DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. I’m Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been having a lot of pressure in my bladder lately, and it’s… well, it’s quite bothersome. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I think.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. And “pressure”… can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels like I constantly need to use the restroom, even when I just have. It's not painful, exactly, but… uncomfortable. Like there’s a fullness that doesn’t quite go away. And sometimes, when I laugh or cough, I feel a little leakage. It's not a lot, but enough to be concerning, you understand?
DOCTOR: Constant urge, feeling of incomplete emptying… leakage with cough… yes, I understand. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, smell, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The color seems normal, I believe. I haven't noticed anything unusual there. The smell… perhaps a slightly stronger odor than usual, but I wasn’t certain if that was just me being overly aware of things, to be honest. It's difficult to say for sure.
DOCTOR: "To be honest"...right. And have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No fever, no chills, and my back feels perfectly normal. It’s really just this persistent pressure and the occasional little leak. It’s just… disruptive, you know? And a little embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's go through some basics, just to be thorough. Any history of urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I had a couple when I was younger, in my early twenties. I remember being quite sick with them – burning sensation, frequent urination, the usual. I haven’t had one in… well, at least ten years, I’d say. Perhaps longer. I don’t recall precisely.
DOCTOR: Past UTIs… alright. Any surgeries or medical conditions in your family that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Let me see… my mother had diabetes, and my grandmother on my father’s side had high blood pressure. As for surgeries, I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, but nothing else that I’m aware of. And I don't believe anyone in my family has had any issues specifically with their bladder, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I lead a pretty quiet life, truthfully. I mostly focus on my work and spending time with my husband.
DOCTOR: Right. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any known allergies to medications. I can take most things without issue, as far as I'm aware. I've never had a reaction to anything prescribed to me before.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your abdomen, and then I'll do a quick pelvic exam. It won’t be comfortable, but it’s important to rule out anything obvious. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds acceptable. I understand it needs to be done. Thank you for explaining it to me. I’ll lie down when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie on your back, feet flat on the table. I’m going to palpate your abdomen first, just to check for any tenderness or masses. Let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Alright, I’m ready. Please let me know if you need me to adjust my position at all. I’ll try to stay as still as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay… I’m not feeling any significant tenderness to the touch, which is good. No obvious masses either. But your bladder does feel quite full, even though you said you recently used the restroom. I’m listening to your abdomen now. Everything sounds normal, no unusual noises. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick pelvic exam. I'll explain each step as I go.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That's good to know about my bladder. I appreciate you explaining everything. Please take your time, and yes, please explain each step. I’m a little nervous, but I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Everything looks normal externally. Now, I'm going to gently insert a speculum to visualize your cervix and vaginal walls. This may feel some pressure, but shouldn’t be painful. Let me know immediately if you feel any sharp discomfort. ...Okay. Your vaginal walls appear healthy. I don’t see any signs of infection or inflammation. Now, I’m going to perform a bimanual exam to check your uterus and ovaries. This involves inserting two fingers into your vagina while I press on your abdomen. Again, let me know if you feel any pain. ...Your uterus feels normal in size and position. Your ovaries are also unremarkable. No tenderness to palpation. Alright. That’s all. Everything appears normal on physical exam, which is… promising, but doesn't rule everything out.
PATIENT: That’s a relief to hear, Doctor, thank you. It was… uncomfortable, but I appreciate you explaining everything beforehand. So, what do you think it could be, if everything seems normal?
DOCTOR: Right. Given your history and the physical exam, it's likely one of a few things. It could be an overactive bladder – the muscles in your bladder contract involuntarily, causing frequent urges. Another possibility is pelvic floor dysfunction – the muscles supporting your bladder, uterus, and rectum aren’t working properly. These are both common, and usually manageable. However, we need to rule out a urinary tract infection, even though the exam didn’t reveal anything obvious. I’m going to order a urine analysis and a urine culture to check for bacteria. We'll also do a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. This will help us determine if you’re emptying your bladder completely.
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining the possibilities. A urine analysis and the other test sound reasonable. Will I need to come back for another appointment to discuss the results? And how long will it take to get them?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to come back. The lab usually takes 2-3 business days to get the results back. I’ll have the receptionist schedule you for a follow-up appointment now. We'll discuss the results and create a plan. If the urine analysis shows an infection, we'll start antibiotics immediately. If it’s pelvic floor dysfunction, we can explore options like pelvic floor exercises or physical therapy. We'll take it one step at a time. In the meantime, try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. Also, make sure you’re drinking plenty of water, but avoid drinking a large amount right before bedtime. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very manageable, Doctor. No caffeine before bed is no problem, and I can definitely drink more water during the day. I’m glad we have a plan. Thank you for taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Alright. The receptionist will call you to schedule your follow-up appointment. If you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, please contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, we'll see you in a few days. Have a good day, Marialena.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Batara. You too. .
