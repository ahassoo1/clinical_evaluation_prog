DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I'm Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good mornin’ to ye too, Doctor. Well, it's this nausea, see. Been gettin’ it most mornings now. Not a proper sick feeling, more like... a queasiness. And I've got this heart trouble, diagnosed a few years back, so I thought I best get it checked out. It just feels… different lately.
DOCTOR: Nausea, you say. And you have a history of heart trouble… right. A few years back. Can you be more specific about the heart trouble?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. It was… dilated cardiomyopathy, I think that’s what they called it. They said my heart muscle was stretched. I was in the hospital for a bit, got put on some water tablets and… somethin’ for the blood pressure. I’ve been keepin’ up with the pills, mind ye. Though, I can never quite remember the names of ‘em, if I’m honest. It’s the water tablets I take every mornin’, and a wee white one. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Dilated cardiomyopathy... yes, I see a note here from St. Jude’s Hospital, 2021. And you're currently taking…water tablets and a white pill, you say. Do you happen to know the dosage of either of those medications?
PATIENT: Och, no, I don’t rightly know the dosages. I just take what the doctor prescribes, ye ken? I fill the prescriptions at the chemist, and they put ‘em in wee boxes. I'm terrible with numbers, always have been. I've got a good memory for faces and stories, but figures... not so much. The water tablets are the bigger ones, I think 40mg, maybe? And the wee white ones… honestly, I couldn’t tell ye. I just take two of each with my breakfast. Is that no enough information? I can bring the boxes next time, if that helps.
DOCTOR: It's… suboptimal, Mr. Benic, to not know the dosages of your medications. However. Let’s focus on the nausea for now. You mentioned it’s primarily in the mornings. Is it related to eating?
PATIENT: Aye, that's a fair point, I suppose. I just trust the folks at the chemist to sort it out. As for the nausea… well, it’s usually before I eat. That's why I noticed it, see? I'd wake up feelin’ a bit queasy, then it'd be worse by the time I got to breakfast. Sometimes it’s bad enough I don’t fancy eatin’ at all. Though, I try to force somethin’ down, 'cause I know I need to keep my strength up. It doesn't seem to matter what I eat, though. Toast, porridge, eggs… makes no difference, really. Just this general sick feelin’.
DOCTOR: So, nausea, primarily pre-prandial, not related to specific food intake. And it’s been ongoing for how long exactly?
PATIENT: Och, now let me think… It started… maybe a month ago? It was just now and then at first, a wee bit of a flutter in the stomach. But it’s been pretty much every mornin’ for the past two weeks, I’d say. It's gettin’ worse, that's for certain. It’s not pain, mind ye, just… uncomfortable. And it leaves me feelin’ a bit weak, to be honest. I've been tryin' to take it easy, but I've got things to do, ye ken? Can’t just sit around all day.
DOCTOR: Mr. Benic, with your history of cardiomyopathy, and now this new onset of nausea, we need to rule out a cardiac cause. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to order some blood work. It's standard procedure, given your situation.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever ye think is best. I trust yer judgement. Heart trouble’s a worryin’ thing, and I’d rather be safe than sorry. Go ahead then, listen away. I'll just sit here and try to relax. Though, I'm never very good at that.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I can hear a slight murmur. It’s not significantly different from previous recordings, but it’s worth noting. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to need to draw some blood for a complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and a thyroid panel. We'll also check your cardiac enzymes to rule out any acute cardiac event. The nurse will be in shortly to take those samples. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Och, right. That all sounds… thorough. Good. Allergies? Hmm… not really. I'm a fairly plain eater, as I said. I used to get a bit of a sniffle when I was wee around cats, but I haven't been near a cat in decades. No reactions to any medicine that I recall, thankfully. I’ve got a sensitive stomach, mind ye, but that’s just a general thing. Nothing specific. Will the blood tests tell us if it's something serious, Doctor? I'm a bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will help us determine the cause of your nausea and assess your overall health. It's unlikely to be anything life-threatening at this point, Mr. Benic, but it's important to investigate. We need to rule out various possibilities, including medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, and thyroid issues. Given your cardiac history, we'll also be monitoring your heart enzymes closely. The nurse will be in shortly. Try to relax. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and we can discuss the next steps. Now, is there anything else you’d like to mention before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: Aye, that makes sense. Thank ye for explainin’ it so clearly, Doctor. No, I think that's all just now. I’ve been a bit more tired lately, mind ye. But I put that down to the weather, to be honest. It’s been a damp summer, and it always gets to me. I just hope it’s not somethin’ too serious. I've got a few things I still want to do, ye ken? Like see my granddaughter graduate. She’s a bright lass. But aye, I'll leave it to ye and the tests. Thank ye again.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. We'll take it from there. We'll see what the tests reveal. Try not to dwell on it, Mr. Benic.
PATIENT: .
