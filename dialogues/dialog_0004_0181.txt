DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. I requested a general wellness lab panel, if you will. Just wanted to get a look at how things are holding up, you understand? At my age, one likes to be… proactive. Nothing specific is troubling me, thankfully. Just a bit of preventative care, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course. Preventative care is excellent, Mr. Mombrun. I commend you for taking that approach. A wellness panel is a good start. Before we proceed with ordering the tests, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Just to have a complete picture. First, have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Let me see… significant illnesses. Hmm. I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia when I was perhaps forty-five, while working on a project in the mountains. Spent a week in the hospital for that. Otherwise, thankfully, nothing too serious. A few broken bones here and there, working construction, you know how it is, but nothing that required a lengthy stay. I had my appendix removed when I was a young man, perhaps twenty years old. Does that count as significant? Otherwise, I’ve been remarkably fortunate, I believe.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia at forty-five, requiring hospitalization, noted. Appendectomy at twenty, also noted. It sounds as though you have been fortunate. Now, regarding family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. A rather complicated topic, Doctor. My mother, she lived a long life, well into her nineties, but she suffered from what the doctors called… hypertension, I believe. High blood pressure. She managed it with medication for many years. My father, he was a strong man, but he had some issues with his heart later in life. Passed away from a heart attack when he was seventy-two, I recall. And my older brother, he developed diabetes, type two, perhaps ten years ago. He's managing it with diet and exercise, as far as I know. Does that provide you with sufficient information? I could delve deeper if you require, but my memory isn't what it once was regarding specifics.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Mombrun, thank you. Hypertension in your mother, heart issues in your father, and type two diabetes in your brother – that gives me a good starting point. Now, just a few questions regarding your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have never smoked a cigarette in my life. Never had the inclination. My wife, Elena, she tried it once when she was very young, but didn’t care for it at all. She always said it smelled terrible and didn't understand why anyone would want to do that to their lungs. We both prioritize good health, you see. We eat a balanced diet – lots of fruits and vegetables – and try to stay active. Although, at my age, “active” means a slightly less strenuous pace than it used to!
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Mombrun. Very commendable. A healthy lifestyle makes a significant difference. And it's good to hear you and your wife share those values. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally, Doctor. Very occasionally. A glass of red wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week. Mostly on the weekends. It's more of a social thing, really, when we have friends over. Nothing excessive, I assure you. My Elena and I, we believe in moderation in all things. It helps keep things… pleasant.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Moderate alcohol consumption, noted. Now, one final set of questions before we proceed with the exam. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just one, Doctor. A low-dose aspirin, every morning. My physician, Doctor Alvarez, prescribed it for me about five years ago, as a preventative measure for my heart. Otherwise, no. I prefer to rely on a good diet and exercise to keep me going. I take a multivitamin from time to time, but that's about it. I generally avoid unnecessary medications if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun. That’s a comprehensive overview. Now, let's move on to a brief physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose and throat. Is that agreeable with you?
PATIENT: Perfectly agreeable, Doctor. Absolutely. I have no objections whatsoever. Please proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgment entirely. Just let me know if there is anything I need to do to make things easier for you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Please extend your arm, and relax. Okay, blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but we'll keep an eye on that. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but there's some mild diminished breath sounds at the bases. It could be normal variation for someone your age, but we’ll monitor it.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. Diminished breath sounds at the bases… is that a cause for concern, or merely something to observe? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I like to understand what is happening with my body, you see. Elena always says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to ask questions, Mr. Mombrun. I encourage it. The diminished breath sounds are mild, and could be due to several factors – age-related changes, mild hyperinflation, even just positioning. It's not immediately alarming, but it’s something I’ll want to monitor over time. That's why I like to establish a baseline with a thorough examination. Now, let's check your reflexes and briefly assess your neurological function. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Follow your finger… like this? Yes, perfectly clear. I have no difficulty tracking your movements. My eyes are still quite sharp, thankfully. Elena says I can spot a bargain from a mile away.
DOCTOR: Good. And can you squeeze my hands firmly?
PATIENT: Of course. There you are. Is that sufficient pressure? I try to maintain a firm grip, you know, keep the muscles active. It's important, at my age.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Mombrun. Excellent grip strength. Okay, last quick check. Can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There you are. Is that adequate? I try to maintain a good posture, you see, even though it's not always easy.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That all looks very good, Mr. Mombrun. You’re in remarkably good shape for your age. Now, based on what you've told me and the brief exam, I recommend we proceed with the wellness panel you requested. It will give us a good baseline of your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. Would you like me to explain what each test entails?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. A wellness panel is precisely what I had in mind. Yes, please, do explain what each test involves. I believe in being informed, you see. Knowing what to expect always eases my mind. Elena would agree with that sentiment, I’m sure. Perhaps just a brief explanation of each, and what we might be looking for, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The panel includes a Complete Blood Count, or CBC, which gives us information about the different types of cells in your blood – red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can help detect anemia, infection, or bleeding disorders. Then we have a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, or CMP. This measures your blood sugar, kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and calcium levels. It helps assess your overall metabolic health and identify potential problems with your organs. We'll also check your lipid panel, which measures your cholesterol levels – total cholesterol, HDL “good” cholesterol, LDL “bad” cholesterol, and triglycerides. This helps assess your risk of heart disease. Finally, we will assess your thyroid stimulating hormone levels to see if your thyroid gland is functioning properly. Do you have any questions about any of those tests?
PATIENT: That is a very clear explanation, Doctor. Thank you. The CBC, CMP, lipid panel, and TSH… I believe I understand the purpose of each. The lipid panel is perhaps the one I am most interested in, given my family history with heart disease. My father, as I mentioned, suffered from issues in that area. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Fasting, perhaps? Or any specific medications I should avoid? I want to ensure the results are as accurate as possible.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. Yes, for the most accurate results, you will need to fast for 10-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drink other than water. You can continue to take your aspirin as usual. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood samples. She will give you specific instructions regarding the fasting period. It’s usually best to schedule the appointment for first thing in the morning. Once we have the results, we'll review them together and discuss any necessary follow-up. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Fast for ten to twelve hours, continue the aspirin… I can certainly manage that. First thing in the morning is ideal. I appreciate the nurse providing specific instructions as well. It is good to have all the details clearly laid out. I believe I am ready to proceed, then. Let me know when the nurse is available.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will have Nurse Ramirez come in momentarily. She'll take your vitals again and then draw the blood samples. She's very efficient and will make sure you’re comfortable. Nurse Ramirez, could you please come in and assist Mr. Mombrun with a blood draw?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for your assistance. I shall await the arrival of Nurse Ramirez.
