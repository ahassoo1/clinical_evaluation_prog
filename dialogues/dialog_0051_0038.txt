DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Evann. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Honestly, it's a little difficult to explain... I believe I was advised to come in regarding… plans for the future, should something unexpected occur. I think it has something to do with a form? An Advance Directive, perhaps? Or a POLST… I’m terribly sorry, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, don't apologize at all. It's perfectly alright. Many people find those forms and terms a bit confusing. It sounds like someone suggested you come in to discuss Advance Care Planning – that’s right, things like Advance Directives and POLST forms. These documents help ensure your wishes are known if you were unable to speak for yourself. Let's take our time and go through this. To help me understand your situation a little better, have you ever thought about what kind of medical care you would or wouldn't want in a serious illness?
PATIENT: I… vaguely recall some conversations with my former spouse. Something about… not wanting to be kept alive by machines, perhaps? But the details are quite blurry, I'm afraid. It was… a long time ago, and there was a great deal happening then. I don’t believe I’ve given it much specific thought since. Is there a… questionnaire, perhaps? Something to help me organize my thoughts?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. It’s very common for these thoughts to be a little hazy, or even unformed. A questionnaire is a wonderful idea! It will help us structure the conversation and clarify your wishes. Here's a relatively short one to start with. It covers a lot of the key questions. Don’t feel pressured to answer everything immediately. We can go through it together, and you can take as long as you need. Before we begin, though, just to get a basic understanding, do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable. Thank you, Doctor. Current medical conditions… let me see. I… I was diagnosed with mild hypertension a few years ago, and I take medication for that. Otherwise… I believe I’m generally quite healthy. Though, I have always been rather slender. Sometimes I worry about that, but my doctor always assures me it’s just my build. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Mild hypertension, okay. And you're on medication for that – good. It’s always best to be proactive about managing blood pressure. And your weight… yes, being slender can sometimes raise concerns, but if your doctor has assured you it's just your build, that's good information to have. We'll take a look at your records to confirm. Do you happen to know your most recent blood pressure reading?
PATIENT: My most recent… blood pressure reading? I… I honestly cannot recall. I see my primary care physician regularly, but I don’t usually make a note of specific numbers. It’s always been… within a reasonable range, I believe. Perhaps you have it on file from a previous visit? I truly am not very good with these details, Doctor. It’s rather embarrassing, I know.
DOCTOR: No, don't worry about it at all, Evann. It’s perfectly common to not remember specific numbers. That's what we’re here for. Okay, here we are. Your last blood pressure reading, taken three months ago, was 128/82. That’s mildly elevated, but within an acceptable range given your medication. We may want to discuss adjusting your dosage if it remains consistently high. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Before we dive into the Advance Directive questionnaire, could you tell me a bit about your medications?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That sounds… reassuringly normal, doesn't it? Let me see… It’s a small, white pill. I take it every morning. The name… it begins with an ‘A’, I believe. Amlodipine, perhaps? Or something similar. I’ve been taking it for… oh, at least five years now, if not longer. I get it refilled automatically through the pharmacy, so I rarely have to think about it. Is that sufficient information? I do apologize for my lack of precision.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes. That's a very common medication for hypertension. And you’re taking it as prescribed – excellent. Don’t worry about the precision, Evann; we have your records to confirm everything. It’s good that you’re proactively managing your health, and it's perfectly alright to not memorize every detail. Now, let’s move onto the questionnaire. It covers a few important areas, such as your values, preferences for life-sustaining treatment, and who you’d want to make medical decisions for you if you were unable to. Are you ready to begin, or would you like a moment to collect your thoughts?
PATIENT: I believe I am ready, Doctor. It… appears quite comprehensive. I do hope I can articulate my thoughts clearly. I confess, thinking about these scenarios is rather unsettling, but I understand it’s important. Let us proceed. I will do my best.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Evann. Take your time. There are no right or wrong answers. It’s about expressing your wishes and values. I’m here to help you through it, and we can pause at any time if you need to. The first question is simply: “What are the most important things in your life?
PATIENT: The most important things… That’s a rather broad question. Hmm… I suppose… connection is very important to me. Meaningful relationships with others. And… creating. I work as an etcher, you see. Bringing beauty into the world through art. And… a quiet life, perhaps. A sense of peace and tranquility. Is that… sufficient? It feels rather inadequate, somehow.
DOCTOR: That’s a beautiful and very insightful answer, Evann. Connection, creation, and peace—those are wonderful values to focus on. It’s not about being “adequate,” it’s about being authentic. We can certainly elaborate on these later if you wish. The next question is: “Are there any medical treatments you would definitely want or definitely not want, even if your life were at risk?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. I believe… I would want to be kept comfortable, certainly. Pain management would be paramount. But… I do not wish to be kept alive artificially, if there is no hope of recovery. No machines breathing for me, if my brain is no longer functioning. I… I do not want to be a burden. Is that clear? I struggle with these concepts, I'm afraid. I’ve never really considered the specifics.
DOCTOR: That's very clear, Evann, and a very thoughtful response. You prioritize comfort, and you don’t wish to be sustained by artificial means if there’s no chance of recovery. That's perfectly valid and important to express. It’s not about struggling, it’s about having these conversations now, so your wishes are known. The next question is a bit more specific: "Would you want full life support, limited life support , or only comfort care?
PATIENT: Only comfort care, Doctor. Definitely only comfort care. I… I do not want tubes, or machines. I want to be able to pass peacefully, surrounded by… by those I care for. I do not want to be kept alive at all costs. It would not be living, in my opinion. It would be… prolonging the inevitable. I hope that’s… understandable. This is quite upsetting, I must admit.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly understandable, Evann. You've expressed a very clear wish for comfort care only, and a desire to pass peacefully with loved ones nearby. That’s a very important decision, and it's good that you're able to articulate it. The next question is about who you would want to make medical decisions for you if you were unable to do so yourself. Do you have a specific person in mind—a healthcare proxy, or someone you trust implicitly to represent your wishes?
PATIENT: That is… difficult. My former spouse… we are not close anymore. We parted ways… amicably, but there is very little contact. I have no children. I have a few… distant cousins, but I do not see them often. There is a colleague, Anya Petrova. She is a fellow etcher, and a very close friend. She is… practical and intelligent, and I trust her implicitly. Would she be suitable? I haven’t formally discussed this with her, I must admit. Is there a specific process for notifying her?
DOCTOR: Anya Petrova sounds like a very suitable choice, Evann. It's important to choose someone you trust to represent your wishes, and it sounds like she fits that description perfectly. There is a specific process, yes. We'll need to complete a form designating her as your healthcare proxy, and she’ll need to sign it, acknowledging her responsibility. We can provide you with the form and instructions. It's also a good idea to discuss your wishes with her directly, so she understands your preferences. Now, we are almost finished with the questionnaire. The final question is: “Are there any other wishes you’d like to express regarding your end-of-life care?
PATIENT: Hmm… I would like… to be buried with a simple stone. Nothing elaborate. And I would like my artwork… my finished pieces… to be donated to the local art school. I would like them to inspire others. And… if possible, I would like my final moments to be… peaceful. Surrounded by sunlight, perhaps. And… the scent of jasmine. It reminds me of my grandmother’s garden. Is that… too much to ask? I feel rather foolish, expressing such… personal desires.
DOCTOR: Those are beautiful wishes, Evann. Not foolish at all—entirely personal and meaningful. We will document everything carefully. These details are important—they reflect what matters most to you, and we will do our best to honor them. So, we’ve completed the questionnaire. That was excellent, Evann. You’ve clearly articulated your wishes, and you’ve thought about this very carefully. We’ll prepare the Advance Directive form for you to sign, and we can discuss the POLST form at another time if you wish. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have answered all of my questions. I am… immensely grateful for your patience and understanding. This was… a difficult conversation, but I feel much better now, knowing that my wishes will be respected. Thank you, truly. And… perhaps we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the POLST form, as you suggested? At a later date, of course.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. It was my pleasure to help you through this. It is a difficult conversation for many people, and you handled it with grace and thoughtfulness. Yes, let's schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the POLST form. We can do that at your convenience. My assistant will reach out to you to arrange a time. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. It was nice meeting you, Evann. Have a peaceful day.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. Goodbye.
