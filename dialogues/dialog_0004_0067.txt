DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Hmm... well, it's this pain. When I take a deep breath, it kinda… hurts. Not all the time, just when I really try to fill my lungs, you know? It’s hard to explain. It’s been going on… a while now, I guess. I don’t really keep track of things these days.
DOCTOR: A while now… right. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… oh, dear. Let me see… Maybe a couple of months? Or longer? It’s…it's not a sharp pain. More like a dull ache. It feels… in my chest, I think. But sometimes it feels like my back too. Everything just kinda aches when I get old, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And does anything make it better or worse besides taking a deep breath?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think… I don't think so, really. Maybe laying down helps a little? But I mostly just try not to think about it. It doesn't stop me from doing things, not yet anyway. I still do a little work, you know, construction. Though not as much as I used to.
DOCTOR: Construction?
PATIENT: Yeah. Managed crews, mostly. Not… not doing the heavy lifting anymore, of course. Too old for that. But I used to be pretty good at it. It kept me busy. Still do some paperwork for friends, help 'em out. It's something to do. But… what does that have to do with my pain, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's relevant to how much strain you're putting on your body. Now, let's go through some basics. Do you have any shortness of breath at rest?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. No. I can walk around, do things. Like I said, I do some work. It's not like I'm puffing and panting all the time. Maybe when I climb stairs, a little, but everyone gets winded doing that, right? I just take it slow. I don't rush.
DOCTOR: And have you had any cough?
PATIENT: Cough? Not much. A little now and then, but just a tickle in my throat. Old age, I figure. Nothing that keeps me up at night or anything. I don't smoke, never did. That's why I don't get those bad coughs. Is this going to take long, Doctor? I have a little appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We need to rule some things out, Mr. Ruocco. Do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… now you're asking things… I don't think so. When I was a kid, I got sick a couple of times, like everyone does. But I don't remember anything special. Maybe a bad cold once or twice? I didn’t really go to the doctor much. We didn’t have much money for that, you know? It’s been a long time, Doctor. I can’t really recall all those details. I just remember being a kid… and working hard.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any family history of lung problems, heart disease, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Oh, family… Hmm. My mother, she coughed a lot when she got older. But I don't know what she had, just that she coughed. And my father… he worked hard, like I said. He just… got old. I don’t recall anyone having heart trouble or… blood clots. We didn't talk about things like that much. It wasn’t… polite, I guess. Is this important, Doctor? I’m starting to get a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: It's pertinent information, Mr. Ruocco. Now, let’s get a basic physical exam. I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart. Please take a deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. I’m trying, Doctor. It hurts a little when I breathe deep, like you asked. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds bilaterally, and a slight crackling in the lower lobes. Your heart sounds are somewhat distant as well. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Oh… now that you mention it, maybe a little. It comes and goes. I thought it was just from being on my feet too long. I didn’t think it was anything serious. It’s worse at the end of the day, I think. What does all that mean, Doctor? Are you finding something bad? I just want to get back to my life.
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, based on what you've told me, and what I'm hearing, it's possible you have some fluid buildup in your lungs, and potentially some underlying heart condition. It is too early to say definitively, but it warrants further investigation. I'm going to order a chest x-ray and an EKG to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll also need to get some blood work done. Given your age and the potential for a serious issue, I recommend a referral to a cardiologist for a full evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Cardiologist… X-rays… blood work…? Oh, dear. That sounds… serious. I don't have insurance, Doctor. I can't afford all that. I just came in for a little pain when I breathe. Is it really that bad? I just want to be able to keep working, keep living… I don’t want to end up in a hospital. .
