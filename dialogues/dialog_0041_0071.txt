DOCTOR: Hi Karry, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Karry Skarbek. I received a letter suggesting I come speak with someone about vaccinations… for some paperwork I need. It has to do with… well, my daughter is trying to get me to come live with her, and I think this is about what shots I need for that. It’s all a bit confusing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. Paperwork for moving in with your daughter, and needing to get up-to-date on vaccinations. No problem at all, we can definitely sort that out. It can be confusing. First, let's just get a general idea of your health history. Do you have a primary care physician currently?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Doctor Evelyn Hayes. She’s… well, she’s been my doctor for a good twenty years now, back in Oklahoma. I still see her when I visit, but… I’ve been living with my daughter for a few months now, and she suggested I find someone closer by for things like this. It’s easier, she says. Do you need her number or something?
DOCTOR: That’s great you have a long-term doctor. No, we don’t need her number right away, but if you’re comfortable, it's helpful to have that information for a complete record. We can get it later if you like. For now, let’s talk about you. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And… oh, a bad bout of pneumonia when I was maybe fifty? I was in the hospital for a week with that. Other than that… just the usual colds and flu. Nothing that needed surgery again. I try to stay healthy, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and pneumonia. Good to know. And it’s always good to hear you prioritize staying healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I’ve eaten just about everything over the years, and never had a reaction. Doctor Hayes checked a few times, when I started having some trouble with my joints, but she didn’t find anything. I can eat peanuts, shellfish… anything. I do get a little itchy sometimes after being bitten by mosquitoes, but I don’t think that’s a proper allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, mosquito bites don’t count as an allergy! That’s very common. So, no known medication or food allergies, that’s good. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis. It’s called… let me see… Meloxicam. Doctor Hayes prescribed it. It helps with the pain in my hands and knees. And sometimes I take Tylenol if it’s really bad, but that’s it. I try not to take too much, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Meloxicam for arthritis and occasional Tylenol. Noted. And good on you for being mindful of your medication use. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: That’s a bit… complicated. My mother’s side… they didn’t talk much about things like that. My father’s side… well, he was adopted, so we never knew much about his family at all. I know my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… something with her heart, when she was older. But I don’t know the details. It was a long time ago, and people didn’t talk about these things as much back then. I wish I knew more, honestly. It would be helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable. Family history can be tricky, especially when information is limited. It’s okay that you don’t have all the details. We can still proceed. Now, just a couple more questions before we move on. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even a puff. My mother smoked, and it wasn’t a pleasant thing to be around, so I always stayed away from it. I always thought it was a bad habit, and I’ve always been careful to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little, now and then. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing more. I don’t really care for it much, to be honest. I mostly drink water. It’s better for you, you know.
DOCTOR: That sounds very reasonable. Okay, that gives me a good overview of your health background. Now, let’s talk about why you’re here today – getting up-to-date on vaccinations. Do you happen to know what vaccinations your daughter suggested you get?
PATIENT: She gave me a list, yes. It was… quite long. Tetanus, I think was on there. And… something with shingles? And another one for… pneumonia, I think, but a different kind than I had before. She said it was important for travel, and for living with other people, just in case. She’s very thorough, my daughter. She worries a lot. I brought the list with me, if you’d like to see it.
DOCTOR: Yes, please, let’s take a look at that list. That will help me understand what we need to discuss. Ah, yes. Tdap, Shingrix, and Pneumococcal vaccine… good. It looks like she’s thinking ahead. We can definitely go through these and make sure you’re protected. First, let's talk a little bit about each one... Do you have any questions about any of these vaccines right off the bat?
PATIENT: Well… I’m a little worried about side effects. I’ve heard stories, you know. People getting sick after getting shots. I’m not a young man anymore, and I don’t want to be laid up in bed for a week. My daughter says it’s all very safe now, but… it’s still a worry. What are the chances of getting really sick from these, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Karry, and it’s good you’re asking. It’s true that vaccines can cause side effects, but serious side effects are very rare. Most people experience only mild reactions, like soreness at the injection site, a low-grade fever, or feeling tired for a day or two. It's far less likely to get seriously ill from the vaccine than to get seriously ill from the diseases they prevent. Let’s talk about each vaccine specifically. First, the Tdap vaccine protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis . You likely had this as a child, but immunity wears off over time, and a booster is recommended every ten years. Do you have any questions about that one before we move on to the others?
PATIENT: Ten years, you say? Hmm… I haven’t had a shot in… goodness, I don’t even remember. I suppose I shouldn’t worry too much about it then, if it’s been a while. Is it a painful shot, Doctor? I remember getting shots as a boy, and they weren’t very pleasant.
DOCTOR: It’s not a particularly pleasant shot, no, but it’s also not as bad as you might remember from childhood. The needles are much smaller and more refined these days. There will be some soreness at the injection site, for sure, but that usually goes away within a day or two. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers like Tylenol or ibuprofen if you need to. Next, we have the Shingrix vaccine. This one protects against shingles, a painful rash caused by the reactivation of the chickenpox virus. It's especially important as we get older, as the risk of shingles increases with age. Have you ever had chickenpox?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I had chickenpox as a boy. All the children did, back then. It was… not a good time. Itchy, and uncomfortable. So this shot prevents that from coming back, but as an older man? My daughter says the risk goes up. Is it a common thing, shingles? I've never known anyone who's had it.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is becoming more common as people age. After you've had chickenpox, the virus stays dormant in your body. As we get older, or if our immune system weakens, the virus can reactivate and cause shingles. It's a very painful rash, and it can sometimes lead to long-term complications. The Shingrix vaccine is very effective at preventing shingles and reducing the severity of the rash if you do get it. It's given in two doses, spaced a few months apart. Would you like to hear about the Pneumococcal vaccine now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Two doses… that sounds like a lot of shots. But if it keeps me healthy, I suppose I can manage. Pneumococcal… what does that one protect against? I haven’t heard of that one at all. Is it something I should be worried about, even if I stay inside mostly?
DOCTOR: The Pneumococcal vaccine protects against pneumococcal disease, which is caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. It can cause infections like pneumonia, meningitis, and ear infections. It's especially important for older adults and people with certain health conditions. Even if you stay inside mostly, you can still be at risk, as the bacteria can spread through respiratory droplets, like coughs and sneezes. There are different types of pneumococcal vaccines, and your daughter was probably referring to the Pneumococcal 20, which protects against the most common strains. It’s a little more involved than the other two, and we'd need to discuss whether it's the right choice for you based on your overall health. Now, before we decide on anything, do you have any other questions about these vaccines, or any concerns that I haven't addressed?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a lot to take in. It sounds like all three are important, but also… a bit worrying. I suppose my daughter wouldn’t have suggested them if she didn’t think they were necessary. But… would it be alright if I took some time to think about it? Maybe talk it over with her again? I don’t want to make a hasty decision, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Karry. That’s a very sensible approach. It’s important to feel comfortable with any medical decision you make. Take all the time you need to think it over and discuss it with your daughter. There’s no rush at all. I can print out some information about each vaccine for you to take home, if you’d like. That might help you weigh the risks and benefits. And if you have any questions later on, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We're here to help. Would you like me to print those handouts for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with all my questions. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little better, knowing I don’t have to make a decision right away.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Karry. That’s what I’m here for. And honestly, it's good you’re asking questions. It shows you’re proactive about your health, and that's excellent. Here you go. One for each vaccine. They contain more detailed information about the benefits, risks, and side effects. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll take these home and talk them over with my daughter. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Karry. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. Have a good day, and I hope you and your daughter have a good discussion. .
