DOCTOR: Hello, Alayne. I'm Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, it's a bit hard to explain, you see. My memory isn't what it used to be. Something about…weakness? My daughter, bless her heart, she was worried about it. And my family…we get terrible headaches, some of us. That’s what she said, anyway. I just…feel a little lost, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Weakness…right. And headaches in the family. Okay. Let’s try to narrow this down. When did you first notice this weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Not recently, I don’t think. It comes and goes, you know? Like…a little flutter, sometimes on one side. It’s hard to say when it started. Maybe a few months ago? Or longer? It’s not constant, thankfully. I can usually still do everything, but…it’s just there, sometimes. It’s more something I feel than something anyone notices, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A "flutter" on one side…hmm. And is this flutter accompanied by anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think…sometimes a little dizziness, maybe? Not spinning, just…off balance. And, like I said, the headaches. Not always with the weakness, but they do run in the family, awful strong headaches. My brother used to miss work all the time because of them. They don’t feel exactly the same, though. Mine are more…a dull ache, usually. Not like the throbbing he’d get. Does that help? I'm trying my best to remember, dear.
DOCTOR: Right, dizziness and family history of headaches. And you say the headaches are a dull ache. Okay. Now, are you taking anything for these headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes. Just…over-the-counter things, you know? Aspirin, or ibuprofen. Whatever’s on sale at the pharmacy, really. They don’t always help much, to be honest. My daughter keeps telling me I should see someone, but…I always put it off. I hate going to doctors. It’s never good news, is it?
DOCTOR: And do those medications cause any stomach upset, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes a little heartburn, I think? Nothing too terrible, just a bit uncomfortable. And…now that you mention it, sometimes I feel a little tired afterwards. But I'm 83, dear, so who isn't tired? It's hard to say if it's the medicine or just…old age.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. I’m going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam. Can you stand up and walk for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that sounds alright. Though I am a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, you know. Just be careful, alright? My daughter says I wobble. It's nothing serious, usually, but…better safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright, take your time. Just walk slowly across the room and back. I'm watching your gait…and yes, I do notice a slightly unsteady gait, and a bit of a shuffling movement. “Patient exhibits slightly unsteady gait with mild shuffling. Observe for balance issues.”
PATIENT: Oh dear… It is harder than it used to be, isn't it? I always feel a bit silly walking in front of people. See? That’s what I mean. Just a little wobble. Nothing to worry about, I’m sure. I just need to concentrate, that's all.
DOCTOR: "Patient reports needing to concentrate to maintain balance. Mild instability noted. No obvious weakness observed during ambulation, but gait is compromised." Okay, let's just check your strength in your arms and legs. Can you squeeze my hands tightly?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Is that alright? I don’t have the strength I used to, you know. I used to be quite strong, working in the insurance office, all those files…but that was a long time ago. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: “Bilateral strength 4/5, slightly diminished but equal bilaterally. No significant asymmetry noted." Now, let’s just check your reflexes. Just relax your arm…and relax your leg… “Reflexes 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. No clonus noted.” It's all pretty normal, actually. A little slow, but normal for your age.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear, dear. I was worried something serious was wrong. It’s just…the weakness comes and goes, and my daughter, bless her heart, she gets so anxious. It's the headaches, I think. They make her worry. Is it my headaches, then? Is that what’s causing the weakness?
DOCTOR: Well, it's unlikely the headaches are directly causing the weakness. It’s more likely…age-related changes. And perhaps a bit of dehydration. You're 83, after all. A lot of things slow down. We could order some bloodwork just to rule out anything else, but honestly, I don’t think it's anything serious. Are you drinking enough water?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dehydration… I suppose I don't drink as much as I should. I prefer a cup of tea, you know? It’s more comforting. But I do try to eat my fruits and vegetables… My daughter makes sure of that. So, you don't think it's something awful? Something like…a stroke? My uncle had a stroke, you see…a very bad one.
DOCTOR: No, based on the exam, I don’t think it’s a stroke. You’re not exhibiting any of the classic signs. But we can order a CT scan just to put your daughter's mind at ease, if you’d like. Otherwise, I recommend increasing your water intake, and perhaps some gentle exercise, if you’re able. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels with the bloodwork. And I'll prescribe a mild supplement, just in case.
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, dear. If a scan would help my daughter sleep at night, then yes, please. She worries so much. And gentle exercise… I used to enjoy walking, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. Maybe I'll stick to tea for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. Is there anything else I need to do? Or any warnings I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m ordering the CT scan and bloodwork. The lab results should be back in a few days. If you experience any sudden weakness, difficulty speaking, vision changes, or severe headache, go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, I understand. Sudden weakness, trouble talking, blurry vision… and a bad headache. I’ll remember that. My daughter will remind me anyway, she’s very thorough. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And please, don't worry about my age. It's just a number, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, the nurse will be in to draw your blood. And she'll schedule the CT scan for you. Just try to stay hydrated and get some rest. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Thank you. I will. And thank you to the nurse, too. Have a good day to you, Doctor.
