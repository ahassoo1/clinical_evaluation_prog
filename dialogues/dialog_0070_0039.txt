DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Lindsey. Well, it's about these cholesterol numbers, I reckon. My daughter, bless her heart, she's the one who made the appointment. Said they were a bit high when I had my check-up at the senior center. I don’t really understand all that medical stuff myself, but she was worried.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lindsey. It’s good to meet you as well. And it’s very thoughtful of your daughter to be proactive about your health. High cholesterol is something we definitely want to address. I see here your recent cholesterol levels were checked on July 15th. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about your health history to get a better understanding of the situation?
PATIENT: Oh, not at all, Doctor. Ask away. I've lived a long life, so there's probably a fair bit of history there! I try to remember everything, so hopefully I can be of some help. Though, sometimes the years do get a little… jumbled. But I'll do my best.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lindsey. We'll take our time. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… high blood pressure, no, never been told that. Diabetes… not that I recall. My mother had a touch of something with her sugar when she got older, but I never did. Heart disease… well, my father, he had a weak heart towards the end. But I’ve never been officially told I had anything wrong with mine. I had a good, strong heart, always been active. Used to work on the farm, you know. Lots of lifting and hauling. Though, that was a long time ago…
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Lindsey. It’s helpful to have that family background. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, that was probably… oh, seventy years ago now! And… there was that time I broke my arm falling off the barn roof when I was maybe fifteen. Had to have it set, of course. But other than that… no, nothing major. A few stitches here and there over the years, bumps and bruises from working, but nothing requiring a proper hospital stay. I've been lucky, I think. Mostly just kept busy and tried to stay out of trouble.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Lindsey. It sounds like you’ve lived a very active and healthy life! Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, that’s an easy one. I don’t take anything regularly. Not a single pill. I always thought all those medicines were more trouble than they were worth, honestly. My daughter keeps offering me vitamins, but I just don’t bother. I eat a good breakfast – oatmeal most days – and try to get a bit of sunshine when I can. That’s my medicine, I reckon.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Lindsey. It’s good to hear you focus on a healthy lifestyle. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat just about anything put in front of me, and I’ve handled all sorts of plants and animals over the years working on the farm. Bees, poison ivy, you name it. Never had a problem. I always figured I had a pretty strong constitution.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear, Lindsey. Now, let’s talk a little about your social history. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked a pipe, but I always thought it smelled awful and looked like a waste of good money. My wife, bless her soul, she didn’t care for it either. We always had fresh air on the farm, no need for anything else.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol, Lindsey?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn’t say I never had a drink. A little beer with dinner on a Sunday now and then, maybe a glass of wine at Christmas. But nothing regular, and certainly not a lot. I wasn’t much of a drinker, never really got the appeal, to be honest. Prefer a good glass of iced tea any day.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, before we move on, do you have any major life stressors currently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my wife passed away five years ago. That was a big one, of course. Still miss her every day. But other than that… no, not really. My daughter and grandkids are good, they visit often. I live alone on the farm, which is quiet, but I like the peace and quiet. I keep myself busy with gardening and fixing things around the place. I suppose getting older is a stressor in itself, but I try not to dwell on it.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Lindsey. It sounds like you have a good support system with your daughter and grandchildren, and that’s wonderful. And it’s admirable that you keep yourself busy and active. Now, let’s talk about your current symptoms. Are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, or any other symptoms that concern you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a bit. That’s the funny thing. I feel… fine. Perfectly fine! That’s why I was so surprised when my daughter said my cholesterol was high. I haven’t been feeling any different. No chest pain, no trouble breathing, plenty of energy for gardening, still walk around the farm every day. Honestly, if she hadn’t made the appointment, I wouldn’t even know there was anything wrong.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Lindsey. It's not uncommon for high cholesterol to have no symptoms, which is why regular check-ups are so important. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a baseline and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Go right ahead, Doctor. Can’t hurt to check, I suppose. I haven’t had a proper physical in… oh, goodness, I don’t even remember. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’d be so kind, please have a seat here. Alright, Lindsey, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take some deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Alright, Lindsey, everything sounds and feels good. Your examination was within normal limits. Now, let's review those cholesterol numbers from your senior center checkup. They showed a total cholesterol of 240, an LDL cholesterol of 160, an HDL cholesterol of 40, and triglycerides of 150. These numbers are a little elevated, especially the LDL cholesterol.
PATIENT: Oh, my. Those numbers… they don’t mean much to me, honestly. My daughter said something about “good” and “bad” cholesterol? Is the 160 the “bad” one? And what does “elevated” mean, exactly? Is it something I need to worry about right away? I’m just trying to understand what all this means for an old farmer like me.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable question, Lindsey. It can be confusing, and you’re right to ask for clarification. Think of cholesterol like different types of fats in your blood. There’s LDL, which is the “bad” cholesterol, and HDL, which is the “good” cholesterol. The LDL cholesterol contributes to plaque buildup in your arteries, which can increase your risk of heart attack and stroke. Your LDL is a bit high at 160 – ideally, we want that below 100. The HDL cholesterol helps remove cholesterol from your arteries, so we want that higher – ideally above 60. Yours is 40, so it's a little low. Your triglycerides are also a bit elevated at 150. “Elevated” means your levels are higher than what we consider optimal for your health. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need to worry right away, but it does mean we should take steps to lower them. Since you are not experiencing any symptoms, we can start with lifestyle modifications. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: Oh, that makes a little more sense, thank you for explaining it like that. So, I need to get the “bad” one down and the “good” one up… and the other one too, apparently. Lifestyle modifications… what does that involve? I’m pretty set in my ways, you know. I’ve been eating oatmeal for breakfast for seventy years! But I’m willing to listen, I suppose. I’d like to avoid taking any pills if I can, so if changing a few things can help, I’m all ears.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Lindsey. Changing a few things is a great first step, and often it’s enough. Since you already have a healthy breakfast routine with the oatmeal, that’s a fantastic start! Lifestyle modifications primarily involve diet and exercise. We want to focus on reducing saturated and trans fats in your diet – things like red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. Increasing fiber intake – fruits, vegetables, whole grains – is also helpful. And regular physical activity – even a brisk walk for 30 minutes most days of the week – can significantly lower LDL cholesterol and raise HDL cholesterol. Since you live on a farm, you likely already get a good amount of activity, but we can discuss ways to incorporate even more. Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, no restrictions, really. I eat just about anything. I do enjoy a good piece of steak now and then, though, I have to admit. And my daughter makes a lovely apple pie… I suppose I could cut back on those a little. Walking… well, I do plenty of that around the farm, checking fences and such. It's not exactly a brisk walk, mind you, more of a… leisurely stroll. But I could probably pick up the pace a bit. So, cut back on steak and pie, walk a little faster… does that sound about right?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable starting point, Lindsey. Reducing your intake of those foods and increasing your walking pace, even slightly, can make a significant difference. We can also discuss some heart-healthy recipes and resources for incorporating more physical activity into your daily routine. I'd like to recheck your cholesterol levels in three months to see how you're doing. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Three months sounds good. Gives me time to get used to things. And recipes… that’d be helpful. My daughter’s a good cook, but she’s always busy with the grandkids. I usually just stick to what I know. So, three months for another check-up, and some recipe ideas… that sounds like a plan, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a lot better now, knowing what I need to do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindsey. I’m glad I could help. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, print out some heart-healthy recipes for you on your way out. She can also schedule your follow-up appointment for three months from today, August 2nd. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man like me and all my questions. I appreciate it. I reckon I'll get started on cutting back on the steak and pie right away!
DOCTOR: You’re very kind, Lindsey. It’s my pleasure. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your farm! .
