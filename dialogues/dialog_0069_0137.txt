DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My… how you say… the place for old people? My son, he want me to go there. He say I need… check first. For be sure I okay. Is for Senior Living, he call it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your son is recommending you look into a Senior Living community, and he wanted you to get a check-up first to make sure everything is alright. That’s very thoughtful of him. So, to start, are you currently having any specific health problems or symptoms that are bothering you?
PATIENT: No, no big problems. Sometimes… my knees, they hurt a little when the weather is cold. And… I forget things, you know? But is old age, I think. Not so bad. I still cook, still clean… mostly. My husband, he help now. He always help.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear that you're still active and managing well overall. Knee pain with the weather and some forgetfulness are common as we get older. Let's talk a little more about the forgetfulness. Would you say it's just occasional misplacing of things, or are you having more trouble with remembering recent events, or perhaps names of people you know?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes names. Not my husband, never him! But… friends, people I see not often. And… what I eat for lunch. Sometimes I look in the fridge and… blank. My son, he say maybe I should write things down. I try, but I forget to look at the paper! It’s silly. Is not… bad, doctor. Just… old.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Ms. Abdollahi. It's very common to experience changes in memory as we age. And it's good that your son is encouraging you to be proactive. To get a better picture, let's do a quick review of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. The doctor give me pills for that. I take them every day. And… my back, I have problem with my back for long time. Old injury, when I was young. But no… no diabetes, no heart problem. I think that’s all. I go to the doctor every year for check up. Regular check up.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you have regular check-ups. And you're taking medication for high blood pressure, that's excellent. Do you remember the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don’t. Little white pill. I take one in the morning. The doctor, he give me the bottle. My son, he fill it for me now. He always help with the pills. I am sorry, I forget the name. Is bad, yes? I should know.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Abdollahi, don't worry about it. Many people have trouble remembering medication names. It's more important that you are taking it regularly, and it sounds like your son is very helpful in making sure that happens. Okay, I see here you're taking Lisinopril 10mg daily for high blood pressure. That matches what you told me. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Yes. Long time ago. When I was… maybe 30? I fall down. Break my arm. They fix it. And… I have problem with my gallbladder. They take it out. Many years ago. That’s all I remember. Is very long time. I was in the hospital for few days. Not so bad, but… I don't like hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a broken arm that was repaired, and gallbladder removal. Thank you. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, cancer, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mama, she have problem with her heart. Old age, the doctor say. She get sick and… she die. My papa, he was strong. No problem. My sister, she have cancer, but she get better. Now she okay. I think that’s all. My family, they live long time. Most of them. But… sick sometimes. Like everyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. History of heart problems in your mother, and your sister's cancer recovery. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What you mean? I cook, I clean, I go to church. I like to read. Mostly… stories. Not the newspaper. Too much bad news. I walk a little, when the weather is good. Not much now, with my knees. And I drink… sometimes wine with dinner. Just one glass. Not every night. Is good for the heart, my husband say. He always say things.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very pleasant lifestyle, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s good that you enjoy reading and staying active, and it’s perfectly fine to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner in moderation. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never. I eat everything. I try everything. Maybe a little… upset stomach sometimes, but not allergy. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I am lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Okay, Ms. Abdollahi, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. That gives me a good overall picture of your health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. You seem like a good doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Abdollahi. I appreciate that. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me… good. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning, given your history. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Your gait is steady, though I notice a slight hesitation on your right side. Overall, your exam is fairly unremarkable. Your vital signs are generally stable, and your heart and lungs sound good. The slight elevation in blood pressure and the hesitation in your gait are things we should keep an eye on. Do you experience any pain when walking?
PATIENT: Sometimes. In my knee. The right knee. When the weather is cold. Is not bad, Doctor. I just walk slow. And… I feel a little… wobbly sometimes. Like I need to hold on to something. Mostly when I stand up fast. That’s all. Not so bad. But… maybe that’s why I walk slow. Is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Abdollahi. It sounds like you’re experiencing some knee pain that's worse with the cold weather and some occasional dizziness when standing up quickly. That dizziness could be related to a slight drop in blood pressure when you change positions, which is fairly common. To be on the safe side, and since you're considering a move to Senior Living, I’d like to order a few simple tests. A complete blood count to rule out any underlying anemia, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a Vitamin D level. Also, an EKG just to get a baseline reading of your heart’s electrical activity. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Tests is good. Make sure everything is okay. My son, he will be happy I do the tests. He worry about me.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s good you have a supportive son who cares about your well-being. Okay, the orders are sent to the lab. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment for the blood draw. It’s usually a quick process. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay active as much as possible, maintaining a healthy diet, and staying hydrated. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. I will do that. Stay active, healthy food, drink water. And call if something is wrong. My son, he will help me remember. He is good son. Is there anything else? For the Senior Living? Do I need to tell them about the tests?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear you have such a supportive son. Regarding the Senior Living, it’s a good idea to let them know you’re undergoing some routine medical testing. You don't need to go into great detail, but simply informing them that you're getting a check-up and some blood work done will be sufficient. It shows them you're proactive about your health, and they may have specific forms for you to fill out regarding medical history and current health status. Here's a document outlining resources for Senior Living communities in the area. It also has a checklist of questions to ask when you visit potential facilities. You might find it helpful. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explain everything very good, Doctor. Thank you for help me. And thank you for being so kind. I think that is all. I will go home now. My husband, he make dinner. I need to help him.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions arise after you leave. And tell your husband I said hello! Have a wonderful evening, and enjoy dinner! We'll be in touch once the lab results are available. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
