DOCTOR: Bula and hello, Jailenne! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Kimm, it's nice to meet you too! Um, well, I've just been getting the chills lately. It's a bit weird, honestly. Not a fever or anything, just...cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills, that's good to know. And just to clarify, when you say “lately,” how long have you been experiencing these chills?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably about three days now? It started kinda mild, and it’s been getting a little worse each day. Not bad bad, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, three days, gradually worsening. And are the chills happening at any specific time of day, or do they seem random?
PATIENT: They seem pretty random, actually. Like, yesterday I felt really cold while I was cooking, and then later, while I was watching TV, I was fine. Today it was first thing this morning. It doesn’t seem to be linked to anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright, random chills over the past three days. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the chills – things like a cough, sore throat, muscle aches, fatigue, or a headache?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I'm a little tired, but honestly, who isn't? I work a lot. But nothing major, no cough, no sore throat, no aches… just the cold shivers. It’s really just the chills that are bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms besides the chills and a little fatigue. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu really badly a couple of years ago, but that was it. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that doesn’t really count, does it? Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat well and get enough sleep when I can.
DOCTOR: No major medical history, just the flu a couple of years ago and a childhood broken arm. Good to know you generally try to stay healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Just the usual check-ups and vaccinations over the years. I’m not a fan of hospitals, if you can tell!
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Um, well, my mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some heart problems when he was older, but other than that, everyone's pretty healthy. Nothing major, really. I don’t think anyone's had anything like… what I'm feeling now.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure and heart problems, but nothing similar to your current symptoms. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things growing up, and I’ve never had a reaction. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. No medications or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and just a multivitamin occasionally. Last question for now - do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I don't smoke, rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a blue moon – and definitely no recreational drugs. I try to take care of myself, remember?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. That’s good to know. Alright, Jailenne, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if anything feels weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, perfect. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds that I can detect. Now, I’m going to check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Okay, your temperature is 98.6°F , your pulse is 72 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg – all within normal limits. I’m also going to quickly check your throat and ears. Open wide and say “ah.” Your throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Ears look good too. I’m going to palpate your lymph nodes now, just feeling for any swelling. No noticeable swelling there either. Everything seems normal so far. Do you have any pain anywhere, like joints or muscles?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. No aches, no pains, not even a headache. That's what's so strange about this, honestly. Everything feels… normal, except for the chills. It's just this weird cold feeling that comes and goes. Like a shiver that lasts too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain anywhere, just the persistent chills. It sounds like we’ve ruled out a lot of the common causes. Given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, it’s possible you’re experiencing a mild viral infection, or perhaps it’s a reaction to stress or a slight imbalance. It’s hard to pinpoint without further investigation. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel just to rule out any underlying issues and get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s happening. A blood test is fine. I just want to feel normal again. Where do we do that? Here?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can do that right here in the clinic. The nurse, Maria, will come in shortly to draw your blood. It’s a quick process, and shouldn't be too uncomfortable. While we wait for the results, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding strenuous activities. If the chills worsen, or if you develop any other symptoms like a fever, cough, or body aches, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. Rest and fluids, got it. And I'll definitely call if anything changes. Thank you, Dr. Kimm. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. I was starting to worry it was something serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. It’s always best to get things checked out when you’re concerned. We'll get those blood tests done and hopefully have some answers for you soon. Maria should be in shortly. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything. I’m just going to relax and wait for Maria, then. Thank you again, Dr. Kimm. I feel a bit better just knowing we’re trying to figure it out.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’ll leave you to rest then and I’ll come back as soon as we have the results. Don't hesitate to buzz if you need anything at all.
