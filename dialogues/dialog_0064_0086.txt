DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, like we talked about. I’m Kahrin, by the way. Let’s just get right to it, if that's okay? I have things I need to do later.
DOCTOR: Of course, Kahrin. Perfectly alright. Yes, Kahrin Kovtun, age 29. We did run some tests a little while back, didn't we?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s me. A little while back… August 12th, I think? Blood work, and… a scan, right? Something with my stomach. Honestly, I don’t remember all the details. I was pretty stressed then, and still am, to be fair. So, what did they find?
DOCTOR: Right, yes. The blood work came back within normal limits, thankfully. The scan... it did show some inflammation in the stomach lining. Not alarming, but enough to warrant further investigation. Do you recall why we decided to do the scan, Kahrin?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Inflammation. See, this is why I write everything down. Why… because of the pain, right? That burning feeling in my stomach? And the… well, the nausea. It wasn’t constant, but it was bad enough that I had to miss work a couple of times. It started, I think, around the beginning of July. Is that what the scan was for? To figure out why I was feeling like that?
DOCTOR: Exactly. The pain and nausea… yes, that’s right. We were looking into the cause of those symptoms. And to be clear, it was primarily a burning sensation, you said?
PATIENT: Yep, burning. Mostly in the upper part of my stomach. And sometimes it would go up into my chest. Like… heartburn, but worse? And it definitely got worse after I ate. Especially if I had anything spicy, or… anything acidic, like tomatoes. Honestly, even just drinking orange juice sometimes set it off. It wasn’t always after eating, but that’s when it was the worst.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Kahrin. And you haven't been taking anything for it, to my knowledge?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I tried some antacids, you know, the over-the-counter stuff? But they didn't really do much. That's why I came to see you in the first place. I didn't want to just keep taking pills that weren't working. Plus, I was hoping to find out what was causing it, instead of just masking the symptoms.
DOCTOR: That was wise of you. Masking symptoms isn’t ideal. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the pain and nausea?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. I mean, I’ve been a little tired lately, but I figured that was just stress. And maybe a little bit of… bloating, sometimes, after I eat? But nothing major. No weight loss, no… you know, anything scary. Just the pain, the nausea, and maybe a little tiredness. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, very helpful. And no blood in your stool, or black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Everything’s… normal, that way. Look, I’m sorry if this isn’t very detailed. I’m just… anxious to know what's going on. I have a trip coming up, and I really don’t want to be sick while I’m travelling. So, can you just tell me what the scan showed? What do I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: Of course, Kahrin. I understand. The scan didn't show anything structurally abnormal – no blockages, no tumors, nothing like that. However, there is some inflammation of the stomach lining, as we discussed. It appears to be a mild case of gastritis. Now, gastritis can be caused by a number of things, including stress, certain medications, and—most commonly—an infection with H. pylori bacteria. Have you ever had a test for H. pylori?
PATIENT: H. pylori? Nope. Never heard of it. Is that… serious? And what’s the next step? Do I need more tests? I really don't have a lot of time, Doctor. Is this something that needs immediate treatment, or…?
DOCTOR: No, it's not an emergency, Kahrin. H. pylori is a common bacteria that can infect the stomach lining. It often causes symptoms like the ones you've been experiencing. We can easily test for it with a simple stool sample or a breath test. And if it's positive, it's treatable with a course of antibiotics and some medication to reduce stomach acid. Would you be comfortable doing a stool sample today?
PATIENT: A stool sample… okay. I guess so. Is it… gross? I’m just… I’m not really a fan of that kind of thing. And how long will it take to get the results? I’m leaving in… two weeks. So I need to know pretty quickly. Look, can we just do whatever test gets results the fastest?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. The breath test is much less… involved. It's non-invasive, doesn’t require a sample, and usually has a faster turnaround time. Let me see… we can schedule you for a breath test tomorrow morning. The results should be available within three to five business days. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yeah, that’s fine. As long as I get the results before I leave, I’m happy. Okay, breath test tomorrow. Is there anything else I need to do? Like, any special diet, or…? I really just want to get this sorted out, so I can enjoy my trip.
DOCTOR: No special diet or preparation needed for the breath test. Just avoid taking any antibiotics or stomach acid-reducing medications for 24 hours beforehand. And please fast for at least six hours before the test – no food or drinks, other than water. We'll give you detailed instructions when you schedule the appointment. I'll also write you a note explaining your symptoms and the pending test results, just in case you need it while you're travelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, perfect. No antibiotics, fast for six hours, and a note. That sounds… good. Really good, actually. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you getting me sorted out so quickly. So, I guess I'm done here? I can go?
DOCTOR: Yes, Kahrin, you're all set for tomorrow morning. The receptionist will schedule your appointment and provide you with the necessary instructions. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. I hope you have a wonderful trip! .
