DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out before they’ll give me a policy. Hope it's quick, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. A pre-insurance physical is perfectly routine. I understand your desire to keep things efficient, and I'll do my best to accommodate that. To begin, let’s go through some standard questions to get a comprehensive picture of your overall health. First, could you describe your current health status?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. Well, I feel alright, mostly. A little tired sometimes, you know? Just getting older, I guess. No big problems, really. I work a lot, managing a hotel, so… busy is the word. Don't get sick often, though.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Putney. "Mostly alright" is a good starting point. And managing a hotel sounds quite demanding – busy is certainly understandable. The occasional tiredness could be related to your work schedule. To clarify, when you say “tired sometimes”, could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Just… at the end of the day, mostly. Like, really dragging. Not sick tired, just… worn out. And sometimes in the mornings it takes a bit to get going. Nothing a strong coffee can't fix, usually. It's been going on for… well, a while now, honestly. Years, maybe? I don't really keep track.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, prolonged fatigue, primarily at the end of the day and some sluggishness in the mornings. Years, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, years. Like I said, don't pay much attention to that sort of thing. It's just… life, you know? Working, trying to keep things afloat. My divorce was… rough a few years back too, but I'm okay now. Mostly. Look, is this going to take long? I got things I need to get back to.
DOCTOR: I certainly understand, Mr. Putney, and appreciate you sharing that with me. Major life changes like a divorce can certainly contribute to feelings of fatigue and overall stress. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. To get a clearer picture, let’s move through a brief review of your general health. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Heart's fine, as far as I know. Doc checked it a few years back when I had a bad flu, everything was good then. No pain, no trouble breathing. Just tired, like I said. Can we skip some of this if it's just about the insurance? They didn't say anything about a full physical, just… a check-up.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask, Mr. Putney. Let me quickly review the insurance form… Ah, yes. It does appear they’ve requested a fairly standard health assessment – height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and a basic review of systems. We can certainly focus on those core elements, and if anything concerning arises, we can always delve deeper. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: A little, yeah. I think I've put on a few pounds. Hard to say exactly, I don't weigh myself regularly. Things have been… stressful, and I probably haven’t been eating as well as I should. Hotel food isn't the best, you know? I'm around 195 now, I think. Last time I checked was… a while ago. Maybe 185? It fluctuates.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Mr. Putney. It’s understandable that stress and a busy work schedule can impact eating habits. Now, let’s get some objective measurements. I’ll need to check your height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse. Would you mind stepping onto the scale first?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Let's just get this over with. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. I got a hotel to run, you know? 198. See? Told you I gained weight.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Putney. And yes, that confirms a recent weight gain. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Whatever. Hurry it up, will ya?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. Your blood pressure is 142/92 and your pulse is 78. That blood pressure is slightly elevated. We should discuss that further. Do you have any history of high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Elevated? Great. Just what I needed. No, never been told I had high blood pressure before. Not that I know of. I usually don't go to the doctor unless I'm really sick. I figure if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Is this going to disqualify me from the insurance? Because that'd be a real problem.
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions, Mr. Putney. A single elevated reading doesn’t necessarily mean you have high blood pressure. It could be due to a number of factors – stress, caffeine intake, even just being at the doctor’s office. We’ll need to take a few more readings over time to get a clearer picture. To be thorough, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history. Okay, well, my mother… she had some heart trouble when she got older, I think. Something with her heart beating too fast. And my father… he had diabetes. Real bad. Other than that, I don't really know. Nobody talked about health stuff much. We were too busy just trying to get by. Look, is this stuff even relevant? I just need the insurance, not a full medical history.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Mr. Putney, and I appreciate you sharing it. Family history is important because certain conditions can run in families, increasing your risk. Knowing about your mother's heart condition and your father's diabetes does give us some additional information to consider. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never been much of a smoker or drinker. Tried a cigarette once, hated it. And drugs? No thank you. I got enough stress in my life without adding that to the mix. Honestly, I'm a pretty boring guy. Just work, sleep, and try to keep the hotel running. That's it. Can we just get this over with? I'm wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Putney. And being “boring” isn’t a bad thing – it sounds like you’re a responsible individual. Finally, let’s briefly review your current medications and any allergies you might have. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Just coffee. Lots and lots of coffee. No allergies either. Not to food, not to anything. I'm a pretty simple guy, remember? Look, is this all? Can I go now? I really need to get back to work. The hotel won't run itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. It appears we’ve completed the necessary assessment for the insurance physical. However, given the slightly elevated blood pressure reading, I would recommend that we schedule a follow-up appointment to recheck it and discuss lifestyle modifications that could help lower it. Even small changes in diet and exercise can make a big difference. I’ll also provide you with a copy of my notes to share with the insurance company. Would you like me to schedule that follow-up appointment now, or would you prefer to do it at a later date?
PATIENT: Look, I appreciate the concern, but honestly, I really don’t have time for a follow-up. I got a hotel to run, people depending on me. Just send the notes to the insurance company and let them deal with it. If they want more information, they can call me. I’m not making another appointment right now. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Putney. I understand your time is valuable, and I respect your decision. I will send my notes to the insurance company immediately. Here is my card. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you experience any concerning symptoms or if the insurance company requires additional information. Thank you for your time, Mr. Putney. I wish you all the best with your hotel. .
