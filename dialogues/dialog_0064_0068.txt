DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… my legs. They’ve been swelling up, you see. It started after… after the treatment. For the cancer. It’s been a few weeks now, and it’s not getting better.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in the legs after cancer treatment… that’s something we definitely need to look into. Can you tell me a bit more about the treatment you had?
PATIENT: Oh… um… it was… chemotherapy. And radiation. Lots of appointments. It was at the big hospital downtown. I don't… I don’t remember exactly what they used, just that it made me very tired. And sick. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's important, Sasha. Both chemotherapy and radiation can sometimes cause swelling – what we call edema. The tiredness and sickness are good to know as well, helps me get a full picture. When did you first notice the swelling, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Maybe… two weeks after I finished? No, more like three weeks, I think. It started in my ankles, and now it’s… higher up, on my calves. It’s worse at the end of the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks after finishing treatment, starting in the ankles and moving up the calves, worse at the end of the day. That’s helpful. Does it feel like it's pitting edema?
PATIENT: Pitting…? What does that mean? I’m sorry, I don’t… I don't understand those big words, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Sasha. It’s perfectly alright. "Pitting" means if I press on the swelling with my finger for a moment, does an indent – a little dip – remain afterwards?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes! Yes, it does. If I push on it, you can see the shape of my finger for a little while. Then it goes away. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, that confirms it's pitting edema. It’s not necessarily bad, but it’s something we need to investigate to find out why it’s happening. Aside from the swelling, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… My legs feel heavy, you know? Like they weigh a ton. And sometimes they ache. Not really pain, just… uncomfortable. Oh, and my skin feels a bit tight. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Sasha. Heavy feeling, aching, tight skin – those all sound consistent with edema. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any shortness of breath, or any changes in your urine output – are you going to the bathroom more or less frequently than usual?
PATIENT: No, no shortness of breath. And… no, my bathroom trips are pretty normal, I think. Maybe a little less than usual, but I just thought that was because… well, I'm drinking less water now that it's not so hot. Is that… is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re thinking about your fluid intake, Sasha. Staying hydrated is important. Less frequent urination could be related to the decreased water intake, or it could be a sign of something else, so we’ll keep that in mind. Now, I'd like to take a look at your legs and get a better feel for the swelling. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Go ahead, Doctor. I just want this to go away. It’s so uncomfortable, and I’m worried it means the cancer is back.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your ankles are noticeably swollen, and there's pitting edema extending up to your calves. Skin temperature is normal, and I don't see any redness or sores. I'm also checking for any pulses in your feet. Pulses are present and feel normal. The swelling appears to be symmetrical, meaning it’s about the same on both legs. This is good information, Sasha. The symmetrical swelling and presence of pulses are reassuring. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve taken a lot of pills lately, but no… no allergic reactions. And I take a vitamin D supplement, but that’s it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just the vitamin D supplement. And have you had any problems with blood clots in the past, or has anyone in your family had them?
PATIENT: No, no blood clots. Not me, and not my family, as far as I know. My mother had… um… heart trouble, but not blood clots. My brother had diabetes, but that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. No history of blood clots, your mother had heart trouble, and your brother had diabetes. That’s helpful to know. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s causing the swelling, I'd like to order a few blood tests. We’ll check your kidney function, liver function, and do a complete blood count. I also want to order a D-dimer test, which helps rule out blood clots. And lastly, an EKG just to make sure your heart is doing okay. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… so many tests. Okay… if you think it’s necessary. Are they… painful? Will they take long? I have a hair appointment on Thursday.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sasha. It does seem like a lot, but it’s the best way to get to the bottom of things. The blood tests just involve a small needle prick – some people feel a little discomfort, but it’s usually quick. The EKG is completely painless – they just attach a few stickers to your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. The whole process shouldn’t take more than an hour. And we'll get the results back within a couple of days, hopefully before your hair appointment. The nurse will draw your blood now and get you set up for the EKG. Then, depending on the results, we might consider further testing, or we can discuss a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. An hour… I can manage an hour. And if it helps… then yes. Let's do it. Please tell me if anything… anything is seriously wrong, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sasha. I promise to keep you informed every step of the way. We’ll discuss everything thoroughly, and I won't make any decisions without your input. Now, let me call the nurse, and she'll come in to get you started. Just relax, and we'll take it one step at a time.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you.
