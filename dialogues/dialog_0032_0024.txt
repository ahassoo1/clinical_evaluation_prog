DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. Confirming I’m able to fly. It’s for… travel insurance, mostly. They need something official saying I don’t have any conditions that would stop me. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A fitness-to-fly certificate, then. Yes, that is… straightforward enough. Though I must say, it is rather unusual to seek this before travel is planned, but we can certainly accommodate. To properly complete this for you, I will need to gather some medical history. It’s quite standard procedure. Let's begin with any current medical conditions you may have. Do you have any ongoing health issues that require regular treatment or monitoring?
PATIENT: No, not really. I lost my husband a few years back, and… well, that was hard, obviously. But physically, I'm pretty healthy. I had Medicare, you know, after… everything. They didn't find anything seriously wrong with me when they checked me out then. Just the usual things, I guess. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly since then, to be honest. Does that make sense? I just… haven't needed to.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a relatively clean bill of health following the Medicare assessments. And no recent hospitalizations or significant illnesses since then. It is… commendable that you have maintained your health, Ms. Sayar. However, "the usual things" is rather vague. Could you elaborate on what those assessments revealed?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It was a pretty standard check-up, I suppose. They did blood work, a chest X-ray… I remember being worried about my heart, because my father had some problems when he was older. They said my heart was fine, completely normal. They checked my lungs too, because I used to live near a coal mine, but everything was clear. And… honestly, that’s about all I remember. It was a long time ago, and they didn’t find anything wrong, so I didn’t really pay much attention to the details. I just trusted they had everything covered.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to not dwell on negative findings when everything is deemed normal. However, for the sake of thoroughness, and to ensure I can provide an accurate assessment for your travel insurance, I'll need a bit more detail. Do you recall any specific diagnoses mentioned during those assessments, even if they were minor?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Oh! They said I had slightly high cholesterol. But it wasn’t high enough to need medication, they just told me to watch my diet. And… I think the doctor mentioned something about a little bit of arthritis in my hands? But it wasn't anything serious, just some stiffness in the mornings. Really, that was it. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. I just… didn’t worry about it much. I'm usually pretty active, so I figured it wasn't a big deal.
DOCTOR: Slightly elevated cholesterol and mild arthritis. Alright. While these are not immediately disqualifying, we do need to ascertain the current status of both conditions. Have you made any changes to your diet since that assessment?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. After the Medicare check-up, I really started trying to eat healthier. More vegetables, less red meat, that sort of thing. I also started walking every morning, just to get some exercise. It's been a couple of years now, and I feel really good. I haven't had any tests done since then to check my cholesterol, but I'm pretty sure it's better now. My hands still get a little stiff sometimes, but it’s not nearly as bad as it used to be. I use a warm compress in the mornings, and that helps a lot. Is that good enough? I'm really hoping this isn't too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Self-reported dietary changes and symptom management are… insufficient for a fitness-to-fly assessment, Ms. Sayar. To properly evaluate your suitability for travel, I will need to conduct a brief physical examination and order some updated laboratory work. Specifically, a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels and a basic inflammatory marker to evaluate the arthritis. It's standard procedure, and I assure you, it’s for your own safety. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I see. I guess I was hoping to avoid all that. But if you really think it's necessary… yes, alright. I consent. I just… I don't really like going to the doctor. But if it's for the letter, and to make sure I'm safe… then yes, please. What exactly does the examination involve? I hope it’s not too… invasive?
DOCTOR: It will be a standard physical assessment, Ms. Sayar. I will listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and briefly examine your hands for signs of arthritis – range of motion, any swelling or tenderness. Nothing overly invasive, I assure you. Let's begin with your blood pressure. Please remove your jacket and sit comfortably.
PATIENT: Okay. This is… fine. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I'm not very good with medical stuff, as you can probably tell. I just want to get this letter and go. No offense, of course. You’re just doing your job.
DOCTOR: 130/80. Slightly elevated, but not concerning. Now, if you would please take a deep breath for me... and exhale slowly. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. Any history of shortness of breath or wheezing, even with exertion?
PATIENT: No, never. I mean, I get a little winded sometimes when I walk uphill, but that's just because I'm not as young as I used to be. Nothing serious. I used to go hiking with my husband, years ago, and I never had any problems then. He was the fit one, though. He could climb mountains without even breaking a sweat.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. Can you make a fist for me, please?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s a little stiff, I’m warning you. Especially in the mornings. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… feels tight. Like my joints are rusty. My grandmother had arthritis too, so I figured it was just… inherited. Is that a thing?
DOCTOR: There is some mild crepitus in the metacarpophalangeal joints, and slightly limited range of motion. No significant swelling or erythema noted. Now, can you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: Is that okay? I don’t want to hurt you. It’s not very strong, I know. I used to be able to knit for hours, but it’s getting harder and harder. My fingers just don’t move as easily as they used to. It’s frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Grip strength is mildly diminished, consistent with mild osteoarthritis. Alright, Ms. Sayar. Based on my examination, and your reported medical history, I'll order a comprehensive lipid panel and a C-reactive protein test to further evaluate your cholesterol levels and inflammatory markers. This will allow me to make a more informed assessment regarding your fitness to fly. The laboratory results should be available within 48 hours. I will review the results and contact you to discuss them. However, be advised that, pending those results, I cannot issue a fitness-to-fly certificate at this time. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. So… no letter yet. Just more tests. Of course. It's alright. I guess I’ll just… wait. What do I need to do? Where do I go for the tests? And how long will it take? I just… I want to get this sorted out. This trip is important to me.
DOCTOR: You will need to go to the lab located at 123 Main Street. The requisition form contains detailed instructions regarding preparation for the tests – fasting required for the lipid panel. The lab technicians will provide further guidance. I expect the results within 48 hours, as I mentioned. I will contact you as soon as they are available to discuss them and determine if a fitness-to-fly certificate can be issued. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid making any non-refundable travel arrangements. It’s prudent to be cautious until we have a clearer understanding of your medical status. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. And… I’ll go do the tests right away. I hope everything is alright. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sayar. I will be in touch.
