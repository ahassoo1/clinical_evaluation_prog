DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Barban. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is... satisfactory to meet you as well. I am here for this... check-up before the insurance starts. Medicare sent me. It is a requirement, yes? I do not know much about these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Medicare does require a baseline health assessment when you first enroll. It's quite standard, really. So, while it is a requirement, it’s also a good opportunity to get a comprehensive overview of your current health status. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, shall we?
PATIENT: History? I... do not have much to tell, Doctor. I work in the food factory. Not much happens there. Healthy work, mostly. Lifting boxes. I have not been to a doctor in… a long time. Perhaps ten years? More? It is not important. I do not get sick easily.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, even healthy individuals benefit from routine check-ups. Ten years is quite a while. Very well. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, even if it seemed minor at the time?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I had the usual childhood things, I suppose. Measles, chickenpox… but that was long ago. In Yemen, we did not see doctors for those things. My mother took care of everything. Herbal remedies. Very effective. I have not needed a doctor since I came here.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications, Doctor Barban?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I drink tea. Sometimes coffee. But no pills. I do not believe in them, really. They just cause more problems, I think. My father… he took many pills. Did not help him at all.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Lamb, fish, rice… all the things. I work with food all day, I would know if I had an allergy. No, Doctor. I am quite sure. Perhaps a little sensitive to very spicy peppers, but that is not an allergy. It is a preference.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mother… she passed away last year. It was… a sickness. Old age, mostly. My father, he passed many years ago. A heart problem, the doctors said. He worked very hard his whole life. Always lifting, always building. A strong man. Not like these days.
DOCTOR: I see. And were there any other significant medical conditions that ran in your family – perhaps diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm. My aunt… on my mother’s side… she had something with her stomach. Very painful. The doctors said… ulcers, I think. And my grandfather… he had trouble breathing when he got old. Very weak lungs, they said. But that was long ago. Everyone in my family worked very hard. Hard work is the problem, I think. Not sickness.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health status, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Physical examination? Yes, of course. Though I doubt you will find anything. I am a strong man. But go ahead, Doctor. I have nothing to hide. Just… be quick, if you would be so kind. I do not have all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll just step over here and lie down, we can begin. I'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we'll listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax, and breathe normally. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Very well. Here. Do not squeeze too tight. It is uncomfortable. Though I am used to lifting heavy things, I do not enjoy being constricted.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax your arm, Mr. Barban. 140 over 90. Slightly elevated, but not concerning at this point. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular. No murmurs or extra noises detected. Breathe deeply, if you would. In… and out… Yes, good. Lungs are clear bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles heard. Alright. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if you feel any tenderness. Soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected.
PATIENT: No tenderness. I told you, Doctor. I am a strong man. I work with food all day. Lifting, carrying… it keeps me healthy. You will not find anything wrong. I assure you. Though I appreciate your… diligence.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, just to complete the assessment, I’d like to check your reflexes. This will just involve a gentle tap on your tendons. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Please relax your legs. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Alright. All vital signs and reflexes appear normal. Given your age and general physical condition, and the fact that you’ve not been seen by a doctor in some time, I recommend a baseline blood panel to assess your cholesterol, glucose, and kidney function. It’s a precautionary measure.
PATIENT: Blood panel? More tests? I thought this was just a requirement for the insurance. Is it necessary? I do not see the point, Doctor. I feel perfectly fine. But… if it is required, I suppose I have no choice. Just… please make it quick. And do not keep me waiting for too long. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: It is a standard part of the Medicare baseline assessment, yes. And while you feel well, it's important to have objective data to establish a baseline for future comparisons. It’s preventative care, Mr. Barban. I’ll have the nurse draw the necessary blood samples. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. I will review the results as soon as they are available, and we can discuss them at a follow-up appointment. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Next week… very well. As long as it does not take up too much of my time. I have work, you understand. Just… call me, if possible. I do not check my email often. And I do not have much patience for waiting on hold. Next week. Fine. Let us be done with this, then.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’ll give you a list of instructions for fasting prior to the test. We’ll contact you directly to schedule your follow-up appointment once the results are available. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Barban?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all. Just… thank you for your time. Though I still believe this was unnecessary. But, it is done. I shall await your call.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Barban.
