DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a reset, or a jumpstart. I’m not ill, exactly, but I don’t feel my best, and I'd like to get back to feeling like myself again, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That absolutely makes sense, Ms. Pitzel. It's good you're being proactive about this. “Stuck” and needing a “reset” is a perfectly valid reason to come see me. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about how you're feeling?
PATIENT: It’s difficult to explain… it's not one specific thing. Just…low energy, mostly. And a bit…unfocused, I suppose. Like my mind is always a little bit foggy. I used to be able to juggle so many things, and now…it feels like a real effort to concentrate on even simple tasks. I also haven't been sleeping as well as I used to. Not waking up tired, necessarily, but…not rested, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand. Low energy, difficulty concentrating, and not feeling rested despite sleep… those can definitely impact your quality of life. Let's try to pinpoint some details. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It wasn’t a sudden thing, more gradual. I would say… maybe six months ago? It started with just feeling a little more tired than usual. Then the focus issues began, probably around four months ago. It's been the last two months that it's really felt… noticeable, and concerning enough to come see you. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. Gradual onset is important to know. And it's good you're tracking the timeline. Now, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being almost no impact and 10 being completely debilitating, how would you rate the impact these symptoms are having on your daily life?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a tough one. Debilitating is too strong a word, certainly. It’s not stopping me from doing things, but… it’s making them harder. More stressful. I’d say… a 5, maybe a 6 on a bad day. It's enough that I find myself avoiding things I used to enjoy, just because I lack the energy or focus for them. Does that sound reasonable?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds very reasonable. A 5 or 6 – impacting your enjoyment of things is significant. Okay, let’s move on to some other things that might be contributing. Could you tell me a little about your typical day?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I work as a molder, shaper, and caster – not metal, more…decorative pieces, things like plaster, resin, that sort of thing. It's physically demanding, but I've been doing it for a long time, so I'm used to it. I usually start my day around 6:00 AM, get ready, have a quick breakfast, and I’m at the workshop by 7:00 AM. I work until around 4:00 PM, with a short lunch break, of course. After work, I help my husband with dinner, and we usually relax in the evenings – reading, watching television. Nothing too exciting. It’s a fairly routine life, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture. And it is physically demanding work. Do you find that the symptoms worsen at a particular time of day, or after specific activities?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. I hadn’t really thought about it. Now that I consider it…they definitely feel worse towards the end of the workday. The fatigue is much more noticeable then, and the mental fog seems to be thicker. It’s like I’ve used up all my energy, both physical and mental. And, truthfully, sometimes even getting started in the morning feels harder than it used to. It takes more effort to motivate myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I’ve been fortunate, I suppose. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing – but nothing serious. I’ve never been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like diabetes or heart problems. I am on Medicare, of course, just because of my age, but that’s more preventative care than anything. I do have high blood pressure, but it's well-controlled with medication. I see my primary care physician regularly for check-ups and blood work.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Well-controlled hypertension is good to know. Do you happen to know what medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… I believe it’s Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day. I have it refilled regularly, so the doctor has it on file, I'm sure. I don't always remember the details myself. It's been a few years now, and everything sort of blends together, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I completely understand. Lisinopril 10mg daily. And are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Just a multivitamin, really. Nothing else. I tried some herbal supplements a while back – something for energy, I think – but they didn’t seem to do much, so I stopped taking them. I mostly rely on a good night’s sleep and a healthy diet, when I can manage it. My husband does most of the cooking, and he's very good about making sure we eat our vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the multivitamin. And no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication before. No food allergies either, thankfully. I enjoy cooking and trying new things, so that would be a problem! My husband always asks before giving me anything new, just in case. He's very cautious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's all very helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit complicated. My mother had some heart problems later in life, and my father had type 2 diabetes. My sister has high blood pressure, like me. On my husband’s side, his mother had arthritis, and his father had Alzheimer’s. It’s not a particularly healthy family, if I’m honest. A lot of aches and pains, and some serious illnesses as people get older. I try not to dwell on it too much, but it's always in the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Now, just to clarify, when you say Alzheimer’s, was that diagnosed by a doctor?
PATIENT: Yes, it was. Diagnosed several years before she passed away. It was… difficult, to say the least. It was a slow decline, and it was hard to watch. He still talks about it sometimes, so it's definitely something that's present in our thoughts. It makes me a little anxious, if I'm being honest, about my own cognitive health. It's probably just my age, but... I worry.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Ms. Pitzel. It’s completely normal to be concerned, especially given your family history. Okay, let’s talk a bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally - maybe once or twice a week. And definitely no recreational drugs. I was raised in a very conservative household, and my husband and I have always lived a fairly quiet life. We prefer a good book and a cup of tea to anything more exciting. It's not really our style. I find enough excitement in my work, thank you very much!
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very good to know. Just a glass of wine occasionally. Now, let's get back to your symptoms. You mentioned low energy and difficulty concentrating. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I don't think so, not dramatically. My appetite has been a little lower lately, but I chalked that up to the fatigue. I just haven’t been as hungry as usual. And I haven’t weighed myself recently, but my clothes feel a little looser, maybe? It’s not a huge amount, but enough that I've noticed it. Nothing alarming, but it's another small change I hadn't really connected to anything until you asked.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly lower appetite and clothes feeling a bit looser. Are you experiencing any difficulty sleeping, other than not feeling rested?
PATIENT: Not really difficulty falling asleep, no. I can usually fall asleep without a problem. It’s more that I wake up several times during the night. Not every night, but often enough to be disruptive. I usually just need to use the restroom, but sometimes I wake up feeling…restless. I'll lie there for a while, unable to get back to sleep, before finally drifting off again. It doesn't feel like a deep, restorative sleep, if that makes sense. And as I mentioned before, even when I do sleep through the night, I don't wake up feeling refreshed. It's a very frustrating cycle.
DOCTOR: Okay, waking up multiple times during the night and not feeling rested, even with adequate sleep duration. Now, just a few more questions. Have you noticed any mood changes recently, such as feeling more anxious, depressed, or irritable?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit harder to answer. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed, not exactly. But I have been a little more…easily frustrated lately. Smaller things bother me more than they used to. And I find myself worrying more, especially about my health, as you might imagine. I wouldn’t say I’m anxious all the time, but there’s definitely a low-level hum of worry that’s always present. It's not debilitating, but it's not normal for me. I usually try to be a more optimistic person, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased irritability, increased worry, and a low-level of anxiety. That gives me a good picture of what you’re experiencing. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. It will help me rule out any underlying physical causes for your symptoms. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I want to get to the bottom of this, and if a physical exam is helpful, then I'm happy to cooperate. Let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly so. It can fluctuate, and we'll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezes or crackles. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Finally, I’m going to do a quick cognitive assessment, just to get a baseline. I'll ask you a few simple questions about your memory and orientation. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds fine. Please, proceed. I'm ready when you are. I'm a little nervous about the cognitive assessment, to be honest, given my family history, but I understand it’s important.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be a little nervous, Ms. Pitzel. It’s just a simple assessment, and it’s not a definitive diagnosis. It simply gives me a baseline to compare against in the future, if needed. Okay, let’s start with your orientation. Do you know what the date is today?
PATIENT: Let me see… today is August 2nd, 2025, isn’t it? Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I believe so. Although, sometimes the dates do run together these days… that’s probably just my age.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Ms. Pitzel. Very good. And do you know where we are right now?
PATIENT: We are at… your clinic. In the rural area. I don’t know the exact name of the town, but it's a small clinic outside of the city, I believe. I remember driving here with my husband. It was a bit of a winding road.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Ms. Pitzel. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m ready. Please, go ahead. I will try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Repeat those back to me, please.
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Is that correct? I hope I remembered them properly. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That is correct. Very good. Now, I'm going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Let me see… backwards… That's a tricky one. D-L-R-O-W. Is that right? I always struggle with spelling, even simple words. It's just one of those things. D-L-R-O-W.
DOCTOR: That is very close, Ms. Pitzel. It’s W-O-R-L-D, but that's alright. It was a challenging task. And finally, I'm going to ask you to name three things that are red.
PATIENT: Three things that are red… Let me think. An apple, of course. A rose. And… a firetruck! Is that enough? Are those three acceptable?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Pitzel. Those are perfect. Thank you. Okay, based on your history, physical exam, and the cognitive assessment, it appears you’re experiencing some symptoms that are concerning, but not immediately alarming. Your cognitive function is within normal limits for your age, but we will want to monitor it over time. The low energy, difficulty concentrating, and disrupted sleep are the most concerning things. Given your symptoms, and your family history, I believe a few things could be going on. It could be something as simple as vitamin deficiency or mild dehydration, but it could also be something more complex, like early cognitive impairment, sleep apnea, or even mild depression. I’d like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and basic metabolic panel. I also recommend a sleep study to rule out sleep apnea. Finally, I want to screen you for depression using a standardized questionnaire. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. I appreciate that, Doctor. I’d like to know what's going on, and if those tests can help us figure that out, then yes, please. Vitamin levels, thyroid, sleep study… and the questionnaire. I’m a little anxious about the sleep study, to be honest, but I understand it’s important. Let’s do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this. It’s just… unsettling, feeling this way.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Pitzel. It’s perfectly normal to feel unsettled when you’re not feeling like yourself. We'll take it one step at a time. I’ll write you an order for the blood work. You can have that done at the lab across the street. They take Medicare, so there shouldn’t be any issues. As for the sleep study, I'll give you a referral to the sleep center. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. It’s usually an overnight study, where they monitor your brain waves, breathing, and heart rate while you sleep. It's not as scary as it sounds, and it will give us valuable information. I’ll also have the nurse give you the depression questionnaire to fill out before you leave. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and eating a healthy diet. I also want you to avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results of your tests. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and you've answered all my questions. I appreciate your patience and your kind approach. I’m just… relieved to finally be doing something about this. It’s been unsettling, as you said, and I’m hopeful that we can figure out what’s going on. Thank you. Perhaps… when I return with the results, we can discuss them? And maybe talk about options?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pitzel. That's exactly what we'll do. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today, to review the results and discuss next steps. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. The nurse is always available to answer your questions. Here’s the order for your blood work and the referral for the sleep study. And the nurse will be right in with the questionnaire. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Pitzel. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I'll see you in two weeks. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. You have a good day as well. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
