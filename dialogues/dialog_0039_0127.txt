DOCTOR: Hello, Gedalya. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, you see. And my eyelids… they’re starting to droop. It's been getting worse over the last few months, and it’s a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids… that is something to look into. A few months, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly. I’d say… around February it started, maybe March. It was very subtle at first, just feeling a little more tired than usual. But now… now it's noticeably harder to do things, and my vision feels strained because of the eyelids. I didn’t think much of it at first, honestly. Just thought I was overdoing it at work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And work… what kind of work do you do, Gedalya?
PATIENT: I’m a facilities manager. So, I'm usually running around, checking on buildings, making sure everything is in order… a lot of walking, a bit of lifting, that sort of thing. It’s… it was manageable, but it’s getting harder to keep up. I find myself needing more breaks, and sometimes I just… can't do certain tasks.
DOCTOR: Okay, a physically demanding job. And you've noticed this impacting your ability to do your work… Any other symptoms along with the weakness and drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes my speech feels a little slurred towards the end of the day, but I thought that was just from being tired. And… this might sound strange, but I've been double-seeing a little bit, especially when I look to the side. It doesn't happen all the time, but it’s there. I also get headaches, but those come and go, and I’m prone to them normally, so I didn’t connect it.
DOCTOR: Slurred speech and double vision… those are important details, thank you for telling me. Headaches, okay. Now, let's see… have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Actually, yes, I think so. I haven’t been eating as much, I suppose. Not intentionally, just… don't feel very hungry. And I think I’ve lost a bit of weight, but I haven't weighed myself recently to be certain. I’m usually quite slim, as you can see, but I do feel a bit… thinner than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some weight loss. Hmm… Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you had any illnesses or injuries recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a cold last winter, but nothing serious. I haven’t been injured, haven’t had any accidents. I generally consider myself quite healthy, to be honest. That’s what makes this whole thing so unsettling. It’s just… come on so gradually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of similar symptoms or muscle weakness or problems with vision?
PATIENT: That's a difficult one. My mother had… some sort of eye condition when she was older, but I don't know the details. She didn’t talk about it much. My father was generally healthy, as far as I know. No one, to my knowledge, has had anything like this weakness or the drooping eyelids. I suppose I should ask my aunt, she’s quite good with family history. I hadn't really thought about it until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can always revisit that. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, or any supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that's about it. I don't have any allergies, either, thankfully. I'm usually very careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Okay, Gedalya, I think it's time to do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and do a closer look at your eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I’m a bit anxious, but I’ll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, if you could just follow my penlight with your eyes, please, don't strain. Just a smooth movement. Okay… good. And now I’m going to test your reflexes. Just relax your arm for me. That’s… a little diminished on both sides. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. I think so, anyway. It feels… a little weaker than usual, perhaps? It’s hard to say, honestly. I’ve never really had this tested before. I'm trying to squeeze as hard as I can, but it doesn’t feel quite as firm as it normally would.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate your honesty. Now, I'm going to check your neck muscles. Could you try to resist as I push against your forehead?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. I'm trying to push back… it’s… a little difficult. It feels harder than it should be, I think. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay. And one last thing, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam… the weakness, the drooping eyelids, the double vision, and diminished reflexes… it could be a few things. It’s difficult to say definitively without some further testing, but one thing that comes to mind is Myasthenia Gravis. It’s an autoimmune condition that affects the muscles. It can cause fluctuating weakness and fatigue. But we need to rule out other possibilities first. Would you be willing to get some blood tests and possibly an MRI?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… Gravis? That sounds… concerning. Autoimmune… I don't know much about that. Fluctuating weakness… yes, that does sound like what I've been experiencing. Some days are worse than others. Blood tests and an MRI… yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is necessary to find out what’s going on, I'm willing to do. The uncertainty is… unsettling. It would be a relief to have a diagnosis, even if it’s not a good one, just to know what we’re dealing with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll get those tests ordered right away. I’m going to write you a requisition for a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and an acetylcholine receptor antibody test to start. And I’ll also order an MRI of your brain and orbits. The MRI will help us rule out any structural issues. I'll also need you to see a neurologist. They are the specialists in muscle and nerve disorders. I can give you a referral. We'll want them to interpret the results of these tests and guide the treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes, that makes sense. Thank you for the referral, I appreciate that. Um… what is the… the likely timeline for getting these tests done? And will I be able to work while waiting for the results? I understand it's probably too early to say for certain, but… I have responsibilities, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, good questions. The blood tests should be fairly quick – a few days at most to get the results back. The MRI, however, can take a bit longer, maybe a week or two depending on availability. As for work… that’s a difficult one. Given your symptoms, and the possibility of Myasthenia Gravis, I would advise you to avoid any strenuous physical activity until we have a clearer diagnosis. It's important not to overexert yourself, as it could worsen the weakness. Perhaps you could discuss with your employer taking some time off, or reducing your workload temporarily?
PATIENT: Time off… yes, that might be difficult. My employer isn't always… understanding. But I suppose I have to prioritize my health. Okay. I will speak with them. And I’ll schedule the tests as soon as possible. Just to clarify… are there any warning signs I should be looking out for in the meantime? Anything that would warrant an immediate trip to the emergency room?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. Yes, definitely. If you experience any difficulty breathing, double vision that doesn’t improve, or difficulty swallowing, please go to the emergency room immediately. Those could be signs of a myasthenic crisis, which is a medical emergency. Also, if your weakness suddenly worsens significantly, don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, try to get plenty of rest, avoid stressors as much as possible, and let me know if you have any concerns. Here’s the requisition for the tests and the referral to the neurologist. I’ll also have the nurse give you a printed handout with information about Myasthenia Gravis. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That was all very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen and explain everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your honesty and… your reassurance. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing we have a plan. I'll schedule the tests and see the neurologist as soon as I can. And I’ll be sure to contact you if anything changes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gedalya. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a bit. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And remember to take care of yourself. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
