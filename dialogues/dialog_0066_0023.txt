DOCTOR: Hi Aron, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um, my chest… it hurts. Not all the time, but sometimes. It's in my… breast. It feels sore, you know? Like when you bump yourself, but… inside.
DOCTOR: Okay, soreness in your chest, specifically in your breast area. And it’s not constant, comes and goes. You said it feels like a bruise, but deeper in?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Deeper. It's hard to explain. Not like a bump you can see, but… feels like something is bruised inside. It's been happening for maybe two weeks now? I don't remember exactly. My wife asked me to come. She worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, two weeks or so. And your wife encouraged you to come in, which is good. Just to clarify, is this soreness in one breast, or both?
PATIENT: Um… I think just one. The left side, I think. It's hard to tell, to be honest. I don't usually… pay attention to these things. My wife noticed it more than me, she says it looks a little… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly on the left side, and your wife has noticed a visual change as well. Has anything specific caused this, as far as you can remember?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing I can think of. I work on roofs, so I move a lot, sometimes I bump into things. But I don't remember hitting my chest hard. Maybe… just from working? I lift a lot of heavy stuff. Could be that?
DOCTOR: Roofing is physically demanding work, definitely. Lifting, moving… that could contribute. Has the soreness been getting worse, staying the same, or better over these two weeks?
PATIENT: It's… maybe a little worse. Not a lot, but I notice it more now than when it started. It doesn’t keep me from working, but sometimes I feel it at the end of the day, when I'm tired. My wife says I look more grumpy too, maybe because of the pain? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gradual worsening, more noticeable at the end of the day when you're fatigued. And your wife has noticed a change in your mood, potentially related. Any other symptoms accompanying this – any fever, chills, redness or swelling in the chest area, any nipple discharge, or changes in the skin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. And… no, nothing coming out of my… nipple. And the skin looks normal, I think. My wife would have said something if it looked different, she always notices these things. It just… hurts, sometimes. That's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, chills, discharge, or skin changes. Just the soreness. Do you have any past medical problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. I haven't been to the doctor in a long time. I usually just… try to work through things. Nothing serious, I hope. I eat okay, try to sleep enough, but roofing is hard work, you know? No problems, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had surgery. I don’t like hospitals. My wife says I’m stubborn. She’s probably right. Just a few cuts and bruises from work, nothing bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. What about your family – anyone in your family have a history of breast cancer, or any other types of cancer?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Hmm… My mother had… something. Not breast cancer, I don’t think. Something with her stomach, a long time ago. She passed away when I was young. My wife’s grandmother had something, too, but I don't remember what it was. We didn't talk about it much. She died a long time ago. I'm not sure. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright, some family history of cancer, but nothing specifically breast cancer that you're aware of. Do you take any medications regularly, or have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any medicine. Just sometimes, when my back hurts from work, I take… ibuprofen? I think that’s the name. And no allergies. Never had a problem with medicine. Just try to rest when I need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for back pain, no known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to examine your chest and breasts more closely. Just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please? My wife will be mad if I come home with more bruises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible. If you'd like, you can change into this gown, and we’ll get started. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Just let me know if you need anything. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to palpate your chest and breasts. I’ll start on your left side, where you mentioned the soreness. Okay, I'm feeling… some tenderness on the inner aspect of your left breast, near your sternum. There doesn't appear to be any distinct mass or lump. Skin is normal in appearance. No visible redness or swelling. I don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes in your armpit. It’s definitely tender to the touch, though. I’m also noting some muscle tenderness in your chest wall, likely from your work.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… right. It feels sore there, like you said. And yes, my muscles are always sore. Roofing is hard work, you know? It's good that you don't feel anything… bad. What do you think it is? Is it something serious? My wife will worry if I don’t tell her everything.
DOCTOR: It's good we've been able to narrow things down. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you likely have a combination of muscle strain and potential costochondritis. Costochondritis is inflammation of the cartilage connecting your ribs to your breastbone. It can cause chest pain that mimics other issues, but it’s typically not serious. The tenderness I felt and your history of physically demanding work support this. However, because you mentioned the tenderness and because it's always best to rule things out, I’d like to get a chest X-ray just to ensure there isn't anything else going on. It’s a quick, painless scan that will give us a clearer picture. Do you have any issues with getting an X-ray, like pregnancy, or any other concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No problems with X-ray. I'm not pregnant, of course! And no other concerns. My wife will be happy you’re being careful. So, muscle strain and… cost-o-what-you-said? Is that something serious? Do I need to stop working? I need my job, you know?
DOCTOR: Costochondritis, yes. It's usually not serious, thankfully. It can be uncomfortable, but it's rarely life-threatening. It often resolves on its own with rest and pain management. Stopping work completely isn't usually necessary, but you will need to modify your activities to avoid straining your chest muscles. We'll discuss pain management options in a moment. I'll write an order for the chest X-ray, and we can schedule that for you. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding heavy lifting, repetitive motions, and any activity that exacerbates your pain. I also want to be thorough. Since you have a history of working with your hands and potentially exposing yourself to the elements, and because of the tenderness, I want to rule out a few other less common possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count as well, just to make sure there’s no sign of infection or any other underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. I'll do whatever you think is best. I don’t want my wife to worry. The X-ray and… the blood test? I just want to get back to work. And sleep without hurting, that would be nice. Can you tell me what those tests look for, just so I know? And… will they hurt?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The chest X-ray will give us a picture of your lungs, heart, and bones in your chest. It helps us rule out things like pneumonia, fluid around the lungs, or any bone abnormalities. The CBC is a blood test that checks the number and types of cells in your blood. It can help identify signs of infection, inflammation, or other medical conditions. Neither test is particularly painful. The X-ray technician will simply ask you to stand still for a few seconds while the image is taken. The blood test will involve a small needle prick in your arm, just like any other blood draw. There might be a slight pinch, but it shouldn't last long. I’m going to write the orders now. I’m also going to recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen for now, to help manage the discomfort. Do you have any allergies to these medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies to ibuprofen or… the other one. I take ibuprofen sometimes for my back, like I said. My wife always tells me to take it with food, so I do. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like, specific stretches or something? I don't want it to get worse. And how long will it take to get the results? My wife will want to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good that you’ve used ibuprofen before without issue. Taking it with food is a smart idea. As for stretches, I recommend avoiding any stretches that cause pain. Gentle range-of-motion exercises for your shoulders and arms can be helpful, but listen to your body and stop if you feel any discomfort. Don’t push through the pain. Regarding the results, the lab usually takes 24-48 hours to process the X-ray and CBC. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. I’ll also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the results and see how you’re doing. I'll also write you a note outlining these instructions, as well as the medications I've recommended. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfect. A note is good, my wife likes to keep track of things. And a follow-up appointment, okay. Thank you for everything. You’ve put my mind at ease, a little bit. I just hope it's not something serious, you know? My wife… she worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's understandable to be concerned, and I'm glad I could offer some reassurance. We're taking all the necessary steps to get to the bottom of this. And I’m happy to discuss this with your wife as well, if she'd like. I’ll have the nurse bring in the paperwork now, and we can schedule that follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and try to rest as much as possible.
