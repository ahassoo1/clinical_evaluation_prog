DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ellan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Though, frankly, I wouldn't be here if it weren't for… well, let's just say my daughter insisted. She’s very keen on these… alternative remedies. I understand you offer certification for medical marijuana? It’s rather a silly thing, if you ask me, but she assures me it's quite legitimate these days.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, I see. Your daughter is interested in exploring medical marijuana as an option. We do provide evaluations for that, yes. It’s becoming more common, and there can be benefits for certain conditions. But, before we focus solely on that, I’d like to understand what’s been going on with you. Is there something specific that’s bothering you, or is this just a preliminary consultation to see if you might be a candidate?
PATIENT: Well, “bothering” is a strong word, Doctor. I’m seventy-four years old. Things ache. It’s the natural order of things, isn’t it? Though, I suppose my hands have gotten a bit… stiff lately. Makes it harder to do my work, naturally. A bailiff needs steady hands. Not that the courts are as… demanding as they once were. Still, one must maintain standards. And my sleep… it's not what it used to be. I wake up several times a night. But truly, Doctor, I don’t believe I need anything. My daughter is the one who’s been going on about it. It’s all very… new-age.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some common age-related changes – some aches and pains, stiffness, and difficulty sleeping. It's good you're maintaining standards with your work, that's wonderful. It's also perfectly reasonable for your daughter to want to explore options to help with these things. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about the stiffness in your hands?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in the knuckles, Doctor. And the wrists, a bit. It’s worse in the mornings, naturally. Takes a good while to loosen up, and even then, it's not quite the same. It doesn’t hurt, per se. It’s more… restrictive. Makes gripping things difficult, and filing paperwork is rather a trial these days. I've been using these… strengthening grips my daughter purchased for me, but I can’t say I’ve noticed much improvement. Honestly, I suspect it’s just time taking its toll. A body can only endure so much, you know. And a bailiff’s work is physically demanding, despite what people might think. Lots of walking, lots of standing… and occasionally, having to… persuade people.
DOCTOR: I see. Stiffness in the mornings, primarily in the knuckles and wrists, making gripping and filing difficult. And it doesn't necessarily involve pain, more restriction of movement. That sounds like it could be several things, actually. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Arthritis? Goodness, no. Never been diagnosed with anything, as a matter of fact. I've always been… quite robust, you see. A strong constitution, my mother always said. Never one for doctors, either. Just a waste of time and money, if you ask me. Though, my daughter insists I have a complete physical every year. Drives me mad, honestly. All those… poking and prodding. She worries too much, that girl. But no, Doctor, I haven’t been diagnosed with arthritis. I just assumed it was… wear and tear. A natural consequence of a life well-lived.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, and it’s good you’ve been generally healthy. Sometimes, wear and tear is the culprit. But it’s always good to rule things out, just to be sure. And since your daughter is so diligent, perhaps a thorough examination isn't such a bad idea. Besides the hand stiffness, have you noticed any other aches or pains anywhere else in your body?
PATIENT: Well, my knees do ache a bit when it rains, if I’m being honest. It’s a family trait, you see. My grandmother had terrible knees. But it’s nothing debilitating, Doctor. Just a bit of a twinge. And my lower back… well, that gets a bit stiff after a long day on my feet, naturally. It’s to be expected, isn't it? Standing and walking for hours. But again, nothing that prevents me from performing my duties. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like I’m listing off all my ailments. I didn't realize I had so many! It's probably just old age creeping in. That's what it is, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound like a list of ailments at all, Ellan. It sounds like you’re an active seventy-four-year-old with a few typical aches and pains that come with age and an active lifestyle. It's good that you are still able to perform your duties. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, the sleep. That’s… erratic, to say the least. I used to sleep like a log, you know. Eight solid hours, without a peep. Now… I wake up several times a night. Sometimes it’s just a matter of needing to use the facilities, other times… I don’t know. I’ll just… wake up. Fully alert, mind you. Laying there staring at the ceiling. It doesn’t hurt to stay awake, it’s just… frustrating. And it leaves me feeling rather tired in the mornings, despite getting what should be enough sleep. My daughter says it could be stress, but honestly, Doctor, what stress does a bailiff have? It's not like I'm running a Fortune 500 company. It’s just… getting older, I suppose. It affects everything, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It certainly can affect everything. Waking up multiple times a night, feeling alert but unable to fall back asleep, despite getting what seems like enough hours… That can be very disruptive. And you're right, it's not always about major stress. Sometimes it’s just changes in the body, or even lifestyle. Now, I'm going to ask some routine questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. My appetite is… normal, I suppose. I enjoy a good meal, always have. And my weight… well, it fluctuates a bit, as it does with age, but nothing drastic. I haven’t lost any significant weight, and I certainly haven't gained any. I'm rather particular about what I eat, you see. Not one for processed foods or sugary drinks. My mother always emphasized the importance of a healthy diet. Though, my daughter does try to get me to eat more… vegetables. She says they’re good for my… “gut health.” Honestly, Doctor, it’s all very confusing these days. So many new things to worry about. Still, no significant changes in appetite or weight, if that’s what you’re asking. I maintain a fairly stable constitution, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Maintaining a stable constitution is excellent. Now, I'm going to ask about any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. Do you take anything regularly?
PATIENT: Well, nothing prescribed, Doctor. I pride myself on avoiding doctors and their… potions, as my grandmother used to call them. I take a multivitamin every morning, just to be on the safe side, my daughter insists. And occasionally, if I have a headache, I'll take an over-the-counter pain reliever. But that's it. Truly. No regular medications. I'm a firm believer in natural remedies, you see. A good night's sleep, a healthy diet, and a bit of exercise. That’s all one needs, in my opinion. Though, I admit, a bit of exercise is becoming increasingly difficult these days. Still, no regular medications. Absolutely none. I’d rather rely on my own strength, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve always been quite… robust, you see. A strong constitution, as my mother always said. Never one for sensitivities or allergies. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like I’m listing off all my good qualities! Though, perhaps that’s just old age talking. Still, no allergies. Absolutely none that I’m aware of. I’ve been fortunate in that regard, I suppose. It’s just… I'm a very… normal person, Doctor. I don't have any complicated medical history or sensitivities or anything like that. Just a bit of stiffness and a bit of trouble sleeping, as we’ve discussed.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you haven't had any allergic reactions. And you are right, you don't present with a complicated medical history, and it sounds like you’ve been quite healthy overall. Now, one final question about your past: Have you ever had any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was… ages ago. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree, but that healed perfectly well. Otherwise, I've been remarkably… unscathed, you might say. No serious illnesses, no major surgeries. I've always taken good care of myself, you see. A healthy diet, regular exercise, and a bit of luck, I suppose. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel like I'm bragging! But truly, I've been very fortunate in that regard. No major health issues to speak of. Just a bit of wear and tear, as we’ve discussed. I believe that's all, Doctor. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, would you mind if I just did a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh dear. Well… I suppose if it’s necessary. I do try to avoid them, as you know. But if it will help determine the source of my… discomfort, I suppose I can endure it. But please, Doctor, be gentle. And no poking and prodding if it’s not absolutely necessary. I do have a low tolerance for… unpleasantness. Is there anything I should be wearing… or not wearing?
DOCTOR: Of course. No need to undress. Just your regular clothes are fine. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your hands and joints. It won’t be anything too invasive, I promise. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Very well. But please, Doctor, don't squeeze too tightly. My circulation isn’t what it used to be. And do tell me if I’m unusually high. My daughter gets quite upset if my blood pressure is elevated. She insists it's a sign of… stress. Honestly, Doctor, what stress does a bailiff have? It’s not like I’m running a Fortune 500 company. But very well. Proceed. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140 over 85. That’s slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. It’s something we can monitor. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Could you take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? I do try to breathe deeply, you see. My daughter insists on “mindful breathing exercises.” Honestly, Doctor, it’s all rather silly, but she means well. Are you detecting anything… untoward? My heart has always been… reliable, as far as I know. No palpitations or anything like that. Just a steady, reliable rhythm. I hope that’s satisfactory. Are you finished with the stethoscope now? It's rather cold.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear. No unusual sounds detected. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to take a look at your hands and joints. Could you hold your hands out, palms up?
PATIENT: There. As you can see, they’re rather… weathered, aren’t they? Years of hard work, you see. Filing paperwork, serving warrants… not exactly gentle occupations. And the knuckles… well, as we’ve discussed. They’re a bit… stiff. And a bit… bumpy, perhaps? My daughter says it’s “arthritic changes,” but honestly, Doctor, I suspect it’s just wear and tear. Are you detecting anything… concerning? Please be gentle. I do rely on these hands for my livelihood, you see.
DOCTOR: There is some swelling around the knuckles, particularly on this hand. And you are right, there is some bony prominence. Do you experience any pain when I gently press here?
PATIENT: Ooh. Yes, a little bit. Not excruciating, mind you. Just a… twinge. As if something is… grating. It's worse in the mornings, as we've discussed. And when I'm gripping things tightly. Filing paperwork, for instance. Or… serving warrants. It’s not constant, Doctor. Just… occasional discomfort. And it’s not enough to prevent me from performing my duties, mind you. Just a… nuisance, really. Is that concerning? My daughter gets quite alarmed about even the slightest discomfort, you see. She insists it's a sign of something… dreadful. Is it dreadful, Doctor? Please be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s not dreadful, Ellan. Based on my exam and what you’ve told me, it appears you have some mild osteoarthritis in the knuckles of both hands. It’s a very common condition, particularly as we age, and it's often caused by wear and tear. It’s good you’re still able to perform your duties. The discomfort you're experiencing is consistent with that.
PATIENT: Osteoarthritis. Well, I suppose that’s what I suspected. Wear and tear. My mother always said I worked too hard. And my daughter… she’ll be insufferable now. “I told you so,” she’ll say. Honestly, Doctor, I didn't need a medical diagnosis to tell me my hands were a bit stiff. What does one do about it? Is there a cure? Or will I be doomed to a life of aching knuckles? And will it prevent me from performing my duties? That's my main concern, you see. I take pride in my work.
DOCTOR: There isn’t a cure for osteoarthritis, unfortunately, but there are many things we can do to manage the symptoms and slow the progression. It's unlikely to prevent you from performing your duties, but it may require some adjustments. There are several options, including over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, which can help with pain and inflammation. We could also consider hand exercises to help maintain range of motion and strength. And there are assistive devices, like splints, that can provide support and reduce stress on your joints. Would you like me to write you a prescription for an anti-inflammatory?
PATIENT: An anti-inflammatory… well, I suppose it couldn’t hurt. But I do try to avoid medication, as you know. And I’m not keen on the idea of taking pills every day. What about these… exercises? Are they difficult? I’m not very flexible these days, you see. And I haven't got much patience for… fiddly things. My daughter tried to get me to do yoga once. It was… a disaster. Still, if it's a gentle exercise… and if it won't take too much time… perhaps I could try it. Do you have any brochures or anything? With pictures? I learn best visually, you see. And perhaps you could recommend a good… hand therapist? Someone who can show me the proper techniques? My daughter will be delighted, of course. She’ll probably sign me up for a whole course of treatments. Honestly, Doctor, she'll be insufferable. But very well. Write me a prescription for the anti-inflammatory, and see if you have any resources on hand exercises.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the prescription for ibuprofen. You can take it as needed for pain and inflammation. And here’s the brochure on hand exercises. These are gentle exercises that you can do at home to maintain range of motion and strength. And here is a list of local hand therapists. They can provide personalized guidance and teach you proper techniques. I would recommend scheduling a consultation with one, especially if you’re experiencing significant pain. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Hm. Well, the pictures are rather small, aren’t they? And the hand therapist… they’re all quite far away, aren’t they? I do try to avoid driving, you see. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be. Still, I suppose I could ask my daughter to take me. She’ll insist, of course. Honestly, Doctor, she’ll probably book me an appointment before I even have a chance to look at the list. As for the ibuprofen… well, I suppose I can try it. But I do worry about side effects. My stomach isn’t what it used to be, you see. Do you have any… recommendations for protecting my stomach? Perhaps a certain type of food? Or a supplement? My daughter will be insufferable if I get an upset stomach. Honestly, Doctor, she’ll say “I told you so” for weeks. Still, thank you for the information. It’s… helpful, I suppose. Now, about this medical marijuana certification… Is that still an option, given my diagnosis? My daughter is quite keen, you see. She says it could help with the pain and inflammation. And it’s “natural,” apparently. Honestly, Doctor, I’m still very skeptical, but I suppose it’s worth considering. What are your thoughts?
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana is still an option, Ellan. It can be helpful for some people with osteoarthritis, particularly for pain and inflammation. However, it’s not a cure-all, and it's not right for everyone. There are potential side effects to consider, and it’s important to discuss them with your daughter. As for protecting your stomach while taking ibuprofen, I recommend taking it with food and avoiding alcohol. You can also consider taking a proton pump inhibitor, like omeprazole, to help reduce stomach acid. We can discuss prescribing one if you’re concerned. And regarding your skepticism, that’s perfectly valid. It’s important to be informed and make a decision that’s right for you. If you’d like to explore the medical marijuana option further, we can discuss your medical history and determine if you’re a suitable candidate. Do you have any specific questions about it?
PATIENT: Hm. A proton pump inhibitor… well, that sounds… complicated. And I do try to avoid taking too many pills, as you know. Perhaps I’ll just try taking the ibuprofen with food and see how it goes. And as for the medical marijuana… well, my daughter is quite insistent, you see. She says it could help with my sleep, as well as the pain. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure about it. It seems… rather unconventional. And I do worry about the side effects. Is it… habit-forming? And will it affect my judgment? I need to be alert and sharp, you see. I’m a bailiff, after all. I can’t afford to be… hazy or confused. And what about the legality of it? Is it legal in this state? My daughter says it is, but I do worry about getting into trouble. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all rather confusing. Perhaps you could explain it to me in simple terms? And tell me what the risks are? And what the benefits are? And will it affect my driving? My daughter will be insufferable if I get into an accident. Honestly, Doctor, she’ll say “I told you so” for the rest of my life. Still, I suppose it’s worth considering. If it could help with the pain and sleep… and if it’s safe… and legal… and won’t affect my judgment… and won’t affect my driving… and won’t get me into trouble… perhaps I could try it. But I need to be sure, you see. Very sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s address your concerns one by one. Medical marijuana has been shown to be effective for some people in managing chronic pain and improving sleep. It contains compounds called cannabinoids, which interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system, which regulates pain, sleep, and mood. As for the legality, yes, medical marijuana is legal in this state with a valid medical card. Now, regarding side effects, the most common ones are dizziness, drowsiness, and dry mouth. Some people may experience anxiety or paranoia, but these are less common and can usually be managed by starting with a low dose. It is not habit-forming in the same way as opioids, but some people can develop a tolerance over time, meaning they need a higher dose to achieve the same effect. As for affecting your judgment, that’s a valid concern. It’s important to start with a low dose and see how it affects you. Never drive or operate heavy machinery under the influence of marijuana. It’s also important to discuss it with your daughter, so she knows you’re trying it and can monitor you. As for your driving, it's best to avoid driving after taking it. I can provide you with more information about the different forms of medical marijuana, the potential risks and benefits, and how to obtain a medical card. We can also discuss your medical history to determine if you’re a suitable candidate. And I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have. It’s important to make an informed decision, so don’t hesitate to ask anything that’s on your mind. Is that helpful?
PATIENT: Hm. Well, it’s… less alarming than I expected, I suppose. But still… rather complicated, isn’t it? Different forms… endocannabinoid system… tolerance… It’s all rather scientific. And I do worry about the side effects. Dizziness and drowsiness… that’s not ideal, you see. And anxiety… I already get anxious enough, without adding marijuana to the mix. And I do worry about the legality of it. What if I get pulled over? Will the police know? And what if I get into an accident? My daughter will be insufferable. Honestly, Doctor, she’ll say “I told you so” for the rest of my life. Still, if it could help with the pain and sleep… and if it’s safe… and legal… and won’t affect my judgment… and won’t affect my driving… and won’t get me into trouble… perhaps I could try it. But I need to be sure, you see. Very sure. Perhaps I should just stick to the ibuprofen. It’s… simpler, isn’t it? And I do worry about getting into trouble. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all rather overwhelming. What do you think? What would you do if you were me? Perhaps you could just tell me what you think is best? I trust your judgment, you see. You’re a doctor, after all.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Ellan. Honestly, if I were in your shoes, I would start with the ibuprofen. It's a well-established medication with a proven track record. It's simpler, as you said, and it doesn’t come with the complexities of medical marijuana. We can see how it manages your pain and sleep, and if it’s not enough, then we can revisit the medical marijuana option. There’s no need to rush into anything. And regarding your concerns about getting into trouble, it’s important to be aware of the laws in this state. You’ll need a valid medical card to legally possess and use medical marijuana. And it’s illegal to drive under the influence, even with a medical card. Ultimately, the decision is yours, of course. But based on what you’ve told me, I would recommend starting with the ibuprofen and seeing how it goes. And if you have any questions or concerns along the way, please don’t hesitate to ask. We can work together to find a solution that’s right for you. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… perfectly reasonable. Ibuprofen it is, then. Simpler, as you said. And less complicated. And less likely to get me into trouble. My daughter will probably be disappointed, but… she’ll get over it. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate your patience. And your honesty. You’ve put my mind at ease, you see. Perhaps I should just stick to the ibuprofen and take it with food. And avoid driving, of course. And if it doesn’t work… well, then we can revisit the medical marijuana option. But for now… ibuprofen it is. Thank you, Doctor. Truly. Now, about these hand exercises… perhaps you could just write down a few simple ones? I don’t need anything complicated, you see. Just a few simple exercises to keep my hands moving. And then… I suppose that’s all, isn’t it? I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been most helpful. Truly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ellan. Here are a few simple exercises you can try. Just repeat each one 10 times a day, and stop if you feel any pain. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’m always here to help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a wonderful day, and take care of yourself.
