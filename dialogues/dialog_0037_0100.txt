DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. AX. It's good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. AX, is it? Yes, right. Well, um… it’s this drug test, I think. Medicare said I needed one. Honestly, things are a bit fuzzy these days, you know? I don't really remember why exactly. Something about making sure I’m okay, I guess?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare sometimes requires periodic drug screenings as part of their coverage. That’s perfectly alright – many people find the details a bit confusing. And it’s good you’re here to get it sorted out. Just to clarify, do you know when Medicare requested this test?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not a clue. Dates… they just sort of… happen. I think it was a letter? A phone call, maybe? Honestly, I get so many things in the mail, and people calling… It all blends together. Was it recent though? I feel like I would remember if it was very long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. It sounds like it was fairly recent. Let's focus on getting this done today then. To start, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I used to take something for my knees, a little white pill… but I stopped that a while back. The doctor… someone told me to stop. It wasn’t really helping anyway. Other than that… maybe a multivitamin sometimes? I try to be good, you know? But honestly, I can’t remember the last time I actually took one. It’s probably in the cupboard somewhere.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you recall the name of the medication you were taking for your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… tricky. It was a small pill, like I said. White. And… it started with a “C,” I think. Or maybe a “P”? Oh, this is awful, isn’t it? I’m so bad with names. It was the doctor who gave it to me, though. Dr… something. Not Dr. AX, definitely not you. Honestly, I wish I could be more help. My memory just isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Hughston. Don't worry about it. It’s very common to have trouble remembering things, especially medication names. We can work around it. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. I don’t think so. I mean, I get a little sniffly in the spring, but that’s just pollen, I guess. Nothing serious. Never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. Though, my skin is a bit sensitive… but that’s just getting old, probably. I’m pretty lucky, really. No big allergies to worry about.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, before we proceed with the drug screen, I’d like to ask a few questions about your general health. Have you been experiencing any pain anywhere in your body recently?
PATIENT: Oh, pain… well, getting old isn’t easy, you know? My knees ache sometimes, like I said before, even though I stopped taking that pill. And my back… it gets stiff, especially in the mornings. Nothing terrible, just the usual aches and pains of getting older. I wouldn’t say it’s pain pain, more like… discomfort. Is that helpful? I’m not very good at explaining things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Hughston. It's good you're sharing this with me. And don't worry about explaining things – we’ll take our time. Besides the knee and back discomfort, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… changes… Well, I've been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. Just generally… worn out. And I seem to be sleeping more than usual. I don’t bounce back like I used to, you know? Everything feels a bit… heavier. That’s probably just getting older too, though, isn’t it? I don’t know… it’s hard to say. Things are just… different.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… Well, it comes and goes, really. Some days I eat like a horse, other days I barely touch a thing. I don’t really have much of an appetite lately, if I’m honest. And I think I might have lost a little weight… but I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. It’s hard to say for sure. Everything feels a bit… off, you know? I'm not as active as I used to be, so I guess that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we proceed with the drug screen, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. That's pretty standard procedure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. A quick exam sounds good. I trust your judgment. I don’t mind at all. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. My knees aren't what they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll take things slow and be mindful of your knees. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Then I’ll briefly check your reflexes and your abdomen. Would you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Relax… Just let me know what you're doing, okay? I don’t like surprises. And don’t worry about my knees, I can handle a little discomfort. I’ve lived a long life, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just listening to your heart and lungs now. Take nice, deep breaths. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, but otherwise sounds regular. Your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated as well, 140/90. That's something we'll want to keep an eye on. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This might be a little… surprising, but it shouldn’t hurt.
PATIENT: Oh, elevated, is it? Well, I get a bit nervous at the doctor's office, so that's probably why. I always worry about something being wrong. Okay, go ahead. Just be gentle, please. And tell me if it's going to be a big tap, okay? I don't want to jump out of my skin.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a few taps here. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but that can be normal with age. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… A little bit, yes. Right there… It's not terrible, but it's a bit sensitive. I get a bit of discomfort there sometimes, especially after I eat. I thought it was just indigestion, though. I suppose old age comes with a few aches and pains, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It could be indigestion, as you said, or something else. I’m not going to jump to conclusions just yet. Okay, that completes the brief physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits for your age, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure and abdominal tenderness. Now, let's proceed with the drug screen. We just need a small urine sample. Would you mind going to the restroom to collect one?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A urine sample. That's… not so bad. I can do that. Just let me know if there's anything special I need to do. And where is the restroom, please? I don’t want to get lost. It’s been a long day already, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. There are collection cups inside, and I’ll give you a private room to leave the sample. Just make sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterward. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Please let me know if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Down the hall to the left. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be right back. Don’t go anywhere.
DOCTOR: I won’t. Take your time, Ms. Hughston. I’ll be right here.
