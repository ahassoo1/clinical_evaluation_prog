DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Skarbek. I’m Dr. Ruocco. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I need to get some information about what shots I might need… it’s for a friend of mine. He’s applying for a visa, and I believe there are requirements for certain vaccinations. I want to make sure he’s covered, you see. It's a bit confusing to sort through all of it.
DOCTOR: A visa, right. People and their paperwork. Look, I deal with patients, not friends of patients. It’s a liability thing. But… alright. What country is he applying to go to?
PATIENT: Oh, my apologies, Doctor. That was… not thoughtful of me. My friend, Daniel, is applying to go to Italy. He’s always wanted to see Rome. He’s a good man, but not very good with… details. That’s why I’m here, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Italy… hmm. Look, vaccinations depend on a lot of things. His age, his medical history… has he had anything done recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I don’t know about any medical history, Doctor. He doesn't usually talk about things like that. He’s a private man. He might have gotten a flu shot last year, but I’m not even sure. He’s… fairly healthy, I think. Works in a garden center, lots of outdoor work. Is it going to be a problem if I don’t know these things?
DOCTOR: A garden center… wonderful. Listen, I can’t just guess at his medical background. It’s irresponsible. Has he had any childhood vaccinations?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… that’s a good question, Doctor. I… honestly, I have no idea. We don’t talk about things like that. He didn’t grow up around here, you see. Different country, different ways of keeping records, I suppose. I’m terribly sorry. I wish I could be more help. Is there a way to… find out? Or would he need to come in himself?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Skarbek, this is getting us nowhere. I need information. I can’t just wave a magic wand and tell you what shots he needs. He needs to come in himself. I need his medical history, his vaccination records… or we can’t do anything. It’s basic procedure. Honestly, some people. Wasting my time.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. That makes sense, I suppose. I just thought… well, I thought I could save him a trip. He’s a bit anxious about doctors, you see. Is there… maybe a list of the common vaccinations needed for Italy? Just so we have an idea of what to look for? I could ask him, and then maybe he'd be willing to come in.
DOCTOR: Here. This is a general guideline from the CDC. It lists common recommendations for travel to Italy. Read it. And tell him he’ll need to come in for a proper consultation. I'm not going to repeat myself. Next.
PATIENT: Oh. Thank you, Doctor. I understand. He will… he will come in, I think. We appreciate your time. Thank you again, Doctor Ruocco. Have a good day. .
