DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I am Dr. Yackey. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Perhaps you could start by telling me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this pain in my side again. And the water infections keep coming back. It’s been going on for a while now, and it’s starting to wear me down. I believe my kidneys aren’t quite right, if I remember correctly from past visits.
DOCTOR: “Again,” you say. Right. Let’s try to be specific, if you wouldn’t mind. This “pain in your side” – where exactly is it located?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s not always in the same spot, you see. But mostly, it’s on my left side, lower down, near my back. Sometimes it feels like it wraps around a bit. And it’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes, but it’s been happening more often lately.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, left flank… fluctuating. And these “water infections,” as you put it – when was your most recent episode?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… the last one… it was just last month, I believe. Around the 15th of July, maybe? I had to see Doctor Patel about it. She gave me some tablets, of course. They help, but then it just… comes back. It’s a bit of a cycle, you see.
DOCTOR: Doctor Patel, yes. I see some notes here. Recurring UTIs, treated with antibiotics. And you believe this flank pain is related?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Patel did mention something about my kidneys, if I recall. She said something about… cysts, I think? And that the infections could be linked to that. I’m not very good with remembering all the medical terms, you see. It all sounds very complicated. Is that Polycystic Kidney Disease she was talking about?
DOCTOR: Polycystic Kidney Disease is… a possibility, yes. Though that typically presents with… a more extensive history. Let’s not jump to conclusions. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, fever, chills, or nausea alongside these infections?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no blood in my urine. And no fever or chills. Sometimes I feel a bit… off, a little sick to my stomach, but I don’t get properly nauseous, if you understand. Just a bit queasy sometimes. It usually passes quickly. It's more the constant ache and the feeling of needing to go to the toilet all the time that bothers me most, you see.
DOCTOR: “Constant ache,” frequent urination… Alright. And have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes in… my bowels? Oh dear. Let me think… Not particularly, no. Everything’s been… regular, as it were. Nothing out of the ordinary there, Doctor. I do try to eat a good diet, lots of fruits and vegetables. Though sometimes I feel a bit… bloated, if I eat too much. But that’s just me, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to palpate your abdomen and listen to your flanks. Please lie back on the examination table. And try to relax, if you can.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall do my best to relax. It's not always easy, you see, being an old man. Shall I lie flat?
DOCTOR: Yes, please lie flat with your knees bent. And please, try not to tense up. I need to feel for any tenderness. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain. Is there any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, a little bit there, on the left side. It’s not sharp, just… a dull pressure. And… yes, a little bit higher up too, near my back. It’s not terribly painful, but I can feel it, Doctor. It's more uncomfortable than anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness in the left flank, as expected. Now, let me listen to your flanks with the stethoscope. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Breath in… and out… Sounds clear, thankfully. No obvious signs of infection at this moment.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I hope that was helpful. It's good to hear there’s no obvious infection, but this ache is still troubling me, you see. I do worry about my kidneys, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your history and the physical exam, and reviewing Doctor Patel's notes, it’s likely you’re experiencing recurrent UTIs with some associated flank discomfort. It could be related to mild kidney involvement, but further investigation is needed. We need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis with culture. We'll also need a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a clearer picture of your kidneys. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds like… a lot of tests, Doctor. A CT scan? Is that… is that dangerous? And what exactly will these tests show? I’m not very good with all the medical jargon, you see. Will they be able to see if my kidneys are alright? And… how long will I have to wait for the results?
DOCTOR: A CT scan uses X-rays, yes, so there is minimal radiation exposure. However, the benefits of obtaining a diagnosis far outweigh the risks in your case. It will allow us to visualize your kidneys, ureters, and bladder to identify any abnormalities – stones, cysts, or signs of infection. The blood tests will assess your kidney function and rule out other potential causes. The urinalysis will confirm the presence of infection and identify the specific bacteria. As for waiting times… the lab results should be back within a few days. The CT scan may take a little longer, depending on scheduling and the radiologist’s availability. I will have the lab draw done today and schedule the CT scan as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so, Doctor. Though it all sounds a bit… overwhelming, if I’m honest. Blood tests, a scan… It’s a lot to take in. But if you think it’s necessary, then I trust your judgment. You’re the doctor, after all. And… will someone explain the results to me when they come back? I do worry about understanding everything on my own.
DOCTOR: The lab will automatically forward the results to my office. My nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. And yes, I will personally review the results with you and explain everything. Now, are you currently taking any medications or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a tablet for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And… no allergies, thankfully. I’ve never had any trouble with medications before. Just the blood pressure tablet, as needed. And a bit of paracetamol sometimes, for aches and pains, but not regularly, you see.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… noted. Alright. I'm going to write you a prescription for a short course of antibiotics to address the potential UTI. Take it as directed, even if you start to feel better. And please, drink plenty of fluids. Here you go. The lab order and CT scan requisition will be sent electronically. Do you have any further questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I believe that’s all for now. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for ordering the tests. I do hope we can find out what’s causing this ache, and get it sorted out. I shall take these away with me, and hopefully, we will know more soon. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Espinueva. Follow the instructions carefully. And please, contact the office if you experience any worsening symptoms. Have a good day. .
