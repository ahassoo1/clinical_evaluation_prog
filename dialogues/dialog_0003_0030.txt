DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I’m Dr. Yackey. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It’s… different. I can’t really describe it, just that it’s not how it usually smells. It started maybe a week or two ago, and it’s been bothering me.
DOCTOR: A change in body odor… right. And you say this started approximately two weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yes, about two weeks. Maybe a little longer, honestly. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when. I just remember noticing it after a workout, and it wasn't the usual smell. It’s… stronger, I think, and maybe a little… sour? Not like BO, exactly, just… different. I shower every day, so it’s not like I’m not keeping clean.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this odor… generalized, or is it localized to a specific area?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think it's mostly under my arms, where you’d expect it, but maybe… a little all over? It’s hard to tell, really. I haven't really been sniffing myself all day to figure it out! But I feel like it's not just my armpits. It’s just a general… presence, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A generalized presence… right. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Other changes? Let me think… Not really. I’ve been feeling okay, normal energy levels. No fever, no weight loss or gain. I guess my appetite's been a little lower than usual, but I put that down to the heat, honestly. It’s been so hot lately, it just doesn’t feel like eating much. Oh! And I've been a little more thirsty, but again, I figured that was the heat too. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Thirst and decreased appetite… alright. And what about any changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Not really a change, exactly. I usually eat pretty healthy – lots of vegetables, some fish, chicken. I try to avoid too much processed food. I did have a lot of mangoes last week – they were on sale! – but I don’t think that would cause a smell, would it? I mean, mangoes smell lovely. I’ve been drinking plenty of water, though, like I said.
DOCTOR: Mangoes are unlikely to be the cause, Ms. Purtee. Let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry. I just… I’m trying to think of everything. No, I don’t take any regular medications. Just over-the-counter stuff if I get a headache. And no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I did have penicillin as a kid, but that was ages ago. Does that count? I don’t even remember if it bothered me.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll note the penicillin. Now, family history – any significant illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… That's a tough one. My mother had high blood pressure, and she had some problems with her knees as she got older. My father... he died when I was young, so I don’t really remember much about his health. He had diabetes, I think. My sister is healthy as far as I know. She lives in Ethiopia, so I don't see her often. We don't really talk about medical stuff. Is that helpful? I wish I knew more.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Alright. Ms. Purtee, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at your skin. Perhaps we can get a better understanding of what’s going on. Please, if you would.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just let me know what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and exhale. Another deep breath… and exhale. Heart rate is within normal limits. Lungs are clear. Now, let me examine your skin… particularly in the axillary regions. No visible rash or lesions. Skin feels normal temperature. No noticeable swelling or tenderness. Hmm. Findings are unremarkable thus far.
PATIENT: Okay. So, that’s good, right? That it’s unremarkable? It means nothing’s seriously wrong? I’m just a bit worried, I guess. It’s just… strange. I’ve never experienced anything like this before.
DOCTOR: It means we haven't identified an obvious cause immediately, Ms. Purtee. It doesn’t necessarily rule anything out. We’ll need to run some basic blood work to rule out any underlying metabolic issues. A complete blood count and a metabolic panel should suffice. I'll order those for you now. We'll also take a urine sample.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work and a urine sample. Whatever it takes to figure it out. I guess I should go to the bathroom now for the urine sample, then? Where is it?
DOCTOR: Down the hall, first door on the left. There are instructions inside. Please ensure you provide a midstream sample. I will review the results as soon as they become available. In the meantime, try not to overthink it. These things often have simple explanations.
PATIENT: Okay, a midstream sample. Right. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be right back.
