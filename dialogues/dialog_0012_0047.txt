DOCTOR: Hi Cleo, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Good to meet you too. Seems like… paperwork? My daughter, she set this up. Something about… long-term care? I get a little mixed up with things these days, if you don't mind. It's been… a while since my wife passed, and things just don't stick like they used to.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Cleo. It’s perfectly alright. Losing track of things is very common, especially after a big loss. And it’s good you are getting things checked out. So, long-term care… is that something you’re thinking about for yourself, or are you helping someone else plan?
PATIENT: Oh, it's for me, I think. My daughter, Lisa, she worries. Says I should have a plan, just in case. I mostly just… take things as they come. I'm still pretty active, you know? I do some work down at the docks, loading and unloading. Nothing too heavy, but it keeps me busy. But she says… what if I can't do that anymore? I don't rightly know. What does “plan” even mean in this case?
DOCTOR: That’s very understandable, Cleo. It sounds like you’re still feeling strong and capable, which is wonderful. And Lisa is a good daughter to be thinking ahead. A “plan” can mean a lot of things, but mostly it’s about thinking through what kind of support you might need down the road if things do change – whether that's help with daily tasks, living arrangements, or medical care. Let’s start with the basics. How are you feeling generally these days?
PATIENT: Generally… okay, I guess. Some aches and pains, mostly in my back from the work. Gets worse when it’s cold. And… tired sometimes. More tired than I used to be, that’s for sure. But who isn’t, right? My memory… well, Lisa says it’s getting worse, and I reckon she’s probably right. I forget names, mostly. And where I put things. Keys, glasses… that sort of thing. Nothing too serious, I hope. Just… old age creeping in. I eat pretty good, though. Lisa makes sure of that. Lots of fish. We live… near the harbor. Small place. Quiet. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Cleo. Aches and pains, fatigue, and some memory issues… those are all things we can explore. It’s good to hear you’re eating well—that’s a great foundation. And it's good you have Lisa looking out for you. Let's talk a bit more about this fatigue. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days I wake up feeling alright, and can get through the work fine. Other days… just dragging. Like I haven’t slept enough, even when I have. It's worse in the afternoons, usually. I used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now I gotta take a few breaks, sit down for a bit. And sometimes… sometimes I just feel… down. Not sad, exactly. Just… empty. Does that sound silly? I haven’t been sick sick, though. No fever, no cough. Just… tired and… off.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound silly at all, Cleo. Feeling tired and “off” is a perfectly valid way to describe things. And it’s good you’re able to recognize those changes. Fatigue, especially when it comes and goes, and that feeling of being down, can be caused by a lot of things. Let’s do a quick review of your overall health. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly before this?
PATIENT: Not really. I used to go to Doc Hansen, back when he was still practicing. But he retired, and… I just didn’t bother finding another one. Didn’t seem to need to. I’m a pretty tough old bird, you know? A little ache here and there never bothered me. Lisa’s been nagging me to get checked out for years, but I always put it off. Now… well, now she practically dragged me in here. I take a little something for my back, just an over-the-counter pain reliever. And that’s about it. Never had any serious illnesses, like heart trouble or… anything like that. Just the usual old man stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It’s good you’ve been generally healthy. And it's understandable that you haven’t felt the need for regular check-ups until now. Let’s talk about your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any health problems that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, memory problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother… she died pretty young, from a sickness. I don’t remember what it was, exactly. It was a long time ago. My father… he lived a long life, but he wasn’t very healthy in his old age. Lots of aches and pains, like me. He got… confused sometimes, towards the end. Lisa says that might be something to worry about. And… my wife, Sarah… she had trouble with her heart. It was a sudden thing. That was… hard. I don't really remember much else about family health problems. We didn't really talk about those things much. Does that help any? It's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Cleo. It's perfectly understandable that it's hard to remember. Knowing about your mother's early death, your father's later confusion, and your wife's heart trouble is helpful. Now, a few questions about your daily life. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No, not anymore. I used to… back when I was younger. A little bit of whiskey now and then, mostly when I was with my friends. But I quit a long time ago. Sarah didn't like it, and… well, it just didn’t seem worth it after she was gone. Never smoked. Never liked the smell of it. And no, nothing else. Just… old age and fish, mostly. Lisa makes sure I take my vitamins, too. She’s a good girl, that Lisa. Always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Cleo. It sounds like you've made some healthy choices. And Lisa does sound like a wonderful daughter. Okay, last few questions before we do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a problem with any medicines. And no food allergies, either. I eat pretty much anything. Lisa makes a good salmon chowder, and I can eat that all day long. I've never really had a reaction to anything. Does that make sense? I'm pretty simple, Doc. I don't ask for much. Just a quiet life and a good fish. I guess that's it, right? Are we done with the questions now? I’m getting a little tired, if you don’t mind me saying.
DOCTOR: Yes, Cleo, that’s a good point – we're almost done with the questions. And no, it doesn't bother me at all that you're tired. It's perfectly understandable. Just a few more to be sure. Okay, last one: Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements, besides the back pain reliever you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just the back pain stuff, like I said. And Lisa gives me a multivitamin every morning with my breakfast. She says it's good for my memory. And sometimes, if I'm feeling a little achy, I take some fish oil. She says that’s good for the joints. That’s it, Doc. Really. She keeps a pretty close eye on me, that Lisa. Always making sure I’m taking care of myself. I appreciate it, even if I don't always say so. So, is that really all the questions? I'm ready for a nap now, if you don’t mind me saying.
DOCTOR: Yes, Cleo, that’s everything. Thank you for answering all my questions so thoroughly. And it sounds like you have a very caring daughter. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a basic neurological assessment. It won’t take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Sounds good. Just… gentle, if you don't mind. My back's been acting up lately. And… I get a little nervous around doctors, if you don't mind me saying. It's been a long time since I been poked and prodded. Just take your time, okay? And tell me if you see anything… bad. I'd rather know, I guess. Just… gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Cleo. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I’ll explain everything as I go. We’ll take our time, and you can let me know if anything feels uncomfortable at any point. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little bit fast. And your lungs are clear, thankfully. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… Just relax your arms for me. Reflexes are a little diminished, which isn’t unusual with age. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to check your memory and cognitive function. Just answer to the best of your ability. What year is it currently?
PATIENT: Oh dear… uh… let me think… Is it… 2023? No, wait… Lisa said something about it being… 2025, right? Yes, 2025. I think. It all gets a little mixed up sometimes, if you don't mind me saying. I used to remember dates just fine. Now… well, now it's just a blur. I hope I got that right. This is harder than it looks, Doc. My mind isn’t what it used to be, I reckon.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Cleo. It’s very common to have some difficulty with dates. And you got it right – it is 2025. We’ll just do a few more simple checks. Can you tell me your current location?
PATIENT: Oh… uh… Well, I live near the harbor. Small place, blue house. Down by the docks. That's… that's about it. It's a quiet neighborhood. Not much happens there. Lisa says it's a good place for an old man. Safe, she says. Does that help? I… I can’t remember the street name, if you don't mind me saying. It's on the tip of my tongue, but… it won’t come. Getting old is a funny thing, Doc. Things just… slip away.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Cleo. Knowing you live near the harbor is helpful. And you’re right, things can slip away sometimes. No need to worry about the street name. Okay, last simple check. I’m going to show you three words, and I’ll ask you to remember them. Ready?
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Show me the words. I'll try my best. My memory isn’t what it used to be, but I’ll give it a shot. Just… go slow, okay? And don't mind if I forget them right away. That happens sometimes, if you don't mind me saying. Let's see… show me the words.
DOCTOR: Okay, Cleo. Can you tell me the three words I just showed you?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think… table… and… chair… oh dear. I… I can't remember the third one. It was something… something you write with? A… a stick? No… a… I’m sorry, Doc. It’s gone. It slipped away already. I knew it the moment I saw it, but now… nothing. This is terrible, isn’t it? My mind is just… fading.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Cleo. It’s very common to have some difficulty with short-term memory. And you remembered two of them, which is good. Okay, that’s all for the quick physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, you’re experiencing some fatigue, some mild memory issues, and your blood pressure is slightly elevated. These things could be related to aging, stress, or other underlying factors. I’d like to order a few blood tests to rule out any deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t mind a little poking and prodding, if it helps. Lisa would want me to get it checked out, anyway. She’s always worried about me. Just… tell me it won't hurt too much, okay? And… will it take long? I don’t like being away from the house for too long. It’s quiet there, you know? Helps me… think. Just… blood tests, you say? Alright, Doc. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: It will be alright, Cleo. The blood draw itself is a quick pinch, and it won’t take long at all. We’ll just need a small sample. And it won’t take long – the whole process should only take about 30 minutes. We have a comfortable lab right here in the clinic. I’ll also have the nurse check your blood pressure again, and discuss some lifestyle changes that can help lower it – like diet and exercise. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your multivitamin, and getting plenty of rest. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doc. You explained everything pretty good. Just… the blood tests, right? And the nurse will check my blood pressure? Alright. I trust you. Lisa always says you're a good doctor. She's got a good head on her shoulders, that Lisa. Just… when will I get the results? I don't like waiting, if you don't mind me saying. I like to know what's going on. Just… how long for the results? That's all I want to know.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Cleo. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. We'll call you as soon as they're available, and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headaches – please don’t hesitate to contact us immediately. Now, let’s go ahead and have the nurse draw your blood, and check your blood pressure. I'll write up the order for the tests. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, Doc. I think that’s everything. Just… thank you. For taking the time to listen to an old man like me. And… tell Lisa I said hello. She worries too much, but… she means well. Just… thank you. Let's get the blood tests done, and get this over with. The sooner I get back home, the better. I appreciate it, Doc. Really.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Cleo. It was my pleasure. And I’ll be sure to tell Lisa hello. Let me call the nurse for you now. She’ll be right in to get you set up. “Nurse, could you please come in to room three?
