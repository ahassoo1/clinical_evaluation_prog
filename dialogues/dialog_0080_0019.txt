DOCTOR: Hi Manuel, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is good to meet you too. My wife… she want… baby. We old now, you see. She think maybe… need help? I not so sure what help is, but she say come see you. We been married long time, but… time go fast, yes?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your wife is hoping to start a family, and you’re exploring options. It’s wonderful you’re both discussing this together. And you’re right, time does go quickly! To help me understand better, could you tell me a bit more about what’s been happening?
PATIENT: Happening? Hmm… we try, yes. For… some months now. Not work. She get sad sometimes. I try make her happy. We have good life, but… no baby yet. I think she worry she too old. I not so worry, but I want her happy. Is that… happening?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is happening, Manuel. It sounds like you've been trying to conceive for a little while now, and it's understandably causing some stress and worry for both of you. To get a clearer picture, and see what options might be available, I’d like to ask a few questions, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Questions is good. I answer what I can. My mind… sometimes slow now, you see. But I try. What you want to know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, take your time. There's no rush at all. Let’s start with your wife. How old is she, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: She… hmm. I think… seventy-two? Maybe seventy-one. Close to seventy-two. We both old! Is long time ago we get married. She always younger than me, I remember that.
DOCTOR: Okay, seventy-two. And how old are you, Manuel, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Ah, me! I am… Seventy-five! Yes, seventy-five. Old man now, you see. But still strong! Still make good things with my hands.
DOCTOR: Seventy-five! That’s wonderful, Manuel. And strength is the most important thing. Now, has your wife ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… yes. Long time ago. She have… two children. Both grown up now. One boy, one girl. But… not for many, many years. Before I meet her even.
DOCTOR: Okay, two children previously. That’s good to know. And has she had any medical problems that you know of?
PATIENT: Medical… problems? She get… little tired sometimes. And her knees… they hurt when it rain. But she take pills for that. Old people problems, you see. Nothing… serious, I think. She see doctor sometimes, but I not always go with her.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tiredness and knee pain. And she sees a doctor regularly. Do you know what kind of doctor she sees for her knee pain?
PATIENT: No. She just… go. She tell me she go to someone, but I not remember who. Maybe bone doctor? I not so good with these things. I make things with metal and plastic, not with… bones!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Manuel. We can try to find that information later if needed. Now, thinking about you, do you have any medical conditions or take any medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. I have… a little trouble sleeping sometimes. But I don't take pills for that. I just… try to relax. And my back… it aches when I bend over too much. But it’s just old age, I think. Nothing a good rest won’t fix. I have Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, some trouble sleeping and back pain. And you have Medicare. Good. Now, have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think… one time, long ago, when I was young. Something with my leg. I fell down when I was working. But it was a long, long time ago. They fix it, and I haven’t had any trouble with it since.
DOCTOR: Okay, a leg surgery a long time ago. And now, just to be thorough, do either you or your wife have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. She take pills for her knees, like I said. And I… I don't take many pills. We both strong people, mostly. Never had trouble with allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, Manuel, I understand you and your wife are hoping to start a family. Given your ages, achieving a pregnancy naturally would be very challenging, but there are options we can explore. Before we discuss those, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam… is good. If you think it help, then yes. I trust you, Doctor. I not so strong like before, but I still… okay. What you want to do? Just tell me.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears. I’ll also feel your abdomen. Nothing to worry about. Just breathe normally, Manuel. Heart sounds are good, regular rhythm. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so… 140 over 90. Pulse is good and strong. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale… Good. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’ll take a quick look in your ears. Ears look normal. Finally, I’ll just gently feel your abdomen. No tenderness here… everything feels normal. Alright, Manuel. Everything sounds and feels good. Your overall health seems stable, which is positive. Now, let's talk about what options might be available to your wife.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. I not worry so much about me. I just want my wife to be happy. What options? Is there… a way? Even if is small chance, we want to try. She very sad sometimes, you see. Maybe… maybe a miracle?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Manuel. And yes, while the chances are lower with age, there are options we can explore. Given your wife’s age, the most realistic option would be In Vitro Fertilization, or IVF, with donor eggs. Her own eggs may not be viable, but using eggs from a younger donor significantly increases the chances of success. It is a complex and expensive process, and there are risks involved, which we would need to discuss thoroughly. Another option, although with a much lower success rate, is using her own eggs with a process called Preimplantation Genetic Testing to select the healthiest embryo. However, given her age, the chances of finding a viable embryo are slim. Before we go any further, I want to be very honest. IVF is a physically and emotionally demanding process, and it’s not a guarantee. It’s also quite costly. Would you both be open to a consultation with a fertility specialist to discuss these options in detail?
PATIENT: IVF… donor eggs? Is… a lot of words, Doctor. I not understand so much. Is like… taking eggs from another woman? And putting them in my wife? Is… complicated. And expensive you say? My wife… she will be happy if is any chance. But I worry about her. Is too much for old woman? I not want to put her through too much pain. Maybe… maybe we just too old for this.
DOCTOR: You're right, it is a lot to take in, Manuel. And it’s perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. Essentially, IVF involves taking eggs from a younger woman – a donor – and fertilizing them with your husband's sperm in a lab. The resulting embryos are then transferred to your wife’s uterus. You're right to be concerned about the physical and emotional burden on your wife. It does involve hormone injections and regular monitoring, and there are risks associated with any medical procedure. It’s also a very expensive process, often costing tens of thousands of dollars. Before making any decisions, I highly recommend a consultation with a fertility specialist. They can explain the process in detail, assess your wife’s overall health, and discuss the risks and benefits specific to her situation. They can also answer all your questions and help you understand the financial implications. I can provide you with a referral to a reputable specialist if you’d like. It’s important to have all the information before deciding if this is the right path for you and your wife. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes… please. A referral. My wife… she very strong woman. But I worry. Is good to talk to someone… someone who know all the things. Maybe they can tell us… is it worth it? Is too much pain? I just want her to be happy. If is too hard… maybe we just… accept. But she want a baby… so much. Please, Doctor. A referral.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Manuel. I understand completely. It's wonderful that you're both so supportive of each other, and I'm happy to provide you with a referral to a highly respected fertility specialist in the area. Here's a card with their contact information. They have a team of experienced doctors and counselors who can answer all your questions and help you make an informed decision. They will be able to assess your wife's health and discuss the risks and benefits specific to her situation. I also want you to know that I’m here for you both. If you have any questions or concerns after the consultation, please don’t hesitate to come back and see me. I can provide emotional support and help you navigate this process. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Manuel?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You very kind. No… I think that is all. Just… thank you. We go now. Talk to specialist. See what they say. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Manuel. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you and your wife all the best in your journey. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Goodbye, and take care. .
