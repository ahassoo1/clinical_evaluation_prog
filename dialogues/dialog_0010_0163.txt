DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure indeed. Well, to put it quite simply, I’ve been…experimenting with a few dietary approaches, let’s say. And I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I go any further. Perhaps “experimenting” is too strong a word. More…investigating. Yes, investigating. It's all rather silly, really, at my age. But one reads such things, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Vantine. It's good you're being proactive about your health, regardless of age. And it’s certainly not silly to investigate different approaches, especially if you've been reading things that sparked your interest. Could you tell me a little more about these “investigations”?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it began with a rather insistent article about intermittent fasting. Seemed quite reasonable, actually – restricting eating to certain hours. I followed that for a fortnight, I believe. Then a friend – terribly enthusiastic woman, always on the latest thing – recommended a rather strict plant-based diet. No animal products at all. That lasted…a week, perhaps. The lack of a proper Sunday roast proved…challenging. And most recently – and this is the one I'm most concerned about, truth be told – I attempted a rather low-carbohydrate regimen. Cutting out potatoes and bread, you understand. It felt…restrictive, even for me, and I’ve found myself rather fatigued. It all feels a bit haphazard when I put it that way.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so thorough, Mr. Vantine. That gives me a good overview. So, intermittent fasting, a plant-based diet, and now a low-carbohydrate diet – all within a relatively short period. And you're experiencing fatigue with the low-carbohydrate approach. Just to clarify, when you say "fatigue," could you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s not…debilitating, you understand. More a lack of…oomph. A general feeling of weariness. I find myself needing a rather lengthy afternoon nap, which I haven’t done since university, truthfully. And my usual enthusiasm for my work – special effects, you see, quite demanding – has diminished somewhat. I also noticed my hands felt rather cold, even on a warm day. It’s not a tremor, precisely, just…a chill. And, if I’m being perfectly honest, my memory, usually impeccable, hasn't been quite as sharp. Though, at my age, one can’t entirely blame the diet, can one?
DOCTOR: No, you're right to point that out, Mr. Vantine. It's good you're aware of the potential for age-related changes as well. The fatigue, cold hands, and memory changes are all things we should investigate further. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me see… Well, I had my appendix removed in 1968, a rather unpleasant affair, but entirely resolved, of course. I also had a bout of pneumonia some twenty years ago, but made a full recovery. Currently, I am being treated for slightly elevated blood pressure, managed with a small dose of medication – lisinopril, I believe it’s called. Otherwise, I’m remarkably robust, considering. I do wear glasses for reading, naturally, and my knees occasionally protest the weather, but nothing debilitating. I have private insurance, should that be relevant. And I take a daily multivitamin, a habit instilled by my late wife.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vantine. That’s very helpful. Lisinopril for blood pressure, appendix removed, pneumonia in the past, multivitamins, reading glasses, and some knee discomfort. And you mentioned your late wife – I’m sorry for your loss. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the lisinopril and multivitamin?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was some time ago now, but I appreciate the sentiment. And no, nothing else, truthfully. Just the lisinopril, as prescribed, and the multivitamin, religiously taken each morning with my breakfast. I do enjoy a glass of sherry in the evenings, if that's relevant. A small glass, mind you, not an indulgence. It aids digestion, you see. And occasionally, a small square of dark chocolate after dinner. Purely for medicinal purposes, of course.
DOCTOR: Of course, “medicinal purposes.” I understand completely, Mr. Vantine. A small glass of sherry and a square of dark chocolate – noted. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies to speak of, Doctor. Remarkably free of them, actually. My late wife, on the other hand, was terribly allergic to bee stings. A rather dramatic incident in the south of France, I recall. But I myself have never experienced an allergic reaction to anything. Not to shellfish, not to pollen, not even to cats, despite my friend’s aforementioned enthusiastic feline companions. I’ve always considered myself rather fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Vantine. No known allergies. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me see… My father suffered from heart disease, unfortunately. He passed away at the age of seventy-two. My mother, a remarkably spry woman, lived to be ninety-one, but developed a touch of arthritis in her later years. My sister, bless her soul, has always been rather robust, though she did have a bout of shingles a few years ago. And, if I recall correctly, my maternal grandfather had diabetes, though it was a rather long time ago. Nothing terribly alarming, truthfully. Mostly the heart disease and a touch of arthritis. We weren’t a particularly sickly family, all in all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vantine. Heart disease in your father, arthritis in your mother, and diabetes in your grandfather – noted. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, I live alone in a rather comfortable cottage in the suburbs. I remain active in my profession – special effects, you see – though I do delegate some of the more strenuous tasks these days. I enjoy gardening, a passion of my late wife, which I’ve continued in her memory. I read extensively – history, mostly – and I occasionally attend the theatre. I don’t smoke, never have. And my alcohol consumption is, as previously mentioned, moderate. I walk regularly, though perhaps not as far as I should. And I maintain a reasonably healthy diet, except for my recent experiments, of course. I wouldn’t describe myself as sedentary, but neither am I a marathon runner.
DOCTOR: That paints a good picture, Mr. Vantine. Active, engaged, and generally healthy habits. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your hands and feet. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. Proceed as you see fit. I’ve always been rather fascinated by the workings of the human body, though my understanding is purely theoretical, of course. I’m quite prepared for a bit of prodding and poking. And do feel free to explain anything you find, if you deem it relevant. I’m a curious man, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit here for me, and we’ll begin. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That's slightly elevated, but not dramatically so, given your history. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds. Your pulses are a little weak, and your hands feel rather cool to the touch. This is consistent with what you've described – the fatigue and the cold hands. I'm also noting some slight pallor in your skin. Your feet have good pulses, but they feel a bit cold as well. No swelling or other abnormalities. Overall, the physical exam findings support what you've been telling me. The cool hands and pallor suggest potentially reduced circulation, and the weak pulses are worth investigating further. Given your fatigue, diet changes, and these findings, I'd like to order some blood work. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. Blood work sounds eminently sensible. I’m not averse to a bit of scientific investigation, you see. Reduced circulation, you say? Fascinating. I must confess, I had noticed my fingers felt rather stiff in the mornings, but I dismissed it as simply the effects of age. So, what sort of blood work are you proposing? And, if you don’t mind my asking, what are you hoping to discover? I understand if you prefer to explain it after the results are in, of course.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'm hoping to get a comprehensive picture of your overall health, but specifically I want to check your complete blood count – that will tell us about your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. We'll also check your iron levels, vitamin B12, thyroid function, and kidney function. These tests can help rule out several possibilities, including anemia, vitamin deficiencies, and thyroid problems, all of which can cause fatigue and cold extremities. It will also give us a baseline to compare against, should we need to monitor anything in the future. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A comprehensive assessment seems prudent, indeed. Anemia, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems… you’re quite thorough. And yes, a baseline is always a sensible precaution. I appreciate your methodical approach. So, what sort of sample are you requiring? A simple blood draw, I presume? And is there anything I need to do to prepare? Fast overnight, perhaps? Or abstain from sherry?
DOCTOR: A simple blood draw is correct, Mr. Vantine. And no need to abstain from sherry! Although, perhaps not immediately before the draw. You can eat and drink as normal, but I would suggest avoiding a particularly strenuous workout beforehand. We'll need about two vials of blood. The lab is just down the hall, and the phlebotomist is excellent. They'll have you in and out in no time. Once we have the results, which usually take a few days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: Excellent. No strenuous workouts, noted. I suppose a gentle stroll in the garden will suffice. And yes, a gentle stroll sounds infinitely preferable. No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything for the moment. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience. I confess, I sometimes ramble. And I thank you for not dismissing my dietary experiments as the whims of an aging eccentric. I shall await your findings with anticipation. And, if you don't mind, could you perhaps provide me with a written summary of the tests you’ve ordered? Just for my own edification, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Vantine. I’m happy to provide you with a summary of the tests. I’ll have the nurse print one out for you before you leave. It's my pleasure, and please don't worry about rambling – it helps me get a better understanding of your concerns. I’m glad I could address your worries. The nurse will be in shortly to take you to the lab. If you have any questions at all before then, please don't hesitate to ask.
PATIENT: Thank you kindly, Doctor. I appreciate your consideration. I shall see you shortly, then. And thank you once again.
