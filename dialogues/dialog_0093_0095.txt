DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s rather inconvenient, but here I am. I woke up this morning and… well, I can’t hear out of one ear. And my face feels… droopy, on that same side. It’s unsettling, to say the least. I don’t have time for this, you understand. I have important things to attend to.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum, and that this is quite unsettling. The sudden onset of hearing loss and facial drooping are certainly things we need to investigate promptly. It's good you came in right away. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me exactly when you first noticed these symptoms?
PATIENT: This morning. I told you. When I woke up. Around… seven, I suppose. Honestly, I don’t keep meticulous records of my awakening times. It was this morning. Is that clear enough? And frankly, I suspect it’s something simple. A pinched nerve, perhaps? I’ve had headaches before.
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear, Ms. Nissenbaum. “Onset this morning, approximately 7:00 AM.” Thank you for that. While a pinched nerve could be a possibility, the combination of symptoms – sudden hearing loss and facial drooping – warrants a more thorough assessment to rule out other potential causes. To clarify, is the facial drooping on the left or right side?
PATIENT: Honestly, you’re asking me to do a self-diagnosis now? It’s the… right side. Yes, the right side. It's rather obvious, isn't it? I’m not a medical professional, but even I can tell something is off with the right side of my face. Do you need me to point it out? It’s quite distracting when people stare.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Nissenbaum. I apologize if my questions felt like I was asking you to self-diagnose. I simply need to gather as much information as possible. “Right-sided facial drooping noted.” Now, has there been any pain associated with this?
PATIENT: Pain? No. No pain. A little… discomfort, perhaps. A strange feeling. But not pain. I’ve certainly endured worse. It’s more… alarming than painful, if you must know. This is all rather inefficient, don't you think? I have appointments.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that, Ms. Nissenbaum. “No pain, only mild discomfort.” I assure you, we will proceed as efficiently as possible. To continue, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hearing loss and facial drooping?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… no dizziness. No headache, as I said. Taste is… normal, I believe. Though, I haven’t had breakfast yet. Everything feels a bit strange, but that's likely due to the… situation. Honestly, it's probably just stress. I’ve been very busy lately. Are you going to examine me, or continue with this interrogation?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum. I apologize for the lengthy questioning, but it is essential for me to get a clear picture of your condition. Now, a physical exam is certainly the next step. First, I’d like to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I will perform a neurological exam to assess the function of your facial nerves and cranial nerves. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Honestly, I don’t see what poking and prodding will accomplish, but if you insist. Just… be quick about it. I have a very important lunch meeting. And please, explain what you are doing as you go. I dislike surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I will explain each step as I perform it. First, I am going to take your blood pressure. This measures the force of your blood against your artery walls. Then, I will check your pulse, which tells me your heart rate. Finally, I will take your temperature. Your blood pressure is 140/90, your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Those are within a normal range, thankfully. Now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes. I will gently touch different parts of your face and ask you to tell me what you feel. This will help me assess the function of your facial nerves.
PATIENT: Honestly, all this fuss over a slightly droopy face. I've had worse mornings. Very well, proceed. Just be gentle. And don’t linger. I haven't got all day, you know. Though, if it helps, the right side does feel a bit numb. A tingling sensation, really. Is that important? Or are you just going to write down everything I say?
DOCTOR: That's quite helpful, Ms. Nissenbaum. The tingling sensation is important information, yes. I’m noting everything you tell me, as it helps me build a complete picture. Okay, can you raise your eyebrows?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s difficult. The right side… isn’t cooperating. It’s quite unsettling to feel a muscle not working properly. Is this a sign of something serious? I really must get back to my schedule. This is most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I see. That's important information. And you're right to bring that to my attention. Now, could you please try to smile for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, look at this! It’s… ridiculous. It’s like half my face is frozen. Is this… is this a stroke? I’ve read about strokes. This is most alarming. Are you going to do something about it, or just observe my misfortune? I really must insist on some answers. And perhaps a referral to a specialist? Someone who actually does things?
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, you are right to be concerned, and I understand your anxiety. Based on your symptoms – the sudden onset of hearing loss, facial drooping, and now the facial weakness I’m observing – a stroke is a possibility that we need to rule out immediately. However, there are other potential causes as well, such as Bell’s palsy. To determine the cause, we need to proceed quickly. I'm going to order a STAT CT scan of your head to look for any signs of stroke. I will also order blood tests to assess your overall health and rule out any other underlying conditions. Given the potential seriousness of this situation, I recommend we transfer you to the emergency room immediately. They have the resources and specialists available to provide you with the prompt care you need. Would you agree to that?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Honestly, the inefficiency is astounding. Very well, if you insist. But I expect you to arrange transportation immediately. And I expect a full report. A detailed report. I have people who need to know what’s happening. And if it is Bell’s palsy, I expect a swift and effective treatment plan. I do not have time to waste on lengthy consultations and ambiguous diagnoses. Get it done. Now. And please, someone fetch me my purse. It's on the chair. This is a complete disruption to my schedule, you understand. A complete disruption.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concerns and will ensure everything is arranged swiftly and efficiently. I'm contacting the emergency room now to alert them of your arrival and expedite your care. I'll also have a nurse bring your purse to you immediately. A nurse will be with you shortly to transport you to the ER via ambulance. We'll also prepare a detailed report of your symptoms and findings for you and your contacts. I will personally ensure that the receiving physician is fully informed of our assessment. Nurse, please prepare Ms. Nissenbaum for immediate transport to the emergency room. She requires a STAT CT scan and neurological evaluation. Also, please bring her purse to her. Is there anyone specific you'd like me to notify?
PATIENT: Yes. My son, David. His number is… 555-123-4567. Tell him to meet me at Mercy Hospital. And emphasize the urgency of the situation. He tends to be… slow to react. Honestly, I shouldn't have to manage this myself. This is entirely unacceptable. And tell him to bring my charger. My phone is already at 20%. This is a disaster. A complete and utter disaster. Now, get on with it. The sooner I’m at the hospital, the sooner this ordeal can be over.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm contacting your son David now with that information. I understand your frustration, and we will do everything we can to ensure you receive the prompt care you need. The ambulance is on its way, and the nurse will be with you shortly to assist with transport. Please, try to remain calm, and let the medical team at the hospital take care of you. We've done all we can here, Ms. Nissenbaum. Now it’s time to let the specialists at Mercy Hospital take over. .
