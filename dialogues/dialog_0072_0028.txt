DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it hasn’t been feeling the best lately either. It feels… tired, I guess is the word. I’ve had a little trouble breathing with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, a persistent cough and some heart palpitations, or a feeling of tiredness in your chest, and some difficulty breathing. Let’s start with the cough. How long have you been coughing, Ms. Sadhu?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started, hmm… about three weeks ago, I’d say. Maybe a little longer. It wasn’t bad at first, just a tickle, really. But it’s gotten worse and worse, especially at night. I have to sit up to breathe sometimes.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, progressively worsening, worse at night, requiring you to sit up… And is the cough productive?
PATIENT: Productive? Oh dear. What does that mean, Doctor? Do you mean… do I cough anything up? Because yes, a little. It’s mostly clear, but sometimes it’s… yellowish. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to notice. I always have a glass of water nearby.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sadhu, productive means whether you’re bringing anything up when you cough. Clear or yellowish mucus, as you describe. Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I’ve been a little more tired than usual, like I said. And I get winded just walking to the kitchen. But nothing else, really. No fever, no chills… just this cough and feeling worn out. Oh! And my ankles have been swelling a bit. Not terribly, but I’ve noticed my shoes feel tighter.
DOCTOR: Swelling in the ankles is… pertinent. Now, let’s move on to this feeling in your heart. Can you describe the tiredness you feel?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a pain, exactly. It’s more like… a heavy feeling. Like someone is sitting on my chest. And sometimes it feels like it’s beating too fast, then too slow. Not all the time, just… when I get to doing something. Even something small, like washing dishes. Then I have to just stop and rest. It’s been happening for… oh, maybe a month now. A little longer than the cough, I think.
DOCTOR: A heavy feeling, palpitations with exertion… Ms. Sadhu, do you have a history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh yes. Years ago, the doctor told me I had… congestive heart failure, I think that’s what he called it. It was about ten years ago, maybe more. I take some pills for it, every day. I can’t quite remember the name of them, though. Little white ones, mostly. And a pink one too. I get them filled at the pharmacy down the street.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me pull up your records to confirm your medications. Okay, I see here you are on furosemide and digoxin. Good. Now, have you been taking these medications as prescribed?
PATIENT: Oh, furosemide and digoxin… Yes, that’s right! I try to, Doctor. I’m pretty good about it, most days. But sometimes I forget. I’m an old woman, you know! It’s hard to keep track of everything. But I usually remember, especially the pink one. That one I know I need to take. I try to take them with my breakfast, but sometimes… well, sometimes I skip breakfast. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sadhu, consistency with your medications is crucial, particularly with digoxin. Skipping doses can be quite dangerous. Now, let’s briefly review your other medical history. Do you have any other health conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear, let me think. Well, I had my gallbladder taken out years ago. And I have a little arthritis in my hands, that’s why they ache sometimes. And… oh, I had a bad bout of pneumonia a few years back. It put me in the hospital. But other than that… no, I don't think so. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat my vegetables and I don't drink too much soda. Mostly water, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder removal, arthritis, history of pneumonia… Now, are you currently experiencing any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things! I like to cook, you know. Salvadoran food, mostly. Lots of beans and rice. And pupusas! Do you know pupusas? They’re… well, they’re delicious! But no, no allergies. I’m pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, Ms. Sadhu, before I proceed with a physical examination, I need to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, God rest his soul, he smoked a little when he was young, but I always made him go outside. I didn’t want the smell in the house. No, never smoked. And I don’t drink alcohol, either. Just water, mostly. And a little coffee in the morning.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, no alcohol. Now, Ms. Sadhu, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your ankles. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. My knees aren't what they used to be, Doctor. Be careful when you poke around!
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, Ms. Sadhu. And another one. I’m hearing some mild crackles in your lower lungs, bilaterally. And your heart rate is a little irregular, as is your rhythm. And as I suspected, you have significant edema in both ankles, pitting edema, to be precise. Ms. Sadhu, your symptoms, combined with my examination findings, are concerning. I suspect this may be an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Exacerbation? That sounds… bad. Is that why I’m so tired and my ankles are swollen? And the cough? What does that mean, Doctor? What are we going to do? I don’t want to end up in the hospital again. That was no fun.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sadhu, those are all consistent with worsening heart failure. The fluid buildup in your lungs is causing the crackles I heard, and the edema in your ankles is also due to fluid retention. The cough can be a symptom of fluid buildup as well. We need to get this under control to prevent a hospital admission. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to confirm my suspicions and assess the severity of the situation. I’ll also order a BNP blood test, which is a marker for heart failure. Based on the results, we may need to adjust your medications or consider other interventions. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness. X-ray and blood tests… It all sounds so serious. I… I think so. You think my heart is getting worse? And you want to change my pills? I’m a little scared, Doctor. I just want to feel better. Is there anything I can do right now? Like, anything at all? Should I drink less water? Or eat less salt? I always put a little salt on my pupusas.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sadhu, it’s good you’re asking these questions. Yes, the tests will help us determine how your heart is functioning. While we await the results, you are correct to ask about lifestyle modifications. Restricting your fluid intake is crucial. Limit yourself to 2 liters of fluid per day – that includes water, juice, soup, and any other beverages. And significantly reduce your salt intake. Salt causes your body to retain fluid, which worsens your heart failure. As for your pupusas… I understand they are a part of your culture, but for now, minimizing salt is essential. We'll need to closely monitor your weight daily and report any sudden weight gain to the clinic immediately. Do you have a scale at home?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Two liters… that's not much. And no salt on my pupusas… that will be hard. But I understand. I don't want to end up in the hospital. Yes, I have a scale. It's in the bathroom. I weigh myself every morning. I’ve noticed I’ve been a little heavier lately, actually. Just a couple of pounds, but still… I'll pay closer attention, I promise. And I'll try to drink less water. And no salt on my pupusas. What about the tests? How long will they take? And will they hurt?
DOCTOR: The chest X-ray will be quick, just a few seconds. You’ll stand in front of a machine and hold your breath. It won’t hurt at all. The EKG involves placing some sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. That also won’t hurt, but it may be slightly uncomfortable. The blood test will take a bit longer, as we need to draw a sample from your arm. The nurse will be in shortly to perform those tests. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, please adhere to the fluid and salt restrictions I’ve outlined. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… please, help me feel better. I miss being able to walk to the store without getting so tired. And I want to be able to enjoy my pupusas again, even if they have to be a little bland. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: We’ll do our best, Ms. Sadhu. The nurse will be with you shortly to begin the tests. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available and discuss a plan with you. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your legs.
