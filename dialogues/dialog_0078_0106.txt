DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. I see you’re here with us today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, it's my foot. It's been bothering me for…oh, a good while now. A sore, really. A nasty one. And it just won’t heal. I’ve tried things, you know. Things my mother used to do. But clearly, those don’t work anymore. Everything is different these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when home remedies don’t quite do the trick. "A good while now" is a bit vague – could you tell me roughly how long we're talking about?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, do I look like someone who keeps track of dates? It's been…months. Several months. Since last Thanksgiving, I think. Maybe even before. It’s hard to say precisely. Time just…blurs when you’re older, you know. And it hurts. That’s the important part.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s the discomfort that matters most. And you're right to focus on that. So, it’s been several months of discomfort in your foot. Can you describe the sore for me?
PATIENT: It's…well, it's red. Of course it’s red! It’s a sore. And it’s…open. Not a gaping hole, thankfully. But it weeps. Always weeping. And it smells. Not a pleasant smell, I assure you. I have to keep it covered, but even then…it’s just unpleasant. And it’s on the bottom of my foot, near my heel. Makes walking difficult, naturally. Though I manage. I always manage.
DOCTOR: Okay, red, weeping, and with an odor, located on the bottom of your foot near your heel. That sounds quite uncomfortable. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? It hurts. Isn't that enough of a symptom? But…well, my leg sometimes feels a little…tingly. Not all the time. Mostly at night. And my feet…they just feel cold, even when they shouldn’t be. It’s probably just old age. Everything is falling apart, you know. But the sore is the main problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your leg, mostly at night, and cold feet. Thank you for telling me. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or noticed any swelling in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: Fever? Goodness, no. I don't go around with fevers. And chills...well, it gets chilly sometimes, but that’s just the air conditioning. Swelling? A little, maybe. My ankles sometimes look a bit puffy. But that’s just water weight. I told you, everything is falling apart! It’s not a mystery. The sore is the important thing. Are we going to do something about it or just keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Louine, and I apologize if my questions feel repetitive. I want to get a good understanding of everything that’s going on so we can best address the sore. I’d like to take a look at your foot now, if that’s alright with you. It will help me assess the situation and determine the best course of action. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. But be gentle. And don't poke around too much. I don’t want it to hurt even more. Honestly, I don’t know why you need to look at it. It’s a sore, doctor. What more is there to see? But…go ahead. Just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me take a look… I see the sore is located on the plantar aspect of your heel, as you mentioned. It appears to be approximately two centimeters in diameter. The surrounding skin is erythematous – red and inflamed – and I do note some weeping serous fluid. There’s some mild tenderness to palpation, but no significant warmth or fluctuance. I don't feel any palpable lymph nodes in your leg or foot. Do you have any pain with me touching here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, of course it hurts! I told you it was painful. Don’t you think I would tell you if it hurt? It feels…raw. Like someone scraped the skin off. And it throbs, constantly. It’s worse when I stand, naturally. Honestly, you don’t need to poke at it to know it hurts. It’s a sore, doctor. A nasty, painful sore. Are you finished now? Can we talk about fixing it?
DOCTOR: I apologize for causing you pain, Louine. I didn’t mean to exacerbate the discomfort. I was just trying to assess the extent of the sore. You're right, there's no need to continue if it's causing you such discomfort. Based on my examination, and what you've told me, it appears you may have a plantar ulcer, likely complicated by some degree of inflammation. It’s common in individuals with circulation issues or nerve damage. Now, to discuss fixing it… Do you have diabetes, Louine?
PATIENT: Diabetes? What a ridiculous question. Of course I don't have diabetes! My mother was very careful about what we ate. Always fresh fruit and vegetables. No sugary drinks or processed foods. And I’ve always been careful about my weight. What do you take me for? A reckless, unhealthy person? It’s probably just…old age. Everything is falling apart, you know. But I don't have diabetes! Now, what are you going to do about my foot?
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Louine. It's good to know. Even without diabetes, circulation issues can still develop, especially as we age. We’ll need to rule out infection as well. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Specifically, I want to check your blood sugar just to be absolutely certain, and also a wound culture to identify any bacteria present. We may also want to consider a vascular assessment to check the blood flow in your legs and feet. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, tests… Honestly, it’s always tests with you doctors. Back in my day, you actually looked at people and figured things out! But…fine. Go ahead. I suppose I can spare a little blood. But don’t take too much. And I don’t want to sit here all day waiting for results. And what about my foot? When are you going to do something to fix it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Louine, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I assure you, the tests will help me determine the best course of treatment for your foot. While we wait for the results, I can clean and dress the wound. I’ll also apply a topical antibiotic ointment to help prevent infection. I recommend offloading pressure from the foot as much as possible, meaning minimizing standing and walking. I'll write you a prescription for a pair of special shoes with good cushioning. We’ll reassess in a few days based on the lab results and how the wound responds to treatment. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Shoes? Fine. As long as they're comfortable. And don’t give me anything too flashy. I don’t need attention. And ointment is fine. As long as it doesn't smell too bad. But please, no more poking and prodding! And hurry up with those results. I have things to do, you know. Important things. Now, can we get this over with? I’m tired of sitting here. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Louine. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And I understand you have things to do. We’ll get through this as efficiently as we can. I’m ordering a wound culture, a blood sugar test, and a vascular assessment. The results should be back within a few days, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, please keep the wound clean and dry, wear comfortable shoes, and try to minimize pressure on your foot. Do you have any questions for me before I finish?
