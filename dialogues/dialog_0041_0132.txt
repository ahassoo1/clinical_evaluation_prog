DOCTOR: Hi Sammie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about this heat, see? I just… can’t take it anymore. Used to be, a warm day was nice. Now? Feels like I’m melting. I’m Sammie Coby, by the way. You can call me Sammie. Don't need all the formalities.
DOCTOR: Right, Sammie. Heat intolerance. It’s been a rough summer, hasn’t it?
PATIENT: Rough is an understatement. It’s… unnatural. I’ve lived a good long life, worked outside my whole time, and I’ve never felt this weak in the heat. It's not just sweating, you know? It's like my body just... shuts down. Makes a fella feel useless.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds really concerning, especially if it's a new change for you. When did you start noticing this… shutting down feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started properly last summer, I reckon. Though, I thought it was just a bad season, getting old, that sort of thing. This year, it’s worse. Much worse. I was painting Mrs. Henderson’s fence in July – good job, good money – and I nearly collapsed. Had to sit down for a good hour, just to get my strength back. Didn’t tell her, naturally. Don’t want people thinking I’m falling apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been progressively worsening over the past year, and it significantly impacted you in July. You mentioned nearly collapsing while painting. Did you experience any other symptoms at that time, besides feeling weak?
PATIENT: Weakness, yeah, that was the main thing. And dizzy, terribly dizzy. Like the world was spinning. And a headache, a throbbing one right behind my eyes. Didn't feel sick to my stomach, though. Just… drained. Like all the life had been sucked right out of me. It's a strange feeling, hard to explain. Not like a normal tiredness, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, dizziness and a throbbing headache alongside the weakness. And you said it felt different than usual tiredness. Have you noticed any of these symptoms – weakness, dizziness, headache – on days when it isn't particularly hot?
PATIENT: Not really. If it’s a cool day, I feel alright. Bit stiff in the mornings, like anyone my age, but nothing like this. It’s the heat, definitely the heat. Makes me wonder if it’s something in the air, or the sun itself being stronger these days. I mean, everything’s different now, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know it’s specifically linked to the heat. Alright, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not much, thankfully. Bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a little pill for it every day. That’s it, really. I’ve always been a strong fella, worked hard my whole life. Never been one for sitting around and complaining. And I don't go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension managed with medication. That's good to know. Do you remember the name of the medication you're taking?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a little white pill. Small one. Ugh, I hate remembering names. Doctor gives me refills every few months. I think… amlodipine? Is that right? Something like that. It starts with an 'A', I’m pretty sure. I just tell the pharmacist what I need, they sort it out.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes. That matches what we have here. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I’m aware of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, climbed every mountain, and breathed in all sorts of dust. Never had a reaction to anything. I’m a pretty tough customer, honestly.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Alright, let’s move on to your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – has had any health problems, particularly related to heat sensitivity, heart issues, or problems with blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, my father, he was a strong man, worked in the fields all his life. He had a bad heart later on, had to slow down. Didn't die from it, just got old and weak. My mother, she was always healthy, but she worried a lot. Never really talked about any illnesses, to be honest. I don't really keep track of those things. Family's scattered all over Nepal now, hard to keep up.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with heart issues later in life. That's helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that even mean? I live alone, if that's what you're asking. Never married, always been too busy working. I have a few friends, mostly other Nepalese fellas who work in construction. We meet for tea sometimes, talk about work, that sort of thing. Not much excitement in my life, to be honest. Just try to get by.
DOCTOR: Right, living alone, socialising with friends. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. Smokes? No. Waste of money, and bad for your lungs. Recreational drugs? Don't even know what you're talking about. I work hard, I eat good food, and I get enough sleep. That's all I need. Honestly, doctor, I think you're asking a lot of unnecessary questions. I just want to know why I can't handle the heat anymore.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, and I apologize if it feels like a lot of questions. It’s just important for me to get a complete picture. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Just to see if anything is obviously off. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don't go poking around too much. I'm a practical man, I don’t have time for fancy tests. Blood pressure's probably a bit high, I already know that. But I manage it, don’t I?
DOCTOR: Of course. Just a quick check. Please sit up and I'll take your blood pressure first. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, as you suspected. Pulse is 78, regular. Lungs are clear, heart sounds are normal, though slightly strong. No murmurs or extra sounds detected. Thyroid feels normal. Any swelling anywhere?
PATIENT: Swelling? No, nothing like that. I told you, I'm a practical man. I notice things. I've never been one to ignore pain or swelling. And honestly, doctor, I'm starting to feel a bit silly sitting here being poked and prodded. Is this going to tell you anything useful, or are we just wasting time? I need to get back to work, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Sammie. Your exam hasn’t revealed anything immediately concerning, but the elevated blood pressure combined with your symptoms of heat intolerance, dizziness, and headache does warrant further investigation. It could be a number of things – dehydration, medication side effects, or something more serious like early signs of heat stroke or a cardiovascular issue. I think it would be prudent to run some blood tests to check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Ugh. Fine. But I want a clear explanation of why you're doing them, and what you're looking for. Don't just tell me it's 'to rule things out'. I want specifics. And I expect a quick turnaround, I don't have all day to sit around waiting for results. And if it’s just going to be a waste of my time and money, I'm not paying for it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. We'll check your complete blood count to see if there's any sign of infection or anemia. We’ll also check your electrolytes – sodium, potassium, and chloride – to see if you're properly hydrated and if there are any imbalances. We'll check your kidney function, as kidney problems can affect your body's ability to regulate temperature. And we will check your thyroid levels, to rule out any thyroid issues. We will also do a basic metabolic panel, to assess your blood sugar and overall metabolic health. These tests should give us a better understanding of what's going on. I’ll order them now, and the results should be back within 24-48 hours. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it done. But I’m warning you, if these tests come back normal, I’m not coming back. I have work to do, and I don't have time for pointless doctor visits. And make sure your nurse knows I don't like needles, so be gentle.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Sammie. I'll make a note about your dislike of needles and ensure the nurse is extra gentle. We'll do our best to get you answers quickly and efficiently. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I will also send you a message with instructions on how to access the lab results online, as well as my contact information should you have any questions. Thank you for your patience, Sammie. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: .
