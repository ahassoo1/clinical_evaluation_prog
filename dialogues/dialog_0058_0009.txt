DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my sight. It’s just not what it used to be. I suppose I should have come sooner, but honestly, I didn't think much of it at first. Just assumed it was age. One gets older, things…dim, you know? But it’s becoming rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Right. "Things dim," yes. A common sentiment. Inconvenient how?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s simple things. Reading, for one. Used to be able to sit and enjoy a good book, now… I have to hold it practically under my nose. And driving at night has become… precarious, to say the least. The glare from other vehicles is quite bothersome. It’s unsettling, really. I wouldn’t want to risk… well, you understand. It’s not something I take lightly.
DOCTOR: Precarious, you say. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… the reading started maybe six months ago, I’d say. Subtly, at first. The night driving, though, that's gotten considerably worse in the last two or three months. It used to be just a bit of a bother, now it’s… frankly, a bit frightening. It’s difficult to judge distances, and the halos around the lights… it’s quite distracting. I really don't appreciate being distracted, Doctor. It's unprofessional.
DOCTOR: Unprofessional?
PATIENT: Well, yes. I maintain a certain standard, you see. I work in Human Resources. Accuracy is paramount. One can’t be properly… discerning if one is squinting to read employee files, can one? It reflects poorly on the entire department, really. And frankly, I’ve always prided myself on my attention to detail. It’s a valuable asset. Though, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to maintain that asset, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Accuracy is important. So, let’s get a better picture of this. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me see… not that I’ve noticed, particularly. Everything seems… blurry, naturally. But beyond that… no floaters, no flashes of light, no pain, thankfully. Just the general dimness and the halos. And, honestly, a bit of a headache if I strain my eyes for too long. Though I attribute that to the constant effort, really. It's quite draining, Doctor. One shouldn’t have to strain to see. It seems rather… inefficient.
DOCTOR: Inefficient, yes. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? No, not to my knowledge. I’ve always been rather… careful with my diet. Mostly lean proteins and vegetables. I’ve never bothered with sugary things; far too…common. As for diabetes… absolutely not. That’s a rather… messy condition, isn’t it? I wouldn't wish that on anyone. No, Doctor, I’m quite certain I haven’t been diagnosed with either of those. I assure you. I keep myself… regulated.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of vision problems?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had cataracts, I believe. Though she lived to be quite old, so I never considered it a particular… concern. She mostly just… squinted a lot. And my uncle, I think, wore glasses. But beyond that… not that I recall. The Cherokee aren’t generally prone to… fragility, if you understand me. We’re a hardy people. It's mostly just… practical matters, you see. Not a lot of time spent worrying about one’s eyesight. More important things to attend to.
DOCTOR: “Not prone to fragility.” Right. Are you currently taking any medications, or have any allergies?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. I pride myself on maintaining my health naturally. And allergies… well, I dislike pollen, naturally. Who doesn’t? But nothing severe, nothing that requires…intervention. Just a bit of a sniffle in the spring, really. Nothing to write home about. I assure you, I'm a rather... robust individual. I don't need medication. It complicates things, you see. One should be able to rely on one's own… constitution.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s do a quick exam, then. Just to get a baseline. Can you follow my finger?
PATIENT: Very well. Lead on, Doctor. Though I must say, I'm rather particular about bright lights. I find them…distracting. Hopefully, this won’t be an arduous process. I have a rather important meeting this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want to arrive…discomposed. Proceed when you’re ready. And please, try to be efficient.
DOCTOR: Just look straight ahead. I need to examine your retinas. Try to relax. Hmm. Some mild drusen, but nothing alarming at this point. Similar findings in the left eye. Visual acuity is approximately 20/30 in both eyes without correction. And… yes, as you mentioned, some noticeable halos around the light source. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, but slightly sluggish.
PATIENT: Sluggish? That doesn’t sound… favorable, does it? I assure you, Doctor, my reflexes are perfectly adequate. Perhaps the light is simply too bright. It’s making everything… hazy. Are you certain your equipment is functioning correctly? I wouldn't want a faulty diagnosis based on… unreliable instrumentation. I trust you maintain a high standard of care, naturally. It’s rather important, you see. One relies on professionals for accurate assessments. Not… guesswork.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, the sluggish pupils are a minor observation, but we shouldn’t dismiss it entirely. It could be nothing, or it could indicate early signs of…something. Given your age and the gradual onset of these symptoms, it’s likely age-related macular degeneration, or cataracts. The halos are consistent with both. However, without further testing, I can’t give you a definitive diagnosis. I'm going to order some visual field testing and a retinal scan. That will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any insurance?
PATIENT: Insurance? No, Doctor. I do not. It’s… rather complicated. A long story, best left untold. Suffice it to say, I manage. I’ve always been… self-reliant. What sort of expense are we talking about, exactly? I need to be mindful of my… resources. I’m quite capable of handling things myself, naturally. But I prefer to be prepared. A precise figure would be…appreciated. And, honestly, I'm not particularly fond of surprises. One expects a certain level of…transparency.
DOCTOR: Without insurance, the visual field testing will be approximately $150, and the retinal scan, another $200. Those are cash prices. I can write you a referral to the specialist in Fayetteville, Dr. Elkins. He has a slightly better rate, but you’ll still be responsible for the full cost upfront. Honestly, without some kind of financial assistance, you’re looking at a significant expense. I can also recommend some over-the-counter lubricating eye drops for the dryness, but that will only provide temporary relief. It won’t address the underlying issue. Do you want me to proceed with the referral, or would you prefer to consider other options?
PATIENT: $350? That is… rather exorbitant, isn’t it? For simply seeing? I find that…unconscionable, frankly. Lubricating eye drops, while appreciated, are hardly a solution. I am not interested in temporary measures. Very well. Proceed with the referral to Dr. Elkins. But please, include a detailed explanation of my situation, and perhaps… a gentle suggestion that a reduced rate might be… advantageous. I wouldn’t want to appear…indigent, naturally. Just a discreet inquiry. And, honestly, a bit of compassion wouldn’t go amiss. I assure you, I’m a perfectly responsible individual. I simply… prefer to be prepared. And I expect a certain level of… respect. Here is my name, just in case you need it again: Delano Alcorta. A-L-C-O-R-T-A.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Here’s the referral to Dr. Elkins. I've included a note regarding your… financial constraints. However, I can’t guarantee he’ll be able to offer a reduced rate. It’s entirely at his discretion. I’ll also give you a sample of lubricating eye drops to tide you over until your appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden vision loss, severe eye pain, or flashes of light, go to the emergency room immediately. Don't hesitate. Do you have any further questions for me?
PATIENT: Flashes of light? Emergency room? Heavens, no. I am perfectly capable of discerning a genuine emergency. And I sincerely hope I won't need to visit such a… chaotic environment. No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Though I must say, I am somewhat…disappointed with the lack of concrete solutions. But I suppose one must be…realistic. Thank you for your time. And do convey my… gratitude to Dr. Elkins, should he prove amenable to a… reasonable arrangement.
