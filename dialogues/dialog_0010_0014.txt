DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Good morning. Hmm... let me see. My wife, she told me to come in. Something about papers… for work? I think it has to do with… taking some time off. I’m a little hazy on the details, to be honest. She handles most of that sort of thing. It's about the church, mostly. Religious activities, you know? And a bit of teaching.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you're here for a medical leave of absence form, likely related to your work with the church and teaching. We can certainly get that sorted out. Before we complete the form, though, I’d like to get a better understanding of your overall health. Just to make sure everything is in order. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, that’s fine. Perfectly fine. I… I think I’m alright, for an old man. My knees ache a bit, especially when it rains. And I forget things, like… like what I was just going to say! My wife says it’s just my age, but… I don’t know. Overall… I get by. Is this form… a long one?
DOCTOR: It’s not terribly long, Mr. Limtiaco. We'll just go through some standard questions. The knee pain is good to know – we can address that. And forgetfulness… well, a little bit of that is common as we age, but we should explore it a bit further just to be sure. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure… the doctor did mention something about that a while back. He put me on a little pill, I think. A white one. I take it every morning, with my coffee. Other than that… I don’t really know. I don’t go to the doctor much, unless something’s really bothering me. My wife keeps track of all that, usually. She’s got a whole binder full of papers, I think. Diabetes… I don’t think so. My blood sugar… no, can’t recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you’re currently taking medication for high blood pressure. That’s good to know. Do you recall the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, no I don’t. It’s a little white pill, like I said. Small one. I just… take it. My wife fills the prescription, and I take it. She’d know the name, for sure. I’m terrible with names, and numbers, and… well, everything these days! Is it important to know the name?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know, Mr. Limtiaco, so we have a complete record. Don't worry about it right now, we can look it up later. We'll need to verify it with your pharmacy. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Surgeries… oh! When I was a boy, I had my tonsils taken out. A long time ago. And… I think I was in the hospital once, when I broke my arm, playing football with the kids at the church. But that was… oh, goodness, sixty years ago? Maybe more. Nothing recent, though. Definitely nothing recent.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, and a broken arm a long time ago. Good to know. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a tricky one. My mother… she lived a long life, but I can’t remember what she died of. Something with her heart, maybe? My father was strong as an ox, but he passed away quite suddenly. I think it was a stroke… or maybe a heart attack? It was a long time ago, and I was quite young. My brother… he’s still alive, thankfully. He has some trouble with his joints, I think. Arthritis, maybe? It's all a bit fuzzy, Doctor. We didn’t talk about these things much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history in detail. We’ll make a note of the potential heart issues and arthritis. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh no, never! I never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she wouldn’t allow it! She’s very health-conscious, you see. Always making me eat my vegetables. And drink plenty of water. Good woman, that wife of mine. She always looked after me.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mr. Limtiaco. Good for you both. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit, now and then. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. On special occasions. My wife enjoys a glass as well. Nothing excessive, I assure you. We're not big drinkers. Mostly just on Sundays, with church friends. A little bit of fellowship.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional wine on Sundays. That’s good to know. Now, before we finish up, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... allergies. Let me think. I think I had a bit of a rash once, after eating shellfish. A long time ago. But I can’t be certain. Maybe it was just something I ate. I don't really recall any serious allergies, though. Nothing that required a trip to the hospital, at least. My wife would know for sure. She keeps a list of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible shellfish allergy. We’ll note that as well. Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, that gives me a good overview. Just to confirm, you're here for a medical leave of absence form, and you've told me about high blood pressure medication, a possible shellfish allergy, and some family history of heart issues. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline reading. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh yes, yes that's fine. A physical exam... alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. My wife always said I needed to go to the doctor more often. I just... don't like being poked and prodded. But if you think it's necessary... I trust your judgement. Just be gentle, alright? My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I’ll just listen to your lungs and heart, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Careful now... that arm isn’t as strong as it used to be either. My wife always said I was getting old… she was right, of course. She’s always right.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148 over 92. It's not alarmingly high, but it's something we should monitor. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. It's not a cause for immediate concern, but it's worth noting. Your lungs are clear. Ears look fine, and your throat is clear as well. Now, can you stand up and let me check your knees?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. These old knees… they’re not what they used to be. She always said I should get them replaced. But I don’t like the idea of surgery. Too risky, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance towards surgery, Mr. Limtiaco. There's no swelling or redness, but there is some crepitus, which is common with age. I can feel some tenderness when I bend them. Does that cause you pain?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes… a little bit. Right here… It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. It's worse when it rains, you know? My wife says it's the humidity. She's probably right. Everything aches when it rains.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some discomfort with bending, and exacerbated by the weather. Okay, Mr. Limtiaco, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and the exam, you have a history of high blood pressure, possible shellfish allergy, some family history of heart issues, and some knee pain likely related to age and weather. Before we complete the medical leave form, I want to be thorough. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting spells recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… no, no chest pain or anything like that. A little dizzy sometimes, when I stand up too quickly. But that happens to old people, doesn't it? And no shortness of breath, thankfully. I still walk to church every Sunday, you know. Can’t miss service. No, nothing like that. Just the knees, mostly. And the forgetting things… but that’s just old age, right?
DOCTOR: Alright, no chest pain or shortness of breath, occasional dizziness. The occasional forgetfulness is something we’ll make note of. Now, concerning your memory, has it been getting worse lately, or is it just a gradual thing?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. It’s hard to say, really. My wife has been reminding me of things more often lately, that’s for sure. Things like appointments, or what I had for lunch. Little things, mostly. It’s not like I’m wandering around lost or anything. But I do… misplace things sometimes. And I struggle to remember names. Especially names. I just… can’t seem to hold onto them. She says it’s worrying, but I think she just worries too much. She's a good woman, but… she worries.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that your wife is attentive. Memory issues can be complex, and it's always best to be proactive. We can discuss some simple memory exercises and strategies later, if you'd like. Now, before we complete the form, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions…? Hmm… not really, I suppose. Just… will this form help me get the time off? I want to be there for the church, you know. They’re counting on me. My wife says I need to take care of myself, and that’s what I’m trying to do. Will this form help with that? And… will it be a long process? I don’t want to be a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Limtiaco, this form will help you get the time off you need. It outlines your current medical conditions and any limitations you might have. It's standard procedure, and it's not a burden at all. It’s my job to help you manage your health so you can continue to be there for the church. The process shouldn’t be too long. Your employer’s HR department may need to verify some information, but typically it’s straightforward. We'll submit it today, and they’ll likely be in touch. Here’s the completed form. It includes your high blood pressure, potential shellfish allergy, knee pain, and notes about your occasional forgetfulness. I’ve also recommended follow-up with a specialist for a more comprehensive evaluation of your memory, just to be safe. And I’ve added a note recommending you discuss the possibility of physical therapy for your knees. Do you have any objections to these recommendations?
PATIENT: Oh… no, no objections. If you think it's best, then that's fine with me. The specialist… well, I don't like going to doctors, but I trust your judgement. And physical therapy… maybe that will help these old knees. My wife will be pleased, she's always saying I need to be more active. So, this form… it's all set then? Can I take it with me?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Limtiaco, the form is all set. Here you go. You can take this to your employer’s HR department. I’m also going to send a copy to your pharmacy to verify your blood pressure medication. And I’ll give you a referral for a neurologist for the memory evaluation, and a list of physical therapy clinics in the area. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… that’s wonderful, Doctor. Thank you. No, I think that’s all. You’ve been very helpful. My wife will be so relieved. She worries about everything, you know. I think… I think I’ll be going now. Thank you again, Doctor. And thank you for being so patient with an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. And please, encourage your wife to take care of herself as well. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And Doctor…? Thank you again. You've put my mind at ease.
