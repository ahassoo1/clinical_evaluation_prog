DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I wish I didn’t have to be here. It's… rather obvious, isn't it? I can’t hear out of one ear, and half my face feels like it’s going to fall off. Is that detailed enough for you? It started yesterday morning.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your…directness, Ms. Nissenbaum, a medical evaluation requires more than just a summary of symptoms. “Half your face feeling like it’s going to fall off” is not a clinical finding. It’s rather alarming language, and doesn't provide me with useful information. Let’s start with the hearing loss. Was this sudden, or did it develop gradually?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t patronize me, Doctor. I’m a radiologist, I understand precision. It was sudden. Woke up yesterday, and…nothing. Just silence on the right side. No warning, no ringing, no…anything. Perfectly fine one moment, completely deaf the next. Is that precise enough for your liking? Honestly, I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying. Sudden onset hearing loss is certainly concerning, and we need to investigate that thoroughly. And you mentioned facial… discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort is… a gross understatement. It's weakness, Doctor. My whole right side feels… droopy. Like when you’ve had a stroke, but, thankfully, not as severe. I can feel it, it's not just some imagined sensation. And yes, it started around the same time as the hearing loss. Yesterday morning. Are we going to get to doing something, or are you just going to keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: We are getting to doing something, Ms. Nissenbaum. A thorough history is part of that process. Now, to be clear, you’re describing weakness on the right side of your face?
PATIENT: Yes, right side! Honestly, do I have to draw you a diagram? The right side. The same side that I can't hear out of. It’s… frustrating, this lack of efficiency. I have appointments, you know. And it’s not just my face, it feels… numb, a little. Although, that might just be from not being able to feel it properly because of the weakness. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Nissenbaum. That is helpful. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think... No fever. No headache. No dizziness. Taste seems okay, though I haven’t exactly been enjoying my meals. And no, nothing else that I can recall. Really, it’s just the hearing and the face. A perfectly good morning ruined. Honestly, I've never had anything like this before. And frankly, I don't have time for mysterious ailments.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, based on your description of sudden hearing loss and facial weakness, this could indicate Bell’s Palsy. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, as those symptoms can also be indicative of more serious conditions. I’m going to conduct a brief neurological examination. This will involve testing your facial muscle strength, reflexes, and sensation. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Bell’s Palsy? Never heard of it. Sounds… unpleasant. And what "other possibilities" are you implying? Look, I'm a perfectly healthy woman, aside from this…this situation. I suppose I have no choice but to let you poke and prod, if that’s what it takes to get this sorted. Just… try not to take all day, please. And explain what you’re doing as you go. I don’t appreciate surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Bell’s Palsy is a condition caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, which can lead to weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. It's usually temporary, but we need to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, such as stroke or a tumor. I will begin by testing your facial muscle strength. Please close your eyes tightly. I'm going to gently try to open your eyelids. Don't resist. This will assess the function of the nerve that controls eye closure.
PATIENT: It’s… harder than usual, I suppose. It feels… resistant. Like my eyelid doesn’t want to cooperate. Honestly, it feels quite unnatural. Just hurry up, please. This is rather uncomfortable. And do be gentle; I have important meetings.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I would like you to raise your eyebrows as high as you can. Please try your best.
PATIENT: It feels… uneven. My left eyebrow goes up fine, but the right one… barely moves. It’s like it’s… stuck. Honestly, this is rather alarming. Is this… normal?
DOCTOR: It is not unexpected, given your reported symptoms, Ms. Nissenbaum. Now, please show me your teeth by smiling broadly.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is humiliating. It looks… dreadful. My whole face is crooked! It's as if one side is paralyzed. Is this… what Bell's Palsy looks like? It’s… rather frightening.
DOCTOR: Now, please puff out your cheeks with air, like you’re blowing out a candle.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is ridiculous! It's like… one side doesn’t work at all. It's completely asymmetrical. The air is just… escaping. This is… very concerning. Is this definitely Bell’s Palsy? What do we do now?
DOCTOR: Based on the neurological examination – the weakness in your eyelid closure, the asymmetry in raising your eyebrows and smiling, and the difficulty inflating your right cheek – the findings are highly suggestive of Bell’s Palsy. However, to rule out other possibilities – specifically, a stroke – I would like to order a blood test and, ideally, an MRI of your brain. The blood test will help us identify any underlying inflammatory conditions. The MRI will give us a more detailed view of your brain and ensure there is no structural cause for your symptoms. Would you be amenable to those tests?
PATIENT: Honestly, more tests? It’s always more tests. I have appointments, you know. And an MRI… that takes time, doesn't it? And probably isn’t cheap. But… I suppose if you say it’s necessary to rule out something… serious, then fine. Do what you have to do. But please, try to expedite things. I don’t have all day. And will these tests… tell me when I can expect to get my face back?
DOCTOR: Very well. I will order the blood work immediately, and schedule you for an MRI as soon as possible. I'll have my assistant contact you with the details. Regarding your recovery, Ms. Nissenbaum, the prognosis for Bell’s Palsy is generally good. Most patients experience significant improvement within weeks to months. However, the exact timeline varies. We will discuss treatment options—typically, a course of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation—once we have the results of the tests. In the meantime, I will also recommend eye drops to keep your right eye moist, as you may not be able to blink normally. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Eye drops? Corticosteroids? This sounds… unpleasant. And what if it doesn't get better? What if I’m stuck like this forever? Honestly, that’s what I’m really worried about. It’s… distressing, to think about. And is there anything I can do? Besides taking your pills and using your drops? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, while it is true that complete recovery is not guaranteed, the vast majority of patients experience significant improvement. Permanent facial paralysis is relatively rare. Regarding what you can do, there are a few supportive measures. Gently massaging the affected muscles can help maintain blood flow and prevent muscle atrophy. Applying a warm compress to the affected side may also provide some relief. However, it's crucial not to overdo it, as excessive stimulation can sometimes worsen the symptoms. I will provide you with a written information sheet detailing these measures and outlining the potential side effects of the medication. It's essential to follow the treatment plan closely and report any concerns to my office promptly. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Massaging, warm compress, medication... and report any problems. Honestly, it's… a lot to take in. And what about work? I have important meetings, presentations… I can't exactly go around looking like this. Is there any… official documentation I can get? Something to explain my… condition?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Nissenbaum. I can certainly provide you with a doctor's note outlining your diagnosis and any necessary restrictions. I will also include a brief explanation of the condition for your workplace. I can also discuss a temporary disability leave if necessary, although that would require further evaluation and documentation. Is that something you’d like to explore at this time?
PATIENT: Honestly, a temporary disability leave might be necessary. I can’t exactly present to a board looking like this. It would be… unprofessional. But I'd prefer to hold off on that for now. Let’s see how things progress after the tests. And the doctor’s note… yes, please. That would be very helpful. Is there anything else I need to know? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. My assistant will contact you to schedule the blood work and MRI, and to provide you with the doctor’s note and information sheet. Please follow the instructions carefully and contact my office immediately if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as severe pain, vision changes, or difficulty speaking. I will review the test results as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss the next steps. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you… I suppose. Honestly, I hope these tests are conclusive. I have a lot on my plate, and this is… incredibly inconvenient. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Nissenbaum. I wish you all the best, and please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. .
