DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… it’s my liver, I believe. Or something with my liver. A bit yellow, you see. Not feeling quite right, and they said I should come in. Honestly, I don’t recall all the details… it was a friend who brought me. A very kind friend. Is that… is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, Annelle, that's a good start. It sounds like you're experiencing some yellowing, and not feeling well. You mentioned a friend brought you in – that’s helpful to know. It is okay if you don’t recall everything. We’ll take it slow. Just to clarify, when you say “yellow,” are you referring to your skin, or the whites of your eyes, or both?
PATIENT: Oh dear… both, I think. Yes, both are… a bit off. I’ve noticed it mostly in the mornings, I suppose. It’s… hard to say exactly when it started. Everything feels a bit… blurry. I do apologize. Is this… is this serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowing of both your skin and the whites of your eyes… that’s what we call jaundice. And it can indicate a number of things, so it’s good you came in to get it checked out. It's alright that things feel blurry; we’ll try to figure it out together. To get a better picture, can you tell me if you've had any other symptoms alongside the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh, symptoms… Yes. Well, I’ve been rather tired, you see. Very tired. And… a bit of an ache. Just a general ache, all over. And my appetite… it's not what it used to be. Everything tastes… flat. I don't know if that makes sense. I keep forgetting things, too. But that's nothing new, I suppose. Is this… is this about the hepatitis? I vaguely remember something about that…
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, a general ache, loss of appetite, and food tasting flat… that all gives me some more information. And the memory issues, you're right, it's helpful to know if this is a new development or something you’ve experienced before. You mentioned hepatitis… that’s a possibility, yes. Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver. But jaundice and those other symptoms can have other causes, too. To help narrow things down, have you had any recent changes in your medications?
PATIENT: Medications… oh dear. That’s… difficult. I don’t really take medications, not regularly. Just… a bit of something for my knees, sometimes. But that's been on and off for years. I haven't changed anything recently, I don’t believe. I really don't keep track of these things. My friend usually handles that. Is this… will I need tests? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, so very minimal medication use, and nothing new recently. That’s good to know. Yes, Annelle, to figure out what's going on, we will need some blood tests. I understand you don't like needles, and we can talk about ways to make it as comfortable as possible. It’s a standard part of investigating these kinds of symptoms. The tests will help us see how your liver is functioning and look for any signs of infection or other problems. Before we order those tests, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, my… medical history. That’s… a long time ago. I believe I had… pneumonia, once. A very bad bout of it. And… something with my gallbladder, many years ago. They removed it, I think. But honestly, Doctor, it was so long ago, I can barely recall the details. I’ve always been… fairly healthy, otherwise. Or at least, I thought I was. Will these tests… will they take long? I have a hair appointment later this afternoon. It’s very important.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia and gallbladder removal in the past. That’s helpful. And it's good you've generally been healthy otherwise. We'll focus on getting the information we need. The blood tests themselves shouldn't take long – maybe 15-20 minutes. The results will take a bit longer – usually a few days for the lab to process them. We should have them back by the start of next week. As for your hair appointment, we'll keep that in mind and try to get this done as quickly as possible. Now, before we proceed with the tests, could you tell me about any family history of liver problems, or any other significant illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s… difficult. My family… they were mostly from… well, from a different country. It’s hard to remember. I believe my mother had… something with her stomach, perhaps? But I don't know the details. And my brother… he had a heart condition, I think. But that was a long time ago. I really don't recall any specific liver problems, no. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not much help, am I? I apologize for being so… vague. I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Annelle, you're not being unhelpful at all. It's perfectly normal to have difficulty remembering details, especially over time. You've given me some useful information, and we'll work with what we have. Okay, so some history of stomach issues in your mother and a heart condition in your brother. Now, just a couple more questions. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh. Alcohol. No, not really. I… I used to, perhaps, when I was younger. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally. But not anymore. Not for many, many years. I don’t care for it, to be honest. It doesn’t agree with me. Is that… is that important, Doctor? I just want to know if this is serious. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Annelle. That helps us rule things out. It is important, yes, because alcohol can affect the liver. Now, one last thing. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. Let me think. I don't believe so, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. Perhaps a little bit of a rash once, from some lotion or something, but nothing serious. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Honestly, Doctor, can we just get the tests done? I'm feeling a bit… overwhelmed. I really need to get to that hair appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Annelle. No known allergies. I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed, and we will get these tests done as quickly as possible. Okay, I’m going to order some blood tests to check your liver function, look for any signs of infection, and rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. I'll also order a complete blood count to get a general overview of your health. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw the samples. They are very good at what they do, and we can make it as comfortable as possible. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I… I don't think so. Just… just get it over with quickly, please. And… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I really do. Is it going to hurt very much?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Annelle. I'll be right here if you need anything. As for the pain, it will be a quick pinch – most people describe it as a very brief discomfort. It's over before you know it. The phlebotomist will use a small needle, and they're very skilled at minimizing any discomfort. Just take a few deep breaths, and try to relax. They should be here any moment now. We'll get through this together. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable while you wait?
PATIENT: No… no, thank you. I think I’m alright. Just… just a little nervous, I suppose. I really do hate needles. But… if it helps, then I suppose I can manage. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. .
DOCTOR: You're very brave, Annelle. And you're not alone in disliking needles. It's perfectly normal. Just try to focus on your breathing, and remember that it will be over quickly. I’ll be here to discuss the results with you as soon as they become available. We’ll take it one step at a time.
