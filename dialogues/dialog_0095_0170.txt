DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I'm Dr. Vanochten. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for a life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, you know? Gotta get a medical exam done. Hope it doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A life insurance physical. We can certainly get that done for you. I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with a little bit of information about your overall health. Do you have any current medical problems or conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn't? Nothing the doctor’s ever really worried about, if that makes sense. I've got Medicare, so they check me up every now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. Not recently. A long time ago, when I was a kid, I broke my arm, but that was… ages ago. Nothing since then, I don't think. Honestly, I don't remember much about it. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries at all, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, not that I can recall. Never really needed anything taken out or put in, thankfully. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. You know, I try to stay healthy. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Uh... that's a tough one. My family... it's complicated. My mom had some trouble with her blood sugar, I think. And my dad... well, he didn't take very good care of himself. But honestly, I don't know a lot of the details. It's not something we talked about much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Putney. Family medical history can be tricky. Okay, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. Never smoked a day in my life. Maybe a beer now and then with dinner, but that’s about it. And I stay far away from anything else. I try to keep things pretty clean, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I'm aware of. I can eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m pretty easygoing that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little something for my knees sometimes, when they act up. But it's just… ibuprofen, I think. Something like that. Nothing regular, if that makes sense. Just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just to confirm, ibuprofen only as needed for your knees?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. When they bother me. Maybe a couple times a month, if that. Nothing serious. I try to just walk it off usually.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, that gives me a good start. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I got some things I gotta get back to.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. … 142 over 90. A little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Now let’s just check your weight and height. You said you were around 5’10”?
PATIENT: Yeah, around that. 5’10”, 5’11” somewhere in there. I haven’t really measured it in a while. What’s the number? Is it bad? I just wanna know if I gotta worry about something.
DOCTOR: Okay, it’s 174 centimeters, which is about 5’8”, and your weight is 97 kilograms – that’s around 214 pounds. Your BMI is 34.3, which puts you in the obese category. We should discuss this further. It can contribute to several health issues. Before we do that though, let's check your reflexes and abdomen.
PATIENT: Ugh, obese? Great. Look, doc, I'm a big guy, okay? Always have been. But I feel fine. Is this gonna affect my life insurance? That’s all I really care about right now. Can we just skip the reflexes and get this over with? I'm getting a little anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Putney. I'm not trying to cause you anxiety, but it’s important to be aware of these things. The life insurance company will likely want this information as well. Okay, we can skip the reflexes for now, but I do want to quickly palpate your abdomen. Just lie flat on your back and relax. It’s just a quick check to make sure everything feels normal. Any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just a little… full, maybe? I ate lunch a couple hours ago. But no pain or anything. Seriously, doc, I'm okay. I just wanna know if I pass the test. Can we get to that part now? Are you gonna take blood or something? I just… I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. I understand you're anxious to get this over with. Yes, we will need to take a blood sample for the life insurance company. It’s standard procedure. We’ll check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and some other basic levels. It’ll give them a more complete picture of your health. If you could just sit in this chair, please. We'll get this done quickly. I’m going to tie this around your arm now. It might feel a little tight.
PATIENT: Fine, just hurry up. This is taking forever. And please don’t poke me too much. I hate needles. I'm really not a fan of this whole process, you know? Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your arm… I know it’s not pleasant, but it’ll be quick. Okay, here we go… Almost done… just a little pinch… Okay, all done. You'll need to keep this bandage on for at least 15-20 minutes. Now, the results will take a few days to come back. We’ll discuss them when they do. In the meantime, I strongly recommend we talk about your weight. I can provide you with some resources to help you manage it. It would significantly improve your overall health. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Look, let's just skip the lecture, okay? I appreciate it, but I'm good. I'll worry about my weight later. Just… tell me when the results are in. Can I go now? I really gotta get going. I’m sure the insurance company will tell me if they need anything else. Thanks for your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. The results will be sent to the insurance company directly, and they will contact you if anything further is needed. I have documented everything we discussed today. Here’s my card if you change your mind about discussing weight management. You have a good day. .
