DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Cannington. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my foot. It’s been bothering me something fierce. A sore, you see. A nasty one. And frankly, I don’t understand why it won’t just heal. I take care of myself, you know. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mrs. Cannington. It’s frustrating when something doesn’t heal as it should, especially when you are taking care of yourself. Let's talk about this sore on your foot. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it must be… oh, at least three months now. Maybe four. Time just slips away, doesn't it? It started small, really. Just a little red spot. I thought it was probably a bug bite at first. But then it just… got worse. And worse. And now it’s… well, it’s quite the hole, actually. I’ve tried putting ointment on it, the kind my daughter brings me. But nothing seems to help. Honestly, I expect more from modern medicine than ointment.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mrs. Cannington. Three or four months is a significant amount of time for a sore to persist. And it's good you’ve been trying to address it. Could you describe the sore to me a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… roundish, I suppose. Not a pretty sight, let me tell you. A lot of redness around the edges. And it's deep. Deeper than it looks, I think. It weeps sometimes. A bit of pus, maybe. Though I try to keep it clean. It smells a little, if I’m being honest. And it hurts! Especially when I try to walk. Though I mostly stay off of it now. I have to, really. It’s just… unpleasant. And getting more so by the day. Are you going to look at it, Doctor? I don’t like showing people my feet.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mrs. Cannington. I’ll need to take a look at it to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I assure you, I've seen many feet, and I won’t be judging. It’s my job to help, and I can’t do that without examining it. Would you mind if I take a look now?
PATIENT: Fine. But don't stare. And be gentle. I have sensitive skin, you know. It’s not as though I’ve been walking barefoot in the jungle, Doctor. Some of us take care of ourselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Cannington. I see what you mean. It is quite deep, and there’s some surrounding inflammation. I also notice a bit of drainage. It’s good you're keeping it clean. I’m going to lightly palpate the area to check for warmth and assess the surrounding tissue. Just let me know if anything is particularly tender. Is that painful here?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, right there. That’s quite tender, Doctor. You’re poking at it rather hard, aren’t you? I told you I have sensitive skin! And don’t look so surprised. It hurts. Really. I’ve had a lot of aches and pains in my old age, you know. But this… this is a particularly nasty one. Are you going to do something about it, or just poke at it all day?
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mrs. Cannington. I didn't intend to cause you any discomfort. I was just trying to assess the extent of the inflammation, and I clearly misjudged the sensitivity. Based on what I’m seeing and feeling, it appears you may have a developing infection. It’s important to determine the extent of it. I’d like to order a culture of the wound to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. This will help us choose the most effective antibiotic. We'll also do a quick blood sugar check, just to rule out any underlying issues that could be contributing to the slow healing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An infection? That’s what I was afraid of. And blood sugar? Now, look here, Doctor, I don’t appreciate you implying… I do try to watch what I eat. Though my daughter brings me treats sometimes. But I’m not sick. Not really. Still, if you think it’s necessary… I suppose a little prick in the finger is better than losing my foot. Just don’t take too long. I have a luncheon appointment later. Though I doubt I'll be able to go now, with a possible infection and all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. Cannington. It’s not an implication that you are sick, but rather a precaution. Elevated blood sugar can sometimes hinder wound healing, so it's a simple test to rule that out. The finger prick will be quick, and we can get the results fairly quickly. I'll also clean and dress the wound for now, and we can discuss antibiotic options once we have the culture results. It's likely a course of oral antibiotics will be sufficient, but it's best to wait for the culture to ensure we're using the right medication. Do you have any allergies to medications, particularly antibiotics?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I don't think so. My daughter always asks me that question. She's a worrier, you see. But I don’t recall ever having a reaction to anything. Though that ointment she brings me… it smells funny. But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just a bad smell. I suppose it’s possible I was allergic to something years ago, but I can’t remember. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Just do whatever you think is best. And please, be gentle. This is all very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Cannington. We’ll proceed with caution, and I’ll document that you don’t recall any medication allergies. We can always start with a narrow-spectrum antibiotic and monitor for any reactions. I'm going to order the blood sugar test and the wound culture now. It will take a few minutes for the blood sugar results to come back. The culture will take a few days to process. In the meantime, I recommend keeping the wound clean and dry, and elevating your foot as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Elevate my foot? How am I supposed to do that? I can’t just lie in bed all day. And what if this ointment doesn't work? It’s quite expensive, you know. My daughter says it's all natural, but frankly, it smells like dirt. And what if I get sicker? What if I lose my foot? Honestly, Doctor, you're not very reassuring. It all sounds quite dreadful. Will this be covered by Medicare? I don’t want any nasty surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. Cannington, and I apologize if I haven't been as reassuring as I should be. It's natural to feel anxious when dealing with a potential infection. Let's address your questions one by one. Elevating your foot simply means keeping it higher than your heart whenever possible. You can do this by propping it up on pillows when you're sitting or lying down. It helps to reduce swelling and promote healing. You don’t need to lie in bed all day, just try to elevate it when you can. Regarding the ointment, we’ll focus on the antibiotic treatment for now. If the ointment isn’t helping, we won’t rely on it. As for getting sicker or losing your foot, those are unlikely scenarios if we address the infection promptly. That's why we’re doing the tests and starting treatment. We want to prevent any complications. And yes, absolutely, Medicare should cover the costs of the tests, treatment, and any necessary follow-up care. I’ll have the billing department verify everything for you. Let's focus on getting the results back and starting the right treatment. We’ll take it one step at a time. Is there anyone you'd like me to contact to help support you during this process?
PATIENT: Well… my daughter, Beatrice. She worries about me constantly. She’s the one who brought me the ointment, you see. And she’s always insisting I see a doctor. Perhaps you could call her and explain everything? She’ll want to know all the details. Every single detail. Her number is… … 555-1212. Beatrice Miller. Though be warned, she can be quite… thorough. And she has a lot of questions. Really, a lot. But she means well. She always means well. Perhaps she’ll feel better knowing a professional is involved.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Cannington. I’m happy to call Beatrice and explain everything in detail. It's good to have a support system, and I understand she's very involved in your care. I’ll make sure to answer all her questions as thoroughly as possible. The results for your blood sugar should be back any minute now. Once we have those, we’ll proceed with the wound culture. In the meantime, please let me know if you experience any increased pain, redness, swelling, or fever. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… please be gentle with my foot. And tell Beatrice I said hello. And that I'm fine. Mostly. Though don’t tell her about the infection just yet. She'll start fussing. Honestly, she's a good girl, Beatrice, but she can be a bit… much. I suppose I should just wait for the results. It's all very unsettling, you know. Waiting. It's the waiting that's the worst part.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Cannington. Waiting can be the hardest part, and I'll do my best to make sure we move through this process as efficiently as possible. I'll certainly let you know as soon as we have the results, and I'll keep Beatrice informed with your permission. And I promise to be gentle with your foot. I'll be right back with the findings. Please just relax, and try not to worry.
