DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. Well, it's… it's been my stomach, mostly. I just… I don't seem to be able to keep much down these days, and I get full awful fast. It's been going on for a little while now, I reckon. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. My memory… it ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when things aren't clear-cut, and memory can definitely play a role. No worries at all, we'll take our time. So, you've been experiencing difficulty keeping food down and feeling full quickly – that's helpful to know. Could you tell me a little more about when you started noticing this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. See, that’s the hard part. It feels like… after things got really bad with the treatments, maybe? I had… well, they said it was cancer. A while back now. I’ve been doing… some things to try and feel better since then, but this feeling… it just keeps coming back. It’s hard to pinpoint a date, I’m afraid. Everything feels a bit mixed up, you see? I used to be able to remember everything, but now… it slips away. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Raymonde. Dealing with cancer treatments can definitely cause a lot of confusion and memory issues, and it's perfectly normal to feel that way. It sounds like this stomach issue started sometime after your treatment ended. Just to be clear – and please correct me if I'm wrong – are you currently in treatment for cancer, or has your treatment been completed?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. Treatment is… it’s finished. Has been for a while. They said… well, they said it should be gone. But I still go for check-ups, you know, just to be safe. It’s just… this nausea and feeling full so fast started after all that. It’s been a few months, I think. Maybe longer. It's just hard to say for certain, dear. I keep meaning to write things down, but… well, you know how it is. It slips my mind before I can even get the pen.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. A few months is helpful. And it's very good that you're keeping up with your check-ups. Now, when you say you feel full quickly, about how much food are you usually able to eat before that happens?
PATIENT: Oh, not much at all, really. Just a few bites. A small bowl of soup, maybe. Or a couple of crackers. And then I feel like I’ve eaten a whole feast! It’s awful. It's not like I'm trying to eat a lot, you see. I just want to get something in my stomach, but it doesn't take much to make me feel stuffed. It's… uncomfortable. And then, sometimes, it just comes right back up. Not always, but often enough to make me not even want to try.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a very small amount of food is causing you to feel full and sometimes leading to nausea or vomiting. That’s important information. Besides the feeling of fullness and nausea, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I've been… tired. More tired than usual, even for an old woman like me. And… sometimes my stomach hurts. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. It seems to happen after I try to eat something, though. And… oh! I haven’t been as interested in things, either. Used to love tending my garden, but now… it just feels like too much effort. Is that… is that a symptom? I don’t know anymore, dear. Everything feels muddled.
DOCTOR: Those are all very important things to tell me, Raymonde. Fatigue, a dull ache in your stomach after eating, and a loss of interest in things – those could all be related. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That’s a… personal question, isn’t it? Well… they’ve been… different. Not regular, like they used to be. Sometimes I have trouble going at all, and sometimes… well, let’s just say it’s not solid. It’s been a bit worrying, to be honest. I haven’t said anything to anyone yet, though. Felt embarrassed, I suppose. But you’re the doctor, so I’m telling you. It’s just… not right.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Raymonde. It’s important information, and you shouldn’t feel embarrassed at all. Changes in bowel movements are definitely something we need to discuss. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides the cancer you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... Well, I used to have high blood pressure, but they put me on medicine for that years ago. It seems to be under control now, thankfully. And… I have arthritis in my hands and knees. That’s why I have trouble gardening sometimes, even when I want to. Other than that… I don’t think so. I’ve been pretty healthy for an old woman, all things considered. But the cancer… that’s been the biggest thing, of course. It threw everything off, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, which is currently controlled with medication, and arthritis in your hands and knees. That's helpful to know. And what medications are you currently taking, if you remember?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a hard one. I take a little white pill for my blood pressure… I think it’s Lisinopril, but I’m not sure. And I take something for the arthritis, too… a pain reliever. It’s a little yellow one. I have trouble remembering the names, you see. My granddaughter, Sarah, helps me fill my pill organizer every week. She knows all the names. I can ask her when I see her next. Would that be alright? I don’t want to give you the wrong information.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Raymonde. It's much better to be sure, and Sarah sounds like a wonderful help. We can always check your medication list through the clinic records as well. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I know of, dear. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to get stung by bees when I was a little girl, but that didn’t bother me too much. Just a little swelling, that's all. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but if I was, I suppose I’d know about it by now, wouldn’t I? But I’ve never had any trouble with medications, either. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Alright, one last question about your history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, dear! I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol in over fifty years. My husband… well, he used to enjoy a little whiskey now and then, but I never cared for it. And I certainly don't smoke or take any of those… recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I'm a simple woman, you see. Just like my garden – I prefer the natural things in life. And I've always taken care of myself, as best as I can. It's important, you know, to look after your health. That’s what my grandmother always told me.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Raymonde. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, dear. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle with my tummy, if you would. It’s been a bit sensitive lately, you see. And… if I start rambling, just let me know. My mind… it wanders sometimes. But I’ll try to be helpful. Just take your time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Raymonde. I will be as gentle as possible. And don’t worry about rambling – we have plenty of time. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out for me. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. I’ll start gently here… Any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a little tender, yes. Just there, on the right side. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. Like a pressure. It’s been like that for a little while now, as I said. It’s not awful, but I definitely feel it when you press. And… maybe a little bit here, too, on the left side. But mostly on the right. It’s funny… it seems to get worse after I try to eat something.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noticing some tenderness in your right upper quadrant and a bit on your left side. No rigidity that I’m feeling, which is good. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope to see if I hear any unusual sounds. The bowel sounds are a little… quiet, Raymonde. Not absent, but definitely diminished. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Oh, my knees are a bit stiff, you know. Arthritis. It makes everything a bit… creaky. Go ahead, dear. Just be careful not to pull too hard. I don’t want to fall off the table!
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, Raymonde, which is not unexpected with your arthritis. Nothing concerning there. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings – the tenderness in your right upper quadrant, quiet bowel sounds, and diminished reflexes – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The nausea, early fullness, weight loss, changes in bowel movements, and abdominal tenderness are all concerning. Given your history of cancer treatment, we need to rule out recurrence or complications from treatment. The quiet bowel sounds could suggest a slowed digestive system, which could contribute to the nausea and fullness. It could also be a sign of a blockage. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your liver function, kidney function, and inflammatory markers. I also want to get a complete blood count to check for anemia and signs of infection. I would also like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better look at your organs and rule out any blockage or recurrence. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a lot of tests, dear. A CT scan… is that safe? And all that blood… I don’t like needles, you know. But… if you think it’s important, I suppose I should do it. I just want to feel better. I'm tired of feeling sick all the time. If it will help you figure out what’s wrong… then yes, go ahead. But please… be gentle with the needles. And let me know what all those tests are for, so I understand what’s going on. It makes me nervous when I don’t know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Raymonde. It is a lot of tests, and I wouldn't order them if I didn't think they were necessary. The CT scan uses a small amount of radiation, but the benefits of getting a clear diagnosis far outweigh the risks in this case. We take precautions to minimize the radiation exposure as much as possible. As for the blood tests, I'll let the phlebotomist know to be as gentle as possible. They are very skilled at drawing blood, and they will do their best to make you comfortable. Let me explain what each test is for: Complete Blood Count : This will tell us if you have any anemia or infection. Liver Function Tests : This will tell us if your liver is functioning properly. Kidney Function Tests : This will tell us if your kidneys are functioning properly. Inflammatory Markers: This will tell us if there's any inflammation in your body. The CT scan will give us a detailed picture of your abdomen and pelvis, allowing us to look for any blockage, recurrence of cancer, or other abnormalities. I'll write the orders for the tests now, and the nurses will schedule them for you. You'll get a call with the appointment times. Do you have any questions about the tests or the scheduling process?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand, dear. You explained it very well. Just… please make sure they are gentle with the needles. And… if I start feeling anxious during the CT scan, can I let them know? I don’t want to panic. It’s just… enclosed spaces make me a bit uneasy. But I trust you, Doctor. You seem to know what you’re doing. Just please help me figure out what’s wrong. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Raymonde. And yes, you can absolutely let them know if you start feeling anxious during the CT scan. They are very experienced at helping patients who feel claustrophobic, and they can give you medication to help calm your nerves if needed. They will also keep you informed throughout the process and make sure you feel as comfortable as possible. I promise we'll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. Once we have the results of the tests, we'll discuss them with you in detail and come up with a plan. In the meantime, please try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or fever – please come to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, dear. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my rambling. I just… I'm glad I came in. I've been putting it off for too long. Thank you, Doctor. I hope we can figure out what's wrong soon.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Raymonde. It was my pleasure to meet you, and I'm glad you came in as well. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. The nurses will come in shortly to go over discharge instructions with you. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
