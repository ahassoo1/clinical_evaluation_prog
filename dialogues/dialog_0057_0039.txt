DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good mornin’ to ya, Doctor Sieh. Well, I got a letter… from the clinic, I think. Said somethin’ about my cholesterol bein’ a little high. Didn't quite understand all of it, to be honest. It’s a bit of a worry, you know, gettin’ older.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that here. It's good you came in to discuss it. It is always best to address these things, and you're right to be proactive. We can certainly take a closer look at those numbers and figure out what’s going on. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I reckon I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. I'm 88, you know. A few aches and pains here and there, what do you expect? My wife, bless her heart, passed away five years ago. Been livin’ on my own since then. I try to stay active, do a little gardenin’ when the weather’s good, and I still manage to get around for groceries and such. I don’t get sick often, though. Haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, I don’t even remember when, truthfully. Just a yearly check-up, usually.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear you’ve been staying so active, Mr. Bohnett. Gardening is excellent exercise. And it’s good you haven’t been too sick. It sounds like you’ve been doing a good job taking care of yourself. Since it’s been a while since your last thorough check-up, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure, now… the doctor mentioned somethin’ about that years ago, maybe when my wife was still around. I had to take a little pill for it for a while, but he said it was under control, so I stopped takin’ it. And I had a touch of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just what happens when you get old, right? No diabetes, no heart problems that I know of. Just the usual aches and pains. I was always pretty healthy, strong as an ox when I was younger, workin’ construction and all. I don’t rightly remember anything else, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. High blood pressure in the past is good to know. And arthritis is very common. We can certainly discuss that further if it’s bothering you. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, yes. When I was a young man, I broke my leg playin’ football. Had to have surgery to set it. That was… oh, goodness, nearly seventy years ago! And… uh… I had my appendix out when I was in my twenties. Aside from those two, nothin’ else. Definitely nothin’ recent. They did a pretty good job with both of ‘em, though. Never had any trouble with either one.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Mr. Bohnett. Both of those surgeries were quite a long time ago, and it sounds like they healed well. Now, can you tell me about your family’s health?
PATIENT: Well, that’s a tricky one. My mother lived to be 92, which is pretty good, I suppose. She died of… well, I think it was just old age. She wasn’t sick or anythin’, just wore out, you know? My father died younger, around 70, from a heart attack, I believe. He worked really hard his whole life, and smoked a lot, so I reckon that didn’t help. I had one brother and two sisters. My brother died when he was fairly young, in his fifties, from… somethin’ with his lungs, I think. My sisters, one passed away a few years ago from cancer, and the other one’s still livin’, bless her heart, but she’s not in the best of health these days. Lots of sickness in the family, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Bohnett. That gives me a good picture of your family history. A heart attack in your father is important to know, and the other information is helpful as well. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not really. I don’t think so. I’ve always been able to eat pretty much anything. Maybe a little sniffly when the pollen’s bad in the spring, but that’s just normal, isn’t it? Never had a bad reaction to any medicine or food, as far as I remember. I eat a lot of shellfish, never bothered me none. My wife used to make a lovely shrimp scampi. No, I don’t think I have any allergies, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ at all. Stopped takin’ the blood pressure pills years ago, like I said. Don’t take any vitamins or nothin’ either. Never really been one for pills and powders. I figure, if I’m gonna take somethin’, it ought to be good and tasty! Just a cup of coffee in the mornin’ and maybe a little glass of wine with dinner now and then. That’s about it. I try to eat a balanced diet, mostly vegetables and fish. And a little bit of steak when I’m feelin’ fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett, that gives me a very good understanding of your background. Now, let’s get back to the reason you came in today – the cholesterol levels. To get a better picture of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds just fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don’t mind a bit. I’ve always been a healthy fella, so I reckon it’ll be nothin’ to worry about. Just tell me if you find anythin’ I ought to be concerned about. No need to sugarcoat it, I can take it. I’m an old man, seen a lot in my time.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, your heart sounds regular, a little bit of age-related murmur which is common, but nothing concerning at this time. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/85, a little elevated but not dramatically so. Pulses are good and strong. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. No swelling in the extremities, skin is normal for age. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. But those cholesterol numbers are what brought you in, and we need to address those.
PATIENT: Well, that all sounds pretty good to me, Doctor. I'm glad to hear my old ticker is still workin' alright. So, what about this cholesterol then? Is it somethin' serious? Should I be worryin'? What do I need to do about it? I don’t want to have to start takin’ a bunch of pills if I can help it, if you know what I mean. I’m a simple man, I like things simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. Your cholesterol levels are a bit elevated, as the clinic letter indicated. Specifically, your LDL cholesterol – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – is 160. We generally want that under 100. Your HDL – the “good” cholesterol – is 40, which is a little low, and your triglycerides are also slightly elevated at 180. Now, is it something to panic about?
PATIENT: No, not panic about, but to get a handle on, right? I figured as much. What does that mean, though? I don’t understand all this LDL and HDL business. Is it gonna give me a heart attack like my father? What can I do about it? And if it is somethin’ I gotta change, what kind of changes are we talkin’? I like my steak, you know. And my wife’s shrimp scampi… a man needs his comforts.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions, Mr. Bohnett. It is important to get a handle on this. Let me explain it simply. Think of cholesterol like a sticky substance that can build up inside your arteries—the pipes that carry blood around your body. When you have too much "bad" cholesterol , it can cause those pipes to narrow and get clogged, making it harder for blood to flow. This increases your risk of heart attack or stroke, like your father experienced. The "good" cholesterol actually helps remove cholesterol from those pipes, so you want that number higher. And triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood that can contribute to the problem if they're too high. Now, the good news is, we can often manage this with lifestyle changes, which is what I always recommend first. Do you think you’d be willing to try some changes to your diet and exercise routine?
PATIENT: Well, I reckon I can try, Doctor. I’m not as spry as I used to be, but I can still walk a bit. And I suppose I could cut back on the steak a little… maybe just on weeknights. I don’t want to give it up altogether! My wife always said a man needs his red meat. What kind of changes are you thinkin'? And how long before I see any difference? I'm 88 years old, things don't happen overnight, you know. I'm a patient man, but I also like to know I'm makin' progress.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Bohnett. I appreciate your willingness to try. And you're right, things don't happen overnight, especially at 88. We’re aiming for gradual improvements. First, let’s talk diet. The biggest thing is reducing saturated and trans fats. Those are found in red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. Cutting back on the steak, especially on weeknights like you said, is a great start. Instead, try leaner proteins like fish, chicken , and beans. Increasing your fiber intake – from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains – can also help lower cholesterol. As for exercise, even 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week can make a difference. Walking is perfect. It doesn't have to be strenuous, just a brisk pace that gets your heart rate up a little. We’ll repeat your cholesterol levels in three months to see how you’re doing. It usually takes several months to see significant changes. And if those changes aren’t enough, we can discuss medication options. But let’s try lifestyle first. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Cutting back on the steak won't be easy, but I can give it a try. And I can definitely walk more. I enjoy gettin’ out in the garden, so I’ll make an effort to walk a bit further each day. Three months to see a difference… alright, I can wait. Do I need to change anything else? Any foods I should definitely avoid? And what about my wine? Can I still have a little glass with dinner? I don't want to give up all my comforts! I'm an old man, Doctor, and a little wine helps me relax.
DOCTOR: That's the spirit, Mr. Bohnett! You're already making positive steps. As for other foods, try to limit processed foods and sugary drinks as much as possible. Read labels and avoid anything with trans fats. And focus on healthy fats like those found in olive oil, avocados, and nuts. And as for your wine… a little bit is okay! One glass with dinner is perfectly acceptable. In fact, some studies suggest that red wine may even have some heart-healthy benefits. But moderation is key. We don’t want to overdo it. I'm going to write up a summary of these recommendations for you, including a sample meal plan. I’ll also give you a referral to a registered dietitian who can help you create a more personalized plan if you’re interested. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: That's good to hear about the wine, Doctor. I was worried I'd have to give it up altogether! And a registered dietitian… that might be helpful. I'm not a young man anymore, and I don't know all the fancy food terms. I'll think about the dietitian. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me and not makin’ me feel like I gotta completely change my life. I'll try my best to follow your advice. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been a great help. When will I get the summary of the recommendations? And how do I go about seein’ this dietitian if I decide to?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. I'm glad I could help. It’s important to me that you feel comfortable and empowered to make healthy choices. My nurse will print out the summary of recommendations for you before you leave. It will include the meal plan and contact information for the registered dietitian. If you decide you’d like to see her, just give her office a call to schedule an appointment. She can help you create a plan that fits your lifestyle and preferences. We’ll see you back in three months to repeat your cholesterol levels. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Mr. Bohnett, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
