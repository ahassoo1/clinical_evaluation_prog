DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re forty years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, morning. Look, I don’t really have time for a whole lot of chatter, Doc. It’s… my stomach. It’s been bloated. Just feels full all the time, you know? Like I ate way too much, but I haven't.
DOCTOR: Bloated, you say. And this feeling of fullness… how long has this been going on, Mr. Kristofik?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t really keep track of that stuff. Weeks, probably. Maybe a month? It comes and goes. It’s annoying, that’s all. Look, is this going to take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: We need to establish a timeline to properly assess the situation, sir. “Weeks” is rather imprecise. Are there any particular foods that seem to worsen it?
PATIENT: Foods? I eat normal food. Look, I work construction, I eat what I eat. Burgers, sandwiches, whatever’s quick. Doesn't really matter. It just… happens. I don’t sit around analyzing my lunch, Doc. I’m a pile driver operator, not a food critic.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? Pain? No, not really. Just… uncomfortable. Full. Like I swallowed a balloon. I don’t know. Look, is this going to involve poking and prodding? Because I really don't have the patience for that right now.
DOCTOR: A physical examination is standard procedure, Mr. Kristofik. It allows me to assess your condition properly. I assure you, it will be as brief as possible. However, to give me a better starting point, can you describe the location of this discomfort?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It’s… everywhere, Doc. All over. Lower stomach, upper stomach… it just feels big. Like my whole midsection is puffed up. Honestly, it’s embarrassing. I don’t like feeling like I’m about to burst. Can we just get this over with? I’m losing daylight.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you'll just lie down on the table, please. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen and palpate it gently. It’s unlikely to be pleasant, but it will give me some indication of what we’re dealing with. Now, is there any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! What kind of question is that? Look, I told you, it's just bloating. I don't go examining my… business, okay? I'm a practical man. If something was wrong, I'd know. And it's not. Just… uncomfortable. Can we hurry this up? I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. However, ruling out potential causes is essential. Are you experiencing any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea? Sometimes. Not like, throwing up, but a little queasy, especially after I eat. Like… too full. But I just push through it. I got a job to do, Doc. Can’t be feeling sick all the time. This is getting ridiculous. Seriously, what are you even looking for?
DOCTOR: I am assessing for tenderness, distension, and any masses. It's standard procedure, Mr. Kristofik. Do you have any history of constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: Constipation? Sometimes. Look, I eat a lot of, you know, basic stuff. Not a lot of fiber, okay? It happens. Diarrhea? Not really. Usually… regular. I'm a simple man with simple needs, Doc. Is this going to take much longer? I swear, I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: And finally, Mr. Kristofik, are you experiencing any unintended weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! I haven't been weighing myself or anything. Look, I’m a construction worker. I gain weight, usually. It's hard work, alright? I eat a lot to keep going. This is just… a waste of my time, Doc. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me, and my brief examination, it could be a number of things, Mr. Kristofik. Given your dietary habits, it is possible this is simply a case of excessive gas and mild indigestion. However, given the persistence of the symptoms, I recommend a few simple tests to rule out anything more serious. Would you be amenable to a blood test and a stool sample?
PATIENT: Tests? Seriously? Look, I told you, it’s just bloating. A little uncomfortable, that's all. I don't need tests. I need to get back to work. I don’t have time for… lab work. Is there anything… anything at all you can give me to just make it stop? Some kind of pill?
DOCTOR: While I understand your desire for a quick fix, Mr. Kristofik, self-treating without a proper diagnosis can be detrimental. However, given your reluctance for further testing at this time, I can prescribe a medication to help alleviate the symptoms of gas and bloating. It’s an over-the-counter medication, simethicone, but a higher dose prescription may provide more relief. I would also recommend trying to incorporate more fiber into your diet, and staying adequately hydrated. However, if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool – you must seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I understand. Gas pills. Fine. Anything to get this over with. Just… write the prescription, Doc. And look, I’m a busy man. Don't expect me to come back for a follow-up unless something’s really, really wrong. And honestly, I doubt that’ll happen.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is your prescription for simethicone. Please take as directed. And while I respect your time, I strongly advise you to reconsider a follow-up appointment. It is crucial to monitor your condition. I have documented our conversation and the prescription in your electronic health record. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Kristofik?
PATIENT: No. That’s it. Just… thanks, Doc. I gotta go.
