DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kalinski. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because… well, my memory. It has been… troubling me lately. I find I forget things. Small things, mostly, but… it worries me. It is new, you understand. Not something I have always been like.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Alvara. It's certainly concerning when you notice changes in your memory, especially if it's a new development. “Small things” can be quite disruptive, and it’s good you're addressing this now. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about these forgetful episodes?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, quite disruptive. For example… yesterday, I made a pot of tea. A lovely Earl Grey. I went to get my book, and when I returned… I had completely forgotten about the tea. It was… cold. And I had already put sugar in it! A complete waste. These things… they happen more and more. Also, I sometimes struggle to remember names. People I know well. It is… embarrassing. And a little frightening. I do not understand it.
DOCTOR: I see. Forgetting the tea and struggling with names – those are certainly examples that sound concerning, particularly given that this is a recent change for you. It’s understandable that it’s frightening when your memory isn't working as it should. To help me rule out different possibilities, let’s go through some more details. Could you tell me approximately when you first began noticing these memory lapses?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began… perhaps three months ago? No, maybe a little longer. Around… May, I believe. It was very gradual. At first, I thought it was just… being tired. I have been… busier than usual with the community association. Many meetings. Many things to organize. But it did not get better. It has… slowly worsened. I remember specifically… forgetting to lock the garden gate one evening. That is very unlike me. I always lock the gate.
DOCTOR: May, that’s helpful. And the garden gate is a good example – a routine task you normally perform without issue. So, approximately three months, and a gradual worsening. Now, to get a broader understanding, could you tell me a little bit about any other symptoms you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Other than the forgetting… hmm. I have… headaches, occasionally. Not severe, just a dull ache. And I feel… tired, even when I have slept. More tired than usual, I mean. I also… sometimes feel a little… confused. Like my thoughts are… slow. And… I do not sleep very well. I wake up often during the night. Is that relevant, Doctor? I do not want to bother you with unimportant things.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Alvara, you aren't bothering me at all. These are all very relevant things to mention. Headaches, fatigue, a sense of confusion, and difficulty sleeping – these could all be related. To help me paint a complete picture, could you describe the headaches a bit more?
PATIENT: They are not… sharp pains. More like a pressure, around my temples. And across my forehead. It comes and goes. Usually in the afternoon. Sometimes… if I have been reading for too long. Or… if I am stressed. Which, lately, has been quite often. The community association is… demanding. I take no medication for them, Doctor. I usually just… rest. Or have a cup of tea. Though, as you know, sometimes I forget about the tea!
DOCTOR: I appreciate the detail, Ms. Alvara, and yes, I do remember the tea. Pressure around the temples and forehead, worse in the afternoon, and related to reading or stress—that’s helpful. Now, let’s talk a little about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… let me see. I had… the usual things. Childhood illnesses, nothing serious. As I got older… high blood pressure. The doctor told me years ago. I take medication for that, yes. A small pill, every morning. And… a touch of arthritis in my hands, but nothing that bothers me too much. It is just a little stiffness. Other than that… no, nothing. I have always been… quite healthy, actually. Until recently.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication, and some arthritis. That’s good to know. And it’s important that you’ve been generally healthy until recently. What about any surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Yes, I had my tonsils removed when I was a child. A very long time ago. And… a hysterectomy when I was… forty years old. That is all. No other surgeries. Nothing recently, certainly. I avoid hospitals whenever possible, Doctor. I do not… care for them.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy and hysterectomy. Thank you. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—for example, dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, or other memory problems?
PATIENT: That is a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she had some memory problems when she was very old. But we just thought it was… old age. She forgot things. Misplaced things. But it was never… diagnosed. My father… he had heart trouble. He died when he was quite young. And my brother… he has diabetes. Nothing… specifically memory related, as far as I know. It is… not a family that talks much about illnesses.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not uncommon for families to avoid discussing health issues. So, some memory problems in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and diabetes in your brother. Thank you. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, absolutely not. I have never smoked in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner, on special occasions. And… recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I am a very… proper woman, Doctor. I believe in a healthy lifestyle. Though, lately, I have been… less active than usual. With all the community association meetings. It leaves me little time for exercise.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And I understand how the community association commitments could limit your activity. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I have always been very fortunate in that regard. I can take most medications without any problems. I have… a sensitive stomach, sometimes, but nothing serious. I am usually able to tolerate everything. I do not… react to anything. Really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That’s a very thorough history. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a more complete picture. I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and do a neurological exam to assess your memory, reflexes, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just… want to understand what is happening. It is… unsettling, this forgetting. I want to be sure it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me, please. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. We may need to discuss adjusting your medication later. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, and your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to test your reflexes and coordination, and then I'll ask you to recall a few things I mention. Can you tell me what these three objects are: apple, table, pen?
PATIENT: Apple… table… pen. Yes, I remember. An apple, a table, and a pen.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's very good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your orientation. What is today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. It is… August 2nd, 2025. Yes, August 2nd, 2025.
DOCTOR: Very good. And where are we right now?
PATIENT: We are… in your clinic, Doctor. In… in the suburban clinic. Yes.
DOCTOR: And finally, can you tell me your full name?
PATIENT: My full name… Venus Alvara. A-L-V-A-R-A. Venus Alvara.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That was very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, I believe it’s important to investigate this further. Your memory recall seems generally intact at the moment, but the gradual onset of forgetfulness, headaches, fatigue, and sleep disturbances are concerning. I'd like to order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other potential underlying causes. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI? Yes… yes, I suppose so. If you think it is necessary, Doctor. Though… I do not like being in those machines. They are… claustrophobic. But if it will help… yes, I will do it. And the blood work, of course. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the MRI, Ms. Alvara. They can be unsettling, but we can discuss strategies to help you feel more comfortable – for example, you can listen to music during the scan, or we can arrange for a mild sedative if you’re particularly anxious. The technician will also be with you throughout the entire process. We’ll also schedule the blood work. I’ll write the orders now and give them to the nurse. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding stressful situations as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I do not think so, Doctor. You have explained everything very clearly. Just… when will I receive the results? And… is it likely to be something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Alvara. The blood work results usually take about a week to come back. The MRI results may take a few days longer, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. It’s important to remember that these tests are simply to gather more information. It’s far too early to say definitively what’s going on. Many things can cause memory problems – vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, stress, sleep disturbances – and many of them are easily treatable. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results, and we’ll discuss them in detail. If anything concerning emerges, we’ll address it promptly. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all, Doctor. Thank you for your kindness. And for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and provide instructions for scheduling the MRI. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
