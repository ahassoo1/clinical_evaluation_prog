DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Well, I just… I wanted to get tested for, you know, the thing. HIV. I just figured it was a good idea to check. Better safe than sorry, right? Though honestly, I doubt I even need it. My wife and I… we're very careful.
DOCTOR: Careful is good. Still, routine testing isn’t a bad idea. Alright. And just to be clear, when you say “careful,” can you elaborate a bit on what that entails?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? You need to know everything? It's… we use protection. Every time. And we’ve only been with each other. Look, I’m not trying to be rude, but I just don't see why I need to explain the specifics of our… private life to you. It feels a little invasive, honestly. Is this standard procedure?
DOCTOR: Standard procedure to gather a relevant medical history, yes. It’s not about being invasive, it’s about risk assessment. We need to understand potential exposures to give you the most accurate advice and testing. "Protection" means different things to different people. Condoms?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting somewhere. Yes, condoms. Always. And I mean the regular kind, not those… fancy flavored ones. Honestly, it’s almost insulting you even had to ask. We're not reckless teenagers. I just… I wanted a test, that’s it. Is there a reason you’re questioning my lifestyle choices? I assure you, my wife and I are responsible adults.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Just covering bases. Always best to be thorough. And I assure you, I’m not questioning anyone’s choices. Just… information gathering. Have either of you ever had any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Neither of us has ever had anything like that. I would know. And my wife would definitely tell me if she had. It’s just… not the kind of thing we would ever… allow to happen. Really, is this necessary? I feel like I’m being interrogated. It's a simple HIV test, not a criminal investigation.
DOCTOR: Alright. No history of STIs, good. Just trying to get a complete picture. And it is important, even with condom use. Condoms aren't foolproof, though they significantly reduce risk. We'll proceed with the HIV test, then. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials we might use?
PATIENT: Look, I just told you, no history of anything. So, no, I'm not allergic to latex. Honestly, you're making me feel like I'm a complete idiot. I understand you have a job to do, but this is getting ridiculous. Can we please just get the test done? I have things to do, you know. I scheduled this appointment weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No allergies noted. We’ll get this done quickly. I’m just going to need a quick blood sample. Follow me to the lab, and they’ll take care of it. Standard procedure, I assure you. And no, you’re not making me feel anything. Just... thoroughness. Follow me.
PATIENT: Fine. Let's just get this over with. Honestly, the whole experience has been… unnecessarily stressful. I've had more pleasant experiences at the DMV. Just… please make it quick.
DOCTOR: We will. It’s a standard venipuncture, shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. The lab technician is very skilled. And… I apologize if the questioning felt intrusive. It's about covering all bases for accurate results and proper counseling. We’ll have results back in about a week. They’ll call you with the details. Here we are.
PATIENT: Whatever. Just... tell them I have a busy schedule and don't want to be here all day. And I really don't need a lecture on safe sex. I already know all that. Let's get this over with. .
