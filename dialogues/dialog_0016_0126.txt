DOCTOR: Hi Christen, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately. And hungry, constantly. It's… rather disruptive, to be honest. I feel like I’m always reaching for a glass of water or a snack, and it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information to start with – increased thirst and hunger. And you say it's disruptive to your daily life?
PATIENT: Indeed. I work in shipping and receiving – quite a bit of moving about, you see – and it’s… difficult to concentrate when you’re constantly thinking about when you can next have a drink or something to eat. It slows me down, and my supervisor has noticed. I’m trying to be efficient, but it’s proving… challenging.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. So it's impacting your work performance, which is understandably concerning. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been building up gradually?
PATIENT: It’s been… gradual, I think. Perhaps the last couple of months? It wasn’t terribly noticeable at first – just a bit more thirsty than usual. But it’s definitely worsened in the last few weeks. I dismissed it initially as the weather getting warmer, to be honest. But it’s still quite bad even indoors with the air conditioning on.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months, worsening over the last few weeks, and not entirely explained by the weather. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – how often you're going, or the amount you’re producing?
PATIENT: Hm. That's a fair question. I… suppose I am going to the toilet a bit more frequently, yes. Though, again, I initially put that down to the increased fluid intake. It’s hard to say if it’s more than usual, independent of the drinking. The amount… I don’t think so. Seems normal enough. I haven’t really paid close attention, if I’m honest. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful information, Christen. It is important. Increased urination alongside increased thirst can be significant. Along with the hunger, it makes me want to explore a few possibilities. Before we get into that, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Unintentional… now that you mention it… I believe I have lost a little weight. Not a great deal, and I haven't been weighing myself regularly, but my trousers feel a bit looser than they used to. It’s not a conscious effort, and I haven't changed my diet or exercise routine. Perhaps a couple of pounds, at most. It’s difficult to be precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few pounds of unintentional weight loss alongside the increased thirst, hunger, and urination… and the impact on your work. We should also cover some other basics. Do you have any blurry vision or fatigue?
PATIENT: Fatigue, certainly. I've been feeling rather… drained, yes. It's not debilitating, but I'm quicker to tire than I used to be. And, you know, blurry vision… now that you ask, I’ve noticed my eyesight hasn’t been quite as sharp lately. I just chalked it up to needing new glasses, to be frank. I've been meaning to book an appointment with the optician. It's not constant, but it does happen occasionally. Is that… a worry? I'm not trying to be difficult, I just… I’m not very good at noticing these things.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being difficult at all, Christen. It’s good you're telling me all this. These are all things that could be connected. Okay, let’s move onto some medical history. Do you have any diagnosed medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Right. No, nothing diagnosed. I had a bout of… the flu, a few years back, and a strained back when I was lifting boxes at work, but nothing chronic. My doctor always said I had a perfectly healthy bill of health. My father had… something with his heart, I believe, but I don't know the specifics. And my mother… she was always very healthy, thankfully. I’m not really a medical person, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. No prior diagnoses, a healthy history overall. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a single one. I try to avoid them if I can. A bit of paracetamol if I’ve got a headache, but that's it. I prefer to just… get on with things, if possible. I'm not one for fussing over minor ailments.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Right. No allergies that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife... ex-wife, used to be allergic to shellfish, but that's neither here nor there. I’ve eaten pretty much everything and never had an issue. I don't go out of my way to try unusual things, but I haven't had to avoid anything specifically.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. Okay, Christen, based on what you've told me – increased thirst, hunger, frequent urination, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, and blurry vision – it raises a concern for diabetes, specifically Type 2 diabetes. Now, this isn’t a diagnosis, and we need to confirm it with some tests. I'd like to do a quick physical exam and then order some blood work to check your blood glucose levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Right. Diabetes... Well, that doesn’t sound very pleasant at all. But, if that’s what you think it might be, then yes, please. A physical exam and blood work sounds perfectly reasonable. I’d rather know what’s going on, to be honest. The sooner we find out, the better. Is there anything I should… prepare for?
DOCTOR: Good. It’s always best to get things checked out. Nothing to specifically prepare for with the blood work, other than you'll need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand – so no eating or drinking anything other than water. For the physical exam, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological exam. It won't take long. If you'll just have a seat here, we can get started.
PATIENT: Right. Eight hours, no food… I can manage that. I usually have a late lunch anyway. Let’s get on with it then, Doctor. The sooner we have some answers, the better. I have a delivery to oversee this afternoon, so the quicker we can do this, the more grateful I will be. Not to rush you, of course. But time is of the essence, so to speak.
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Christen. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is 142/90. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal, sensory response is intact. Okay, everything seems relatively normal on the physical exam. Now, the blood work will give us a much clearer picture. I’m going to write a requisition form for a fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and a complete metabolic panel. That will give us a good baseline. Do you have any questions before I get that sorted?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That all sounds… thorough. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, complete metabolic panel... I trust your judgement. I'm not familiar with all the terminology, but if you think it’s necessary, then so be it. Where will I need to go for the blood work? And how long will it take to get the results? I need to arrange my schedule accordingly. I’m hoping it's not too disruptive.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The nearest lab is City General Hospital, just off Elm Street. I'll give you a written request; just take this to the reception desk when you go. They don’t require an appointment. As for the results, they typically come back within 24-48 hours. I’ll have my assistant call you as soon as they’re available. If we don’t hear anything within 48 hours, please give us a call. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and avoid any sugary drinks. And don't worry too much; we’re just gathering information at this stage. We’ll know more once we have the results. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Right. City General Hospital, no appointment necessary, results in 24-48 hours. I’ve got that. No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. I appreciate your thoroughness, and I’ll go and get the blood work done as soon as possible. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I’ll await your assistant’s call. Thank you for your time. I should be getting back to work. Time is, as they say, money. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Christen. We'll get to the bottom of this. And thank you for coming in today. Take care and get back to work safely. If you have any concerns before the results come back, don't hesitate to give the clinic a call. .
