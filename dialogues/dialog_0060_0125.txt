DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Nooruddin, it’s… a precaution, really. I requested the HIV test. Just want to be sure, you know? It's better to be safe than sorry, even if I highly doubt it’ll be anything. My wife and I… we’re careful people.
DOCTOR: Careful people, yes. Of course. Still, testing is always a good idea. Even with precautions, things can happen. It's responsible of you to get this checked. Now, just to clarify – and please don’t take offense, I just need a complete picture – when you say "careful," can you elaborate on the types of precautions you and your wife take?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? We use protection. Every time. It's not… complicated. People don't need a detailed explanation of their private life for a standard test. But, if you must know... we've been using condoms consistently since we got married. And we only have each other, if that makes you feel better. It’s hardly a wild lifestyle, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I assure you, I am not judging your lifestyle. I am a physician, and I need information to properly assess your risk factors and ensure the accuracy of this test. A history of consistent condom use is good to know, but it doesn't eliminate all risk. There's still potential for breakage, slippage, or improper use. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Are you implying I would have something like that? I assure you, Doctor, I’ve never needed to visit a clinic for… those kinds of issues. My wife and I are both very clean people. This is becoming rather insulting, frankly. But no, never. Absolutely not. It’s a waste of your time to ask, really.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I am simply following protocol, Mr. Belan. It's standard procedure to inquire about previous STI history, regardless of your current… confidence. Alright. Let's move on. Have you ever shared needles, even for medical purposes – say, if you've traveled to a country with limited healthcare access?
PATIENT: Needles? Are you serious? I am a Compliance Officer, Doctor. I work in an office. I’ve never had any need for needles beyond a routine vaccination. And travel? We took a lovely holiday in the Maldives last year, but I can assure you, it involved spa treatments and cocktails, not… shared needles. This line of questioning is becoming increasingly absurd. Are you always this… thorough?
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I am assessing all potential risk factors for HIV transmission. While your lifestyle may seem low-risk to you, it’s my responsibility to be thorough. Dismissing possibilities based on assumptions is unprofessional and potentially dangerous. Let’s try this differently. Have you ever received a blood transfusion, or had any surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I understand you have a job to do, but this is starting to feel like an interrogation. My wife and I are responsible adults. We’ve both had routine check-ups, vaccinations, the usual things. I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager – a very standard procedure, I might add – and that's it. No transfusions. No… anything else. Honestly, I fail to see how this is relevant to a simple HIV test request. Are you doubting my honesty now? This is quite ridiculous. I came here for a test, not a character assassination.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I am not doubting your honesty. I am attempting to gather a complete medical history. While you describe a seemingly low-risk lifestyle, it's my professional duty to explore all possibilities to ensure accurate interpretation of test results and provide appropriate care. However, if you are uncomfortable answering these questions, we can proceed directly to the test. But be aware that a limited history may make interpreting the results less precise. Do you wish to continue with the test now, or would you prefer to schedule another appointment to discuss this further?
PATIENT: Fine. Let's just get the test done. I've wasted enough time here answering ridiculous questions. Clearly, you don't trust my word, so just… proceed. The sooner I get this over with, the better. And frankly, I expect a negative result. It’s the only logical outcome. I’ve made my point. Let's move on.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow me. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly. I’ll need a brief urine sample as well, just to rule out any other potential issues. It's standard procedure, Mr. Belan.
PATIENT: Standard procedure… Everything is “standard procedure” with you, isn’t it? It’s quite exhausting.
