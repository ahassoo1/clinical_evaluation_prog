DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, I'm here about getting surgery. Weight loss surgery, that is. My wife helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, I don’t remember all the details why exactly, but she said it was a good idea, and I trust her.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight loss surgery. That's a significant step, and it's good you're approaching it with support. It's alright that you don’t recall all the specifics; we can go over everything today. Just to get a better understanding, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on that led you and your wife to consider this option?
PATIENT: Well… things have been… difficult, I guess. I've always been a bigger guy, but it’s gotten harder to do things. Just walking around, even. And my health… I don’t really know what’s wrong, exactly, but the doctor back home said I needed to lose weight. My wife does most of the remembering for appointments and stuff, so… she probably knows better than I do. I just get tired easily, and things hurt sometimes. I mostly just want to feel better, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some significant challenges with your energy levels and overall physical comfort. It's very common for those considering weight loss surgery to feel this way, and it’s perfectly alright that you’re relying on your wife for some of the details. Let's try to piece things together. Perhaps we can start with some general questions about your health history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Um… I think so? I think the doctor back home mentioned something about my sugar being high, but I don’t really remember. And… my blood pressure, maybe? I get it checked at the regular doctor's visits, but honestly, I don't pay much attention to the numbers. They just tell me to eat better and exercise more. Which… is hard. I definitely haven’t been diagnosed with anything official, if that makes sense. My wife would know for sure, she keeps all the papers.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like there are some concerns that have been raised in the past, even if they haven’t been formally diagnosed. We'll definitely look into that further. Let's talk about any surgeries you've had, if any. Have you ever been hospitalized or had any operations?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Never been in the hospital. No surgeries, nothing like that. Just… regular check-ups. And the dentist, of course. I try to go to the dentist twice a year, like they tell me. But honestly, I don’t really like going. It’s… uncomfortable. I’m not good with… medical stuff, I guess. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: That's completely understandable. Many people feel anxious about medical procedures. It's good you prioritize dental health, though. Okay. Now, can you tell me a bit about your family?
PATIENT: Um… sure. I have a wife, like I said. We’ve been married for… fifteen years now, I think. Maybe fourteen. We don't have any kids. Both of our families are still back home. I came here a while ago for work, and my wife joined me a few years later. They're… healthy, as far as I know. My mom cooks a lot, really good food, but it's not always the healthiest, if you know what I mean. Lots of rice and… pastries. They worry about me, though. They always ask if I'm eating enough. It's… complicated.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Family history can be quite important. It sounds like there’s a lot of care and concern there, even if the lifestyle isn’t always the most supportive. Now, just to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little about your daily routine?
PATIENT: Well… I work. I’m a salesperson at a clothing store. Mostly standing around and helping people find clothes. It’s… okay. Not very active, though. I mostly just stand. I come home, have dinner with my wife, watch a little TV. Sometimes we go for a walk, but not very often. I usually eat… whatever my wife makes. She’s a really good cook. I don’t do much exercise, honestly. I get tired pretty easily, so I mostly just relax in the evenings. It’s… a pretty boring life, if I’m being honest. But it’s comfortable. I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a fairly sedentary lifestyle, and that’s something we'll need to consider as we discuss potential surgical options and your overall health plan. Finally, before we move on to a brief physical exam, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. No, not really. I used to take something for my… stomach, I think. Something for heartburn. But I stopped taking it a while ago. It didn’t really seem to help much, and my wife said it wasn't good for me. So, no, I don't take anything regularly right now. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache if I need it. Over-the-counter stuff. Nothing prescribed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall physical condition. It won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. I guess I should have known you'd want to do that. Sorry, I'm not very good with this kind of stuff. Just tell me if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all. We'll take things at your pace. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Alright, Mr. Kochubey. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly elevated rate. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is a bit elevated. Abdomen is soft, some fullness noted. Your weight is consistent with what you mentioned. Reflexes are normal. Overall, a basic examination doesn't reveal anything immediately alarming, but the elevated blood pressure is something we'll need to investigate further. Given your history and the physical exam findings, I think it's important to order some lab work. We'll need to check your blood sugar levels, cholesterol, and kidney function, among other things. This will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help us determine if you're a suitable candidate for weight loss surgery. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to feel better. So, yeah, lab work sounds fine. How long will that take? And where do I go? I don’t really know where anything is in this building.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I completely understand. We'll get that set up for you right away. The lab is just down the hall, and the receptionist will give you the necessary paperwork. It usually takes about an hour or two to complete all the tests, and you don’t need to fast beforehand. We should have the results back within a few days, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I’d like to recommend a consultation with a cardiologist to evaluate your blood pressure further. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes and ensure your heart is healthy enough for potential surgery. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. A heart doctor sounds… good. I mean, if you think it’s necessary. My wife always says I should get more check-ups, so… yeah, I’ll do it. Just… how much will all this cost? I don't have insurance, and we're not really… well, money is tight. I don’t want to get a huge bill I can’t pay. Is there any way to… get help with the cost?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Kochubey, and I'm glad you asked. The costs can certainly add up, especially without insurance. Let me be upfront with you. The lab work will likely be around $200-$300, and the cardiology consultation could be another $300-$500. Fortunately, this clinic does offer a financial assistance program for patients without insurance. Let me see… It's based on income, and you'd need to fill out an application. Also, we have a social worker on staff, Ms. Evans, who can help you navigate potential payment plans and other assistance options. I can connect you with her after this appointment. We'll do everything we can to make this process as affordable as possible. I will write down Ms. Evans’ contact information for you, along with the estimated costs and the lab requisition form. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… that sounds really good, Doctor. Thank you. That’s a big relief. I really appreciate you being honest about the costs and offering help. I'll talk to my wife about it and fill out that application. And I’ll definitely schedule something with the heart doctor. So… is there anything I need to do before my next appointment? Anything I should be thinking about or preparing? Besides filling out the paperwork, I mean.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I'm glad we could discuss this openly. Besides the paperwork and scheduling with the cardiologist, I would suggest starting a food diary. Just write down everything you eat and drink for a few days. It will give us a better understanding of your current dietary habits. Also, try to get a sense of your activity levels – even small amounts of walking or light exercise. It would also be helpful if you could bring a list of any medications you've taken in the past, even if you're not currently taking them. And, if possible, any previous medical records you may have. But most importantly, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've covered everything really well, Doctor. Thank you again for being so patient and understanding. I really appreciate it. I’ll go get the paperwork from the front desk and start that food diary. I should probably call my wife too. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we’re here to support you. Please take your time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
