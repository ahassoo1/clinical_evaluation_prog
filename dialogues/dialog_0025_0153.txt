DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Krahn, good afternoon. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just… a check-up, I think? Something about needing clearance for… work. I usher at the theater, mostly. Tickets and such. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. They just said I needed to come in. Is that right?
DOCTOR: A clearance, you say. Yes, I see a note here regarding employment. Though, a "check-up" is rather vague, don’t you think?
PATIENT: Vague is… a good word. I don’t remember much of the details. It’s… been a long time since I’ve really needed to go to the doctor. Just wanting to get this over with quickly, if that’s alright. Old bones, you know? Not much trouble, usually.
DOCTOR: "Old bones," alright. We'll see about that. Well, let's start with a little history then. Just to cover all our bases. Have you been experiencing any pain, anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. My back gets a little stiff sometimes, after standing for long periods at the theater. But that’s just… old age, probably. And my knees… they ache a bit in the cold weather. Nothing I can’t walk off, though. Is that what you mean? Like, serious pain? Because, no, not really. Mostly just… discomfort.
DOCTOR: "Discomfort." Right. And how long have you been experiencing this… discomfort in your back and knees?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years, I think. A long time. Maybe… ten years? More? It comes and goes, you see. It’s not constant. I really can’t put a date on it, Doctor. Things… blend together after a while. I'm divorced, you know. Lost track of time a bit then, too. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Your marital status is… unlikely to be relevant, Mr. Krahn. But we do need to establish a timeline. So, ten years for the back and knees. Has it been getting progressively worse over that time, or about the same?
PATIENT: About the same, I think. Maybe a little worse in the winter. But it doesn’t stop me from working. I can still stand for hours, you know? I just… take it easy. And I use a walking stick sometimes, if the weather is bad. But mostly… it’s manageable. Honestly, Doctor, I'm probably wasting your time. I'm just an old man who ushers at the theater.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, we're trying to establish whether you're fit to perform your job safely. “Manageable” is subjective. Now, let's move on. Any trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? No, not really. I get a little winded climbing stairs, sometimes. But who doesn’t? I’m not a young man anymore. And I used to smoke, a long time ago. Stopped years and years ago, though. Decades, probably. Is that… relevant? I don’t get any chest pain or anything. Just… a little shortness of breath. Occasionally.
DOCTOR: “Occasionally.” And how much did you smoke, and for how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a long time ago. A pack a day, maybe? For… twenty years? Thirty? It’s all a blur, I tell you. I was younger then. Different life. It was stressful, you know? A lot of pressure. I don't remember the exact numbers, Doctor. Just that I smoked. A lot. And then I stopped. Cold turkey. It was a struggle, but I did it. Is it important that I stopped? Because I did stop! I'm trying to be helpful.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is important that you stopped. But a pack a day for twenty, possibly thirty years… that does have implications. Let’s move on. Any history of heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Heart problems… hmm. My father… he had a weak heart, I think. He died when I was young. But I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago. My mother lived to be very old. Very healthy. No problems that I know of. I didn’t see my father much, you know. Different life then. Is that helpful? I'm afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. I just want to get this clearance so I can go back to work. It's… important to me.
DOCTOR: "Weak heart" isn't a diagnosis, Mr. Krahn. Do you know if he had any specific heart conditions?
PATIENT: No, I really don't. I was a child, Doctor. I just remember my mother saying he had a weak heart. He didn't go to doctors much. Different times then. People didn't… bother with things like that. It was just… something he had. Honestly, I'm not very good at remembering details. I’m just an old man. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. Can we just… skip this part? I really want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I understand you want to get this over with quickly. However, I need accurate information to determine if you are physically capable of performing your job duties safely. Your history is… lacking. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more direct questions. And I need you to try your best to recall any details, even if they seem unimportant. Are you willing to cooperate?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I'll try. I really will. It's just… it was a long time ago. And things… blend together. But I'll try. Please. Just… be patient with me. I don't want to cause any trouble. I just want to keep working.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No… not really. Nothing regularly. I take a little ibuprofen sometimes, for my knees. When they really bother me. But that’s it. And… oh! I take a multivitamin occasionally. But not every day. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago. But the doctor said I didn’t need it anymore. I don’t remember the name of it, though. It was a long time ago. Different doctor. Is ibuprofen okay? Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen is fine in moderation. But you were on medication for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes. For a while. The doctor said my blood pressure was a little high. But then I changed doctors, and the new doctor said I didn't need it anymore. He said I was fine. It was… about ten years ago, maybe? I really don't remember the details. Different life then, you see. I was… more stressed. And I’ve been trying to eat healthier. Fewer salty foods. That’s probably why my blood pressure is better now. Is that… helpful? Can we move on, Doctor? I feel a bit… flustered.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Let's do a quick physical exam. Please step onto the scale. We'll start with your weight and blood pressure. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Don’t worry, it won’t take long.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… good. A physical exam. Yes. That’s… practical. I can do that. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m not very good at… balancing these days.
DOCTOR: 118 pounds. Now, just relax your arm. And try not to talk while I take your reading. 140 over 90. Hmm. Okay, now let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out.
PATIENT: Is that… high? My blood pressure, I mean. I haven't had it checked in… a long time. I get a little nervous at the doctor, you see. It probably goes up then. I used to smoke, remember? That probably doesn’t help. But I stopped! Years ago. Is everything… okay, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated, Mr. Krahn. And I'm hearing some… diminished breath sounds in both lungs. Do you experience any shortness of breath, even at rest?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not usually. But sometimes, when I climb the stairs at the theater, I get a little winded. And… yes. Now that you mention it, sometimes when I lie down flat, I feel a little… breathless. It’s not terrible, though. Just… uncomfortable. I thought it was just old age, you see. Is that… bad, Doctor? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, given your history of smoking, your elevated blood pressure, and your diminished breath sounds, I'm concerned about the possibility of underlying lung disease. While it could be something relatively minor, it's important to rule out more serious conditions. I’m going to recommend a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test to assess your lung capacity. I’ll also write you a prescription for a medication to help lower your blood pressure. However, given your symptoms, I’m also referring you to a pulmonologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? A… pulmonologist? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Lung disease? I… I don't understand. I just usher at the theater. Is that… is that why I can't get the clearance? Will I… will I have to stop working? I really need that job, Doctor. It's… important to me. What does this all mean? And what’s a pulmonologist?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, please try to remain calm. A chest X-ray is a simple imaging test that will help us see if there are any abnormalities in your lungs. A pulmonologist is a specialist who focuses on lung health. I'm not saying you definitely have anything serious. I'm simply taking precautions to ensure your health and safety. As for the work clearance, we can't determine that until we have the results of the tests and a proper evaluation. It’s possible you’ll be able to continue working. But it’s also possible you may need to adjust your duties or take some time off. I understand this is concerning. But the sooner we get these tests done, the sooner we'll know what's going on and can develop a plan to address it. I will provide you with the necessary referrals and prescriptions. And I encourage you to ask any questions you have. Do you understand what I'm recommending?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. A chest X-ray… and a specialist. And… wait. I don’t have insurance, Doctor. I can’t afford any of this. I… I just have a small pension. It barely covers my rent. What am I going to do? I can’t afford a specialist. And what if they tell me I can’t work? Is there… is there anything else I can do? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I understand your financial concerns. Unfortunately, I cannot directly cover the costs of your medical care. However, I can provide you with information on local resources that may offer financial assistance or reduced-cost services. I will also write a letter explaining your situation to the pulmonologist, and we can inquire about any available charity care options. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a low-dose blood pressure medication to help manage your elevated readings. It's important to take this medication as directed, even if you can’t afford all the recommended tests. Here is the prescription. And I'll have my nurse provide you with a list of local resources. I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with a pulmonologist as soon as possible. Ignoring these symptoms could have serious consequences. Do you have any questions about the medication or the referrals?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. It's all… a bit overwhelming. Thank you, Doctor. For… trying. I appreciate it. But I don't know what I'm going to do. I just wanted to keep working. That's all. I think… I think that's all. Thank you again, Doctor.
