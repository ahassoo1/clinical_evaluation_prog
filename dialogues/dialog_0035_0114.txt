DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. I have trouble when I lie flat. It feels like… like something is pressing on me. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Maribeth. Difficulty breathing when lying flat is definitely something we want to look into. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it started… oh, maybe three months ago? It’s worse at night, definitely. I have to sleep propped up with… with three pillows now. It wasn’t like that before. And it feels… tight. Like a band around my chest. I don’t have any pain, just… difficulty.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months ago, worse at night, requires three pillows… and you describe it as tightness, not pain. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the breathing trouble?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I do cough a bit more than I used to, especially when I’m trying to lie down. Not a bad cough, just… a little tickle in my throat that makes me cough. And my ankles… they swell up some by the end of the day. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, both the cough and the ankle swelling are important things to know. Let’s talk about the cough first. Is it a dry cough, or do you bring anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly dry. Sometimes a little bit of… white stuff, but not much. It's not a productive cough, if that’s the right word. Just a little tickle and then a little… puff of white. It doesn’t bother me too much during the day, it’s just… there. Mostly happens when I’m trying to get comfortable at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly dry cough, a little white mucus, worse when lying down. And the ankle swelling… is it in both ankles, or just one?
PATIENT: Both ankles, Doctor. And it’s not terrible, mind you. Not like they’re huge. Just… puffier than they used to be. I notice it when I take my shoes off. I used to have very neat ankles, if you know what I mean. Now they’re… less neat. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is very helpful, Maribeth. You're describing things very clearly. Now, let’s go through some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you been having any chest pain at all, even a little bit?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Not a bit. That's why it’s so confusing to me. It’s not like I’m in pain, it just… feels hard to breathe when I lie flat. Like something is heavy. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but it’s getting harder. It’s making me… restless at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain, just the feeling of heaviness and difficulty breathing, causing restlessness. And you mentioned this has been going on for about three months and is getting worse. Now, have you noticed any shortness of breath when you’re walking or doing other activities during the day?
PATIENT: Not really. I walk a little bit, to the library mostly. I haven’t noticed any trouble walking. Or climbing stairs. It’s just… when I try to lie down. It feels like… well, like I’m suffocating a little. But I can breathe perfectly fine when I’m sitting up. Does that make any sense? I’m probably not explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Maribeth. You're explaining it very well. It sounds like the symptoms are very positional, which is important. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any heart problems?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I know of. I've had the usual things, a bit of arthritis in my hands, but nothing with my heart. My mother had high blood pressure, if that's important. And my father… well, he didn’t take very good care of himself. But no heart trouble that I know of, on my side of the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known heart problems yourself, mother had high blood pressure. Thank you. Have you ever had any surgery?
PATIENT: Just my gallbladder, years and years ago. 1987, I think it was. And… Oh, and a hysterectomy, a long time ago. Other than that, no. Nothing major. Nothing with my heart, definitely. I try to stay out of hospitals, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in 1987 and a hysterectomy. And you're generally healthy otherwise. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis. It’s called… Celebrex, I think. One pill a day. And sometimes, if my arthritis is really bothering me, I'll take Tylenol. But that’s it. Nothing for my heart, nothing for my breathing. I try to avoid taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Celebrex for arthritis and Tylenol as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can take penicillin, I can take… all sorts of things. I'm not a very allergic person. I'm lucky that way, I suppose. It's the breathing that's bothering me now, not allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even a puff. My husband… he smoked, but I always told him to do it outside. I never liked the smell of it. And I always worried about his lungs. No, I’ve never smoked a day in my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Thank you for all that information, Maribeth. It's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your ankles. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better. It’s getting harder to sleep, and I need my sleep. So, yes, please. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in for me… and exhale slowly. Okay, good. Now I'm going to listen on your back… another deep breath in… and out. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs sound relatively clear, although I do hear some mild congestion. Now, let's take a look at your ankles. I see a little bit of swelling, as you mentioned. And it's soft to the touch. It doesn’t feel particularly warm or painful. Okay. Thank you, Maribeth. That was helpful. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing heart failure. The congestion in your lungs, the ankle swelling, and the difficulty breathing when lying flat are all consistent with that. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm that diagnosis. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to start, and I also want to check your blood levels for a few things. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Heart failure? Oh dear. Well, if that's what it is, then I suppose we should find out. A chest X-ray and an EKG… yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. I just want to understand what’s going on. My mother… she had some trouble with her legs, but I don’t know if it was the same thing. Can you explain a little bit about what heart failure means? I don't want to just be given tests, I want to know what we're looking for.
DOCTOR: Of course, Maribeth. It’s completely understandable that you want to know more. Heart failure doesn't mean your heart has stopped working, it simply means it's not pumping blood as efficiently as it should. This can happen for a number of reasons, and it can lead to fluid building up in your lungs and other parts of your body, which is why you're experiencing shortness of breath and ankle swelling. The chest X-ray will help us see if there's fluid in your lungs, and the EKG will look at the electrical activity of your heart to see if there are any irregularities. We'll also check your blood levels for things like BNP, which is a marker of heart strain. I want to be clear that we don't have a definitive diagnosis yet, and these tests will help us figure out what's going on. If it is heart failure, there are many things we can do to manage it and improve your quality of life. It’s often treatable with medication and lifestyle changes. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: So, it's not… stopping, it’s just… weaker? And the tests will show how weak it is? And the medicine can help it… pump better? My mother… she was always tired. Is that… is that a symptom? Because I am tired, lately. More tired than usual. And I have to go to the bathroom more often at night. Is that connected too? I just… I don’t want to end up like my mother. She didn't want to go to the doctor, and… things got bad.
DOCTOR: You've asked very good questions, Maribeth. Yes, you’re right, it's not that the heart stops, it’s that it becomes weaker and has trouble pumping enough blood to meet your body’s needs. The tests will help us determine how weak it is, and if there are any underlying reasons for it. And yes, fatigue and needing to go to the bathroom more often at night can both be symptoms of heart failure. When your heart isn't pumping efficiently, fluid can build up in your body, which can lead to fatigue and also put pressure on your kidneys, making you need to urinate more frequently. It’s very good that you are coming to the doctor now. Your mother’s experience is understandable, and it’s important to remember that medical care has improved significantly. We have many more tools and treatments available now than we did in the past. We are going to work together to figure out what’s going on and get you the best possible care. I’m going to order those tests, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… very sensible. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. So, the tests… where will I go? And how long will they take? And will I have to… fast? I always get nervous about fasting. And… Will you tell me the results, or will someone else? I’d… I’d prefer to hear them from you, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Maribeth. I completely understand your concerns. The tests will be done right here at the clinic. You’ll go to the radiology department for the chest X-ray, which should only take about 15-20 minutes. You won’t need to fast for that one. The EKG will be done right here in the exam room, and it only takes about five minutes. You’ll lie on a table while some small stickers are placed on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. And yes, I will personally tell you the results. I always prefer to discuss these things with my patients directly. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from today, and we can go over everything then. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s all for now. Just… a week from today. I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor Alzoubi. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I just want to… feel better. That’s all. I suppose I should go then? And someone will come and… get me for the tests?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I'll have the nurse come in and give you the instructions for the tests and schedule you for the EKG and X-ray. She’ll also give you any paperwork you might need. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, Maribeth. I’m glad you came in, and we’ll do everything we can to help you feel better. Have a good day, and we’ll see you next week.
