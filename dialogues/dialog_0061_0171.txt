DOCTOR: Bula! And hello to you. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's lovely to meet you, Lacreasha. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Um... my nails. They just... look funny now. Not like they used to. I don't really... remember when they started lookin' this way, but it bothered me enough to come. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. "Nails look funny" is a perfectly good reason to come see a doctor! We'll figure out what's going on. You said you don't remember when they started changing… roughly, can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm... sometime after... well, I went to visit my cousin. In... Afghanistan, I think? Or was it Pakistan? It was hot. Lots of dust. Before that, they were fine. Regular polish, you know? Now... they're kinda... thick? And yellow-ish. Not a pretty yellow.
DOCTOR: Okay, so changes noticed after a trip to Afghanistan or Pakistan, with a lot of dust exposure. And you've noticed they’re thicker and have a yellowish discoloration. That’s helpful. Just to be clear, are all of your nails affected, or just some of them?
PATIENT: Ugh, all of 'em. Every single one. It's... annoying, really. I used to take pride in my hands. Now look at 'em! Not like I do much with my hands these days, anyway. Just... listenin' to people's ears all day. It's a lonely job, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when something changes with your body that bothers you, especially when it affects something you take pride in. And a lonely job makes it even harder. "Listening to people's ears"… you’re an audiologist, correct?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That's right. Audiologist. People come in complainin' about ringin' or not hearin' and I... poke around in their ears. It's not glamorous. But it pays the bills. Look, are you gonna... do somethin' about my nails, or just ask me questions all day?
DOCTOR: I am getting to the "doing something" part, I promise! The questions help me understand what might be going on and rule out different possibilities. Given the yellowing, thickening, and that it started after travel with dust exposure, a fungal infection is a strong possibility. I’d like to take a closer look, if that’s alright with you. I'll need to do a quick physical exam of your nails. We might also want to send a clipping to the lab to confirm if it's a fungus. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fungus? Oh, lovely. Just what I needed. Is that... contagious? I don't wanna give it to anyone. And lab? Sounds expensive. Do I have to pay for that? My Medicare... covers things, right? I forget. It's all so confusing.
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Lacreasha. Let's address them one by one. Yes, fungal nail infections can be contagious, but it’s not super common. We’ll take precautions to avoid spreading it. And the lab test… Medicare should cover it, but we’ll double-check with your insurance just to be sure. There might be a small co-pay, depending on your plan. Now, let's have a look at your nails. Could you please sit back and extend your hands, palms up?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. I got things to do, you know? People don't just stop needing their ears listened to because I'm here gettin' my nails poked at. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just taking a look at the thickness, the color, and looking for any crumbling or separation from the nail bed. I see some lifting of the nail on several fingers, and the yellow discoloration is quite pronounced. The texture is definitely thicker than normal. It looks like it is affecting all ten nails, as you mentioned. Do you experience any pain or discomfort with your nails?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. It's just... ugly. And kinda rough. Makes it hard to pick at things sometimes. I used to bite my nails, but... haven't done that in ages. It doesn't hurt, though. Just annoying. Like a pebble in your shoe, you know?
DOCTOR: "A pebble in your shoe" is a perfect way to describe it. Okay, so no pain, just discoloration and roughness. Given the physical exam findings and your history, I am highly suspicious of onychomycosis, which is the medical term for a fungal nail infection. To confirm this, I’d like to take a small clipping from one or two of your nails to send to the lab for a fungal culture. It’s a quick and relatively painless procedure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. More clippings? Is this really necessary? I mean, it looks like a fungus, right? Can't you just... give me somethin' for it? I don't wanna be poked and prodded all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lacreasha. You’re right, it looks like a fungus. But there are other conditions that can mimic a fungal infection – psoriasis, trauma, even certain types of nail deformity. It’s important to get an accurate diagnosis before starting any treatment. Treatments for fungal infections can take months, and some have potential side effects. It’s best to be sure we're treating the right thing. The lab test is the most reliable way to confirm the diagnosis and ensure we choose the most effective treatment for you. The clipping is tiny, and it doesn't usually cause any discomfort. Would you be willing to let me take just one small clipping to send off?
PATIENT: Ugh... fine. Just... get it over with quickly. And gently! I don't wanna bleed all over the place. Just promise me you won't take too much. And you better have a band-aid.
DOCTOR: I promise, just a tiny piece. And of course, I have a band-aid. There, all done. It barely stings, right?
PATIENT: Mm-hmm. Barely. Don't make a big deal out of it. Now, what happens while we're waitin' for this... lab result? Can I still see patients? I got a schedule to keep, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, you can still see patients. The lab result usually takes about 2-3 weeks. While we’re waiting, we can discuss treatment options in general. The most common treatment for onychomycosis is either topical antifungal medication, which you apply to the nail yourself, or oral antifungal medication, which you take by mouth. Oral medications are more effective but have more potential side effects, so we'll consider your overall health and preferences when deciding. Also, there are some lifestyle measures you can take – keeping your nails short and dry can help prevent the infection from spreading. Do you have any questions about either of those treatment options at this point?
PATIENT: Lifestyle measures... keep 'em short and dry? That's it? Sounds kinda silly. Oral medication... no, no, I don't like the sound of that. Side effects? I got enough problems without addin' more. Topical... is that like polish? Can I still wear regular polish over it? I got a wedding next month, you know. Need my nails to look nice.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions. "Keep 'em short and dry" isn't a cure, but it helps create a less favorable environment for the fungus to grow and can prevent spreading it. It's a good supporting measure. Topical medication is applied like a polish, yes. You typically file the nail surface to allow the medication to penetrate better, then apply it once or twice a day. As for wearing regular polish over it… that’s a little tricky. Regular polish can create a barrier that prevents the antifungal medication from reaching the infected nail. It’s best to avoid it while you’re using the topical treatment, if possible. However, for a special occasion like your wedding, you might be able to apply polish a day or two beforehand and then resume the medication afterwards. It won’t completely negate the treatment, but it might slow it down slightly. We can discuss the best approach closer to the wedding date. Do you have any allergies to medications or nail products that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies... hmm. I think I had a rash once from somethin' red. Nail polish, maybe? Or was it lipstick? I don't remember. I just stopped usin' it. And I think my cousin, the one in... wherever, she said I get hives from penicillin. But that was ages ago. Honestly, I forget most things. What kind of polish is this stuff, anyway? Does it smell bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, rash from something red, possibly nail polish or lipstick, and a history of hives from penicillin. I’ll make a note of those allergies. The antifungal polish comes in different formulations. Some do have a slightly medicinal smell, but it’s usually not very strong. It's not like the strong scent of regular polish. There are also some formulations that are odorless. We can see what’s available and find one that you tolerate best. Before prescribing anything, I’d like to get a more detailed allergy history, if you don’t mind. Can you recall specifically what happened when you had the reaction?
PATIENT: Oh, it was years ago. Red lipstick, I think. My lips got all puffy and itchy. I stopped usin' it right away. My cousin gave it to me, she always buys weird stuff. I just figured I was sensitive to somethin' in it. Honestly, I don't remember much else. It was just puffy lips, and I didn't wanna kiss anyone, so I threw it away. Can we just skip the history? I got people waitin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No problem. Given the puffy lips with red lipstick, it sounds like you may have a contact allergy to something in it. It's good you stopped using it. We'll avoid anything with similar ingredients. So, for now, let's focus on the fungal infection. We’ll send off the nail clipping, and once we have the results, we can discuss the best treatment options. I'm leaning towards starting with a topical antifungal medication, given your preference to avoid oral medications. I’ll give you a prescription for a broad-spectrum topical antifungal polish to start, just in case the lab confirms our suspicions. It's best to start treatment as soon as possible. Do you have any questions about applying the polish, or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: A broad-spectrum polish... sounds complicated. How often do I have to put it on? And do I have to file my nails? I don't wanna make 'em too short. And... can I still get a manicure? Even if I gotta wait a little bit? I just... like havin' nice nails. It makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions! “Broad-spectrum” just means it works against a wide range of fungi. It's not complicated at all. You typically file the nail surface once a week to help the medication penetrate better. You don't have to file them too short, just thin the surface slightly. Think of it like prepping the nail for polish. As for manicures… it's best to avoid them while you're undergoing treatment, as the tools can introduce bacteria and potentially spread the infection. And the polish, as we discussed, can create a barrier. However, once the infection has cleared, you can definitely get a manicure again! For now, let's focus on getting those nails healthy. I’m giving you instructions on how to apply the polish. Do you have any questions about these instructions?
PATIENT: Oh, great. Tiny print. And lots of words. I guess I can try. File once a week... polish twice a day... no manicures... It sounds like a lot of work. Can't you just give me somethin' stronger? Like, a pill? Just one? For a week? It'll be easier, I promise.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lacreasha. It does sound like a lot of work, and you’re right, a pill would be much easier. However, oral antifungals can have side effects, including liver problems and interactions with other medications. We need to consider your overall health and weigh the risks and benefits carefully. Given your concerns about side effects, I really believe starting with the topical treatment is the best approach. We can monitor your progress and if the topical treatment isn't effective after several weeks, we can revisit the discussion about oral medication. But let’s give the topical treatment a fair chance first, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. But if this doesn't work... you're gonna have to give me somethin' else. I don't like havin' ugly nails. It just... makes me feel bad. Okay, I guess I'll try it. For now. Can I go now? People are waitin'.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You can go now. I understand your frustration, and I'm here to help you every step of the way. We'll monitor your progress, and if the topical treatment isn’t effective, we'll discuss other options. Here’s the prescription, and remember to follow the instructions carefully. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a lovely day, Lacreasha. And I hope your patients are doing well.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome! And goodbye to you too, Lacreasha. Take care!
