DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I'm Dr. Deschane. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks. My heart... it feels funny sometimes. Like it's racing, but not right. It's been happening for... I don't know, maybe a month now?
DOCTOR: “Funny” isn’t terribly specific, Mr. Puder. Can you elaborate?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. It's like... flutters. Like a bird in my chest. Not painful, just... weird. And fast. Really fast for a few seconds, then goes back to normal. Happens when I'm just sitting, sometimes when I walk. Not when I work, though. I work with the machines, very busy all the time. Does that make more sense?
DOCTOR: It's a start. And you said it's been happening for about a month?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer. It started slow, just once or twice a week. Now it's... more. Maybe two or three times a day. Not all day, just little bursts. My wife, she says I look tired, too. But I sleep okay, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do these episodes happen at any specific time of day, or are they completely random?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really a time. I notice them more when I stop moving, I think. Like, if I'm walking and then I sit down… boom. Or if I'm resting, and then I stand up. But not always. Sometimes when I'm just… there. It's hard to say for sure. Not really a pattern, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from this fluttering sensation and feeling tired, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I don't get short of breath. No chest pain. Not dizzy. Just… tired. And maybe a little… worried, to be honest. It’s just… strange feeling. Like something is not right. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? No, not that I noticed. My wife, she would say something if she saw it, right? She notices things. No, no swelling. I wear work boots all day, so… hard to tell maybe? But I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I've always been pretty healthy, I think. I work hard, eat okay… Never been to a doctor much, to be honest. This is… new for me.
DOCTOR: And has anyone in your family had heart problems—high blood pressure, heart attacks, arrhythmias, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… My father, he had… pressure, I think. High blood pressure, yes. He took pills for it, for many years. But that was… a long time ago. And my grandmother… she had something wrong with her heart, but I don't remember what. Old age, mostly. Not much else, I don't think. My mother was healthy. And my siblings… they're all okay, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I don’t need them. Just… work, eat, sleep. That’s me. I drink coffee, of course, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your pulse and blood pressure. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 135/85, which is slightly elevated. Your pulse is 88 and regular, but somewhat fast. I’m hearing a slight irregularity in your heart rhythm, a premature atrial contraction, or PAC. It's subtle, but it’s there. Your lungs are clear. Now, let’s just quickly check your ankles for any swelling. No swelling present.
PATIENT: Okay. Irregular? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… bad? My heart, is it broken?
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions, Mr. Puder. “Irregular” doesn’t necessarily mean “broken.” Many things can cause an irregular heartbeat, and most are not immediately life-threatening. A PAC, or premature atrial contraction, is essentially an extra beat that happens occasionally. Sometimes it’s triggered by stress, caffeine, or dehydration. But given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the fact that you're experiencing these palpitations, I want to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order an EKG – an electrocardiogram – to get a more detailed look at your heart’s electrical activity. And I'd also like a basic blood panel to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and thyroid levels. This will help me determine the cause of your symptoms and create an appropriate treatment plan. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay… EKG and blood. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Will the tests… hurt? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: The EKG is completely painless, Mr. Puder. We simply place some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure the electrical activity of your heart. It takes just a few minutes. The blood work will involve a small needle prick in your arm, which may cause a slight discomfort, but it's very quick. The results usually take a couple of days to come back from the lab. Once I have those, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend cutting back on caffeine – even just a little – and staying well-hydrated. Also, try to manage any stress you might be experiencing. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Cutting back on coffee… that will be hard. But I can try. Stress… yes, work is busy. Okay. Will the tests… tell me if I need pills? Is that what will happen? That’s what I’m most worried about, I think.
DOCTOR: It might lead to medication, Mr. Puder, but that’s not necessarily the case. The tests will give us information, and based on that information, we’ll make a decision together. If your blood pressure remains elevated and the EKG shows something concerning, medication could be an option. However, lifestyle changes – reducing stress, improving your diet, and staying active – can often make a significant difference. We'll explore all options before resorting to pills. I also want to stress – no pun intended – that waiting and seeing isn’t a good strategy here, given the irregular heartbeat. It’s better to be proactive and understand what’s going on. I’ll have my nurse come in and draw the blood now and schedule the EKG. Do you have any other questions before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think… that’s all, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you… explaining everything.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll leave you to it, then. Don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms while we wait for the results. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Puder.
PATIENT: .
