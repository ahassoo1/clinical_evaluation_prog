DOCTOR: Hi Enrique, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I... well, my face gets red. A lot. Like, flushing. It’s been happening for… a long time now, I think. Maybe a few months? Hard to say exactly. It just comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of flushing, coming and going. That's helpful. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. When… okay. It’s not always the same. Sometimes it happens after I eat. Spicy food, mostly. But not always spicy food. And sometimes… just when I’m talking. Or… feeling a little warm, you know? Not a fever warm, just… warm. It’s strange. I don't know what sets it off, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be triggered by both eating – especially spicy foods, but not exclusively – and sometimes just with talking or feeling warm. That’s good information. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Better… let me think. Cool air helps. A fan, or going into a cooler room. And… sitting down. When I'm standing, it seems worse. And… drinking water. Water always makes it a little better, I think. Not right away, but after a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, cool air, sitting, and water seem to help. That's useful to know. Have you noticed anything else happening when your face flushes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… my heart feels like it’s beating faster. Not a racing heart, just… thump-thump-thump a little stronger. And… I get a little sweaty. Just my face, mostly. Not all over, just where my face is red. It doesn’t last long, though. Just while the flushing is happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased heart rate and some facial sweating during the flushing episodes. Have you been experiencing any dizziness or lightheadedness along with these symptoms?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no. Not really. I don't think so. Sometimes… a little shaky, maybe? When it happens and I'm talking to people. Like, nervous shaky. But not… spinning or anything. Just… a little tremble. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t feel like I’m going to fall or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, but some shakiness when flushing happens, especially when talking. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all, even if they don't seem connected?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… now that you mention it… my sleep hasn’t been very good. I wake up a lot. And… sometimes I feel a little… worried. Just general worry. It’s been worse lately, I think. But I don't know if that’s connected to the flushing. I lost my wife last year, you see. It’s… been hard.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. That must be incredibly difficult. And yes, stress and worry can absolutely affect physical symptoms. Okay, so we’ve got flushing, sometimes triggered by food or feeling warm, with increased heart rate, facial sweating, shakiness, and some trouble sleeping, along with increased worry since your loss. Now, to get a better picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. Honestly. Not since my wife got sick. She… she did all the doctor things. I don’t have any big problems, I don’t think. No diabetes, no heart trouble… I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit about twenty years ago. And… I don't drink much alcohol. Just a little wine sometimes, with dinner. I do take a little medicine for my blood pressure, but it's a small dose. The doctor gave it to me a few years ago. That’s all I can think of, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major medical problems, quit smoking 20 years ago, occasional wine, and you take medication for blood pressure. Do you remember the name of that blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me see… my wife used to keep track of all that. I think… it was a little white pill. I don't remember the name, sorry. I just know I take it every morning. The pharmacy sends it to me, so I don't have to worry about it. I can show you the bottle, if that helps? It's in my bag.
DOCTOR: Yes, if you don’t mind, showing me the bottle would be very helpful. While you’re getting that, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Okay, one moment. Here. As for allergies… not that I know of. I eat everything. Never had a problem with food or anything. And… no allergies to medicine, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Let me see… Lisinopril. 10 milligrams. That's good to know. And no known allergies. Now, just to finish up, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father had… heart trouble, I think. He died when I was young. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, like me. And… my sister has diabetes. That’s all I really know. We didn't talk about health much, you see. It wasn't something we did. I don’t think anyone else had any big problems. Mostly, everyone just… got old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble in your father, high blood pressure in your mother, and diabetes in your sister. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your face. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I hope it’s not anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. That’s something we should keep an eye on. I see some flushing on your face, mostly around your cheeks and nose. Is this redness typical of what you experience?
PATIENT: Yes, that's usually where it is. Sometimes it spreads a little, but mostly just my cheeks and nose. It's hard to say how red it gets, you know? I don't see it on myself. It feels warm, though. Always warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it feels warm and is mostly on your cheeks and nose. Given your symptoms – the flushing, increased heart rate, shakiness, trouble sleeping, and worry, along with a slightly elevated blood pressure – and considering your history, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms related to anxiety and potentially rosacea. Rosacea can cause facial flushing, redness, and bumps. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function and rule out any other underlying medical causes for your symptoms. I'll also recommend seeing a dermatologist to confirm a diagnosis of rosacea and discuss treatment options. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay… anxiety and rosacea… That… doesn't sound too bad, I suppose. But tests… okay. If you think it’s best. And a… dermatologist? What do they do? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Enrique. A dermatologist is a doctor who specializes in skin conditions. They can take a closer look at your skin, confirm whether you have rosacea, and recommend treatments like topical creams or other therapies to help manage the flushing and redness. They can also rule out other skin conditions. The blood tests are just to be thorough and rule out other potential causes. So, I’ll write you a referral to a dermatologist, and I'll also give you a lab order for the blood tests. We can discuss the results when you've had them done. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend practicing some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises or meditation. And getting regular sleep and staying hydrated are important too. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Relaxation… deep breathing… okay. I can try that. I used to… well, my wife used to do yoga. Maybe I can look up some videos online. No, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for not making me feel like I'm crazy. I guess I'll go find a dermatologist.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Enrique. It's my job to listen and help you feel better. And you're definitely not crazy. It's good you came in to get this checked out. Here are the referral and lab order. The receptionist will help you schedule an appointment with the dermatologist and get the blood tests done. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, taking care of yourself, both physically and mentally, is important. Have a good day, Enrique. And take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
