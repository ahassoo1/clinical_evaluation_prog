DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Sherion. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... it’s my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It feels like… a tight squeezing, sometimes. Like someone is holding it real tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight squeezing. That's helpful. And you said it's not constant, but enough to worry you. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? Let me think. It doesn't happen when I'm resting. Always when I’m… doing something. Like, yesterday, I was gardening. Pulling weeds, you know? And then… oof… there it was. And the day before, I was walking up the stairs… same thing. Not when I'm sitting and watching TV, though. Never then.
DOCTOR: So it seems to be brought on by activity… gardening, walking stairs. That’s good information. Does the pain radiate anywhere – does it spread to your arm, your jaw, your back, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes! Sometimes… my left arm. It feels… achy. Not a sharp pain, just… heavy and achy. And… sometimes my jaw feels a little funny. Like it’s tight too. But not always. Just sometimes with the chest squeezing. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherion, it’s good you’re telling me all this. The arm and jaw discomfort along with the chest pain is something we need to explore further. Now, on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain you can imagine, how would you rate this chest pain when it happens?
PATIENT: One to ten… hmm. It's not like a broken bone or anything, Doctor. I've broken a wrist before, and this isn’t that bad. I’d say… maybe a five? Sometimes six, when I'm walking up the stairs and really pushing myself. But usually around a five. It's scary, that's why I came. It just feels… wrong.
DOCTOR: A five or six with activity. Okay. And how long does the pain usually last when it occurs?
PATIENT: Not long, Doctor. Maybe… five minutes? Sometimes ten if I keep going. Like, when I was gardening, I kept pulling weeds even though it hurt a little, and it lasted longer. But if I stop what I’m doing and rest… it goes away pretty quick. Like magic. But then I worry it will come back!
DOCTOR: That’s important – it resolves with rest. Now, Sherion, do you have any shortness of breath with this pain, or any nausea, sweating, or dizziness when it happens?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness or sweating. I don’t think so… not that I noticed. I do get a little… breathless sometimes when I’m walking up the stairs, but I always figured that’s just 'cause I'm getting old! I get winded real easy. But I don’t feel sick to my stomach or anything like that. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me think… the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high a few years ago. He put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. It made me feel… funny. And my husband, Miguel, he says my cholesterol is high, but I haven’t really been to the doctor for a long time. No diabetes, though. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure and your husband mentioning high cholesterol. And no known diabetes. Now, Sherion, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I took penicillin as a kid, and I don't remember having a reaction. I get itchy sometimes, but I just thought that was the weather! No real bad reactions to anything. Miguel says I'm a tough old lady!
DOCTOR: Well, Miguel sounds like a smart man! And good to know about no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. It's just… this chest pain worries me. So, listen to my heart, whatever you need. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just have a seat here for me. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please, just relax and breathe normally. Okay… heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Not alarming, but something to keep in mind. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a bit elevated – 148 over 92. And your pulse is 88 and regular. Now, I'm just going to palpate your chest wall, just to make sure there isn't any tenderness. No tenderness to palpation. Everything feels normal there. Alright, Sherion, based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing angina. That's chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. Your symptoms – the squeezing pain brought on by activity, radiating to your arm and jaw – are consistent with that. But we need to do some further testing to confirm that diagnosis. I’m going to order an EKG and some blood work. The blood work will check your cholesterol levels and look for any markers of heart damage. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Angina? Is that… bad? And an EKG and blood work… oh dear. Sounds serious. But… if you think it’s important, Doctor, then yes. Do whatever you need to do. My husband, Miguel, will be very worried, but I'll tell him everything. Just… tell me what to expect. What happens during this EKG? And what are you looking for in the blood work?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking questions, Sherion. Angina can be serious, but it's also very manageable with the right treatment. Think of it like a warning sign – your heart is telling you it needs more oxygen during exertion. The EKG – that’s an electrocardiogram – it's a simple, painless test. We'll put some sticky patches on your chest, arms, and legs, and it records the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us see if there are any abnormalities in your heart rhythm or evidence of past heart damage. As for the blood work, we're looking at a few things. Your cholesterol levels, of course, to see if that's contributing. We’ll also check for something called troponin, which is released into the bloodstream when there’s damage to the heart muscle. Elevated troponin levels could suggest a heart attack, but it's important to remember that doesn't necessarily mean you're having one right now. It just gives us more information. We'll get those results back within a few days, and then we can discuss the best course of treatment. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity. And if you experience any chest pain that's severe, doesn't go away with rest, or is accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… no strenuous activity. And if it gets really bad, go to the emergency room. I understand. No troponin… that’s good, right? And the sticky patches… that doesn’t sound too bad. My Miguel will be happy I'm getting it checked out, he worries a lot. He's a good man. So… what kind of treatment are we talking about, if it is angina? Pills? Surgery? Oh dear…
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking, Sherion. And no, elevated troponin wouldn’t be good, but we're just being thorough. Let's not jump ahead to worst-case scenarios. Most people with angina are treated with medication. Typically, we'll start with pills to help lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, and medications to help widen the blood vessels in your heart, allowing more oxygen to reach the muscle. Surgery is usually reserved for more severe cases, where medications aren't enough. If your arteries are severely blocked, we might recommend a procedure called an angioplasty or a bypass surgery. But again, let’s wait for the test results before we discuss that further. For now, let's focus on getting the EKG and blood work done. I'll have my nurse come in and get you set up. She'll explain everything in detail. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. You've explained it very clearly. I'm still a little worried, but I feel better knowing what to expect. Thank you for listening to me, and for not making me feel silly about worrying. And tell your nurse to be patient with me, I'm not very good with these things!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherion. And you weren't silly at all. It's always better to be safe and get things checked out. I'll let my nurse, Maria, know to take extra time with you. She’s wonderful. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, just relax and try not to worry. Everything will be okay.
