DOCTOR: Hi Rayshun, welcome. I'm Dr. Valerie Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Hernandez. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue. I am here today regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the requirement for masks and other protective equipment… and a possible exemption, if that is possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Rayshun. That's perfectly reasonable. It sounds like you’re asking about a medical exemption related to a workplace mask requirement. To best understand if an exemption is appropriate, I’ll need some more information. Let me just pull up your record here… Okay, I see you're 47 years old. Do you have any underlying medical conditions – anything at all – that might make wearing a mask difficult or problematic?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is correct. And thank you for pulling up my record. Regarding medical conditions... well, I have always had very sensitive lungs. As a child, I was often sick with pneumonia and bronchitis. Though it’s been many years, I still find that breathing in things – dust, strong smells, even cold air – can cause me significant discomfort. It’s not a formally diagnosed condition now, if that matters, but it has always been a part of my life. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly for it, as it hasn't usually been severe enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, a history of sensitive lungs and frequent respiratory infections as a child, with ongoing sensitivity to irritants like dust and cold air. And you haven't had a formal diagnosis, but it continues to impact you. Just to clarify, when you say "discomfort," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels... tight in my chest, Doctor. And I cough, usually a dry cough, and sometimes it feels like I am struggling to get enough air. It doesn't happen all the time, but it is more likely when the air is cold or if there’s something in the air. It can make me feel anxious, honestly, because it reminds me of being a child and feeling so sick. It hasn't been serious enough to require hospitalization or anything, but it is not comfortable, and it does worry me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so chest tightness, a dry cough, and a feeling of shortness of breath triggered by irritants, and it causes some anxiety because of past experiences. That’s very good information. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked. My mother… she had a very bad experience with smoking, and I have always avoided it. I also work with children, and it would be irresponsible of me to even consider it. I try to be very mindful of my health, even if I haven’t always seen a doctor about everything.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And it's responsible of you to consider your health, especially working with children. Alright. Have you noticed any recent changes in your breathing or cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing recent. It’s been pretty consistent over the years. It flares up sometimes, calms down sometimes… but nothing dramatically different. It’s the thought of being required to wear a mask for extended periods at work that has me concerned. I worry it would make it worse, and I worry about potentially exposing the children I work with if it does.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, you're concerned about the potential impact of prolonged mask wearing on your existing respiratory sensitivities and the possibility of exacerbating your symptoms, and the risk to the children you work with. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen saturation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. Listening to my lungs and checking my oxygen sounds very helpful. Please, proceed when you are ready. I would like to get this matter resolved, if possible.
DOCTOR: Great. Please, if you could just sit back and relax. Take some deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. I’m going to listen to your lungs in a few different spots. It might be a little cool, just for a moment. Okay. I'm hearing some mild wheezing, especially on exhale. It's not significant, but it's present. Your oxygen saturation is 98%, which is good. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any recent fever, chills, or body aches?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, chills, or body aches. I have felt perfectly healthy otherwise. A little anxious about this situation, naturally, but otherwise, I feel well. I have been very careful to avoid getting sick, especially with everything that has been going around.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So, no systemic symptoms. Based on your history, the examination findings, and your overall presentation, it’s plausible that prolonged mask wearing could exacerbate your respiratory sensitivities. However, a definitive answer requires some further investigation. I recommend a pulmonary function test, or PFT, to assess your lung capacity and airflow. This will give us a more objective measure of your lung function and help us determine if you have any underlying lung disease. Would you be willing to pursue that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. If that is what is needed to get a clear answer, then I am willing to pursue a pulmonary function test. I want to be responsible, both to myself and to the children I work with. A clear answer would be very helpful. Where would that be done, and what is involved?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. The PFT can be done at the Rural Community Hospital, about 20 minutes from here. They have a dedicated pulmonary department. It involves breathing into a mouthpiece connected to a machine that measures how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly you can do it. It's a non-invasive test, and it usually takes about 30-45 minutes. I will send a referral to them electronically, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, to protect yourself and the children you work with, I recommend continuing to practice good hand hygiene and avoiding close contact with anyone who is sick. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Scheduling an appointment at the Rural Community Hospital sounds good. And I will certainly continue to practice good hygiene. Is there anything else you need from me today, or any paperwork I need to fill out?
DOCTOR: No, I don't believe so. I've sent the referral, and they will contact you to schedule the PFT. I will also include a note for the pulmonologist outlining your history and my concerns. I'll document everything we've discussed today. Once you have the results of the PFT, please contact me, and we can review them together and discuss the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not believe I do. You have answered all of my questions thoroughly, and I appreciate your time and consideration very much. I feel much better having taken this step. Thank you again, Doctor Hernandez. I will contact you once I have the results of the PFT.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshun. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as increased chest tightness, shortness of breath, or fever, please seek medical attention immediately. Get that test done and get back to me. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: You as well, Doctor Hernandez. Thank you again for your kindness and professionalism.
