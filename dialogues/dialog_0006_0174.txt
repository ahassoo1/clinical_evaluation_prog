DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. I'm Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly? It's…well, it’s a long story. I suppose it's just…feeling down. Very down. I haven’t been myself for a while now, and I thought it best to get it checked. I don’t want to waste your time, truly.
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s my job. Feeling down…okay. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been…a good six months, I’d say. Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, you know? Just…less enjoyment in things. Then it got…worse. I used to love my garden, absolutely love it. Now…it just feels like a chore.
DOCTOR: Six months…less enjoyment…okay. Any other changes you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Well…my appetite isn't what it used to be. I find myself not wanting to eat, even the foods I enjoy. And…I haven't been sleeping well. I wake up a lot during the night, and then I can't get back to sleep. It’s very frustrating. I try to go to bed at a reasonable hour, but… It doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: Okay, changes in appetite and sleep... I see. Have you noticed any difficulty concentrating, or maybe feeling more tired than usual, even before accounting for the sleep issues?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Absolutely. It’s…like my brain is foggy. I used to be very sharp, you know? I kept up with current events, I read a lot. Now…I find myself rereading the same page several times and not remembering what I’ve read. And I get tired so easily. A little bit of activity, and I'm exhausted. It's…disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I…I’ve lost some weight. Not a tremendous amount, but enough that my clothes feel…looser. I haven’t been intentionally trying to lose weight, of course. Quite the opposite, actually. It’s a bit worrying, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you taking any medications currently, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Just the usual. Something for my blood pressure, a very small dose. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I’ll take ibuprofen. Nothing else, I assure you. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s see… And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No allergies that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Though, I do get a bit itchy when I'm around cats, but that's just a sensitivity, not an allergy, I don't believe. A minor thing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, a bit of a personal question, but has anything particularly stressful happened in the last six months or so?
PATIENT: Well… my divorce was finalized about eight months ago now. It was… a long time coming, and perhaps it’s just taking a toll on me. It wasn’t a pleasant split, Doctor. A very unpleasant one. I try not to dwell on it, but…it’s difficult. It’s very difficult to just erase thirty years of life.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very challenging. Alright, Mrs. Derasmo, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better overall picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel…better.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could just step up here and lie down for me, that would be wonderful. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look in your ears and throat. Your heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly concerning for your age. Throat looks fine, ears are clear. Blood pressure is 138/75, which is slightly elevated, but consistent with your usual readings. Based on what you've told me and this brief exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. It's important to remember that this isn't a sign of weakness, and it's very treatable.
PATIENT: Depression… I… I suppose I suspected as much. It just…doesn’t feel like me. I used to be so strong, so independent. Now, I find myself just…existing. Treatable, you say? What…what does that involve, Doctor? I’m willing to try anything to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely treatable. There are a few different avenues we can explore. Often, a combination of therapy – talking to someone to work through your feelings – and medication can be very effective. We could start with a low dose of an antidepressant to help regulate your mood, and I can refer you to a therapist in the area who specializes in grief and divorce. Would that be something you'd be open to?
PATIENT: Therapy… and medication. Yes, I think I am. I’ve always been a bit hesitant about taking pills, but… if it helps, then I suppose I have no objections. And a therapist who understands…grief and divorce… that sounds very… comforting. Yes, Doctor, please. I would be very grateful for both.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I'm going to write you a prescription for a low dose of sertraline. It’s an SSRI, and it's generally well-tolerated. I'll also print out a list of local therapists, along with their contact information and specialties. It’s best to call a few and see who you feel most comfortable with. I want you to start the sertraline as directed, and schedule an appointment with a therapist within the next week or two. It's important to be patient – it can take a few weeks to see the full effects of the medication. And, if you have any concerning side effects, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Sertraline… I see. A few weeks… patience… Yes, I understand. No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment, Doctor. Just…thank you. Truly. You’ve given me a little bit of hope. Perhaps… perhaps I can start to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I certainly hope so, Mrs. Derasmo. Remember, you're not alone in this. And we're here to support you every step of the way. I'll see you back in a month to check on your progress. Don't hesitate to call if anything comes up before then. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Gorga. You as well. I believe I will.
