DOCTOR: Good morning, Zoie. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Well, it’s… it’s a little hard to explain. Things just aren't working like they used to, down there. You know... when I gotta go. It's like... it takes a long time, and it's not as strong as it once was. My husband, he says I take forever in the bathroom now! He’s a good man, always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re experiencing some changes with your urinary function – difficulty starting, a weak stream, and perhaps taking longer to empty your bladder?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds right. Difficulty... that’s a good word. It is difficult. And it's... frustrating, I guess. I don’t remember it ever being this way before, but then again, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Is that… bad? Is something seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned when things change, Zoie, and it's good you came in to discuss this. Changes in urinary function can have a number of causes, and it’s important to figure out what’s going on. It’s not necessarily serious, but we need to investigate. To help me understand better, could you tell me a little more about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm... how long? Oh dear. That’s a tricky one. I think… maybe a few months? Or maybe longer. It came on slowly, you see. Not all at once. My husband noticed it before I did, I think. He’s very observant. I really don’t know exactly, though. It just... gradually got harder. Does that make sense? I don't keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Gradual changes can be hard to pinpoint. A few months is a helpful starting point. Now, besides the difficulty and weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Not really. I mean, I get up at night sometimes to go to the bathroom, but I always have. Old age, you know? And… sometimes I feel like I haven’t emptied my bladder completely, even after I’ve gone. Just a little bit left, like a dribble. But that might just be my imagination. I do have a little trouble sleeping, but I think that's just because I’m getting older. Is that what you mean by symptoms?
DOCTOR: Those are all helpful things to know, Zoie. Getting up at night to urinate and feeling like you don't completely empty your bladder are definitely symptoms we should consider. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, my… medical history. Well, my doctor always tells me to watch my salt, so maybe something with my blood? I've been to a lot of doctors over the years, you see. They all say the same things, mostly. I don't have the diabetes, I think. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps track of all that. I take pills for my heart, though. Something… a water pill, I think? And something for my blood pressure, but I can’t remember the name. It’s all a bit of a blur, dear. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all, Zoie. It’s perfectly understandable. Many people find it difficult to keep track of everything. Knowing you take medication for your heart and blood pressure is helpful. Do you mind if I ask about any surgeries you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. And… I think I had a hysterectomy when I was young, but that was a long time ago. And… I might have had something on my knee, but I’m not sure. It was a small one, I think. Nothing major. Honestly, it was so long ago, and there were so many. I don’t remember the details very well. My memory is just… not what it used to be, dear.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Zoie. Knowing about the gallbladder, hysterectomy, and possible knee surgery is a good start. We can always look through your records if you'd like. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s a good question. My mother… she had problems with her heart, I think. And my brother, he had the diabetes. But other than that, I don't really know. My family wasn't really one for talking about illnesses, you see. We just… dealt with things. And there were so many of us, it’s hard to keep track. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. It’s just all a bit of a blur, dear.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Zoie. Knowing about your mother’s heart problems and your brother's diabetes is helpful information. Finally, can you tell me about any allergies you have, and if you currently smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had any bad reactions to anything. No, no allergies. And… I used to enjoy a little glass of wine with dinner, but my doctor told me to stop. So, no alcohol anymore. And I certainly don't smoke. Never have. My husband, he used to smoke, but he quit years ago. Thank goodness for that. So, no smoking and no drinking, dear. Just trying to stay healthy as best I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie, that gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a gentle pelvic exam to assess the function of your bladder and pelvic muscles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Oh dear. I haven't had one of those in… well, a very long time. Is it necessary? I understand you need to check things, but… it just feels a little… intrusive, you know? Is there anything else you could do first? Perhaps just listening to my heart and lungs?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Zoie. A pelvic exam can feel uncomfortable, and it’s perfectly okay to feel anxious about it. It’s true, we can start with listening to your heart and lungs and checking your abdomen. However, to properly assess what’s going on with your bladder, a pelvic exam is the most helpful next step. It allows me to check for any tenderness, assess the strength of your pelvic floor muscles, and rule out any other potential causes of your symptoms. We can take things very slowly and gently, and I will explain everything I’m doing beforehand. You are in complete control, and we can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. I want to assure you that my goal is to provide the best possible care while respecting your comfort and dignity. Would you be willing to consider it with those assurances?
PATIENT: Well… if you say it’s necessary… and if you promise to be very gentle… and if I can stop at any time… Okay. Alright. But please, go slowly. And explain everything. I just… I get nervous, you see. It's been a long time. And I don't want any surprises. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Thank you for trusting me, Zoie. I appreciate your willingness to proceed. I will absolutely be as gentle and thorough as possible, explaining each step before I do it. You are in control, and we can stop at any time. First, let's have you lie back on the examination table, with your knees bent and your feet flat on the table. I’ll drape a sheet over you to keep you warm and comfortable. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. This will just help me get a general sense of your overall health. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. That doesn’t seem to cause any pain, does it?
PATIENT: No, it doesn’t hurt, exactly. Just… a little uncomfortable. It’s been a while since anyone touched my tummy like that. Everything feels a little… sensitive these days. Just go slowly, dear. And tell me what you're doing. That always makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie. As I said, just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your abdomen feels soft, and I don’t feel any masses or abnormalities. Now, to proceed with the pelvic exam, I'm going to ask you to bend your knees and relax your muscles. I will use a lubricated speculum to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visualize the cervix and assess the walls of the vagina. I will also do a digital exam, using a gloved, lubricated finger to check the size and shape of your uterus and assess the surrounding tissues. I understand this can be uncomfortable, but I will work quickly and gently. Remember, you can tell me to stop at any time. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: A speculum… and a finger… Oh dear. Will it hurt? And… will it take long? I just… I’m a little scared. I haven't had one of these in so long. And… what are you looking for exactly? It's just... a lot to take in. And I don't want any surprises. Please, tell me everything you're doing before you do it.
DOCTOR: Those are all very reasonable questions, Zoie, and I’m happy to answer them. The exam may feel some pressure or a slight discomfort, but it shouldn't be painful. We can use a smaller speculum if you prefer, and I will work as gently as possible. It will only take a few minutes. I’m looking for any signs of inflammation, infection, or abnormalities in your cervix, vagina, uterus, and surrounding tissues. This helps me determine the cause of your urinary symptoms. I'll also be assessing the strength of your pelvic floor muscles, which are important for bladder control. Before I begin, I will explain each step as I go. You can tell me to stop at any time, and we can take breaks if you need them. I will also be mindful of your comfort and dignity throughout the exam. First, I’m going to gently insert the lubricated speculum into your vagina. This will allow me to visualize your cervix. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh dear… alright. But please, go slowly. And tell me what you’re doing before you do it. And if it hurts… I will tell you. Don't hesitate to stop, okay? Just… go slowly. Very slowly. Ready… I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie. I’m going to explain each step as I go. First, I’m going to gently separate the labia and apply a small amount of lubricant to the vaginal opening. This will help the speculum slide in more easily. Now, I’m going to slowly and gently insert the speculum into your vagina. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Remember, you can tell me to stop at any time. How are you feeling so far, Zoie?
PATIENT: It's… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. It feels… cold. And… stretched. It's not painful… yet. But it's… not pleasant. Please… just hurry. And tell me what you're doing next. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie. I will work as quickly and gently as possible. Now that the speculum is in place, I’m going to gently visualize your cervix. I’m looking for any signs of inflammation, infection, or abnormalities. Your cervix looks healthy. There’s no sign of inflammation or infection. Now, I’m going to gently perform a digital exam, using a gloved, lubricated finger to check the size and shape of your uterus and assess the surrounding tissues. This will help me assess the strength of your pelvic floor muscles. I will let you know before I insert my finger. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Another finger…? Oh dear. Is it absolutely necessary? I just… I’m very sensitive down there. And everything feels so… stretched and uncomfortable already. Alright. But please, be very gentle. And tell me what you’re doing before you do it. Just… be gentle. Ready… I think. But hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie. I understand your hesitation, and I will be as gentle as possible. The digital exam is helpful for assessing the strength of your pelvic floor muscles and checking for any tenderness or abnormalities in your uterus. Before I insert my finger, I will let you know. Now, I’m going to gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your vagina. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I will be checking the size and shape of your uterus and surrounding tissues. How are you feeling so far, Zoie?
PATIENT: It’s… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. And… cold. It feels like… pressure. And it’s making me feel… a little scared. Please… hurry. Just get it over with. I don’t like this. Just… be gentle. And tell me when it’s over. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie. I'm working as quickly and gently as possible. I’m feeling your uterus, which feels normal in size and shape. I'm also assessing the surrounding tissues, and I don't feel any tenderness or abnormalities. Your pelvic floor muscles feel a little weak, which can contribute to urinary symptoms. Alright, Zoie, I’m finished with the digital exam now. I’m going to gently remove my finger and the speculum. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Oh… finally. It’s… over? Thank goodness. It was… very uncomfortable. And a little scary. I’m glad it’s over. I don’t think I want to do that again. What did you find? What did you learn? Just… tell me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie. Everything is over now. I understand it was uncomfortable, and I apologize for any distress it caused. I did find that your pelvic floor muscles are a little weak, which can contribute to your urinary symptoms, such as difficulty starting, a weak stream, and feeling like you haven’t completely emptied your bladder. Your cervix and uterus looked healthy, and I didn’t find any signs of inflammation or infection. Based on my exam, it appears you may have some stress incontinence or weak bladder control. This is common, especially as we age. It means the muscles that support your bladder aren’t as strong as they once were. Fortunately, there are several things we can do to help improve your symptoms. Would you like me to explain some of the treatment options available?
PATIENT: Treatment options…? Yes, please. Anything that will make things better. I just… I want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again. And not be so scared all the time. What can we do? Tell me everything. What are my options? Are they… painful? And will they take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie. Let's discuss some of the treatment options available. Fortunately, there are several things we can try. The first line of treatment typically involves pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises. These exercises help strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and urethra. They are simple to do at home, and they don't require any special equipment. I can provide you with a handout explaining how to do them properly. Another option is bladder training. This involves gradually increasing the amount of time between bathroom visits to help improve bladder control. If these conservative measures don't provide enough relief, there are other options available, such as medications or more invasive procedures. However, we can start with the pelvic floor exercises and bladder training and see how you respond. The exercises are not painful, and they don’t take long. You can do them anywhere, anytime. It may take a few weeks to see improvement, but with consistent effort, you should start to notice a difference. Would you like me to demonstrate how to do the Kegel exercises?
PATIENT: Demonstrate…? Yes, please. I'm not sure I understand. Show me exactly how to do them. And tell me how often I need to do them. And… are there any mistakes I should avoid? I just want to get this right. Thank you, dear. You're very kind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zoie. I’m happy to demonstrate. To do the Kegel exercises, imagine you’re trying to stop the flow of urine midstream. Squeeze the muscles you would use to do that. Hold the squeeze for a few seconds, then relax. Repeat this process several times. It’s important to focus on squeezing the right muscles – you shouldn’t be squeezing your abdominal muscles, buttocks, or thighs. You can do these exercises anywhere, anytime. Start with 10-15 repetitions, three times a day. As you get stronger, you can gradually increase the number of repetitions and the length of time you hold the squeeze. One common mistake is to squeeze your abdominal muscles or buttocks. It’s important to focus on squeezing only the muscles that control the flow of urine. Another mistake is to hold your breath during the exercise. Remember to breathe normally. This handout has detailed instructions and illustrations. Do you want me to demonstrate again, or would you like to try a few repetitions while I watch to make sure you’re doing them correctly?
PATIENT: Try a few repetitions…? Yes, please. I’m probably doing it wrong. Is that right…? Or am I squeezing something else? It’s harder than it looks. I’m probably making a mess of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie. Don't worry, it is harder than it looks, and it takes practice. You're doing a good job just trying! I feel a little bit of abdominal muscle tension. Try to relax your abdomen and focus on squeezing only the muscles you would use to stop the flow of urine. Imagine you're tightening your pelvic floor muscles as if you're stopping yourself from passing gas. Try to avoid squeezing your buttocks or thighs. It's okay if you can’t feel a strong contraction at first. Just focus on isolating the right muscles. Now, try a few repetitions while I watch. Don't worry if you're not perfect. Just focus on isolating the right muscles and relax your abdomen.
PATIENT: Is that better…? Or am I still squeezing something else? It’s just… so hard to tell what muscles I’m squeezing. I’m probably making a mess of it. I’m trying my best, dear. Perhaps I’m just too old to learn this now.
DOCTOR: You are not too old to learn this, Zoie. And you're doing much better! It takes practice to isolate those muscles, and it’s perfectly normal to struggle at first. I do feel a little more pelvic floor muscle contraction now, which is great! It's still subtle, but you're definitely engaging the right muscles. It’s like any other exercise – it takes time and practice to build strength. Don't get discouraged if you don't feel results immediately. Here’s what I recommend. Continue practicing the Kegel exercises several times a day. Start with 10-15 repetitions, and gradually increase the number as you get stronger. You might find it helpful to do the exercises while lying down or sitting in a quiet room. Focus on isolating the right muscles and relax your abdomen. Don’t strain or force anything. And don’t hesitate to ask me any questions if you’re struggling. I’m here to help. We can also explore other treatment options if the Kegel exercises aren’t effective. We can also schedule a follow up appointment to re-evaluate and discuss the situation. Now, are there any other questions or concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. You’ve been very patient with me, dear. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I’ll try to do the exercises like you showed me. And I’ll come back if I have any trouble. Thank you again, Dr. Petrimoulx. You're a kind doctor. I think I’ll go home now and take a nap. It’s been a long morning. .
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Zoie. You're very welcome. Remember, be patient with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take it easy and get some rest. It was lovely meeting you. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Zoie!
