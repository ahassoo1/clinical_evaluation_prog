DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning. Just…travel. Need…shots, I think? My wife…she always did the planning. Now…I gotta figure it out. Somewhere warm. That’s all I remember right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, travel vaccinations. That’s perfectly reasonable. To help me figure out which vaccinations you might need, could you tell me where you're planning to travel to?
PATIENT: Somewhere…beach. Lots of sun. Not…cold. She liked…Thailand, maybe? Or was it…Philippines? Honestly, it all kinda blurs together now. Lots of little islands. That's what I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, Thailand or the Philippines…both warm destinations with islands. Okay. And have you traveled to either of those countries before?
PATIENT: Uh…yes. I think so. With…her. Many times. But…it was a while ago. I don’t…keep track of those things. Did we get shots then? I really don’t remember. It was…her job.
DOCTOR: Let me take a look at your records here… Okay, it looks like you did receive some vaccinations prior to travel to the Philippines in 2022. Hepatitis A and Typhoid, specifically. But those may need boosters depending on how long it’s been and where you’re planning to go this time. Do you know if you received any others, like for Japanese encephalitis or rabies?
PATIENT: Japanese…what now? Rabies? Like…dogs? No. I don't think so. She just…told me what to get, and I went. I didn't ask questions. Didn't need to. This is…stressful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. It's perfectly common to not remember these details. Japanese encephalitis and rabies are potential concerns in some areas of Southeast Asia, but we can assess your risk based on where you're going and what activities you plan to do. To start, could you tell me roughly when you’re planning to travel?
PATIENT: Uh…soon. Before it gets cold. Maybe…September? October, definitely before November. I just…want to get away. She always booked everything months in advance. I'm…not good at this.
DOCTOR: September or October, that gives us some time. Okay. And besides relaxing on the beach, do you have any specific activities planned?
PATIENT: Activities? Not really. Just…beach. Maybe some…food? She liked the markets. I followed her. I don’t…do much on my own. Nothing…dangerous. I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Alright. No specific adventurous activities. And just to be thorough, are you planning on doing anything that might put you in close contact with animals?
PATIENT: Animals? No! No animals. I…don't like animals. She liked the monkeys, but I stayed away. Definitely no…close contact. They bite.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Given your travel timeframe and your planned activities, I recommend a Hepatitis A booster and a Typhoid booster, just to be safe. We can also discuss the possibility of a Tetanus booster if it’s been more than ten years since your last one. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Boosters…more shots? Fine. Whatever you think. Just…get it over with. Is it gonna hurt? She always said they didn’t…but she was good at that stuff. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: I understand. They're not the most pleasant, but they're quick. We can minimize discomfort. Let's do a quick physical exam just to make sure you're otherwise healthy for travel, and then we'll get those boosters taken care of. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…quick, okay? I don't want to be here all day. Just get it done. Then I can…think about the beach.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Do you have any history of allergies, or any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing I know of. She always handled the…medical stuff. I just…take pills when I’m sick. Headache pills. That's it. No…conditions. I don't think so. I'm pretty healthy. Usually. At least, I was before this whole…travel thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or chronic medical conditions. Good. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones, besides headache pills?
PATIENT: Uh…no. Just the…headache pills. Sometimes. When it’s really bad. She…she had a lot of pills. But that was for…her. I don't take many. Just the basics. This is…a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: I understand. We just want to make sure everything is safe for your trip. Okay, so no regular medications. Alright. That completes the exam. We'll go ahead and administer the Hepatitis A and Typhoid boosters. Then we can discuss some general travel health advice. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…hurry, okay? I just want to get this over with. Then…then I can think about the beach. Is it going to hurt a lot?
DOCTOR: It will be a quick pinch, Odell. Nothing you can't handle. I’ll let you know when I'm about to administer the injections. Just relax your arm. There you go. All done. You may experience some mild soreness and fatigue for a day or two. We’ll also review some post-vaccination care. Now, let’s discuss some general travel health advice…are you familiar with avoiding mosquito bites?
PATIENT: Mosquitoes? Yes. I hate them. They bite. She always had…spray. And those…things you plug in. I always got bitten, even with the spray. Is it going to be full of mosquitoes? I don't want to get sick.
DOCTOR: Southeast Asia can have a lot of mosquitoes, yes. It's important to be proactive. In addition to repellent with DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus, wear long sleeves and pants, especially at dawn and dusk. We also recommend avoiding areas with standing water, where mosquitoes breed. And I highly recommend consulting your wife's previous travel doctor, if possible, regarding the specific precautions she took. Would you like me to provide you with a handout detailing travel health advice and mosquito bite prevention?
PATIENT: Handout? Yes, please. Anything…to help. I don't remember what she did. Everything…blurs together. If she saw a doctor, I didn't…go with her. She just told me what to pack. I just want to be…safe. Just…not sick.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. This handout covers a lot of important information, including mosquito bite prevention, food and water safety, and what to do if you do get sick. It also has a list of resources you can refer to for further information. Pay close attention to the section on preventing traveler’s diarrhea. It’s common in Southeast Asia, but easily manageable with proper precautions. Do you have any questions about any of this information?
PATIENT: Traveler’s…what? It’s a lot to read. Food…safety? I just…eat what she gave me. She always knew what was good. I don’t…understand. Just…don’t eat bad food? What does that even mean? I think…I need a minute. This is too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is a lot of information. Let’s focus on one thing at a time. The most important thing is to drink bottled water, avoid ice, and be cautious about street food. Stick to restaurants that appear clean and well-maintained. And if you’re ever unsure about the safety of something, it's best to avoid it. We can also provide you with a list of recommended medications to have on hand, like anti-diarrheal medication and rehydration salts. Would you like me to write out a prescription for those?
PATIENT: Prescription…yes, please. Anything that will help. Just…make it easy. I don’t want to…worry about getting sick. She always knew what to do. Maybe…maybe I shouldn’t go. It’s too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Odell, it's understandable to feel overwhelmed right now. Travel can be stressful, especially when you're planning it on your own. But it doesn't have to be. We’re here to help you prepare and minimize any risks. I'm confident that with a little preparation, you can have a safe and enjoyable trip. Let's focus on getting you the medication you need and a clear plan for staying healthy. And remember, I'm available to answer any questions you may have, even after you've left the office. How about we write that prescription, and then I'll give you a list of local travel clinics you can contact if you want further information?
PATIENT: Okay…okay. That sounds…good. A plan. Yes. Prescription first. Then…the list. Just…help me get through this. It's…a lot harder than I thought it would be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here’s the prescription for anti-diarrheal medication and rehydration salts. You can fill it at any pharmacy. And here's a list of local travel clinics. They offer comprehensive travel health consultations and vaccinations. I’m also including a brochure on dealing with jet lag. Jet lag can be debilitating. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Odell?
PATIENT: Jet lag… No. I think…that’s all. Just…tired. Everything feels…too much. Thank you. I just want to go home now. Maybe…maybe I will think about the travel clinic later. Right now…I just need to rest. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Take your time, Odell. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Here's my card. Take care, and I hope you have a safe and enjoyable trip. .
