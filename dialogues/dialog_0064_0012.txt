DOCTOR: Good morning, Velda. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I’m going on a cruise in a few weeks – the first one since… well, since my husband passed – and the cruise line needs some information from a doctor. Just a standard thing, I expect. They sent a form. I thought it best to get it sorted properly.
DOCTOR: Right, a pre-travel form for the cruise. Absolutely sensible. And my condolences on your loss, Velda. It’s wonderful you’re taking this trip, though. A good way to… well, to do something nice for yourself. Let me see… the form, if you have it, would be helpful. But even without it, we can go through some basics. Just to make sure everything is alright for your travels. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you kindly, Doctor. It is nice to be doing something. He would have loved it, actually – all the exotic ports and such. Here’s the form. As for conditions… hmm. Not really, no. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor – old Dr. MacIntyre – said it was just stress related, and it’s been fine ever since. Nothing I take medication for, and nothing that’s bothered me for a good long while. Just the usual aches and pains for a woman of my age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right, blood pressure a few years ago, now managed. That’s good to know. And yes, “usual aches and pains” is perfectly normal. Just to be thorough, Velda, when you say “fine,” have you actually had it checked recently?
PATIENT: Recently… well, that’s a good question. Not as recently as I should, I suppose. Dr. MacIntyre retired last year, you see, and I haven’t really gotten around to finding a replacement. I felt alright, so I just… didn’t. It was last checked… oh, I’d say maybe two years ago, when I had my annual flu jab. All was well then. Perfectly normal, he said.
DOCTOR: Okay. Two years ago is a little while back. We may want to get a quick check just to be safe, given the cruise and all. It's just a precaution. Would you mind if I took your blood pressure now?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. That sounds sensible enough. A precaution is always wise, especially with a long trip. Yes, please do. I’m happy to have it checked. It’s probably fine, but better to be sure, as you say.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It's a quick and painless procedure. I’m just going to wrap this around your arm, and you’ll feel a little pressure. Try to relax, and don't talk while I'm taking the reading. Okay. 142 over 88. A little elevated, to be honest. It’s not alarmingly high, but it is a bit above what we’d ideally like to see, especially with your history. Do you experience any headaches, dizziness, or vision changes?
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated, you say? No, not at all, Doctor. No headaches, no dizziness, and my vision is perfectly good. I wear glasses for reading, of course, but that’s just getting older. I haven’t noticed anything out of the ordinary, truly. Just… feeling a bit tired, perhaps? But then, who doesn't feel tired these days? It's probably just the excitement about the cruise, honestly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Fatigue can certainly be a symptom, but it’s also very common. And you’re right, excitement can play a part. Given the slightly elevated reading and your past history, I think it would be best to do a few more checks. Perhaps a quick blood test just to rule anything out, and an ECG to check your heart rhythm?
PATIENT: A blood test and… an ECG? Oh dear. Is that… necessary, Doctor? I mean, I feel perfectly alright, as I said. It all sounds rather… involved. I was hoping for a quick sign-off on the form and then I could get on with planning the cruise. I understand you're being careful, but is it really needed?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Velda. And you’re right, it might seem a little excessive. But a cruise involves a change in routine, different foods, potential for dehydration… and it's better to be safe than sorry, especially when we've found a slightly elevated blood pressure reading. The blood test is just routine – checking your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and ruling out any underlying causes for the blood pressure. The ECG is a simple, painless scan that checks your heart's electrical activity. It’s not about expecting something to be wrong, but about having a clear picture of your overall health before you travel. It's just a precaution. If everything is normal, you'll have peace of mind, and you can enjoy your cruise without worry. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best… then yes, I suppose I should. It's just… a lot of fuss, really. But you’re right, peace of mind is important. And I would hate to be poorly on the ship. So… blood tests and an ECG. When can we get that done? And will it take long? I do have a few things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for understanding. It won't take long at all. We have a small lab just down the hall, and the blood test will only take a few minutes. The ECG is done right here in the examination room, and it only takes about five minutes to complete. We can probably get everything done within half an hour. I’ll just get a phlebotomist to draw your blood, then we’ll do the ECG. I’ll explain everything as we go. We should have the results back later this afternoon. Do you have any allergies to latex or plasters?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to either, Doctor. Thank goodness for small mercies! Latex or plasters, I’m fine with both. Though I’ve always been a bit squeamish about needles, if I’m honest. But I’ll manage. Let’s get it done, then. The sooner it's over, the better.
DOCTOR: Right. No problem at all. The phlebotomist is very good, very gentle. And you won’t even feel a thing, honestly. Just a little pinch. I'll let her know you're a little squeamish, she’s very understanding. I’ll just pop next door and let her know you’re ready. It will only take a moment. Just relax, and we'll have everything sorted out soon. I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you.
