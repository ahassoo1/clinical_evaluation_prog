DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I am Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. Well, it’s… it’s my breathing. When I lie down flat, it feels like I can’t get enough air. It’s been happening for, oh, I’d say about three weeks now. Not all the time, but most nights when I try to sleep. It’s quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: I see. Breathing difficulty when recumbent, for approximately three weeks. And it’s primarily a nighttime issue. Can you describe the sensation more precisely?
PATIENT: Precisely? Hmm. It's not a pain, exactly. More like… a tightness in my chest, and I feel like something is pressing on me. Like a weight. And I have to sit up to catch my breath. It doesn't happen when I'm sitting or standing, only when I'm lying down. I prop myself up with pillows, and that helps some.
DOCTOR: A tightness, a sensation of pressure… and alleviated with propping yourself up with pillows. Do you experience any associated symptoms with this difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Associated symptoms… let me think. Sometimes my ankles are a bit swollen at the end of the day. Not terribly, but noticeable. And I do feel a little more tired than usual, but at my age, isn't everyone a little tired? I haven't coughed, no wheezing, and my heart doesn’t race.
DOCTOR: Ankle swelling, and increased fatigue. Alright. And would you say this fatigue is new, or has it been a gradual onset?
PATIENT: It's… gradual, I suppose. It started maybe around the same time as the breathing trouble, three weeks ago. It’s not debilitating, Doctor, but I don't have the energy to do much gardening anymore, and I used to love my garden. Just a bit… worn out, I’d say.
DOCTOR: I understand. Reduced activity tolerance alongside these other symptoms. Now, let's delve into your medical history a bit. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on a pill, and it’s been under control for years now. I also had a bit of arthritis in my hands, but mostly just aches and pains. Nothing serious. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out many years ago, but that wasn't a problem. No diabetes, no heart trouble, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, managed with medication. Arthritis. Cholecystectomy. No history of diabetes or cardiac issues. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pill, Lisinopril. One a day. And sometimes I take a little something for the arthritis when my hands are really bothering me, but it’s just over-the-counter ibuprofen. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril daily. Ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything. I eat everything, I take most pills without issue, and I haven’t been stung by a bee in years. I don’t think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had arthritis, like me. And my father had… well, he had some heart trouble when he got older. Nothing major until his eighties. My sister, she had high blood pressure too, but she takes pills, like me. That’s about all I can recall, really. We didn't talk about illnesses much in my family.
DOCTOR: Family history of arthritis, hypertension, and cardiac issues in the elderly. And, finally, could you briefly describe your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I live alone in my own house. I used to garden a lot, but I haven’t been doing much of that lately. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink a little wine with dinner, but I cut back on that. Mostly, I read and watch television. Quiet life, you could say. I try to eat healthy, but I do enjoy my sweets now and then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Vanderwiele. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. We will start with listening to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s best. It’s a little high for me, isn’t it? But I suppose I can manage. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale slowly. Another deep breath… good. I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds bilaterally, and a slight crackling towards the bases, particularly on the left side. And there’s some mild pitting edema in both ankles. Now, I would like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to rule out any underlying pulmonary or cardiac issues. We will also need a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte balance. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. X-ray and… EKG? That sounds serious, Doctor. Is something very wrong? I just thought it was old age catching up with me. I suppose if you think it’s necessary. But I do hope it’s not anything too alarming. Yes, alright. Do what you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please explain things to me afterwards, if you wouldn't mind.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Ms. Vanderwiele, to investigate these symptoms thoroughly. It doesn't necessarily indicate anything serious, but it's important to rule out potential causes. I'll explain the results to you in detail as soon as they are available. The nurse will be in shortly to draw some blood and escort you to radiology for the X-ray and EKG. In the meantime, please refrain from strenuous activity. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once we have them.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining things. It’s just… a bit unnerving, that’s all. I’ll try to stay calm and listen to the nurse. When will I hear about the results? A few days? A week? I’d like to know roughly what to expect.
DOCTOR: The results should be available within 48 to 72 hours. The nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I anticipate we'll have a clearer picture of what's causing your symptoms by then. Do you have any further questions before I leave you to the nurse?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. Just… please hurry, if you can. This waiting is the hardest part. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly.
