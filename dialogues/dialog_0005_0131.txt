DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sladen, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Don… Don… Anyway, it's my blood pressure. It's been a bit high lately.
DOCTOR: "Donate," it’s Doctor Donate. And “a bit high” isn't really a diagnosis, is it?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry, Doctor Donate. Yes, you’re right. It is higher than it should be, according to the machine at the pharmacy. I usually get readings around, um… 130 over 80, maybe? But last week it was 145 over 95 a couple of times. That’s what made me want to come in.
DOCTOR: Pharmacy machines are notoriously inaccurate. Still, we should check it ourselves. And "a couple of times" doesn't tell me much. Have you been feeling any symptoms with these higher readings?
PATIENT: Hmm, symptoms… not really. I mean, no headaches or anything like that. Maybe just a little tired, but I figured that was just from work. I’m on my feet a lot, you know? Personal care… it’s a busy job. I don't feel sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, fatigue isn’t exactly specific, is it?
PATIENT: No, I guess not. It’s just… I don’t usually bother the doctor unless something’s really wrong, you know? My grandma always said, “Don’t go to the doctor for every little sniffle.” But then my cousin, she had high blood pressure and… well, it caused her some trouble. That’s why I wanted to get it checked.
DOCTOR: Grandma’s advice isn't always the best. Your cousin's situation is...relevant, I suppose, but we're not treating your cousin here. Let's get a proper reading first. I'm going to take your blood pressure now, and then we'll talk about your medical history. Have you been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Nothing regular, anyway. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back, if it's acting up. But that's it. And just vitamins, a multivitamin, the usual. I try to eat okay, mostly.
DOCTOR: “Trying” isn’t really a strategy. And ibuprofen regularly can actually raise your blood pressure, so it’s good to know. Now, let’s get this reading. Please, relax your arm. And don’t talk while I’m taking it.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Relaxing. I'm quiet now.
DOCTOR: 142 over 91. As I suspected. Not a crisis, but definitely something we need to address. Now, let's go over your medical history. Any major illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm… nothing major, really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that’s about it. No surgeries since then. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. No big illnesses, just the usual colds and flu. I did have a bad bout of the flu a couple years ago, but I recovered okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history?
PATIENT: Oh, um… my mom had diabetes, but she managed it with diet and pills for a long time. And, like I said, my cousin has high blood pressure. My dad, he was pretty healthy actually, lived to be 85. I think that’s it. Nobody else I can think of with anything serious.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. I don’t drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, like on a special occasion. And definitely no drugs. I stay away from all that.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s get some basic vitals. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs and check your weight. Then we’ll discuss a plan. Please, sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Weight is 132 pounds, height is five foot, which puts your BMI at 26.1. That’s considered overweight, which can contribute to your blood pressure. Now, Ms. Sladen, we need to address this blood pressure. It's not dangerously high right now, but it's trending in the wrong direction. I’m going to start you on a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic. It’ll help your body get rid of excess salt and water. We’ll also need to make some lifestyle changes – diet and exercise. I’m going to give you a pamphlet with some guidelines. I want you to cut back on sodium, eat more fruits and vegetables, and aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. I also want you to monitor your blood pressure at home, and schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to see how you're doing. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Hydro… what now? A diuretic? What does that do, exactly? And 30 minutes of exercise… that's a lot when you’re working all day. I understand about the diet, but the exercise… and this medicine… is it going to have side effects? I don't want to feel sick all the time.
DOCTOR: Hydrochlorothiazide is a water pill, it helps your kidneys remove salt and water from your body. And yes, it can have side effects. Common ones are dizziness, and increased urination. But we started with a very low dose, which minimizes that. As for the exercise, it doesn't have to be intense. A brisk walk, gardening, anything that gets your heart rate up. It’s about making small changes, Ms. Sladen. Look, I understand you’re busy, but we’re talking about your health here. Ignoring this isn’t an option. If you don’t address this blood pressure, you risk stroke, heart attack, kidney damage… Are you following me?
PATIENT: Stroke… heart attack…? Okay, okay. I'm following. It's just… a lot to take in. So, the pill… do I take it with food? And how often? And what if I do feel dizzy? Or sick? Should I stop taking it then? I just want to make sure I do it right. I don't want to mess anything up. Could you maybe write down exactly what to do, just so I don’t forget?
DOCTOR: Alright. Fine. One pill, 12.5mg of hydrochlorothiazide, once daily, preferably in the morning. Take it with food to minimize dizziness. If you experience dizziness or excessive weakness, stop taking the pill and call my office immediately. I’ll also write down a list of foods high in sodium to avoid. Now, I'm going to order some basic blood work – a complete metabolic panel and a lipid panel. This will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. Schedule an appointment with the lab today. And come back in one month for a follow-up. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I understand. Lab work, follow-up in a month… and the pill in the morning with food. And call if I feel dizzy. Is there anything else I should be worried about? Any symptoms I should look out for besides dizziness? And… is there a website or something I could look at to learn more about this? I like to… research things. Just so I know what I’m dealing with.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Sladen, don’t go Dr. Google-ing everything. You’ll just end up more worried than you need to be. If you experience any swelling in your ankles or feet, or any chest pain, call my office immediately. As for resources, the American Heart Association website has some basic information. But I prefer you rely on my guidance. Alright. I think that covers everything. Schedule your lab work and follow-up, and let's see how you're doing in a month. Goodbye, Ms. Sladen. And try to make some healthy changes. It's in your best interest. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor Donate. I will. I’ll schedule the lab work right away. And I’ll try my best to… make some changes. Thank you again. .
