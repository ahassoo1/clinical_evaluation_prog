DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… my joints. They’re just… stiff. Especially in the morning. It’s… hard to get going, you know? It's been happening for a little while now, I think. I can’t really say how long, exactly. Time… it goes so fast.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for joint stiffness to develop gradually, so it’s not unusual you aren’t certain of the exact onset. “A little while now” is helpful, though. Can you tell me a little more about where exactly you’re experiencing this stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s mostly in my hands, I think. And… my knees, maybe? They ache a bit when I first get up. Not all the time, though. And sometimes… my back. But that could be from bending over with the little ones, you know? I work with children. Daycare. It's… a good job, mostly. But lots of lifting.
DOCTOR: Yes, daycare certainly involves a lot of physical activity. So, to clarify, the stiffness and aching are most prominent in your hands and knees, with occasional back discomfort, particularly after activity?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds right. Hands, knees… and back sometimes. It's not terrible terrible, you understand. Just… annoying. Makes it hard to open jars, and… pick up the toys. You know, the little ones drop things constantly. And bending down… oof. That’s not getting easier.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like this is impacting your daily activities, which is important to address. Now, has this stiffness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Definitely comes and goes. Worse in the mornings, like I said. But… through the day it gets a little better. Sometimes. Not always, though. Some days it's just… worse than others. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Voner. Fluctuating symptoms are very common. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in those joints – hands and knees, specifically?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmmm. I haven't really looked, to be honest. I mean, I notice if something hurts, but I don't usually look at my hands. Redness… no, I don't think so. Not that I've noticed. It's just… achey. That's the main thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this joint pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. I… I get tired, sometimes. But I mean, who doesn’t, right? I’m not as young as I used to be! And… sometimes my hands feel a little… numb. Not all the time, just… occasionally. It comes and goes, like everything else. I don't know if that's related, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional numbness in your hands. That's helpful information. Now, have you ever had any injuries to your hands or knees?
PATIENT: Injuries… Hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I remember, anyway. I used to be very active, when I was younger. Dancing, mostly. Maybe I twisted something back then? But it was a long time ago. I really don't recall any specific injuries. Nothing serious, I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any fever, weight loss, or any skin rashes?
PATIENT: Fever… no. Weight loss… I don’t think so. Maybe a little? But I’ve been eating less, to be honest. Just not as hungry. And… no rashes. My skin is just… old. It's getting a bit thin, that’s all. Nothing unusual.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a good question. Let me think… I had… high blood pressure, a long time ago. The doctor put me on some pills for it. But… I stopped taking them a while ago. I wasn’t feeling well, and I think it was the pills. And… I think I had a bit of arthritis in my foot, years ago. But it wasn't serious. I don't really know… I don't go to the doctor very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in the past, and some arthritis in your foot previously. It’s alright that you don’t go to the doctor frequently; we’re just gathering information now. Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, not that I recall. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I think. But that was… a very long time ago. Nothing else, I don't think. I try to avoid hospitals, if I can. They give me the shivers.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother had… bad joints, when she got older. Arthritis, I think. Badly, badly in her hands. Couldn't even hold a cup, towards the end. My father was… healthy, I think. Always working, always strong. My sister… she had some problems with her back, but I don't know what. It was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of arthritis in your mother and some back problems in your sister. Now, finally, let’s talk about your current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh… no. Not really. I mean, I take a little something for my nerves, sometimes. It helps me sleep. But it’s… nothing regular. Just when I can’t sleep. And… allergies? No, I don’t think so. I eat everything. I like to cook. I haven’t had any reactions to anything, that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner, thank you for that detailed information. It’s very helpful. Now, I would like to do a quick physical examination. Just to check your joints and get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start by examining your hands. Could you please make a fist for me, then open and straighten your fingers as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Okay. There… it’s a little… stiff. You can probably see. It feels… tight. And… a little bit achy.
DOCTOR: I do notice some slight stiffness in several of your joints, and a small amount of crepitus – that’s a bit of a grinding sensation – when you move them. There’s no significant swelling or warmth at this point, and the tenderness is mild. Now, let’s look at your knees. Could you please sit comfortably on the examination table, and let me gently bend and straighten each of your knees?
PATIENT: Okay. This is… alright. Go ahead. My knees… they click sometimes. It's just… a little uncomfortable when I bend them. Not terrible, but… I feel it.
DOCTOR: I’m feeling some mild crepitus in your knees as well, and your range of motion is slightly limited. There’s no significant swelling or warmth, but I do detect some mild tenderness along the joint line of both knees. Now, I’m going to briefly examine your back. Please lean forward and touch your toes, if you’re able, and then stand back up straight. Let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Oof. That’s… a little difficult. It hurts a little in my lower back. Not… sharp pain, just… a dull ache. There… that’s not very good, is it? It’s stiff. Very stiff. It's… always been a little bit of a problem, but it's worse today, I think.
DOCTOR: I do detect some tenderness in the lower lumbar region of your spine, and some mild muscle spasm. There’s no evidence of nerve impingement at this time. Alright, Ms. Voner, thank you for allowing me to perform that examination. Based on your history and the physical findings, it appears you are experiencing symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis, a common condition involving the breakdown of cartilage in the joints. It’s likely contributing to the stiffness, ache, and limited range of motion in your hands, knees, and back. However, to rule out other potential causes, such as rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory conditions, I would like to order some blood work. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… Oh dear. I don't really like needles. But… if you think it’s important, then yes, alright. If it will help… I suppose. It’s just… I bruise easily. Will it be much?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the needles, and bruising is a valid point. We’ll just need a routine panel; it won’t be a large volume of blood. It’s primarily to check for inflammatory markers and rule out other possibilities. It's a standard precaution. While we await the results of the blood work, we can begin with some conservative management strategies to help alleviate your symptoms. This includes over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or naproxen, as long as you have no underlying kidney issues or stomach problems. Regular, low-impact exercise, like walking or swimming, can also help maintain joint mobility and strength. Additionally, heat or cold packs can provide temporary relief. Would you like me to provide you with a written handout outlining these recommendations?
PATIENT: Yes, a handout would be… very helpful. I forget things so easily. Ibuprofen… I think I've taken that before. But I'll check. I don't want to take anything that will upset my stomach. And… walking and swimming… I used to swim. Maybe I should start again. It’s been a long time. That sounds… manageable. It's just… getting started. That's the hard part.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will print out a handout detailing the recommendations, including potential side effects of ibuprofen and alternative pain management options if needed. We can also discuss some resources for low-impact exercise programs in the area, if you’d be interested. I will also write a prescription for a topical cream containing capsaicin, which can provide localized pain relief for your hands and knees. It works by temporarily reducing pain signals in the affected joints. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly or you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, swelling, or redness, please contact the clinic immediately. And once we have the blood work results, we can discuss further treatment options, which may include physical therapy or, in some cases, injections. Does that all sound alright to you, Ms. Voner?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds good. A lot to remember, but… I’ll try my best. A cream sounds nice. Less… scary than needles! Physical therapy… I’ve heard good things. And… I will contact you if anything gets worse. I promise. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… patient with me. I think… I think that’s everything, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Voner. I’m glad I could help. Yes, I believe that’s everything for today. I’m happy to answer any further questions you may have as they arise. Here is the handout with the recommendations, and the prescription for the capsaicin cream. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again for follow-up.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. And thank you again… for everything.
