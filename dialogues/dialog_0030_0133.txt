DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be quick about it, I just need some forms notarized, really. Some health things… paperwork, you know? I don’t really like fussing with it all.
DOCTOR: I see. While I am happy to assist you with any health-related questions or concerns, my role here is as a medical doctor. I can certainly review the forms with you to ensure they are medically accurate, but I am not authorized to act as a notary public. That requires a specific legal certification. However, let’s talk about the “health things” mentioned on the paperwork. Perhaps I can clarify some of the information or address any concerns you have while we’re at it. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I didn’t realize… I just thought any doctor could sign them. That's…embarrassing. Well, if you can just look at them, that would be wonderful. It’s mostly just confirming I’m still…well, still me, you know? Still healthy enough to do things. It’s for a little travel thing. I don’t want to bother you with details if you’re busy.
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Melvenia. It’s perfectly alright. Many patients have questions about form completion. And yes, I’m happy to review them to ensure accuracy. To do that effectively, and to be sure I can help as much as possible, could you tell me a little bit about why these forms need to be completed?
PATIENT: It’s for a volunteer trip. A church group is going to build houses down in Mexico, near my family’s land. They want to make sure we’re all healthy enough to swing a hammer and not collapse in the heat, I guess. It’s mostly just…proof of a recent checkup, tetanus shot, things like that. They’re very particular, bless their hearts. I just want to get it over with so I can go help. I don’t have family nearby to help with all this paperwork.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful you’re going on a volunteer trip – that’s very generous of you. And it’s certainly sensible for them to ensure everyone is medically fit for the work. I see here they’re requesting a recent physical exam, tetanus vaccination status, and a general health declaration. Do you have a copy of your vaccination records with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I thought I did. Let me see… receipts, grocery list, a picture of my niece… Here! I think this is it. It’s from Dr. Ramirez, back in Tucson. It says tetanus booster, November of last year. Everything else… I honestly can’t remember. It was a while ago, and I don’t keep track of things like that very well these days.
DOCTOR: Excellent. This is helpful. November of last year is well within the acceptable range for a tetanus booster. To proceed, I would like to perform a brief physical exam and review your medical history. This will allow me to complete the health declaration accurately and ensure you’re fit for travel and volunteer work. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. As long as it doesn't take too long, Doctor. I have a little appointment later this afternoon. But… yes, let’s get it done. Just, please, be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. We’ll take things at your pace, and I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s start with your height and weight. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. I’m rather tall, you know. Always have been. Makes finding clothes difficult. But go ahead, Doctor. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll step onto the scale for me, please. Okay, 189 centimeters and 110 pounds. And that is quite tall! Now, if you could just sit on the examination table, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: My mother was tall, and her mother before her. It’s a family thing. Go ahead, Doctor. Just try not to scare me with that thing. It always feels so cold.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds good so far, Melvenia. Heart and lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 130 over 80, but not severely so. Now, let's take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat.
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that bad? My sister always had high blood pressure, but I always thought I was okay. Just… be careful. I have a sensitive gag reflex.
DOCTOR: It’s a little elevated, Melvenia, but not necessarily cause for immediate alarm. We’ll keep an eye on it. It could be elevated due to stress or simply a bit of a variation. We can discuss lifestyle modifications to help manage it if it remains consistently high. And I will be very careful with your throat. It looks healthy, no signs of infection. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Do you have any allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not to anything food-related, no. But… I get terribly itchy when I’m around cats. Really, terribly itchy. And sometimes, if I’m in the garden too long, I get a rash from the weeds. But other than that… no. Nothing serious. I just avoid cats, mostly. Horrible little creatures.
DOCTOR: Okay, allergic reaction to cats and occasional rash from weeds. Noted. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Just a little something for my arthritis, mostly. It’s called… Celcoxib. One a day. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take some ibuprofen. And I take a multivitamin… sometimes. I forget. I'm not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Celcoxib for arthritis, ibuprofen as needed, and a multivitamin occasionally. It’s alright to forget sometimes, Melvenia. Many patients have difficulty with medication adherence. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Let me see… No diabetes, no. My sister had high blood pressure, like I mentioned. I haven’t been diagnosed with heart disease, no. And… no cancer, thankfully. I had a little… scare a few years ago, but it turned out to be nothing. Just a benign cyst. But other than that… no. Pretty healthy for my age, I think. I’ve always been a strong woman.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Melvenia. And it sounds like you’ve been very proactive about your health. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Oh! Yes. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. A long, long time ago. And… I had a hysterectomy in my thirties. That’s about it. Nothing since then, thankfully. Not a fan of hospitals, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and hysterectomy. Noted. And finally, can you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a long story. My mother had arthritis, like me. And my sister, she had high blood pressure and… she had a stroke a few years ago. It was very sad. My father… he died of a heart attack when he was relatively young. And my grandparents… well, I don’t really remember much about them. They died when I was a little girl. Mostly just arthritis and heart problems on both sides, I think. It runs in the family, I guess.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Melvenia. It's helpful to have a clear picture of your family history. Alright, we’ve covered quite a bit. To summarize, you’re here to obtain a health declaration for a volunteer trip to Mexico. You have a history of arthritis, occasional ibuprofen use, an allergy to cats and weeds, a history of appendectomy and hysterectomy, and a family history of arthritis, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Based on this, I believe you are medically fit to travel and participate in volunteer work, with a few considerations. Would you like me to elaborate on those?
PATIENT: Yes, please do, Doctor. I want to be prepared. I don’t want to collapse in the middle of building a house! Tell me everything. What do I need to watch out for?
DOCTOR: Certainly. First, it's important to stay well-hydrated, especially in the warm climate. Dehydration can exacerbate existing conditions and lead to fatigue. Second, continue to manage your arthritis with Celcoxib as prescribed. If you experience increased pain, consider using ibuprofen sparingly, but be mindful of potential side effects. Third, monitor your blood pressure at home if possible. If it remains consistently elevated, we can discuss lifestyle modifications or medication options. Fourth, be aware of the symptoms of a stroke, which can include sudden weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, and vision changes. If you experience any of these symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. Finally, protect yourself from insect bites and sunburn. Wear protective clothing, use insect repellent, and apply sunscreen regularly. I'll provide you with a written health declaration form, which you can take to your volunteer trip organizers. It will also include these recommendations. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: That all sounds… sensible. Stay hydrated, manage the arthritis, watch the blood pressure, stroke symptoms… and insect bites. Okay. I can do that. What about the forms? Will you sign them now? That’s what I came for, after all. And... is this visit going to be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can certainly complete and sign the health declaration forms for you now. Regarding the cost, I understand that you do not have insurance. We offer a self-pay rate for patients without insurance, and I’ll be happy to discuss the details with you. I will also ensure the fee is reasonable, considering the scope of the visit. Let me finish completing these forms, and then we can discuss payment options. Here are the completed forms. As for the cost of the visit today, it will be \$75. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: \$75… Yes, that’s… manageable. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And signing the forms, of course. I think that’s everything. I should probably get going. I have a lot to pack!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Melvenia. I’m glad I could help. Before you go, please remember to stay hydrated, manage your arthritis, monitor your blood pressure, and be aware of stroke symptoms. And have a wonderful time on your volunteer trip! If you experience any concerns while traveling, please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. And feel free to reach out if you have any questions in the future. Have a safe and fulfilling journey.
