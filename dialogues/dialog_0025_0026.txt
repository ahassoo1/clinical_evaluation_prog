DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker, welcome. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, it's this tiredness. Just…no energy. It comes and goes, you know? It’s not like I’m doing anything to be tired, either. Mostly just sitting. My husband says I’ve been sleeping more, but it doesn’t help. And something about…numbers being off? He showed me a paper, but honestly, I didn't really understand it. He worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tiredness, even with extra sleep…and your husband mentioned some numbers being off. Okay. Let's start with the tiredness. When did you first start noticing this, Ms. Oitker?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. Seems like…a while now. Maybe a few months? It’s all blurring together, to be honest. It's not like it came on suddenly. More like…slowly getting worse. I used to be able to get up and potter around the garden all day, but now…just thinking about it makes me weary. Though, to be fair, the garden is a lot of work. It's not what it used to be, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months, gradually worsening. And it's impacting your ability to do things you enjoy. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think...well, my muscles ache a bit sometimes. Not all the time, just now and then. And I've been a bit clumsier than usual, I suppose. Dropped a teacup just yesterday, shattered it everywhere. My husband blamed it on the tiredness, of course. He always has an explanation. It's just...getting old, I expect. Everything starts to go, doesn’t it? Though, I was a strong swimmer, you know. Used to be able to swim for hours. Not like this now.
DOCTOR: Right. Muscle aches and some clumsiness. And you've noticed a change in your strength. Do these aches feel all over, or are they in specific areas?
PATIENT: Specific areas, I think. Mostly in my legs and arms. Not my back, thankfully. My back’s been alright. It's more like...a dull ache. Not sharp, just…there. And it seems worse after I've been sitting for a long time. Then trying to get up is… a struggle. My husband helps me, you know. He's a good man, but he fusses so. He keeps going on about…something in my blood? Honestly, doctor, I don't pay attention to those things. I leave that to him.
DOCTOR: Alright, aches in your legs and arms, worse after sitting, and difficulty getting up. And your husband has mentioned something about your bloodwork. Let's take a look at that chart… Hmm. Your husband is right. Your vitamin D level is quite low, and your hemoglobin is a little on the low side as well. We’ll need to talk about that. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh dear. I haven't really been keeping track. I eat…well, I eat. My husband cooks, mostly. He makes lovely dal. I don’t think I’ve been eating less, but I haven't been feeling particularly hungry, either. Just…not a big appetite, really. Everything tastes a bit…bland, if I'm honest. Not that I complain. It's just…the food doesn’t excite me like it used to. And I’ve been a bit forgetful, you know. Losing things, misplacing my glasses…though, that’s probably just old age again.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite, food tastes bland, and some forgetfulness. Now, have you had any problems with your digestion?
PATIENT: Digestion? Let me see…well, sometimes I feel a bit…bloated, I suppose. And a little bit of… discomfort. Not pain, exactly. Just a bit… unsettled. It comes and goes. I thought it was just something I ate. My husband makes such good food, but sometimes it’s a bit…rich, you know? Too many spices, perhaps. He means well, he really does. He just likes to experiment. I don’t want to discourage him, so I just…try to eat it. Though, I do sometimes feel a little queasy afterwards.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating and some discomfort after eating, sometimes feeling queasy. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a long time ago. I had…something with my kidneys, when I was younger. Back in Bhutan, before I came here. I was quite ill, but I recovered. They gave me some…herbs, mostly. And lots of rest. It was a long time ago, so I don’t remember the details. And… I had a bit of trouble with my heart, later on. They put me on some pills for a while, but I don't take them anymore. The doctor said it was… under control. Honestly, I don't remember much about it. It all happened so long ago. I mostly just try to forget about it. Worrying doesn’t help, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, history of kidney issues and heart trouble. Do you recall what kind of heart trouble you had?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It was… palpitations, I think. My heart would race sometimes. And I felt… faint. The doctor said something about… irregular heartbeat. But I don’t really understand those things. He gave me some pills to slow it down. I took them for a while, then he said I didn’t need them anymore. Everything was… stable. I haven't had any trouble with it for years. Really. It's just… a blur now. So many years ago, so many doctors. It all gets mixed up. I mostly just try to focus on the present. Worrying doesn’t solve anything, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Irregular heartbeat in the past, now stable. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Hmm. Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Though, that rash last year… my husband said it was the detergent. He changed it, and it went away. But I don’t think that was an allergy, really. More like…sensitive skin, perhaps. I’ve taken all sorts of pills over the years, and nothing has ever bothered me. Honestly, I can't recall a single allergic reaction. Not ever. My husband always checks everything, though. He's very careful. He worries so much about me.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pills or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see…well, I take a vitamin D supplement now, the doctor prescribed it. And sometimes I take a little something for my joints, when they're bothering me. It's…a herbal remedy, my husband gets it from the shop. It’s got turmeric in it, I think. And sometimes, just sometimes, I take an antacid, if I'm feeling a bit…indigested. But that's it, really. Nothing else. Just a few little things, here and there. My husband keeps track of it all, though. He makes sure I take everything properly. He’s very organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D supplement, turmeric for joints, and antacids as needed. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. That’s just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. That's fine. Go ahead. I suppose it's a good idea to check everything. Though I don't expect you'll find anything wrong. I feel…well, I feel tired, mostly. But I’m an old woman. Things wear out, you know? Just like everything else. Though my husband keeps saying I’m strong for my age. He’s very kind. Do be gentle, though. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be very gentle. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Okay, your heart rate is a little fast, but it’s regular. I hear some… diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of your lungs. I’ll need to listen more closely to that. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little slow, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Hmm. It's a little tender in the lower abdomen, but nothing too concerning. Overall, your exam is mostly within normal limits for your age, but there are a few things I want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Further? Oh dear. What things? Is it something serious, doctor? My husband will be so worried. He gets so anxious about my health. He keeps saying I should rest more, but I am resting! I just…feel tired all the time. Is it my heart? Or my lungs? I don’t want to end up in the hospital. I hate hospitals. Everything smells so…sterile. And so many beeping noises! Just tell me what’s wrong, doctor. I can handle it. I’m an old woman, I’ve seen a lot in my life. Just don’t make me go to the hospital, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker. Let’s not jump to conclusions. It’s not necessarily something serious, and I’m not saying you need to go to the hospital right now. But your diminished breath sounds and tenderness in your abdomen, along with your tiredness and decreased appetite, are things we need to look into. Your heart sounds okay for now, but we need to rule out other possibilities. The most likely thing, based on your symptoms and the exam, is that you might have some mild anemia, which explains the tiredness. Also, I'm concerned about a possible mild infection in your lungs, which could explain the diminished breath sounds and abdominal discomfort. To be sure, I want to order some blood tests – a complete blood count to check for anemia, and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs. We will also do a urine test to rule out a urinary tract infection. This will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests… Oh dear. More tests. My husband will be relieved, I suppose. He always wants to know everything. But I hate needles. They make me so dizzy. And X-rays… are they safe? I’ve heard they’re not good for you. And urine tests… well, that’s just embarrassing. But if you think it's necessary, doctor, I’ll do it. I trust your judgment. Just promise me you'll explain everything clearly, and that you won't make me go to the hospital. And if it is something serious, please don’t tell my husband right away. He gets so upset. He needs to take his medication, you know. His blood pressure. It’s all very complicated. Just take care of me, doctor. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker. I promise I’ll explain everything clearly, and I'll do my best to avoid making you go to the hospital. We’ll start with the blood tests and chest X-ray. The blood test will just be a small sample from your arm, and the X-ray is quick and relatively painless. As for the urine test, we can provide you with a private room for that. I’ll order these tests right away, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them in detail and create a plan of action. Regarding your husband, I understand your concerns. I’ll respect your wishes and keep him informed only as much as you want me to. Now, let's get a requisition form for these tests. Here you go. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They'll take good care of you. Is there anything else I can do for you at this moment?
PATIENT: No, doctor. I think that's all. Just…thank you. For listening, and for explaining everything so clearly. And for promising not to send my husband into a panic. He worries so much. He's a good man, but… he can be a bit much sometimes. I suppose I should go and get these tests done, then. The sooner it's over, the better. And please, doctor… call me if you find anything concerning. Don't wait for the next appointment. Just… let me know. I’d rather be prepared. .
