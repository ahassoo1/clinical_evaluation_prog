DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, I just kinda wanted to check things out. See what’s what, you know? I ain’t really sick sick, just… curious, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Checking things out” is a good idea. It’s always better to be proactive about your health. To help me get a better picture of what you’re thinking of, can you tell me a little more specifically what you’re curious about?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I work on boats, right? Out on the water a lot. Sometimes I feel a little… off. Not sick, like a cold or anything. Just kinda tired, maybe a little achy. And I was wondering if bein’ on the water all the time does somethin’ to a person. Like, if the air or somethin’ messes with you. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Working on boats does expose you to some different things. And fatigue and aches can have a lot of different causes. To start, let’s talk a little more about this “off” feeling. When did you start noticing it?
PATIENT: Uh… lemme think. It started… maybe six months ago? Around then, I guess. It comes and goes. Some days I feel fine, real strong. Other days, like after a long trip, I just feel… drained. Hard to explain. It ain’t a sharp pain or anything, just… heavy, you know? Like I been workin' too hard, even when I haven't.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, coming and going, and a heavy feeling even with adequate rest. That’s helpful. Do you notice anything specific that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. When the weather’s real bad. Like, big storms comin' through. When the boat’s rockin’ a lot, and I gotta work extra hard to keep things steady… that’s when it’s the worst. And… bein' in the sun all day, too. I try to wear a hat and stuff, but it still gets to me sometimes. Makes me feel kinda dizzy and weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse with storms and prolonged sun exposure. Dizzy and weak is good to know. Have you had any nausea or vomiting with the dizziness?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Not sick to my stomach or nothin'. Just kinda… lightheaded. Like I might fall over if I stand up too fast. And sometimes my head feels kinda… fuzzy. Not a headache, exactly, just not clear. Like I'm tryin' to think through somethin' thick. You know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Lightheadedness and a “fuzzy” feeling in your head. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing or vision recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… my ears do ring sometimes. Not all the time, but after a long trip, especially if the engine’s loud, they’ll be ringin’ for a bit. And my vision… maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I just figured that was 'cause I need new glasses. I ain’t been to the eye doctor in a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears after engine noise and some blurry vision. We should definitely check those things out. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual kid stuff, chickenpox and all that, but nothin' serious. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but it healed up good. I ain't been to the doctor much, honestly. Just when somethin's really bad. I got Medicare, so I go if I need to, but I try to tough it out if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical history. Just the usual childhood illnesses and a broken arm. And you use Medicare. Good to know. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Everything's original, ha! I always figured if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Though… I might need somethin’ done with my back someday. All the liftin' on the boats… it’s takin’ a toll. But it ain’t bad enough yet to go under the knife.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And some back pain from lifting. Let’s move on to family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any medical problems, like heart disease, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my momma had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandpappy, on my dad’s side, he had somethin' with his heart. I don't really know much about it, though. We wasn’t a family that talked a lot about health stuff. Everyone just kinda… dealt with it. Nobody really went to the doctor much, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure and some heart issues. We will keep that in mind. And now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Never smoked a day in my life. Don’t really care for it. And I don't drink much, maybe a beer or two on a special occasion. And I definitely don’t do any drugs. Never have, never will. I gotta be clear-headed on the boats, you know? Can't be messin' with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no drugs. One last question before we do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. I can eat just about anything. Never had a reaction to anythin'. I've been stung by a few bees, but that just hurts, it don't make me sick or nothin'. So, no allergies that I'm aware of. You wanna check me out now, Doctor? I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Excellent. Yes, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment. I’ll also take a look in your ears and eyes. First, let’s check your blood pressure. 130 over 80. That’s a little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, let's check your ears. There’s some cerumen buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to the ringing you’ve been experiencing. I’ll make a note of that. And finally, your eyes. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Your vision appears slightly blurry, as you mentioned. Reflexes are normal. Overall, the neurological exam is unremarkable. Now, I want to order some blood work and an audiogram – a hearing test – to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We'll also do a urinalysis just to get a general overview. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Blood work and a hearin' test… and somethin' with the pee, huh? Alright. When do I gotta do all that? And will the results tell me what's goin' on with this tired feelin'? I'm hopin' it ain't somethin' serious. I gotta get back to work, you know? Boats ain’t gonna sail themselves.
DOCTOR: I understand. Boats don't sail themselves! We'll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. The lab is just down the hall. They'll need a blood sample and a urine sample. It usually takes about 30 minutes. Then, the audiology department is on the third floor, and they can schedule you for a hearing test within the next few days. As for the results, the blood work will check for things like anemia, vitamin deficiencies, and kidney function, all of which can cause fatigue. The urinalysis will look for any signs of infection or other problems. And the audiogram will tell us more about the ringing in your ears and if there’s any hearing loss. It's hard to say definitively what’s causing the tired feeling without the results, but these tests will give us a much better idea. I'll call you as soon as I have them, usually within a week. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and avoid loud noises as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that covers it, Doctor. You explained everything real good. Rest, stay hydrated, and quiet… I can do that. Hopefully it's just somethin' simple. Thank you for takin' the time to listen, and for not makin' me feel like I'm crazy for feelin' tired. Some doctors just brush you off, you know? I guess I'll go do these tests now. Just down the hall, you said? Alright. Thank you again, Doctor Alzoubi.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Heindel. It’s my job to listen. And you’re not crazy at all – fatigue is a common symptom with many different causes, and it's good you're getting it checked out. Yes, just down the hall. The lab staff will take care of everything. And don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and get back to sailing!
