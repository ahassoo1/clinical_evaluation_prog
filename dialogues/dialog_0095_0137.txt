DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is good to meet you too. My… how you say… the place for old people? I need paper for that. My son, he say I need check-up first. For the… senior living.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, a pre-admission physical for the senior living facility. That’s perfectly alright. We'll get that sorted out for you. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why now is the time you’re considering a place like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… it is… getting hard. The house… too big. And my husband, he… he needs more help than I can give now. My son, he worry. He say is better place, more people. More help if something happen. I… I not so sure. But I listen to my son.
DOCTOR: That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like a difficult decision, but a practical one. So, to get a good picture of your overall health for the facility, let’s go through some questions. First, are you having any specific health problems right now – anything that’s bothering you, like pain, shortness of breath, or feeling unusually tired?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my knees, they hurt. When I walk too much. And… I forget things. Not all things! Just… little things. Like… what I eat for breakfast. Or… name of the nice flower my neighbor give me. But not big things! Is just… old age, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee pain and some memory issues. We'll definitely explore both of those. When did you start noticing the knee pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… long time. Maybe… two, three years? Not every day. When I walk a lot, or go up the stairs. Sometimes is just… a little ache. But sometimes… is hard to move. Like… stuck.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about the memory issues?
PATIENT: Maybe… a little longer than knees? Maybe… five years? Is not bad. I still know my family. I still know how to cook. Is just… small things. Like… I put the keys in the fridge sometimes. Or… I go to the store, forget what I need. Is silly things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been gradual. It sounds like it's more than just occasional forgetfulness. Let's talk about other things. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure. The doctor, he tell me many years ago. I take the… the little white pill. Every morning. Is okay now, I think. He check it, and is good. No… no heart problems. I think. And no… diabetes. Is my husband have that. Not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The baby, many years ago. That is a surgery. And… when I was young, my appendix. Very sick. That is surgery too. And… I think that is all. Is long time ago. Very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, C-section and appendectomy. And how about your family?
PATIENT: My husband… he is okay, but old. He have the diabetes, I tell you. And my son… he is healthy. Work too much. Two children. Very good children. My daughter… she live far away. In… California, I think. She call me sometimes. Everyone is okay. I think. Is hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, you don’t need to remember everything right now. Just a general idea is fine. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I eat everything. I take the pill for blood pressure, and sometimes… for the knees. When they hurt very bad. No… no allergies. I never have problem with food. Or… bee sting. Or… anything. I think. Is important to know?
DOCTOR: It is good to know. Just to be sure. Okay, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Is okay. You already check my blood pressure? The little machine on my arm? Is okay. You do what you need. Is good.
DOCTOR: Yes, we did a preliminary check, but I like to do it myself to confirm. Take a nice deep breath for me... and again... Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you please bend them for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Oh… a little pain. Here. And here. Is worse when I bend them. Is like… stuck. And the bone… it feels rough. Is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can feel some crepitus – that’s the roughness you’re describing – and some tenderness on the inner part of both knees. There's also some swelling, though it’s not significant. Range of motion is limited, as you mentioned. Okay. We'll need to get some x-rays of your knees to get a better look at the joints and rule out any significant arthritis. Do you have any pain right now while your leg is extended?
PATIENT: No… no pain when is straight. Just when I bend them. And… when I walk too much. Is… like the bone… rub together. Is hard to explain. The x-ray… is good? Will show me what is wrong?
DOCTOR: Yes, x-rays can show us the condition of the bones and joints and help determine if there's any arthritis or other structural issues. It's a good next step. We'll also do some blood work just to get a general overview of your health and check your kidney function, as that can affect some medications. Let's get those orders in. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That is good. My son, he say I need all these tests. He is very… careful. He worry too much, but is good son. You think… is bad? My knees? I can still walk, but… is harder now.
DOCTOR: It's good that your son is involved and looking out for you. From this quick exam, it looks like you likely have some osteoarthritis, which is very common with age. It’s not necessarily “bad,” but it is something we need to manage to keep you comfortable and mobile. The x-rays and blood work will help us get a clearer picture and create the best plan for you. I'm ordering the x-rays and blood work now. The lab is just down the hall, and the radiology department is on the third floor. Do you have any questions for me before we get you set up with those tests?
PATIENT: No… no questions right now. Just… is the tests… will take long? I not so good with… waiting. My son, he can come with me? He work, but… maybe he can take half day.
DOCTOR: The blood work shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes, and the x-rays maybe another 20-30 minutes. And yes, absolutely, your son is more than welcome to accompany you. Having someone with you is always a good idea. We'll have the results back in a few days, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a plan. Here are the requisitions. Just take these to the lab and radiology departments. Do you think you'll be able to manage that, or would you like me to have a nurse escort you?
PATIENT: I think I can manage. With the paper. My son, he is very good with paper. He will help. Is okay. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. I'm glad we could get this started. If you have any questions at all before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here's a card with our number. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. Bye bye to you too, Doctor. And thank you for your help.
