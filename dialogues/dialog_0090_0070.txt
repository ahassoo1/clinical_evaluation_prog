DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too, Doctor. Kur, you say? Yes. Well, I… moved here. Just moved. From… somewhere. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. They said I needed to… check in. With a doctor. Because of… the old age thing, I guess. Medicare, you know? They send letters. Lots of letters.
DOCTOR: Right. Medicare does send a lot of letters. And welcome to the area, Mr. Szmyd. So, to clarify, you’re not currently experiencing any specific health problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Problems? Not that I remember. Everything… feels okay. A little tired, maybe. Old bones, you know? But that’s just… life. I used to do… faces. Pretty faces. For the stage. Makeup, yes. A long time ago. But no problems. Not really.
DOCTOR: "A little tired." Alright. And you said you were involved in stage makeup previously?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, that’s right. I made the actors look… beautiful. Or scary. Whatever they needed. It was good work. Very… precise. Lots of little brushes and powders. But… it was a long time ago. Before… everything got fuzzy. I don't even remember where the stage was, half the time.
DOCTOR: Well. Alright. Let's do a quick examination, just to get a baseline, since you’re a new patient and you mentioned feeling a bit tired. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Examine? Look, I’ve had plenty of people poking and prodding at my face over the years. Actors are very… sensitive. But… alright. If you must. Just be gentle, yes? And don’t smudge my glasses. They’re new.
DOCTOR: Of course. Gentle. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Always with the squeezing. It's not comfortable, you know. Makes me feel… old.
DOCTOR: 140 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. Breathe normally. Any chest pain or shortness of breath lately?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Just… a little winded sometimes. When I… walk. Or think. Hard to say. Everything feels a bit… slow these days. Like looking through a fog. Is that normal for… old people? I don’t recall anyone asking me about fog before.
DOCTOR: Well, a little shortness of breath isn’t uncommon with age, but “fog” is… vague. Let’s check your reflexes. Left leg now.
PATIENT: Hmph! Oh! Careful! What was that for? My knee! It’s not as strong as it used to be, you know. I haven’t… danced in years. It's a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Reduced reflexes. As expected. Now, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think... Ah... I think... maybe a little pill. For… something. The color is blue. Or maybe white. My neighbor helps me with them. She's very organized. I don't really pay attention to those things. She just tells me to take it with breakfast. Or maybe dinner. I honestly can’t remember.
DOCTOR: A blue or white pill, taken with breakfast or dinner… and you don’t know what it’s for?
PATIENT: Exactly! See? It’s all… blurry. It’s not my fault, you know. I have a lot on my mind. Or… had. Before the fog, of course. She said it was important. Very important. And she's a very responsible neighbor. I trust her. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mr. Szmyd, it's important for me to know what medications you're taking to ensure your safety. We need to determine what this pill is. Do you know your neighbor's name and contact information?
PATIENT: Hmph. Yes, yes. Her name is… Olga. Olga… Petrova, I think. She lives right next door. Number 14. She has a cat. A very fluffy cat. I… I believe she’s listed in the phone book. Or maybe the internet. My grandson helps me with the internet sometimes. He’s a very clever boy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Olga Petrova, number 14. We’ll try to get in touch with her. Given your memory issues and the unidentified medication, I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. Also, I'm recommending a neurological consult. It's best to get a specialist's opinion on your cognitive function. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Neurological…? What does that mean? More poking and prodding? I’m starting to feel quite overwhelmed. Look, I just wanted to check in. Make sure everything was… working. Not get… tested and examined and… and what was the other thing? It all sounds very serious.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. A neurological consult simply involves a doctor specializing in the brain and nervous system. They’ll perform some tests to assess your memory and thinking skills. It's a precaution, given your… vague recollection of events and medications. It's better to be thorough. We'll get a clearer picture of what's going on, and I can better address your concerns. The blood work is standard procedure for new patients, especially given your age. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Hmph. “Vague recollection…” You make me sound… foolish. Fine. Tests. Blood work. But if it involves anything with needles, I’m drawing the line. And no more tapping on my knees! Just… promise me it won’t take all day. I have… things to do. Or I used to. Before the fog.
DOCTOR: No needles if you absolutely refuse. I will write the orders for the blood work and the neurological consult. We’ll schedule those appointments for you as soon as possible. As for the neurological exam, they will likely ask you a series of questions, and may do some simple memory tests. It shouldn’t take long. I’ll have my assistant, Nurse Davies, come in and explain the paperwork and scheduling process. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Nurse…? Alright. Paperwork… I hate paperwork. And questions… hmm. Yes, actually. Will this affect my… my television watching? I enjoy my programs. Very important programs. Especially the ones with the… the detectives. And the cooking.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I assure you, these tests will not affect your television watching. They are simply to assess your overall health and cognitive function. I’ll leave you with Nurse Davies. She'll handle the rest. Please be honest with her. It’s important.
PATIENT: Honest… As if I remember what’s honest anymore… Honestly. Detectives… and cooking… that’s all that matters…
