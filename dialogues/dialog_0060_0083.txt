DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s not really a problem, you understand. More of a… a little thing. My daughter, she says I should get a card. A “get well” card, she says. Even though I feel perfectly fine. But she worries. And she says you have to write it. A doctor’s card means something, you see? It’s… encouraging. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Right. A doctor’s note for… encouragement. Well, it’s certainly…unconventional. But alright. So, let's just clarify – you're here because your daughter thinks you should have a note from a doctor, despite feeling “perfectly fine”?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. She thinks… I don't know, she thinks a little something official will… cheer me up. She means well, you understand. She’s a good girl, but… a little overbearing. It’s just a card, doctor. With a nice message. Something a doctor would say. Not like… a sympathy card, of course. Just… nice. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: No, it's not hard, Mr. Kammer. It’s… a peculiar request. But fine. Before I write this… “encouraging” note, I do need to ask a few basic questions, just for my records. It’s standard procedure, even for… this. Have you been experiencing any changes in your health lately?
PATIENT: Changes? No, not really. I eat my breakfast, I walk a little. Same as always. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? I’m… getting older, you understand. That makes you tired. But no changes. Nothing a little rest can’t fix. I don’t go to the hospital, I don’t take pills. Just… normal. Is that what you want to know, doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say “a little tired,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Well… you know, like… at the end of the day. I sit in my chair, and… I just feel… settled. Not sick, mind you. Just… done. Like the chair is… holding me. And I stay there a little longer than I used to. Before I would be up, doing things. Now… I just… sit. It's not a bad feeling, doctor. Just… different. Is that making sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It’s… vague, Mr. Kammer, but alright. Any difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: No, doctor. I sleep like a log. Always have. Maybe I wake up once, to use the bathroom, but that’s it. No trouble falling asleep, no trouble staying asleep. I don’t need pills or anything. Good sleep, good appetite. That’s what my mother always said. You take care of those two things, you’ll be alright. She lived to be ninety, you know. Ninety years old. Good sleep and a good breakfast. That’s the secret.
DOCTOR: And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: Perfectly fine, doctor. I eat my breakfast, like I said. Eggs, toast, sometimes bacon. Lunch is usually a sandwich. And dinner… my daughter makes a nice dinner. Usually chicken, or fish. I eat everything she puts in front of me. I don't skip meals. I don't have a fancy diet. Just… normal food. Like a normal person. Is that what you want to hear, doctor? I eat. I sleep. I don’t complain.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. And you said your daughter brings you dinner?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. She worries, you see? She lives close by, thankfully. She checks on me a lot. Makes sure I'm… okay. She’s a good girl. Too good, maybe. Always fussing. But she means well. She brings the dinner, makes sure I eat it, asks if I need anything. She's very… thorough. It’s nice, I suppose. But sometimes a man just wants to… sit in his chair, you know? Without someone asking if he needs a glass of water.
DOCTOR: And does your daughter happen to notice anything… different about you lately?
PATIENT: Different? I don’t know. She says I’m… quieter. That I don’t talk as much. But I always was a man of few words. She worries about everything. She says I’m… withdrawn. But I’m just… relaxing, doctor! A man deserves to relax in his old age. She thinks I’m sad, maybe. But I’m not sad! I just… prefer my own company sometimes. She's always making a fuss about something. It’s… exhausting, to be honest. Is that… is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I see here your height is listed as 187 centimeters and your weight as 64 kilograms. That's... a fairly low weight for your height. Are you aware of any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, the height, that’s right. Tall, I am. Always been tall. But the weight… well, I don’t pay much attention to that. I’ve always been… slender. My mother was slender, too. I eat enough, doctor, I assure you. Maybe I just… don’t put weight on easily. It’s not a problem, I don’t feel weak or anything. It’s just… the way I am. She probably wrote that down because she worries. She always exaggerates. Is it really important, doctor? I feel fine.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Kammer. Significant weight loss can be indicative of underlying medical conditions. While I understand you feel fine, it’s my responsibility to investigate. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Now hold on just a minute. I came here for a card, doctor. An encouraging card! Not… poked and prodded like some… some young athlete. I told you, I feel perfectly fine. I eat, I sleep, I sit in my chair. What more do you need to know? My daughter is going to be furious if I come home and tell her I spent the afternoon getting… examined. This is ridiculous. I think I'll just go. I don't need this. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, your daughter brought you in here because she is concerned. Dismissing potential health issues is not a responsible course of action. I am obligated to at least perform a basic assessment. It will only take a few minutes. If everything is normal, I will happily write your card. But I cannot, in good conscience, simply sign a piece of paper without ensuring your well-being. I strongly advise you to reconsider. At the very least, let me check your blood pressure and listen to your heart. It's a simple precaution.
