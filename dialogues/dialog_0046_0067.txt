DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m pleased to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, Doctor. Glowka, you say? Yes… well, it’s this pain. When I breathe… deep like… it hurts. It's been… a little while now, I think. Hard to say exactly how long. Old man problems, probably.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some chest pain that worsens with deep breaths. "A little while now" is helpful, but if you could try to estimate – perhaps a few weeks, a month, longer?
PATIENT: A month… maybe. Or a little more? Time… it just goes by, you know? I’ve been busy… with things. Construction, mostly. Still doing a bit of managing, even if I’m not… doing as much. It comes and goes, the pain. Not every breath, just… when I really fill my lungs.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you trying to pinpoint the timeframe, Mr. Ruocco. It's good you’re still managing things, staying active is important. When the pain comes, where exactly do you feel it?
PATIENT: Right… here. Not a sharp pain, more of a… ache. And sometimes, it feels like it goes through to my back. A dull ache, mostly. It's hard to explain. It doesn’t… stop me from doing things, but it’s… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an ache on the right side of your chest, sometimes radiating to your back. I understand it’s not stopping you from your activities, but it is bothersome. To get a better understanding, can you describe what you were doing when you first noticed the pain a month or so ago?
PATIENT: Hmm… a month ago… let me think. I think… I was inspecting a new site. Lots of walking uphill, you know? Dusty. And I had to… lift some things. Not heavy, nothing too bad, but… moving things around. That’s when I first noticed it, I believe. A little bit of discomfort. Didn’t think much of it at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain started with walking uphill and some lifting. And you didn’t think much of it initially. Has anything made it worse since then?
PATIENT: Worse… yes, now that you mention it. Cold weather, I think. When it's damp and chilly, it seems to bother me more. And… if I cough. A good, hard cough. That really brings it on. I haven’t been sick or anything, just… a tickle in my throat sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, so cold, damp weather and coughing seem to exacerbate the pain. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… No, not really. Maybe… a little tired sometimes, but I’m eighty years old! I get tired easy. No shortness of breath, no swelling in my legs… nothing like that. Just… this ache. And the tiredness. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no shortness of breath, no leg swelling. Just the chest ache and some fatigue. Have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Before? Hmm… no, not exactly like this. I’ve had aches and pains, of course. Old construction work, you know. But this is… different. Not a muscle strain, not a pulled something. More… deep inside. I had a bad cold when I was younger, maybe, that hurt a bit like this. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like this is a new type of pain for you, distinct from your usual aches. Now, I'm going to ask some routine questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… yes. Well, the doctor… years ago… told me my blood pressure was a little high. Gave me some pills for it. I took them for a while, then… I stopped. Didn't really like taking pills. And… I think I had a bit of pneumonia once, when I was younger. But nothing serious. That’s about it, I think. Honestly, I don’t go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that you were treated for with medication, and a bout of pneumonia in the past. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No… no, nothing. Like I said, I don't like taking pills. Maybe a pain reliever now and then, if my back is acting up. But that’s about it. Just… whatever I can find over the counter. Nothing regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, pretty much. Never had a reaction to anything. No trouble with bee stings or anything like that. I think I’m pretty clear on allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And lastly, regarding your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, lung problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… My father… he had a weak heart, I think. He passed away when I was young. And… my sister, she had some trouble with her lungs when she got older. But that's about all I remember. We weren’t a family that talked about… health problems much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a father with a weak heart and a sister with lung problems. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and check your chest for tenderness. It shouldn’t take too long. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s fine. Get it over with, you know? I have… things to do. But… go ahead. Listen away. Just… be gentle. This old body doesn’t take much anymore.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… again… good. Okay, and now I’ll listen to your heart. Your lung sounds are a little diminished on the right side, but I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Your heart sounds are regular, although a bit faint. There is some tenderness when I press on the lower right side of your chest, where you mentioned the pain. It doesn’t seem to be any muscle spasms. Does this reproduce the pain you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s it. That’s the spot. It’s… achy. Not sharp, like a muscle pull. More of a… deep ache. And… yes, it feels like the pain I’ve been getting. It's just… fainter. But it’s the same spot.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, it's possible this could be musculoskeletal pain, perhaps costochondritis - inflammation of the cartilage in your rib cage - or it could be something else. Given your age and some diminished lung sounds on the right, I’d like to get a chest X-ray just to rule out any underlying lung issues like pneumonia or pleurisy. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes, alright. If it’ll… get to the bottom of things, then yes. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but if you think it’s necessary… do it. Get it over with. Is it… painful?
DOCTOR: No, an X-ray isn't painful at all. You’ll just stand or sit still while the machine takes a picture. It only takes a few minutes. While we're waiting for the X-ray results, do you mind if I ask a few questions about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Alright, ask away. But don’t take too long, you know? I’m not good at sitting still for long periods of time.
DOCTOR: Of course. Have you smoked at any point in your life?
PATIENT: Smoked? Oh… yes. A long time ago. When I was young. During the war, mostly. Everyone smoked back then. I quit… oh, fifty years ago, maybe more. Haven’t touched one since. A long, long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to hear you quit so long ago. And what about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Not much, never really been one for it. A beer with dinner now and then. That’s about it. Nothing heavy. Not a drinker, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you still involved in any construction work, or are you mostly managing things from an office now?
PATIENT: Still managing. Mostly paperwork now, thankfully. I go to the sites sometimes, to check on things. But I don’t do much of the lifting or… actual work anymore. Mostly just… telling people what to do. And worrying about things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And finally, have you had any recent illnesses, such as a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, not recently. I had a little tickle in my throat a few weeks ago, like I said. But nothing serious. No fever, no bad cough, just… a tickle. It went away on its own. Honestly, I haven’t been sick in… well, a long time. I have a pretty good constitution, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for answering my questions. Now, let's go get that X-ray, and we'll discuss the results when we return. It should give us a better idea of what's going on. The radiology technician will explain the procedure to you, and you can ask them any questions you may have. Do you have any questions for me before we head over?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… get it over with. I appreciate you… listening to me. It's nice to talk to someone. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. That’s all. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I understand. We’ll take a look at the results as soon as they’re available. It shouldn't be too long. I’ll explain everything clearly, and we’ll figure out the best course of action together.
PATIENT: .
