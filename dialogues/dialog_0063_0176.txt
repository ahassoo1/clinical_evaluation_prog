DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been… oh, let me think… more than two days now, easily. It's really getting on my nerves, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Two days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, two days. Started Tuesday, I believe. I was at work, setting up for the evening show – a bit of a rush, you know? And then hic… just started. I thought it would pass, but it hasn’t. hic See? Still going. It's pretty constant, actually.
DOCTOR: Constant hiccups for two days… Hmm. And what exactly is this “evening show” you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, I manage entertainment. I run a small venue – mostly live music, comedy nights, that sort of thing. It’s a bit of a hectic job, always lots going on. hic Keeps me busy, though! We had a magician booked for Tuesday, and I was just finishing up setting the stage when it started. hic Does that make any sense? It’s probably just stress, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Stress, perhaps. Though persistent hiccups in an adult are… not always simply stress. Have you noticed anything that makes them worse?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… hic… No, not really. They just… happen. Eating doesn't seem to change it, drinking water doesn't really help. hic I tried holding my breath a few times, like people always say, but that only lasted a few seconds. hic I don’t think anything makes them worse, they're just… consistently annoying!
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other symptoms alongside these hiccups?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? hic No, not really. I feel… fine, otherwise. A little tired, maybe, but that’s just from work. hic No pain, no shortness of breath, no… I don’t know, dizziness or anything like that. Just the hiccups. They're just… relentless! hic It's starting to give me a headache, honestly.
DOCTOR: Headache is likely from the… exertion of the hiccups themselves. Let’s have a quick listen to your lungs, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. hic Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. hic Just… try to be quick, if you don't mind? It's a little embarrassing, all this hiccuping. hic I feel like a broken record.
DOCTOR: Deep breath in… and out. Again. hic… Lungs sound clear. No wheezing, no crackles. Pulse is… normal. Have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little cold, maybe, a few months back? Nothing serious. hic Just the usual sniffles, a bit of a sore throat. It cleared up on its own pretty quickly. hic I don’t usually get sick, to be honest. I'm always running around, so I think I build up some immunity. hic Is it something I caught, do you think?
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be an infection at this point. Do you take any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. hic Never really been one for pills, if I can help it. hic Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but I haven't taken anything for days, I promise. hic I try to stay healthy, eat reasonably well… although, with my job, it’s hard to get regular meals. hic Do you think it's something to do with my stomach, maybe?
DOCTOR: A stomach issue causing hiccups for two days… possible, but improbable. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hic Not really. I mean, I sneeze a bit in the spring, with the pollen, but nothing major. hic No known allergies to food or anything like that. hic We do have some cleaning products at the venue, but I don’t usually handle those myself. hic I’m really stumped, Doctor. It’s just… hic persistent! Is it something serious, do you think?
DOCTOR: It's… unusual. Given your age and the lack of other symptoms, it’s unlikely to be anything serious. However, persistent hiccups can be indicative of certain underlying issues. We can order some blood work, just to be thorough. But I suspect it's simply… a temporary annoyance.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood work sounds… sensible, I suppose. hic If it puts my mind at ease. hic I just want it to stop. hic What kind of things would the blood work check for, Doctor? hic Just so I know what to expect, you understand.
DOCTOR: Routine things. Electrolytes, kidney function, a basic metabolic panel. We'll rule out anything obvious. The nurse will draw the samples. And in the meantime… try to relax. Though I understand that’s rather difficult with… hic your current predicament. I'll put in the order now.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. hic Relax, you say? hic Easier said than done, with all this… hic I suppose I can try. hic Will I need to fast before the blood work, Doctor? hic And where do I go to get it done? hic I’m a bit new to all this, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to fast for eight hours beforehand. No food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. And the lab is just down the hall, room 302. The nurse will give you a slip. Really, Ms. Redeye, it's a very simple procedure. Don't fret.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Eight hours… hic That means no dinner, then. hic Room 302, got it. hic Thank you, Doctor. hic I appreciate you looking into it. hic I hope it’s nothing serious. I suppose I should go and ask the nurse for the slip, then? hic Is there anything else I should know before I go? hic
DOCTOR: No, that will be all. The nurse will explain everything. And try not to worry unnecessarily. Persistent hiccups are… rarely a sign of anything grave. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Good day, Ms. Redeye.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. hic Yes, of course. hic Thank you again, Doctor. hic Good day to you too. hic
