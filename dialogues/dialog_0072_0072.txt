DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 38 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Hembrey. Yes, that’s right. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been… forgetting things. It’s been happening more and more lately, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Forgetting things, you say. Can you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Um, okay. It's not like, big things, usually. More like… where I put my keys, or if I took my vitamins. Little everyday stuff. But then sometimes I’ll… struggle to remember a coworker's name, even though I’ve met them a few times. It's just… frustrating, and I worry it's more than just being tired.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re addressing this now. When did you first start noticing these memory lapses?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. Maybe… six months ago? It was gradual, so I didn’t really pay attention at first. It just slowly got worse. I thought I was just stressed with work, you know? But it hasn’t really gotten better, even when things at the office calm down.
DOCTOR: And would you describe these instances as… frequent?
PATIENT: Frequent… yeah, I think so. It’s not every day, but it feels like most days I have at least one moment where I’m really scrambling to remember something. Sometimes more. It's enough to make me double-check things constantly, which is annoying. I even started writing things down, but then I forget where I wrote them down! It’s a bit of a mess, really.
DOCTOR: I see. Alright. Let’s move on to some other questions, then. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this memory difficulty?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Not that I've really noticed, no. I sleep okay, I think. I haven’t been feeling more sad or anxious than usual. No headaches or anything like that. I guess… maybe a little more clumsy lately? I tripped over the rug yesterday, which isn’t normally like me. But I don’t know if that's related.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness… noted. Let's discuss your medical history, Ms. Heidenthal. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, strep throat – but nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that’s about it. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothing like that. I’m pretty healthy, generally. Except for the forgetting, of course.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. And occasionally ibuprofen for headaches, but not regularly. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I prefer just… dealing with things, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any instances of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a tough one. My grandmother, on my mom’s side, she… she wasn't really herself towards the end. She was very forgetful, and confused. I don’t know if it was Alzheimer’s or something else, honestly. Nobody really talked about it much. My mom said she just "declined with age." And then, my great-uncle, he had some issues too, but again, nobody really knew what it was. So… maybe? It’s kind of a family secret, I guess.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, that is helpful information. Now, let’s discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month, if that. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m pretty boring, actually. I prefer a quiet night in with a book. It's probably why I'm so worried about losing my memory, you know? It's kind of all I have.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, for a quick physical assessment. I’m going to check your reflexes, balance, and do a brief cognitive test. It's just to get a baseline. Please follow my instructions as best you can. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Sure, that sounds fine. Um… today is August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I think so. It’s easy to lose track sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like you to repeat these three words for me: apple, table, penny. Remember them, and I'll ask you to recall them later.
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. Got it. Apple, table, penny. Hopefully I can remember those. It sounds easy enough, but you never know, right? Apple, table… and penny.
DOCTOR: Yes, indeed. Now, I’m going to check your vital signs and then do a brief neurological exam. Please sit comfortably.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I always get a little nervous at the doctor, even for routine checkups. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don’t move your head.
PATIENT: Okay, I can do that. Is this okay? Am I doing it right? I'm worried I'm blinking too much.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Gait appears stable, but slightly cautious. Now, can you please count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. Counting backwards by sevens? That’s… difficult. Um… let me see… 100, 93… 86… uh… 79? Is that right? This is harder than it looks. It's making me anxious, and that's not helping my memory.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s stop there. Now, do you recall the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Three words… apple… and… oh, it’s on the tip of my tongue. Table… and… I’m so sorry, I just… I can’t remember the third one. I knew I should have written them down! This is awful. I feel so stupid.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Heidenthal, based on this brief assessment, and given your family history, there’s a possibility of early cognitive decline. However, it’s far too early to draw any definitive conclusions. It could simply be stress or vitamin deficiencies. I recommend a full neurological workup, including an MRI of the brain. And I'll order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. An MRI… that sounds… serious. I… I guess that’s what I was afraid of. But… could it really be something serious? Like… Alzheimer's? I just… I don’t know what I would do.
DOCTOR: It's important not to jump to conclusions. Many things can cause memory problems, and an MRI will give us a clearer picture. I’m also referring you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. In the meantime, try to maintain a healthy lifestyle – regular exercise, a balanced diet, and plenty of mental stimulation. I also suggest bringing a trusted family member with you to the neurology appointment. They can help you process the information and ask questions. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don't think so. Not right now. It's just… a lot to take in. An MRI… and a neurologist. I guess I’ll… schedule those appointments. Thank you, Dr. Hembrey. I think I’m ready to go now. Would… would it be okay if I called if I think of anything? Or… if I just need someone to… talk to?
DOCTOR: You can contact my office with any questions, Ms. Heidenthal. However, please understand that my time is limited. I suggest focusing on scheduling those appointments as soon as possible. Have a good day. .
