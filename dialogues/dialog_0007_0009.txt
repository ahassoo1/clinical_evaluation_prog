DOCTOR: Hi Delano, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… my sight. It’s been going. Not suddenly, mind you. More… fading. It’s difficult to explain to someone who, I presume, still has good vision. It’s just… not as sharp as it used to be. And I’m a man who appreciates detail, you understand. It’s rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I do understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. “Fading” is a useful way to describe it. When did you first notice this change in your vision?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a tricky one. It wasn’t a specific day, if that makes sense. Perhaps… six months ago? Maybe a little longer. It was subtle at first. I chalked it up to eye strain from the computer, to be honest. I spend a good deal of my time reviewing employee files, you see. Small print, lots of it. But it hasn't… improved. Quite the opposite, really. I find myself holding things further away to read them. It's... bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of gradual worsening, worse with close-up work. Have you noticed it affecting other things?
PATIENT: Well, yes, naturally. It’s not as if one only reads employee files, Doctor. Driving at night has become… less pleasant. Streetlights seem to have a rather excessive glare. And I used to enjoy birdwatching, a perfectly respectable hobby, I assure you. But identifying species from a distance has become… challenging. One doesn’t want to misidentify a cardinal as a sparrow, you know. It’s simply not precise.
DOCTOR: Right, so night vision is affected, and difficulty with distance as well. Okay. Have you had any pain, redness, or discharge in your eyes?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Are you suggesting I’d come in if my eyes were hurting? That seems rather obvious, doesn’t it? No, Doctor, no pain, no redness, no… discharge. Just a gradual lessening of clarity. A decline, if you will. It’s a rather subtle complaint, I imagine. Not like a broken bone or some… common ailment.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not. And it's good you're describing it to me. Okay, let’s move on. Any family history of eye problems – glaucoma, macular degeneration, cataracts?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… difficult to say. My mother’s side… they weren’t much for discussing medical matters. A rather stoic bunch, you see. My father… he wore glasses, certainly. But what for? I honestly couldn’t tell you. Cataracts, perhaps? It was some time ago. He’s passed on now. No one ever spoke of anything… significant. They were… practical people, not prone to worrying about such things. It’s probably not relevant, honestly. A lot of people wear glasses.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know either way. Okay. And do you have any other medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Doctor, I assure you, I am a reasonably healthy man. I maintain a sensible diet – mostly. And I take regular walks. No, I don’t have any… conditions. High blood pressure? Diabetes? Goodness, no. I might have had a touch of the flu a few years back, but that hardly seems pertinent. I’m not one for frequenting doctors' offices. I prefer to avoid them, if I'm being frank.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's good to know. Any medications you’re currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: Well, I take a daily multivitamin. A sensible precaution, you understand. And occasionally, an aspirin for a headache. But that’s hardly a medication, Doctor. Nothing prescribed, nothing… ongoing. I’ve always preferred to treat minor ailments myself. A bit of rest, a bit of common sense. That usually does the trick. I certainly don’t rely on a cupboard full of pills. It’s… unnecessary, in my opinion.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional aspirin. Alright. I'd like to do a quick eye exam now, if you don’t mind. Just to get a baseline and see what’s going on. It won't take long. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I confess, I don’t anticipate it will reveal anything particularly illuminating. Still, if you insist. Yes, I can follow your finger. Though I must say, I do hope this won’t involve any… unpleasant procedures. I’ve never been particularly fond of having things poked and prodded. Proceed, I suppose. But gently, if you would.
DOCTOR: Of course, gently. Okay, looking straight ahead… good. Now follow my finger… right, left… up, down… excellent. Visual acuity… let’s check that. Reading chart at 20 feet… hmm. Right eye, 20/30. Left eye, 20/25. Okay. Not terrible, but definitely some decline. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. No obvious signs of cataracts or glaucoma. Fundoscopic exam… vessels look healthy, optic disc appears normal. I’m going to check your peripheral vision now. I’ll ask you to look straight ahead and tell me when you see something in your side vision.
PATIENT: 20/30 and 20/25, you say? That hardly seems… drastic. Though I suppose it confirms what I’ve been noticing. A slight blurring, a lack of sharpness. Peripheral vision, you say? Very well. Do try to be precise, Doctor. I need to know exactly when I detect something. I have a rather acute sense of observation, you know. And please, avoid any sudden movements. It’s rather disconcerting. Proceed. But carefully.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as precise as possible. Okay, looking straight ahead. Now, tell me when you see something in either side. … Anything now?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Though… wait. Just a fleeting shadow. Very faint. Peripheral vision isn’t what it used to be, I suppose. To the… left, I believe. Yes, definitely left. It’s… subtle. Not at all obvious. Are you certain that machine is functioning correctly, Doctor? It doesn’t seem terribly sensitive. Perhaps a different angle? It's… difficult to discern anything concrete. Very faint, indeed. I’m not one for guessing, you know. I prefer to be certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ve adjusted the sensitivity. Just let me know when you see something, even if it’s faint. We’re just trying to get a baseline. … Anything now?
PATIENT: Very well. Now… yes. Again, to the left. A fleeting… smudge, perhaps. It’s not a distinct shape, Doctor. More of a… darkening. It’s… unreliable, to be frank. I suspect this test is rather subjective. One’s perception can easily be influenced by… suggestion. Still, yes. To the left. But please, don’t ask me to pinpoint its exact location. It’s… ephemeral. A shadow, at best. This is all rather… imprecise, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: You're right, it can be subjective. Okay, one last thing. I'm going to check your eye pressure. It's a quick puff of air. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it won't last long. Just relax and look straight ahead. Okay, right eye pressure is 14. Left eye pressure is 16. Those are within the normal range.
PATIENT: A puff of air, you say? Rather… startling. And rather unnecessary, in my opinion. 14 and 16, you say? Within the normal range? Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. Though it hardly explains the… deterioration. A perfectly normal reading doesn’t negate the fact that my vision is demonstrably declining. It simply… doesn't. I find it rather frustrating that a few numbers can dismiss a perfectly valid observation. Still… what are your thoughts, Doctor? What does all this mean? Don’t tell me it’s just “age,” I’ve heard that one before.
DOCTOR: Okay, Delano. Your visual acuity is slightly reduced, but not dramatically. Your eye pressure is normal, and the fundoscopic exam didn’t reveal any obvious signs of glaucoma or cataracts. The peripheral vision test was a little difficult to interpret, but it doesn’t seem significantly impaired. Based on everything, it sounds like you're experiencing what we call presbyopia – age-related farsightedness. It's very common, especially after the age of 40. It's why people often need reading glasses. However, the fact that you’re noticing difficulty with distance vision as well suggests something else might be contributing. I’m also a little concerned about your subjective description of difficulty with peripheral vision. While the test wasn’t conclusive, it’s better to be cautious. I recommend we get a more comprehensive evaluation with an ophthalmologist. They have specialized equipment and can rule out any other potential causes, such as early signs of macular degeneration or other retinal issues. I’m going to write you a referral now. Would you like me to explain what an ophthalmologist does?
PATIENT: Presbyopia, you say? Age-related farsightedness? Well, that's… hardly a diagnosis, is it? It simply states the obvious. I am aging, Doctor. It's not a revelation. And to suggest it explains all my difficulties… it feels… inadequate. An ophthalmologist, you say? Specialized equipment? Is that to say your equipment isn’t sufficient? I confess, I find it rather concerning that you're deferring to another specialist so readily. It doesn't inspire confidence. However… if you believe it’s necessary to rule out… “retinal issues,” as you put it… very well. A referral, then. Though I must say, I expect a thorough explanation from this “ophthalmologist,” and I expect them to take my concerns seriously. Don’t simply dismiss it as “age,” Doctor. I find that… insulting. And yes, please. Explain what precisely an ophthalmologist does. I prefer to be fully informed.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I apologize if I made it sound like I wasn’t taking them seriously. It’s not about my equipment being insufficient, it’s about having access to specialized tools and expertise. An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of all eye diseases and conditions. They can perform more detailed tests to evaluate the health of your retina, optic nerve, and other structures within your eye. They’ll likely do an Optical Coherence Tomography, or OCT, which provides a cross-sectional image of your retina, and a visual field test, which maps your peripheral vision more accurately. They can also check for any signs of macular degeneration, glaucoma, or other potential issues. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected ophthalmologist in the area. She's known for her thoroughness and compassionate care. I’ll also include a summary of my findings and your concerns in the referral note. In the meantime, if you're experiencing any sudden changes in your vision, such as blurry vision, double vision, or loss of vision, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions about the referral process or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: Dr. Eleanor Vance, you say? Very well. I appreciate you providing a name. “Optical Coherence Tomography” and “visual field test”… more technical jargon, I presume. I confess, I find the sheer number of tests… unsettling. It feels as if my vision is being subjected to a… barrage of scrutiny. A “summary of findings”… yes, that’s essential. I want this Dr. Vance to be fully aware of my concerns, and I want her to take them seriously. I don't want a cursory examination and a dismissal as “age-related.” No, I believe that covers it for now. Just… ensure that Dr. Vance understands the gravity of the situation. My vision is… important to me. It's not something to be taken lightly. And thank you… for writing the referral. Though I confess, I’m not entirely optimistic. This whole experience has been… rather frustrating. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I believe I'll take my leave. I have several matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your frustration, and I’ll make sure Dr. Vance is fully informed of your concerns. I’m confident she’ll provide you with a thorough evaluation and address any questions you may have. Here’s the referral note and Dr. Vance’s contact information. Please schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Thank you for coming in today, Delano. And I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you… for your time. Though I remain… skeptical. I trust Dr. Vance will prove… more insightful than this initial examination suggests. Good day, Doctor. .
