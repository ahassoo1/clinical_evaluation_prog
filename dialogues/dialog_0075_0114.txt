DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Vanderwiele is the name. It's… well, it's my breathing. It’s been troubling me, especially when I try to lie down flat. Makes it very difficult to get comfortable, you see. I hope we can get this sorted quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Maribeth. Breathing difficulties are never pleasant, and we'll do our best to figure out what's going on. "Troubling" is a good way to describe it – can you tell me a little more about how it's troubling you?
PATIENT: Well… it feels like something is… pressing on my chest, almost. Not painful, exactly, but… heavy. And then I have to really work to get a good breath. It's worse when I'm trying to sleep, or just rest with my head on a pillow. Standing or sitting is… better. Much better, really. I don't know if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Maribeth. That description – the heaviness, the feeling of working to breathe, and it being worse when lying down – is very helpful. So, it sounds like this has been gradually worsening, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It didn't start suddenly. It’s been… creeping up on me, I suppose, for a few months now. At first, I thought it was just a bad mattress, or something. But it hasn't gone away. And it's… interfering with my sleep, naturally. I used to be a very sound sleeper. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything else changed along with this breathing issue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have noticed my ankles are a little… swollen, sometimes. Not terribly, but enough to notice. And I feel a bit… tired, more than usual. I used to walk every morning, but now I find myself… slowing down. Is that important? I don't know what's important and what isn’t.
DOCTOR: It absolutely is important, Maribeth. Both the ankle swelling and the fatigue are relevant. Just trying to build a complete picture here. Now, on a scale of one to ten, with one being no shortness of breath at all and ten being the worst you can imagine, what number would you give your breathing right now?
PATIENT: Right now? Oh… I’d say maybe a four. Not awful, but definitely noticeable. It's not constantly a four, you understand. Some days it’s less. When I’m exerting myself, like climbing stairs, it goes up to a six, maybe even a seven. I avoid stairs now, if I can. Is that… a bad sign?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re aware of how it changes with activity, and no, avoiding stairs isn't necessarily a "bad sign"—it’s your body telling you something, and we’re trying to understand what that is. Let’s go through a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. And I’ve been told I have… mild arthritis in my knees. Nothing too serious, just a little stiffness. Oh, and I have high blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. A small pill, every morning. I’ve been taking it for… oh, goodness, at least ten years now. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: That's a good start, Maribeth. Thank you. And what medications are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… the bottle is in the kitchen. It’s… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, ten milligrams, once a day. And sometimes, when my knees are particularly stiff, I take Ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter, you understand. Nothing prescribed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily and Ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat… well, I eat a pretty normal Zuni diet, mostly. Corn, beans, squash. I don’t have any food sensitivities that I’m aware of, and I’ve never had a problem with pollen or anything like that. My mother always said I was a sturdy child. A sturdy child with this breathing problem now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A sturdy child indeed. And have there been any heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My father… he had some chest pains later in life, but the doctor said it was indigestion. He smoked, you see. A lot. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had… I think it was a stroke. Not a heart problem, exactly, but… something with her blood pressure, I believe. She wasn’t very forthcoming about her medical issues. Zuni people don’t always talk openly about those things. It’s considered… private.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Maribeth. It's good to know what you do know, and I respect your family's traditions. Now, to get a better sense of what's going on, I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart with my stethoscope. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable. I’m not afraid of needles, if that’s what you’re wondering, but I do prefer to know what’s coming. And please don’t rush. I don’t mind waiting.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won’t be uncomfortable at all. I’ll explain everything as I go. Okay, take some nice, deep breaths for me… in through your nose, out through your mouth. I hear some… mild crackling in the lower part of your lungs, on both sides. And your heart sounds a little… enlarged, but not dramatically so. Your pulse is regular, but a bit on the slower side. I’m also going to check your ankles for swelling, if you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Alright. Crackling, you say? That doesn’t sound very good, does it? I suppose that’s why you’re listening. My ankles are… yes, they are a little swollen, aren’t they? I hadn't really paid much attention. It comes and goes. Is it the medication, do you think? The blood pressure pill? I've been taking it for so long… I just assumed that was normal for me now. I do hope it's not something serious, Doctor. I have a grandson I need to see soon.
DOCTOR: It's good you're observant, Maribeth. And no, crackling isn't ideal, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything terribly serious. It can indicate fluid buildup in the lungs, which could be related to your heart, or other issues. And swelling in the ankles, along with fatigue, does raise a possibility that your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should. The blood pressure medication could be a contributing factor, but we need to rule out other causes first. I'd like to order a few tests. A chest X-ray, to get a clearer picture of your lungs. And a blood test, to check your kidney function and look for signs of heart strain. We'll also do an EKG, which records your heart's electrical activity. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. X-ray, blood test, EKG… it all sounds rather… thorough. I trust your judgment. I’ve always been a practical woman. If there's something wrong, I’d rather know about it. And can you explain to me… what exactly will happen during these tests? I like to be prepared. I don’t like surprises. And… will they be painful?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Thoroughness is important. And you deserve to know exactly what to expect. The chest X-ray is very quick. You’ll simply stand in front of a machine, and it takes a picture of your lungs and heart. There’s a small amount of radiation involved, but it’s a very low dose. The EKG involves placing small, sticky patches on your chest, arms, and legs. These patches are connected to a machine that records your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt at all – you won’t feel anything. The blood test is just a simple prick of your finger or arm to draw a sample of blood. You might feel a tiny pinch, but it’s over very quickly. None of these tests should be painful. And the technicians who perform them are very skilled. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. A quick picture, sticky patches, and a little pinch. I can handle that. And how long will I have to wait for the results? I know you’re busy, Doctor, and I don’t want to take up too much of your time. I do have a garden that needs tending to, you know. But I understand these things take time.
DOCTOR: Gardening is important. I appreciate that. The X-ray results usually come back within a few hours, sometimes sooner. The blood test results take a little longer – usually a day or two. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a diuretic – a water pill. It’ll help your body get rid of some of the extra fluid, which might ease your breathing and reduce the swelling in your ankles. It’s a low dose, and we’ll see how you respond to it. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A water pill… to get rid of the fluid. Yes, that makes sense. And what are the… side effects? I always worry about side effects. My neighbor, Beatrice, she took a water pill once and she was in the bathroom all day! Will it interfere with my blood pressure medication? I take that every morning, you see, and I don't want to mess anything up. I just want to be able to breathe again, Doctor. And tend to my garden. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that is absolutely not too much to ask, Maribeth. And I understand your concern about side effects. Beatrice's experience isn't typical, but it's good you asked. The most common side effect of diuretics is increased urination – which is the point, of course! You'll need to go to the bathroom more frequently. It's also possible to experience some mild dizziness or lightheadedness, especially when you stand up quickly. And rarely, it can affect your potassium levels. That’s why we’ll check your potassium with the blood test. As for your blood pressure medication, we'll monitor your blood pressure closely to make sure everything stays stable. The diuretic and the blood pressure medication work differently, so they shouldn’t interfere with each other. But again, we’ll keep a close eye on things. Here’s the prescription. It’s for Furosemide, 20mg, once a day in the morning. Take it with a full glass of water.
PATIENT: Furosemide… 20 milligrams. Once a day, with water. Alright. I can manage that. And what if… what if I start to feel worse? Or dizzy? Or my ankles get more swollen? Who do I call? I don't want to end up in the emergency room. I just want to be prepared. It's the not knowing that worries me the most. And I have a grandson’s birthday coming up... I need to be there for him.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Maribeth. And you absolutely should know what to do if you start to feel worse. If you experience any dizziness, lightheadedness, or increased swelling in your ankles, call my office immediately. The number is on this card. We can get you in to see me right away. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, or feel like you’re having trouble breathing, go to the emergency room immediately. Don't hesitate. And don't worry about being a bother. We're here to help. We'll monitor you closely, and we'll adjust your medication as needed. I want you to be able to enjoy your grandson’s birthday and tend to your garden. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. And patient. I appreciate that. I've always believed in being prepared. I'll take the water pill tomorrow morning, and I'll call if I have any problems. Thank you, Doctor Panjoj. I hope it helps. I really do. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I believe I have some gardening to think about.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Maribeth. And you take care of yourself – and enjoy your gardening. Don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. Have a good day. .
