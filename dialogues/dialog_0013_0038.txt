DOCTOR: Hi Evann, good to meet you. I’m Chriselda Morenomartinez, one of the family doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Morenomartinez. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe I’m here to discuss… advance planning, if that’s the correct phrasing. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… well, should anything happen. I was advised to inquire about a form, perhaps an Advance Directive or a POLST, I think? It was suggested by a friend, but truthfully, I don’t recall the specifics. My memory… isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay, advance care planning – absolutely, that’s a really important thing to do. And you’re right to ask! It is about making sure your wishes are known. Both an Advance Directive and a POLST form are good options, and we can definitely figure out which one is best for you. Let me just quickly pull up your record here… Evann Buoniconi, age 35… alright. I see you've had a check-up with Dr. Ramirez about two years ago. Nothing major flagged there. Just to get a better sense of things, could you tell me a little bit about why you’re thinking about this now?
PATIENT: Dr. Ramirez… yes, that name sounds familiar. It’s difficult to say precisely why now. A friend… she recently had a difficult experience with her mother, and it prompted me to consider… well, ensuring my own affairs are in order. It feels… responsible, I suppose. Though, as I said, the details are… hazy. It’s not a pressing matter, not a specific illness or concern. More of a… preventative measure. I apologize for my lack of clarity. It’s frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Evann. It’s perfectly understandable, and it’s actually very responsible of you to think about this even without a specific health concern. A lot of people wait until there is a crisis. So, preventative planning… good to know. Just to be thorough, are you currently experiencing any health problems at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not presently. I am… generally healthy, I believe. I work as an etcher – it requires a steady hand, and I’ve not noticed any decline in that regard. Occasionally, my back aches from bending over the workbench, but that is… commonplace for my profession, and easily managed with rest. Nothing that would necessitate a visit to a physician, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Steady hand is important for your work, that’s reassuring. And back pain from bending, noted. Sounds like typical occupational discomfort. I see here you’re 5’10” and currently weigh 123 pounds. Is that roughly accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… correct. I have always been rather slender. It’s… a family trait, I suppose. Though, I do try to maintain a healthy diet. It’s difficult to find time for much exercise, with my work, but I walk when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you’re mindful of your health. Just making sure I have a complete picture. To help me understand what kind of advance care planning is best for you, could you tell me a little bit about your values and beliefs regarding medical treatment?
PATIENT: That is… a rather large question. I suppose… I value my independence, above all else. I would prefer to maintain control over my own decisions, for as long as possible. And I… I don't wish to be kept alive artificially, if there is no reasonable hope of recovery. Prolonging suffering seems… unkind, both to myself and to others. Though, the specifics… escape me. It’s a difficult topic to contemplate, truthfully. I haven’t given it much deliberate thought, beyond that basic principle.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Evann. Independence and avoiding prolonged suffering… those are important values to consider. It sounds like an Advance Directive would be a good starting point for you. It allows you to document your wishes regarding specific medical treatments, should you become unable to communicate them yourself. Do you have any particular treatments you’d want to specifically include or exclude?
PATIENT: That is… I honestly don’t. I’m not particularly knowledgeable about medical procedures. I suppose… I would want to be kept comfortable, regardless. Pain management is… essential. And I would trust my physician to make reasonable decisions, in consultation with… with anyone I designate. Perhaps… no aggressive resuscitation if there is no hope of a meaningful recovery. But beyond that… I’m afraid I can’t offer much specific guidance. It’s all rather overwhelming.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Evann. We can keep it broad. “Comfort care” and trusting your physician’s judgement are excellent starting points. And specifying no aggressive resuscitation when there’s no hope of recovery is a very common and reasonable request. So, we can document those wishes in an Advance Directive. It’s a legal document, so it requires a witness. We have the forms here at the clinic, or you can find them online. Do you have someone specific you’d like to designate as your healthcare proxy – someone who would make decisions on your behalf if you were unable to?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question. My husband… we are divorced. And I… I don't have any close family. I have a few… acquaintances, but I wouldn’t trust them with such a responsibility. I haven’t thought about designating anyone, truthfully. Is that… permissible? Can I complete the form without designating a proxy? I understand the importance, but I simply… don’t have anyone suitable. Perhaps… you could serve as my proxy, if necessary? I realize that is… an imposition.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Evann. You are not required to designate a healthcare proxy if you don't have someone you trust. The form will allow you to state that you do not wish to designate one, and that the hospital or your physician should follow your stated wishes as closely as possible. Regarding me serving as your proxy… while I appreciate the trust, it’s generally not recommended due to potential conflicts of interest. It’s best if the proxy is someone independent, who can advocate solely for your wishes. However, we can explore other options. Do you have a close friend, a lawyer, or even a trusted member of your community who might be willing to serve as a backup?
PATIENT: No… I’m afraid not. I keep to myself, mostly. My work… it requires solitude. I don’t have any close relationships, I’m afraid. In that case… perhaps it’s best to proceed without a designated proxy. I understand the risks, and I accept the responsibility for not having one. I would simply request that my wishes be respected, to the best of your ability. Is that… acceptable?
DOCTOR: Yes, Evann, that is acceptable. We will document that you do not wish to designate a healthcare proxy and that we should adhere to your stated wishes as closely as possible. It's important that we have a clear record of that. Here is the form. It’s fairly straightforward, but please read it carefully. There are sections for your preferences regarding life-sustaining treatment, pain management, and other important considerations. You'll need a witness – someone who is not a family member and is not directly involved in your healthcare. Do you have any questions about the form itself, or about the process?
PATIENT: No… not at present. It looks… rather lengthy. Perhaps… could you briefly explain the sections? Just a general overview? I apologize for my ignorance, but I’m not accustomed to dealing with such documents. And… is there a cost associated with completing this form?
DOCTOR: Certainly. No apology needed at all. It is a lot to take in. This first section is about your general preferences regarding life-sustaining treatment – things like mechanical ventilation, CPR, and artificial nutrition. You can indicate whether you would want these treatments in all circumstances, in limited circumstances, or not at all. This section is about pain management. It allows you to specify your preferences regarding pain relief, even if it might have some side effects. And this section is for any additional wishes or instructions you might have. You can also designate a surrogate decision-maker here, if you change your mind about not having a proxy. As for the cost, there is no cost associated with completing this form. It’s part of our standard preventative care services. We can even provide a witness here at the clinic, if you prefer. Would you like me to explain any of the sections in more detail?
PATIENT: That… is very kind of you. Yes, please. Perhaps… the section regarding life-sustaining treatment. I’m… uncertain about the terminology. What does “mechanical ventilation” entail, precisely? And what is the difference between “all circumstances” and “limited circumstances”? And… would completing this form have any legal ramifications for me or for my estate?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's break that down. “Mechanical ventilation” means using a machine to help you breathe. It’s often needed if your lungs are unable to function properly on their own, due to illness or injury. It involves inserting a tube into your airway and connecting it to a ventilator. “All circumstances” means you would want mechanical ventilation, regardless of your medical condition or prognosis. “Limited circumstances” means you would want it only if there is a reasonable chance of recovery, or if it would provide temporary support while you receive other treatments. If you check “none,” it means you would not want mechanical ventilation under any circumstances. Completing this form has legal weight, yes. It's a legally binding document that expresses your wishes regarding your medical care. It will be included in your medical record, and healthcare providers are legally obligated to follow your instructions, as long as they are reasonable and consistent with ethical guidelines. It will also be considered by your estate if there are any disputes about your care. However, it's important to remember that you can change your mind at any time. Do you find that explanation helpful?
PATIENT: Yes… that is much clearer. The distinction between “all circumstances” and “limited circumstances” is particularly helpful. I believe… I would prefer “limited circumstances.” I do not wish to be kept alive artificially if there is no reasonable hope of recovery. And… what constitutes a “reasonable hope of recovery”? Is that determined by… you? Or is there a specific criteria? And… is there a specific form for designating my… possessions? Or is that handled separately?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Evann. And it's one that often comes up. Determining a "reasonable hope of recovery" is a complex medical judgment. It's not simply a matter of a specific number or percentage. It takes into account your overall medical condition, your prognosis, your values, and your wishes. It's a conversation between you, your healthcare providers, and, if you have one, your designated healthcare proxy. We would consider factors like the severity of your illness, the likelihood of a meaningful recovery, and the potential for a good quality of life. We would also take your wishes into account. That's handled separately. A will or a trust is used to designate your possessions. I’m not qualified to give legal advice, but I can provide you with a referral to an estate planning attorney if you’re interested. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes… a referral to an estate planning attorney would be most helpful. And… is there anything else I should be aware of regarding this form? Any potential pitfalls or complications? I apologize for my numerous questions, but I wish to ensure everything is… in order. And… thank you. For your patience. Perhaps… I should take the form home and review it more carefully before completing it?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. And please, don’t apologize for the questions – it’s much better to be thorough and informed. One potential pitfall to be aware of is ensuring the form is properly witnessed and signed. It needs to be legally binding. Also, it’s a good idea to review the form periodically, especially if your wishes change or if your medical condition changes. Absolutely. That’s a very good idea. Take your time, review it carefully, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. We can go over it together when you’re ready. Here’s my card with the clinic’s contact information. And I’ll also get you a referral for an estate planning attorney. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I believe that is all. Thank you again, Doctor Morenomartinez. Your assistance has been… invaluable. I appreciate your patience and your… kindness. I shall review the form at my leisure. And I will reach out if I have any further questions. Good afternoon. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. I'm glad I could help. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good afternoon, and safe travels. .
