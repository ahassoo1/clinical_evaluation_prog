DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Bacy. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I requested a general wellness check, a lab panel, if you will. Just trying to keep an eye on things, you understand. At my age, one wants to be proactive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Mombrun. That’s very wise of you. A proactive approach is always best. So, a general wellness check and a lab panel. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I consider myself quite fortunate. I’ve always been a… robust man, I suppose you could say. I’ve worked in construction my entire life – heavy lifting, lots of time outdoors. Keeps a man strong, it does. I’ve had the usual bumps and bruises, naturally, but nothing serious. My wife, Elena, always says I’m too stubborn to admit when something is serious, mind you! But truthfully, I feel quite good for a man of seventy-four. No major complaints, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Mombrun. It sounds like you’ve led a very active life. “Patient reports generally good health, active lifestyle.” Now, have you had any recent changes in your health?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question, Doctor. Let me think… Now, physically, no. No new pains, no dizziness, nothing like that. My appetite is still very good, perhaps too good, Elena would say! But I have been noticing… well, my memory isn’t quite what it used to be. Small things, you understand. Forgetting where I put my glasses – which is ironic, isn’t it? – or a name on the tip of my tongue. Nothing alarming, but noticeable. It's been creeping up on me, I suppose, over the last… six months, maybe a year.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know, Mr. Mombrun. Memory changes can be concerning, and it’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. We'll definitely look into that. Now, besides the memory concerns, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I've noticed. No trouble sleeping, no changes in my weight, nothing like that. I still enjoy a good meal with Elena, and I walk with her every morning, weather permitting. I haven't felt any… shortness of breath, or anything of that nature. I suppose I’m just getting older, and a bit more forgetful, as one does. It’s not troubling, exactly. Just… present. Is there anything specific I should be looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. It’s helpful to know what you aren’t experiencing as well. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history, just to be thorough. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. I've been quite fortunate in that regard. My family history is… fairly unremarkable, if you will. My parents lived long lives, though my father did have some trouble with his joints in his later years. But nothing major. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything chronic, and I’ve never had to take any regular medications… until recently. The doctor prescribed me something for my cholesterol, about six months ago. It was slightly elevated during a routine check-up with my primary care physician. But that's the extent of it, really. Oh, and I did have my appendix removed when I was a young man, but that was many years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information. So, no chronic conditions, appendix removed in your youth, and a recent prescription for cholesterol medication. Do you remember the name of the cholesterol medication?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. It’s… let me see… Atorvastatin. Yes, that’s it. Atorvastatin. It’s a small dose, just twenty milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it regularly, as prescribed. No noticeable side effects, thankfully. Elena keeps track of my pills, you see. She's very organized. I sometimes forget if I’ve taken it or not, but she always reminds me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you're tolerating the medication well and that Elena is helping you stay on track. Okay, so Atorvastatin 20mg daily. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I can eat anything, and I haven’t ever had trouble with any medications. Elena is always very careful when she prepares food, and she checks everything before I take it. She's a wonderful woman. Always looking out for me. I suppose if I were to have an allergy, she would know about it!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, and it’s good to have someone so attentive looking out for you. Alright, Mr. Mombrun. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. Never have, never will. I’ve never been interested in any of those things. My father always said a clear head and strong hands were all a man needed. I’ve always been a fairly disciplined man. I enjoy a good cup of coffee in the morning, and occasionally a glass of water with dinner, but that’s the extent of it. I spend most of my time with Elena, gardening, and walking. A simple life, but a good one. A very good one.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Mombrun. A healthy lifestyle is certainly beneficial. Okay, so no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, is there anything specific you’re concerned about that we haven’t discussed yet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything quite thoroughly. I mainly just wanted to get a general check-up and see if everything was still in working order, so to speak. And perhaps get some advice about my memory, if you think it’s warranted. I'm not overly concerned, but it's better to be safe than sorry, isn't it? I trust your judgment, Doctor. Proceed as you see fit.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Mombrun. That’s a very sensible approach. Let’s start with a physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then we’ll do a quick neurological assessment, checking your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Proceed as you need to. I'm ready when you are. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Mombrun, your heart rhythm is regular, and I’m hearing good breath sounds bilaterally, though there’s a slight decrease in intensity at the bases. Not concerning at this time, but we'll keep an eye on it. Blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated but within an acceptable range for your age. Ears and nose appear clear. No signs of infection or inflammation. Throat is clear as well. Now, let's move on to a quick neurological assessment. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I'll test your reflexes. Can you follow my finger?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can. Just point it, and I’ll follow along. It’s no trouble at all. My vision isn't what it used to be, but I can still see well enough.
DOCTOR: Good, your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. Please relax your arms at your sides. Okay, your reflexes are slightly diminished, which is common at your age, but they are symmetrical. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps for me, and then perform a quick balance test. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, certainly. Just tell me when to stop. I'm a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I can manage.
DOCTOR: Okay, your gait is slightly slower than average, and your balance is a little unsteady, but nothing overly concerning at this time. Now, let’s finish with a quick cognitive assessment. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to check your memory and orientation. Can you tell me what today’s date is?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. Let me think… It’s August… the second. Yes, August 2nd. And the year… is it 2025? Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I believe that’s correct. It’s a bit hazy sometimes, but I’m fairly certain.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s correct. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where we are… We're in a doctor's office, aren't we? A clinic, I believe you called it. A suburban clinic… and I believe the name of the clinic is… oh dear. It’s escaping me at the moment. But yes, a suburban clinic. Is that sufficient, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Mombrun. That’s sufficient. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words back to me. I’ll say them slowly, and then you repeat them. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Is that correct, Doctor? I hope I remembered them properly. My short-term memory isn’t always reliable, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more questions about your daily life, to get a better understanding of your overall cognitive function. Do you have any difficulty with tasks like managing your finances, preparing meals, or remembering appointments?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not difficulty, exactly. Elena handles most of the finances, she's very good with numbers. And she helps me keep track of appointments, too. But I can still prepare meals, and I remember most things… eventually. It just takes me a little longer, and I sometimes need a reminder. Nothing that interferes with my daily life, mind you. But I do notice a difference from how things used to be. It's subtle, but it's there.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Mombrun. That’s good to know. Based on the physical exam and cognitive assessment, your neurological function is generally intact, but there are some mild cognitive changes that warrant further investigation. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, which is common for your age, and your gait is a bit slower, but nothing overly concerning. The mild cognitive changes, such as difficulty with recall and needing assistance with appointments, are what we need to look into further. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these changes, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or anemia. I also recommend a cognitive screening test to get a more detailed assessment of your memory and thinking skills. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment completely. If there's something going on, I'd rather know about it sooner rather than later. Blood work and a cognitive screening test… yes, please. Let's get to the bottom of this. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Mombrun. I’m glad you’re agreeable to those tests. I’ll order the blood work now, and the nurse will draw the samples before you leave. We can schedule the cognitive screening test for next week. It will take about an hour, and it will be administered by our cognitive specialist. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to engage in mentally stimulating activities, such as reading, puzzles, or social interaction. Staying active and engaged can help maintain cognitive function. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. You’ve put my mind at ease, and I appreciate your thoroughness. Engaging in mentally stimulating activities… yes, I will certainly continue to do that. Elena and I enjoy gardening, and we read the newspaper every morning. I think we’re in good hands, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and attention. When will the results of the blood work be available?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. The blood work results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. We’ll contact you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a plan of action. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your cognitive function, such as confusion, memory loss, or difficulty speaking, please contact us immediately. Do you have any other concerns before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. You've been exceptionally helpful and addressed all my worries. I feel much better knowing we’re taking these steps. I’ll be sure to contact you if anything changes. Thank you again for everything. And please, thank the nurse for drawing the blood. It's never a pleasant experience, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. I’m glad I could help. I will certainly thank the nurse for her assistance. It's never a pleasant experience, indeed. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day, Mr. Mombrun. And please, don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw the blood.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well. I appreciate your kindness and attention.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. .
