DOCTOR: Good morning, Lytisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s about a test, I think? Something to do with… checking things. My… someone told me I needed to get this done. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Medicare sent something in the mail, I believe.
DOCTOR: Right, that sounds about right. Medicare often sends reminders for preventative screenings. It is easy to lose track of those things. "Checking things"... okay. Do you recall what kind of checking it was for?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now you’re asking me something… Was it… for work? I drive a big roller, you see. A really big one. Paving, mostly. But… I don't remember anything specific about why they want to check things. Maybe it has to do with keeping me safe on the job? I honestly can’t say. I just know I have to get it done. It’s a drug test, I think someone said?
DOCTOR: A drug test... that's possible, especially with your line of work. Though, Medicare wouldn't typically directly schedule that. It might be something your employer requires, and Medicare is just aware of it through your insurance. Let's try to narrow things down a bit. Do you remember if it was a blood test, a urine test, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I think it was… a little cup? Yes, a little cup. I remember thinking it wasn't too bad, all things considered. Not like a needle, that’s for sure. So… urine, I guess? Is that what you mean? I really don't like needles, so I'd remember that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a urine test. That’s helpful. And you’re right, much less invasive than a needle! It sounds like this might be a routine drug screening as part of your employment requirements. Let me quickly check your electronic health record to see if there's anything documented about a recent request for a drug screen, or perhaps a referral for lab work. Just one moment… Ah, here we are. It looks like there was a request from your employer, "Pave-It Co.", for a ten-panel urine drug screen about a month ago. It's dated July 2nd, 2025. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Pave-It Co… July 2nd… Yes… yes, that rings a bell. July… that was a hot month, wasn't it? And yes, that’s the company I work for. Ten-panel… what does that even mean? But, yes, that sounds right. They probably just need me to get it done. I just wish they’d send someone to remind me! My memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's very common for things to slip our minds, especially with a busy schedule. "Ten-panel" just means they’re testing for ten different types of substances. It’s standard procedure. Now, have you already had the urine test done?
PATIENT: Oh, I see! Ten things… alright. And… No, I don't think so. I don't remember giving a sample, anyway. I’ve been meaning to go, but things have been hectic with the road work. I thought maybe this was the appointment to do it. That’s why I came! I haven’t actually done it yet. Should I go do it now? Is there somewhere here I can… you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can absolutely get that done for you today. We have a lab right here in the clinic. It’s a very simple process. I'll just need to give you a collection cup and instructions, and then you'll have a private room to provide the sample. I'll also give you a form for the lab technician. Before we do that, though, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know. A room… that’s good. Let me think… medications… Well, I take something for my arthritis. It’s a little white pill. Can’t remember the name right now. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for the pain, when the pill doesn’t help enough. That’s over-the-counter, I guess. Otherwise, not much. Just a little vitamin D in the winter, but I think I ran out of that a while ago. My memory is just awful, I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Lytisha. It's perfectly normal to forget things. We'll figure it out. Okay, so you’re taking something for arthritis and ibuprofen as needed. Do you know the name of the medication for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Ummm… it started with a… an 'N'? No, maybe a 'C'? Oh dear… It was a little blue pill… No, white! I'm so confused. I really wish I could remember. It's something the doctor at the old clinic gave me. Before… before my husband passed. It's all a bit… foggy. It’s definitely something for joint pain, though. I’m sorry, I’m just drawing a blank.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Lytisha. Don't worry about it. It's understandable that it's difficult to remember, especially with everything you've been through. We can try a couple of things. I can look up your past medications in your electronic health record. Alternatively, if you happen to have a list of your medications at home, that would be helpful. For now, though, let's just proceed with the urine drug screen. It's unlikely to cause any issues, but it's always good to be aware of any medications you're taking. I’ll write down “Possible arthritis medication - patient unable to recall name” in your chart. Before we head to the lab, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds like a good idea, looking it up. Thank you. Allergies… hmm. Let me think… No, I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. No food allergies, no bee stings, nothing. I used to help my mother with her garden, and I never had any trouble with the plants. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Unless… sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when it’s really cold, but I don’t think that’s an allergy. Just dry skin, probably. No, I’m pretty sure I don’t have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Alright, Lytisha, let’s go ahead and get you to the lab. It's just down the hall, second door on the left. The lab technician, Sarah, is expecting you. She'll give you the collection cup and instructions. Just let her know you're here for the ten-panel urine drug screen ordered by Pave-It Co. Do you have any questions before we head over?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Well, that sounds… straightforward enough. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just… is it a long process? I have to get back to work this afternoon. And… Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not a long process at all. The actual sample collection will only take a few minutes. There might be a slight wait while they process the sample, but I doubt it will be more than 15-20 minutes. And no, it won't hurt at all. It's a simple, non-invasive process. You'll just need to provide a urine sample in a private room. Sarah will give you clear instructions. She's very kind and helpful. Don't worry, Lytisha. We'll get you in and out quickly. Would you like me to walk you over there, or are you comfortable going on your own?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a relief to hear. Fifteen minutes… that’s not bad at all. And no hurt… good. Yes, that’s good. If you wouldn’t mind walking me over, that would be lovely. Just to… make sure I find the right place. I get a little turned around sometimes. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, absolutely. Let's go. It's this way. There, that's the lab. Sarah is usually right inside. Just let her know you're here for the drug screen, and she'll take care of you. I'll be nearby if you need anything at all. Don't hesitate to ask. Good luck, Lytisha. You'll do great. Now, go ahead and head inside.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. Alright, here goes nothing. .
