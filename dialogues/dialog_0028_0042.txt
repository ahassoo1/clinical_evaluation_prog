DOCTOR: Right. Londell Kammann, 69 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Dr. Memmolo, it’s good to meet you. I put “Men’s Health Optimization” on the form, but really, I just want to make sure everything’s still… working right, you know? Getting older ain’t for sissies. I figure it’s good to check things now before somethin’ doesn’t work right, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Optimization,” right. Vague, as usual. Well, preventative care is… acceptable, I suppose. Let’s start with the basics. Any specific concerns?
PATIENT: Specific concerns… hmm. Not really worried about anything, but my energy’s been a little low lately. Not sick tired, just… tired. And, well, things ain’t as… responsive as they used to be, if you catch my drift. Mostly just want to feel like myself again, you know? I still like to get out and do things – fishin’, workin’ on my etchings – but it takes a bit more effort now.
DOCTOR: Etchings. Interesting. Energy levels and… “responsiveness.” Alright. Let’s not delve into specifics just yet. First, let’s go over your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. Had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well controlled with a little pill for years now. And arthritis in my hands, which is why I don’t do as much detailed work as I used to. Other than that, I’m pretty lucky. My wife, bless her soul, she had some trouble with her heart before she passed, but I haven't had any major problems myself. I see Dr. Evans for check-ups every six months or so, and he always says I'm doin' alright for my age.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, arthritis. Noted. And you said you see Dr. Evans regularly?
PATIENT: Yep, Dr. Evans over in Stilwell. Good man. Been seein' him since… oh, must be fifteen years now. He's a family doctor, does everything. He runs the blood tests and all that. I'm pretty sure he's got my file pretty well memorized at this point. He’s the one who suggested maybe talkin’ to someone about… well, this. Said sometimes things change, and a different perspective can be helpful.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Dr. Evans… let's see. Sighs. Alright, so regular check-ups, stable blood pressure. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… just my appendix when I was a kid. Real old-fashioned operation, way back in '58, I think it was. Nothing since then. No broken bones, no nothin'. I was always pretty careful, you know? Didn't take a lot of risks. My wife, now she was the adventurous one. Always draggin' me along on some wild goose chase or another.
DOCTOR: Appendix, 1958. Fine. Family history then. Any significant medical issues in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother's side, there was a lot of heart trouble. Her father died young, from a heart attack, and she had a bad ticker herself. That's why I'm careful about salt and all that. My father's side… mostly just folks livin' to a good old age. A little bit of diabetes here and there, but nothin’ major. My wife’s family, I don’t know as much about, honestly. Didn’t get to know them too well. They lived up north somewhere.
DOCTOR: Heart disease in the maternal lineage, diabetes. Noted. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I can take pretty much anything without a problem. My wife used to tease me about it, said I had an iron stomach. She was allergic to penicillin, though. Had a bad reaction to it when she was a little girl. I always had to make sure the doctors knew that. Makes me double-check everything now, even for myself. Old habits, I guess.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. And you're currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just the one. Lisinopril. For the blood pressure. Ten milligrams a day, been on it for years. Dr. Evans keeps adjustin' the dose as needed. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my hands when the arthritis is acting up, but that’s only as needed, you know? Not every day. It doesn't always help much, but it takes the edge off sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril ten milligrams daily, ibuprofen PRN. Let’s move on to… a physical exam. I suppose we should at least confirm you are, in fact, still functioning. If you'll just step over here.
PATIENT: Well, I appreciate the tact, Doctor. Still functioning, you say? I reckon I am, mostly. Though sometimes I feel like an old tractor that needs a good tune-up. Lead the way. Just let me know if you need me to do any fancy maneuvers. My knees ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Just lie back. I’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Standard procedure. 140 over 85… elevated, but not alarming given your history. Pulse is regular at 78. Heart sounds… normal S1 and S2. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Reflexes, huh? I always did have pretty good reflexes. Used to be a pretty good fisherman, you know? Gotta be quick to set the hook. Not as quick as I used to be, mind you. Age catches up with everyone eventually. Ooh, that tickles a bit. Still jumpin' though, I guess.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes… also 2+. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No obvious focal neurological deficits. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Alright. Everything appears… within normal limits. For a man your age. Now, let’s discuss some potential… options.
PATIENT: Well, that's good to hear. “Within normal limits” is a good start. Options, you say? I’m listenin’. I ain’t lookin’ for no miracle cure, just want to feel a little more like myself again, if that makes sense. Maybe a little more energy, a little less… sluggishness. What kind of options are we talkin’ about? Pills? Shots? I’m not real keen on a lot of fancy stuff, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: We can run some blood tests. Check your testosterone levels, vitamin D, thyroid function… the usual suspects. It’s possible low testosterone is contributing to your fatigue. There are… treatments available, if that is the case. We could also discuss lifestyle modifications – diet, exercise. But frankly, at your age, it’s likely just… the natural progression of things. I’ll order the blood tests. You can come back in a week to discuss the results. Here’s the requisition form. The lab is down the hall, third door on the left. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Low testosterone, huh? Well, I figured as much, to be honest. It's just… hard to hear it out loud, I guess. Lifestyle modifications… I try. I really do. I walk when I can, try to eat healthy, but it's hard when you're on your own. I guess… no, that's all for now. Just the blood tests. Thank you, Doctor. I'll go get those done. .
