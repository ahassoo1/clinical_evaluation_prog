DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Selbitschka, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Reneisha Selbitschka. Though, please, call me Reneisha if you prefer. I appreciate your time, Doctor Sink. I’m hoping we can get to the bottom of this quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “quickly” depends on what “this” is. Let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s the weight, Doctor. I’ve… gained quite a bit, and rather suddenly. It's very unusual for me. I haven’t changed my eating habits, and I’m certainly not less active. It's just… appeared. I was hoping you could perhaps tell me what might be causing it.
DOCTOR: Suddenly… how long is “suddenly”?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It began, I would say, around the first of June. Perhaps a little before, but definitely noticeable by then. About two months now. I noticed my clothes feeling tighter, and then the scale confirmed it, unfortunately. It’s… disconcerting, to say the least.
DOCTOR: And how much weight, approximately, are we talking about?
PATIENT: Approximately… fifteen pounds, I believe. Perhaps a little more. I weigh myself every Tuesday, and it’s been a steady increase. Fifteen pounds in two months feels… substantial, especially given my routine hasn’t changed. I'm usually quite stable, you see.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds… Alright. And your height and weight as of today?
PATIENT: Certainly. I am one hundred and fifty-five centimeters tall. And… today, the scale read eighty-three kilograms. I confess, I didn’t want to look, but I knew I had to be precise for you. It's… rather disheartening.
DOCTOR: Eighty-three kilograms… That puts your BMI at… well, never mind. Let’s not focus on numbers. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me see. No, not really. My energy levels are… perhaps a little lower than usual, but I attributed that to the summer heat. No changes in appetite, no swelling, no unusual aches or pains. I sleep normally, and my… bathroom habits are regular, if you don’t mind my being so direct. Truly, just the weight gain and a slight fatigue. It’s very perplexing.
DOCTOR: Fatigue is… common. And it could be anything. Any family history of… weight issues, thyroid problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, family history. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had diabetes, though it was quite late in life. And my father… he was always a larger man, though I don’t believe it was ever diagnosed as anything specific. As for thyroid… I don’t recall anyone specifically. My family isn’t particularly forthcoming about medical details, if you understand. It was… a different time, and they didn’t discuss these things openly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. I pride myself on my good health, and I haven’t needed any medication for… well, for as long as I can remember. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s all. I prefer to rely on a good diet and regular exercise. Which, as I said, hasn’t changed. It’s quite frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Frustrating for you, yes. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. It's unlikely to reveal anything, but it's procedure. Please step onto the scale, and then we'll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. It will be brief.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I’m quite prepared.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not concerning at this moment. Heart and lungs sound clear. No swelling in the extremities. Thyroid feels… normal, though a more thorough examination would require lab work. Everything seems… unremarkable. Which is, frankly, the problem. I suspect this is likely a matter of… fluid retention or dietary changes you haven’t fully accounted for. But to be thorough, I’ll order some basic blood tests: a complete metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a lipid panel.
PATIENT: That… is disheartening to hear, Doctor. I assure you, my diet has not changed. I am meticulous about what I consume. But I understand your need to be thorough. Blood tests… very well. When might I expect the results? And is there anything specific I should do in the meantime? Perhaps adjust my diet further, despite my conviction there haven't been any changes?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes 3-5 business days. In the meantime… I suppose you could try a low-sodium diet for a week, and increase your water intake. But frankly, I don’t anticipate it making a significant difference. I’m ordering the tests simply to rule out any underlying medical causes. Don't drastically change anything until we have the results. It complicates matters. I’ll have the lab requisition ready for you. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. I appreciate you listening to me, and for ordering the tests, despite your… reservations. I understand your skepticism, and I assure you, I will follow your instructions precisely. A low-sodium diet and increased water intake. Very well. I shall await the results. Thank you, Doctor Sink. Perhaps we can discuss this further when they are available.
DOCTOR: Yes. We'll see. Call my office to schedule a follow-up once the results are in. That will be all.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a pleasant day. .
