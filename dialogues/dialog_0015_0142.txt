DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doc. It's… headaches, mostly. Real bad ones. And, well, my heart feels like it's gonna jump outta my chest sometimes when they hit. It’s been happening on and off for a while now, I guess. I don't really keep track of things well, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “On and off for a while now.” Right. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. That's tough. Maybe… a couple months? Or longer? It's hard to say. They don't come every day, but when they do, they knock me flat. I usually just try to sleep it off, if I can. I don’t remember anything special happening before they start, if that makes sense. Just… boom. Headache, sweaty, heart racing. Then it eventually goes away.
DOCTOR: So, no specific triggers that you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Triggers? Not that I know of. I work at the… well, it's a factory. Pretty standard stuff, you know? Lifting boxes, checking things… nothing too stressful, I don’t think. I eat… when I can. Usually just whatever's quick and easy. I haven’t changed anything about my life recently, not that I remember, anyway. Does that help? I’m sorry I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: It's...adequate. And it is my job to extract the information, so don't apologize. Let's move on to other symptoms. Aside from the headaches and the racing heart, have you been experiencing any nausea, vomiting, vision changes, or sensitivity to light or sound with these headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, yeah. Sometimes I feel kinda sick to my stomach when the headache’s really bad. Not like, throwing-up sick, just… queasy. And, now that you mention it, things do look kinda bright sometimes when I have one. I usually just close my eyes, so I figured it was just that. I don't think I've noticed anything with sounds, though. No, definitely not sounds. It's just… a really bad headache.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any fever, neck stiffness, weakness, or numbness with these headaches?
PATIENT: Fever… I don't think so. I haven’t checked, really. No neck stiffness that I noticed. And no, no weakness or… numbness. Everything feels normal, except for the headache and the heart thing. Honestly, it’s hard to tell what’s normal anymore. It’s been happening for… well, you know. I just thought it was stress, or something.
DOCTOR: “Stress.” Let’s review your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Past medical… uh… Not that I remember. I mean, I've had the usual colds and stuff, but nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but that healed fine. I don’t really go to the doctor much. I got divorced a couple years ago, if that counts as a medical condition. But no, nothing… nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, not that I recall. Like I said, I don’t really go to the doctor. I try to avoid it if I can. I had a wisdom tooth pulled a long time ago, but that doesn't really count, does it? It was just… a tooth. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Let's discuss your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of migraines, heart problems, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My dad… he always complained about headaches. Real bad ones, like me. But he just… took some pills, I think. I don’t really know much about it. My mom… she was pretty healthy, as far as I know. No heart problems that I remember. And… I don’t really talk to my family much anymore, so I wouldn’t know about anything else. Honestly, I'm not very close to them. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Adequate, again. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I mean, I’ve eaten pretty much everything. And I’ve taken some over-the-counter pain relievers for the headaches, but I don't think I've had any reactions. I'm not really the type to have allergies, if that makes sense. I just… don't react to things much, usually. I'm pretty resilient, I guess. Does that… count as an answer?
DOCTOR: Resilient is… not a medical term, Mr. Lawther. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Like I said before, I take some pain relievers when the headaches get really bad. Just… ibuprofen, I think? Or maybe acetaminophen. Whatever's on the shelf at the store. Nothing regularly, though. Definitely not anything prescribed by a doctor. And no supplements. I don't really bother with that stuff. Sorry I'm not much help with all this. I just... don't really keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to perform a physical examination. Please lie down on the table. I will need to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a neurological assessment. It will be a standard exam, Mr. Lawther, but it is necessary to gather more information.
PATIENT: Okay. Alright, if you think it’s necessary. Just… let me know if anything feels weird, okay? I don't really like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated, Mr. Lawther. 148 over 92. Your heart rate is also a bit fast, 98 beats per minute. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. I'm going to assess your cranial nerves now. Strength is normal in all extremities. Now, I’m going to check your pupils. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Do you feel any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: No pain. Just… bright. Everything looks kinda blurry when the light's in my eyes, but that's probably normal, right? I don’t usually wear glasses, if that makes a difference. Everything’s always a little fuzzy. I’m starting to feel a little… anxious, Doc. Being poked and prodded is making my heart race even more. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Your heart is racing, Mr. Lawther. It’s currently 110 beats per minute. And I noticed some nystagmus – involuntary eye movements – when you look to the side. That, coupled with your elevated blood pressure and the reports of headaches and nausea, is concerning. It is possible this is simply a severe tension headache, but given your symptoms and these findings, we need to rule out other potential causes. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your head, without contrast. The CT scan is to rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: A CT scan…? What does that mean? Is it… serious? I don't like the sound of that. And what’s a metabolic panel? Look, I told you I just get headaches. Maybe I just need some stronger pain pills or something. Is it really necessary to do all this…? I don’t do well with hospitals and tests and stuff. It makes me really nervous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, your symptoms and the findings from my examination warrant further investigation. A CT scan is a non-invasive imaging test that will allow us to visualize your brain and rule out serious conditions such as a tumor, aneurysm, or bleeding. A metabolic panel is a blood test that will assess your kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. It is important to understand that dismissing your symptoms without proper evaluation could have serious consequences. I understand that you are anxious, but I assure you, this is the best course of action. I will explain the procedures to you in detail and answer any questions you may have. The lab technician will draw blood, and a radiologist will perform the CT scan. The results will be available within a few hours, and I will discuss them with you then. We need to rule out any life-threatening causes for your headaches before considering other options. Would you like me to call someone to be with you during this process?
PATIENT: … I don’t have anyone to call. My ex-wife… well, that wouldn’t go well. And my family… like I said, we don’t talk. Fine. Do the tests. But… can you explain everything again? Slowly? And… what if you find something bad? What if it is something serious?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s go through this again. The blood tests will simply require a small sample of blood to be drawn from your arm. It will take just a few minutes. The CT scan is a bit more involved, but it is not painful. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. The machine will take a series of X-ray images of your brain. You will need to lie still for a few minutes during the scan. As for what if we find something serious… that is why we are doing this, Mr. Lawther. If we find something concerning, we will discuss all of your options, which may include further testing, medication, or referral to a specialist. We will face it together, step by step. It is important to remember that early detection is crucial, and we are doing everything we can to get you the answers you need. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye…? I don’t… I don’t think so. I’ve never had a scan before, so I wouldn’t know. I’m not allergic to anything that I know of. I get a few mosquito bites in the summer, but that’s about it. Is the dye something I should be worried about? What does it do? And… how long will the scan take? I really don’t like being closed in. I get kinda… claustrophobic.
DOCTOR: The contrast dye is a liquid that helps to enhance the images of your brain during the CT scan, making it easier to identify any abnormalities. It is administered intravenously, through a small needle in your arm. The most common side effects are a warm sensation and a metallic taste in your mouth, but serious allergic reactions are rare. The scan itself will take approximately 15-20 minutes. You will be able to communicate with the technician throughout the procedure. If you feel anxious or claustrophobic, you can let them know immediately, and they can take steps to make you more comfortable. We will monitor you closely throughout the procedure to ensure your safety. Before we proceed, I need to inform you about the potential risks of the CT scan. There is a small amount of radiation exposure involved. However, the benefits of obtaining a diagnosis far outweigh the risks in your case. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Radiation… okay. I guess so. If it helps figure out what’s wrong, then… yeah. I understand. It’s just… a lot. So… blood test first, then the scan? And you’ll be with me? Or at least someone will be? I really don't want to be alone for this. This is all kinda scary, Doc.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Lawther. Blood test first, then the CT scan. And you will not be alone. I have already spoken with the nursing staff, and they will be with you every step of the way. A nurse will draw your blood, and a radiologic technologist will perform the scan. I will be available to answer any questions you may have before, during, and after the procedures. We will take things one step at a time. It is normal to feel anxious, but please remember that we are here to support you. Let’s get the blood test done first. The nurse is waiting for you just outside the door. Do you want me to accompany you to the lab?
PATIENT: Yeah… yeah, that would be good. Thanks, Doc. Just… knowing someone’s with me makes a big difference. Okay. Let’s get this over with.
