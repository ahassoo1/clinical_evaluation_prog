DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Lason is the name. It's… alright to meet you, I suppose. What brings me in? Well, it’s these… spells, I call them. Confusion, mostly. Happens now and then. Not good for a man who sets tile, let me tell you. Precision work, that is. Can’t be having moments where you forget which piece goes where.
DOCTOR: I see. “Spells” of confusion, you say. And it’s impacting your work as a tile setter, requiring precision. That’s certainly concerning. Could you tell me a little more about these episodes?
PATIENT: Concerning to you, maybe. I’ve been setting tile for forty years, Doctor. I think I can handle a little… distraction. But alright, fine. It’s hard to explain. Things just… aren’t right. Like I’ll be in the middle of a bathroom, laying the pattern, and suddenly… I’ll look around and not remember why I'm there. Or what I was doing five seconds ago. It doesn’t last long, a minute or two, maybe. But it’s unsettling. And my wife, she worries. Says I ask the same questions twice. Though she forgets things too, if you want to know the truth.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite disruptive, even if brief, and I appreciate you sharing that your wife has noticed changes as well. It's good you have someone observing with you. You mentioned it doesn’t last long, a minute or two – is that a recent change, or has it always been that duration?
PATIENT: Always been that way, mostly. A minute, maybe two. Though, thinking about it… it feels like it’s happening more often lately. Used to be months between… incidents. Now it’s… well, a couple times a week, maybe. It’s hard to keep track, to be honest. I don’t go around with a timer, Doctor. And before you ask, no, I haven’t hit my head. I’m careful. A tile setter can’t afford to be clumsy.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, that the frequency seems to be increasing. And good to hear you haven’t experienced any head trauma. We’ll certainly want to explore the cause of these episodes. To get a better understanding, could you describe what it feels like when one of these spells starts?
PATIENT: Feels… fuzzy. Like looking through dirty glass, maybe? Everything seems… distant. And slow. Like I'm underwater. And the thoughts… they don’t connect right. Like trying to remember a name, but it’s just on the tip of my tongue and won’t come out. It’s frustrating, mostly. Makes me feel… foolish. And I get a little worried, I suppose. Not that I’d admit it to everyone.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Fuzzy" and "distant," like being underwater, with difficulty connecting thoughts – that's a very helpful description, Mr. Lason. It sounds unsettling, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel worried. Now, let's talk about other things that might be going on. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside these episodes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. Well, I’ve been a little more tired lately, I suppose. But I’m sixty-six, Doctor. What do you expect? I work hard. And my appetite hasn’t been what it used to be. Not that I’m complaining, mind you. My wife makes excellent food, but sometimes… I just don't feel hungry. And I've been… a little clumsy, now that you mention it. Dropping tools, bumping into things. But I chalked that up to getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue, decreased appetite, and some increased clumsiness. Thank you for sharing that. These are all things we should investigate further. Now, thinking about your past health, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Let's see. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a little pill for it, every morning. And I had my prostate acting up a while back, but they took care of that. Otherwise… no. I’ve always been a healthy man. Strong. Worked with my hands my whole life. Not one for sitting around and complaining, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: I do catch your drift, Mr. Lason. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a history of prostate issues. That's good to know. And do you happen to know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that’s a good question. My wife handles most of that. She keeps track of the pills. Let me think… it's a white one, I think. Small. And… it starts with an ‘A’… or maybe a ‘V’… I’m really not good with names. She’ll know. Definitely ask her. I just take what she gives me. It works, doesn’t it? Keeps the pressure down. That's all that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Lason. We can certainly ask your wife. It’s very helpful that it’s keeping your blood pressure stable. Now, to get a broader picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. My wife makes a wonderful fish amok, very spicy. Never bothered me. And I’ve never had a reaction to any pills. I’ve taken all sorts over the years. Scrapes, cuts… you name it. No allergies. I’m a tough Cambodian man, Doctor. We don't have time for allergies.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Lason. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a complicated question. My parents… they both passed away a long time ago. They weren’t ones for going to the doctor much. They believed in home remedies, mostly. Lots of herbs and… well, I’m not sure what else. My brother, he has… something with his heart, I think. But he lives in Phnom Penh, we don't talk much. And my sister… she’s always been healthy, as far as I know. Nothing major, if that answers your question. A lot of hard work in my family, Doctor. Not a lot of doctor visits.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Lason. A history of heart issues in your brother is worth noting. Now, to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work. Hard. Six days a week, usually. Setting tile. It’s physical work, keeps me moving. I don't sit around much. I used to enjoy fishing, but I haven’t had much time for that lately. I eat pretty well, my wife makes sure of that. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a beer with dinner once in a while. And I don’t smoke. Never have. A simple life, Doctor. A lot of work, good food, and trying to keep busy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason, that gives me a good understanding of your daily life. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. But don’t expect miracles. I’m a working man, not a porcelain doll. Just get it over with, if you must. I’ve got tiles to lay tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. Your pulse is 78 and regular. That's a little elevated, but not unexpected given your activity level and the fact that we're talking. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. I’ll also do a quick neurological assessment. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Follow your finger? Yes, I can see perfectly fine, Doctor. I set tile, remember? Precision work. Requires good eyesight. Though, my wife says I need to get new glasses. She’s probably right. But go ahead. Test my reflexes, if you must. Just don't poke me too hard. I bruise easily, you know. Old age.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Your strength is good in all extremities. Now, I’m going to check your gait and balance. Would you mind standing up and walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Walking? Fine. But don't expect any fancy steps. I'm a tile setter, not a dancer. There. Happy now? A little wobbly, maybe. But I’ve been on my feet all day. It's not a sign of anything serious, I assure you. Just tired legs.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. I did notice a slight unsteadiness in your gait. It could be due to fatigue, as you mentioned, but we’ll want to investigate further. Based on what you've told me and the brief physical exam, I'm concerned about a possible neurological issue contributing to your confusion and increasing clumsiness. It’s important to rule out other potential causes, but we need more information. I'd like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any infections. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to get a better look at things. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: MRI? Now hold on a minute. An MRI? That sounds… serious. And expensive. What exactly are you looking for? I told you, I'm just a tired old man. Maybe I need a vacation. Not a fancy brain scan. And what about the blood work? What are you hoping to find in my blood? I don’t like the sound of this, Doctor. Seems like you’re looking for problems where there aren't any.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. It does sound serious, and I apologize for causing you anxiety. An MRI is the best way to get a clear picture of your brain and rule out any structural issues that could be causing your symptoms. It’s a non-invasive procedure, though it can be a little noisy. The blood work will help us rule out vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or any infections that could be contributing to your confusion. It’s a standard set of tests and will give us a baseline to work with. I’m not looking for problems, Mr. Lason, I'm trying to rule out potential causes for your symptoms. Your episodes of confusion and increasing clumsiness are concerning, and it’s important to get a clear diagnosis so we can provide you with the best possible care. I can explain the costs associated with these tests, and we can discuss whether your insurance will cover them. We can also talk about alternatives, though I believe these tests are the most thorough way to investigate your symptoms. Do you have any questions about the MRI or the blood work?
PATIENT: Insurance… that’s a good point. I have Medicare, but I’m not sure what they cover these days. Everything is so complicated. And expensive, as you said. You said it's noisy? I have sensitive ears. And what if you find something? I don't want to know if I have some terrible disease. I just want to get back to setting tile. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you trying to help. But I’m not sure I want to go through all this. Maybe I’ll just try to get more rest. And listen to my wife more. She’s always telling me to slow down. Is there anything else I need to do? Blood work, maybe? But I don't want any fancy scans if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Lason. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about the costs, potential findings, and the inconvenience of these tests. Let’s take a step back. We can start with the blood work. It’s a less invasive and less expensive option, and it will give us some valuable information. We can review the results together, and then decide whether further investigation with an MRI is necessary. I will have my staff check your Medicare coverage for the blood work and let you know what your out-of-pocket costs will be. I want to emphasize that I'm not trying to scare you, Mr. Lason. I'm simply being thorough and making sure we rule out any potential causes for your symptoms. It’s better to be safe and know what’s going on, so we can make informed decisions about your care. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood work for now?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Blood work. Just blood work. But no promises about any fancy scans after that. And tell your staff to be quick about it. I’ve got tiles to lay, you know. And make sure my wife doesn't find out I’m getting poked and prodded. She worries enough as it is. So, where do I go? And when? Just tell me what I need to do. And no surprises, Doctor. No surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. No surprises, I promise. Here's the lab order. You can go to any Quest Diagnostics lab location. They have several locations in the area. The order includes a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin B12 level. You don’t need an appointment, but it's always a good idea to call ahead to confirm their hours. I'll have my staff schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week to review the results. They will also contact your insurance to verify coverage. I will also make a note to ensure your wife is not contacted without your prior consent. Do you have any questions about the lab order or the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just… try not to scare me with the results, Doctor. I’m an old man, not a young whippersnapper. And tell your staff to be gentle. Alright, I’ll be going now. Thank you… I suppose.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I will do my best to explain the results clearly and thoroughly, and we’ll take things one step at a time. And I'll make sure my staff is aware of your preferences. Thank you for coming in today. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Lason. And please, get some rest.
