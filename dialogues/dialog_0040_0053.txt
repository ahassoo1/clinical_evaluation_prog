DOCTOR: Right, yes. Kandy Yadao, 66. Medicare. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… going to the bathroom. Or, not going to the bathroom, easily, that is. It’s been… troublesome, for a little while now. Not a sudden thing, you understand.
DOCTOR: “Troublesome,” alright. And how long is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, I’d say, maybe six months ago? At first it was just a little bit slower to start, you know? Now… now it takes a good bit of effort, and sometimes I just… can’t go completely. I have to… push, really. Not comfortable at all.
DOCTOR: Six months. Okay. And are you experiencing any pain with this… effort?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not really pain, exactly. More like a… straining feeling? Down low, of course. And afterwards, sometimes I feel like I haven’t emptied everything. Does that make sense? It’s not sharp, or awful, just… incomplete. And a little uncomfortable, lingering.
DOCTOR: Straining, incomplete emptying… Right. Have you noticed any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Changes in… well, yes, actually. It’s not… as solid as it used to be. More… narrow, I think. And sometimes… a little softer than usual. Not diarrhea, mind you, just… not firm. It's hard to explain. I used to have very regular habits, you know? Every morning, like clockwork. Now… it's unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Narrower stools, changes in consistency… And are you experiencing any bleeding?
PATIENT: Bleeding? No, no bleeding. Definitely not. I would remember that, wouldn't I? No blood in the stool, or anything like that. I check, of course. One has to be careful, you know? But no, nothing like that. Just the… difficulty, and the changes in what comes out, if you don't mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Any family history of… bowel problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… my mother had some trouble with… well, she called it ‘digestive weakness’ when she got older. Lots of stomach upset, but I don't think it was ever anything specific. My father… he was pretty regular, as far as I know. No one ever talked much about that sort of thing, you understand. It wasn't polite. And my brother… he’s fine. Still eating like a horse, last I checked. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you on any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just the usual. For my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And a little vitamin D, the doctor suggested it last winter. That’s it. Nothing else. I don’t take anything over-the-counter, unless I have a bad headache, and then just some acetaminophen. I try to avoid pills whenever possible, you know?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, vitamin D… Alright. Let’s do a quick exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I'm a bit embarrassed, of course, but I understand it's necessary. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on your side, please. We’ll start with a rectal exam. It won't be pleasant, but it will give us some information. I’ll need you to let me know if you feel any pain. And please try to relax.
PATIENT: Oh. That kind of exam. Well… alright. It’s not my favourite thing, I must say. But if you think it’s important… Just… be gentle, please? And I will try to relax, as you said. Though I can’t promise much.
DOCTOR: I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Now, just take a few deep breaths. I'm going to insert a gloved, lubricated finger… to assess the tone of your rectum and check for any masses or tenderness. Hmm. Tone is reduced. I don’t feel any obvious masses, but there is some tenderness on the left side. Alright. That's all for now.
PATIENT: Oh. Tenderness, you say? On the left side… Not good, is it? Does that mean something serious? I’m a bit worried now, to be honest. I’ve always been quite healthy, you see. What are we thinking, doctor? What could be causing this?
DOCTOR: Reduced tone and tenderness… It could be a number of things. Hemorrhoids, a fissure, or possibly diverticulitis. We need to rule out anything more serious, of course. I'm going to order a stool sample to check for blood and infection, and a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy will give us a good look at your entire colon and rectum to see what's going on. It’s the most accurate way to diagnose the problem.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… Oh dear. I’ve heard stories. Isn’t that… invasive? And unpleasant? I’m not sure I like the sound of that at all. Is it absolutely necessary? Could we not try something else first? A different kind of test, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Look, it's the most definitive way to rule out anything serious, like cancer. Yes, the prep isn't fun, and it's not the most comfortable procedure, but it’s essential. We can discuss the sedation options, of course, to make you more comfortable. We could try a FIT test first, but if that comes back positive, you'll still need a colonoscopy. We don't want to delay getting a proper diagnosis, do we?
PATIENT: Cancer… oh, goodness. No, you’re right, I don’t want to delay. It’s just… the thought of it. And the preparation… I’ve heard terrible things. Sedation, you say? What kind? Will I be… asleep? I’m not a brave woman, doctor. I really am not.
DOCTOR: We can discuss the sedation options with the endoscopy nurse. It's usually a mild sedative, something to help you relax and make you a little sleepy, but you’ll still be conscious. They'll go over all the details with you when you schedule the procedure. I'm going to write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma. She's an excellent gastroenterologist. Schedule the appointment as soon as possible. And I'll order the stool sample now. Anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… very well. Dr. Sharma, you say? I will schedule it. As soon as possible. I suppose… no, that’s all for now. Thank you, doctor. Though I’m not at all happy about any of this, I must admit. But thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. The nurse will explain the rest of the process. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
