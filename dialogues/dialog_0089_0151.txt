DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Oh, well, it's this tingling. It's been going on for a little while now, and it's...well, it's annoying, to be honest. I just want to know what's causing it, if that makes sense. I don't have time for a lot of fuss, you know? Just want to get it sorted.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Annoying tingling – I understand wanting to get to the bottom of it quickly. Can you tell me a little more about this tingling?
PATIENT: Sure. It's mostly in my hands and feet. Feels like… pins and needles, you know? Like when your leg falls asleep, but not as bad. It comes and goes. Some days it's hardly there, other days it's more noticeable. It’s worse when I'm tired, I think. I do a lot of walking for my job – postal work – so maybe that has something to do with it? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, hands and feet, pins and needles sensation, comes and goes, worse with fatigue, and you do a lot of walking for your job. That's helpful. How long has this been going on for, Teretha?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? It was very mild at first, I barely noticed it. I just thought I was tired. But it’s gotten a little bit worse over time. Not a lot, but enough that I thought I should get it checked out. I’m not one to complain, usually.
DOCTOR: Six months, starting mild and gradually worsening. Alright. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Weakness… not really. I mean, I get tired, like I said, after a long day at work. But I haven’t dropped anything or tripped or anything like that. My hands still work fine for sorting mail, and I can walk my usual route. It's just the tingling. I can still do everything, it just… feels strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, no weakness, just the tingling sensation. Have you noticed it anywhere else besides your hands and feet?
PATIENT: No, just my hands and feet. Sometimes it feels like it's creeping up my arms a little, but it doesn't go very far. Mostly it stays in my fingers and toes, you know? It doesn't go up my legs or anything. And definitely not in my face or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, just hands and feet, occasionally creeping up the arms slightly. Now, have you had any other symptoms alongside this tingling?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. I've been a little more tired than usual, but I put that down to work. And, well, I'm getting older, aren't I? Things just start to ache a bit. But no, no other symptoms. No pain, no numbness, no dizziness, nothing like that. Just the tingling. It's a nuisance, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms – no pain, numbness, or dizziness. Just the tingling and increased fatigue. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was under control with diet. And I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was ages ago. Nothing else. I don’t take any regular medication, either. Just the occasional pain reliever if I get a headache. I'm not insured, so I try to stay healthy and avoid going to the doctor unless I really have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of controlled high blood pressure and gallbladder removal. No current medications. That’s good to know. And you mentioned not being insured – we’ll keep that in mind as we figure things out. Do you have any family history of conditions like diabetes, neuropathy, or anything else neurological?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… that’s a hard one. My mother had arthritis, badly. And my father… he just got old, you know? He had a lot of aches and pains, but I don’t think it was anything specific. No one ever talked about diabetes or anything like that. We weren’t really the type to go to doctors much, even back then. I don’t think anyone had…what did you say? Neuropathy? No, I don’t think so. Sorry, I’m not much help with that.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Teretha. You’ve given me a good overview. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I hope this doesn't take too long. I have a route to finish this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to gently test the sensation in your hands and feet. Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Go ahead. Just tell me when you touch me, right? I hope it doesn't tickle. I don't like tickling.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Sensation is intact in your hands and feet, though slightly diminished distally – meaning at your fingertips and toes. Strength is 5 out of 5 in all extremities – meaning normal. Feet appear normal, no swelling or skin changes noted. Pulses are 2+ bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, and temperature is 98.6. Everything looks good so far.
PATIENT: Okay. Well, that doesn’t sound too bad, does it? Everything looks good, you say? What does that mean though? Is it something serious? I'm not wanting a lot of tests, if I can help it. Honestly, I just want to know if it's something I should be worried about.
DOCTOR: Alright, Teretha. Everything appears normal on initial exam, which is reassuring. However, your slightly diminished sensation in your fingertips and toes, combined with the tingling, suggests we need to investigate a bit further. It's unlikely to be anything immediately serious, but it could be peripheral neuropathy - damage to the nerves in your hands and feet. This can be caused by a variety of things, including vitamin deficiencies, diabetes , or just age-related changes. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a basic blood workup. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel , vitamin B12 levels, and a fasting blood sugar test. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Vitamin deficiencies… that sounds plausible, I suppose. I don't eat the best, to be honest. Fasting blood sugar… that's the diabetes thing, right? Okay, yes, blood work is fine. As long as it doesn't take too long to get the results, and it’s not too expensive. I really don't have a lot of money. What’s the next step after the blood work? Will I need to come back again?
DOCTOR: Yes, the fasting blood sugar tests for diabetes. We'll also check your HbA1c, which gives us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past three months. The lab work shouldn't be too expensive, and I can ask them to give you the most affordable options. Results typically take 2-3 business days. After the results come back, we’ll review them together. Depending on what they show, we may need to discuss lifestyle changes, like diet, or potentially explore further testing if necessary. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let’s just get the blood work done. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all right. Lifestyle changes... I can probably manage that. I'll try to eat better. Okay, blood work it is. Where do I go to get it done? And will someone call me when the results are ready? I don’t really check my mail very often, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'll write you a lab order now. You can go to [Name of local lab - e.g., Quest Diagnostics] at [Address of lab]. They're open [Hours of operation]. And you're right to mention the mail. I’ll have them call the clinic directly at [Clinic phone number] when the results are back. I’ll make a note on your chart to have someone contact you specifically. Is this phone number still [Your phone number]?
PATIENT: Yes, that phone number is still good. [My phone number]. Thank you. That’s very helpful. I appreciate you having them call me directly. I just… I don't want anything to get lost in the mail. Okay. I think that’s everything. Is there anything else I need to do? Or can I go now? I really need to get back to my route.
DOCTOR: No, I think that’s everything for today, Teretha. You’re all set. Just head to the lab when you have a chance. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Thank you for coming in, and I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly. Have a good rest of your day, and try not to overexert yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I will call if I need anything. Have a good day too.
