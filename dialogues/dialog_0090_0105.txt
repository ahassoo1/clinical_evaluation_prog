DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, I think it's about getting ready for… surgery? My wife helped me set up the appointment. It’s something about my weight, and she said this was the first step. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details. It was a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Surgery?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Bariatric surgery, I think she called it. Something to help me lose weight. It’s… it’s a bit of a blur, to be honest. We talked about it a while ago, and then things got… busy. Is that what we’re here for? I just want to make sure I’m remembering right.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like you’re here for a pre-operative evaluation for bariatric surgery. We need to establish if you're a suitable candidate, and ensure there aren't any underlying issues that need to be addressed first. It’s good your wife is involved; these things are often best approached with support. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. I don't think so. I mean, nothing major that I’ve been told about. I get a little tired sometimes, but I thought that was just… life, you know? I haven’t really seen a doctor regularly in… a long time. My wife usually handles all that. I’m really sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. Is it okay if she comes with me when we talk more about this? Maybe she remembers better.
DOCTOR: It would be… helpful to have her present, yes. But we still need to try and gather your information. Okay. No diagnosed conditions. How about any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing soccer. They put a cast on it, but I don't think that was a real surgery, was it? Other than that… I honestly can’t recall anything. I'm really bad with dates and stuff like that too. It’s frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: A broken arm, alright. That’s not what we’re concerned about here. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any significant medical problems that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. My… my dad had some problems with his heart, I think. He was older when it happened. And my mom… she had trouble with her sugar, maybe? Something with eating. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't really paying attention to medical things then. It’s difficult to say for sure, I’m sorry. I feel like I'm just giving you vague answers. Is this going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: It is… less than ideal, Mr. Kochubey. But we can work with it. Alright, heart problems in your father, possible sugar issues in your mother. Now, let's talk about you. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven’t really taken much medication in my life, to be honest. Just… maybe some pain relievers for headaches? Nothing regular. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction to anything. But again, I’m not very good at remembering these things. My wife probably has a better list if you want to ask her. Would it be alright if I called her in? It would really help, I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. A brief call to your wife is acceptable. While you do that, I'll review what little information we have so far. Go ahead.
PATIENT: Hey honey? It’s me. Um, the doctor is asking about… everything, and I'm really drawing a blank. Could you maybe come in for a few minutes? It would be a huge help. Yeah, I'm right here… okay, great. Thanks, love. She's on her way. It shouldn’t be too long.
DOCTOR: Very well. In the meantime, perhaps you could tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: My diet… hmm. It’s… not great, I guess. A lot of rice and meat. We eat a lot of lamb, it’s traditional. And bread. I like bread. Sometimes we have vegetables, but not enough, probably. My wife tries to get me to eat healthier, but… I just like what I like. We don't really eat a lot of fast food, but I do snack sometimes. I'm not sure what else to say. It's pretty simple, really. I don’t cook much. It’s not something I put a lot of thought into, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: So, primarily rice, lamb, and bread. Minimal vegetables. And snacks. Do you drink a lot of sugary beverages – soda, juice, tea with sugar?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I like tea, very sweet tea. And sometimes soda with dinner. My wife says it's bad for me, and she tries to get me to drink water, but I prefer the taste of something sweeter. I probably drink too much, to be honest. It’s just… a habit, I guess. I know I should be better about it. I just… it’s hard to change old habits.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise? Not much, I'm afraid. I walk to the store sometimes, but that's about it. I used to play soccer when I was younger, but… that was a long time ago. I have a desk job, so I sit a lot. I really should be more active, but… I just don't have the energy, I guess. It’s another thing my wife keeps telling me. I feel like I'm failing this test already.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, Mr. Kochubey, this information is... less than comprehensive. It is difficult to assess your suitability for bariatric surgery without a clearer understanding of your medical history and current lifestyle. Ah, your wife. Excellent. Perhaps she can fill in the gaps.
PATIENT: That would be wonderful, Doctor. Thank you. She really is the organized one in the family. Honey, this is Dr. Kur. She's trying to figure out if I'm… well, if I’m healthy enough for the surgery. I’m not very good at remembering things, as you can see.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I appreciate you joining us. As your husband has mentioned, we are attempting to gather a thorough medical history to determine his candidacy for bariatric surgery. Unfortunately, he has been unable to provide a comprehensive account. Perhaps you can assist us. Let’s start with any diagnosed medical conditions your husband does have. Diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything at all?
PATIENT: Well, he does have… borderline hypertension. His blood pressure has been a little high for a few years now, and we’ve been monitoring it. He doesn’t love taking medication, so we try to manage it with diet and exercise… although, to be honest, it’s a struggle. And he was pre-diabetic at his last checkup, which is why we’re looking into the surgery. It runs in my family, and I'm worried about him. He doesn't always remember what the doctor tells him, and he doesn't like going to appointments. So, I usually go with him, to make sure he understands everything.
DOCTOR: Borderline hypertension, pre-diabetes. And he is resistant to medication. Is he currently on any medications at all, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: He takes a daily multivitamin, that’s about it. Oh, and sometimes he’ll take ibuprofen for headaches, if they’re really bad. But that’s infrequent, maybe once or twice a month. He really tries to avoid medication whenever possible. He says it makes him feel sluggish. I've tried to get him to see a specialist about his blood pressure, but he insists he's fine, as long as he watches his diet. It's… difficult. He's a stubborn man.
DOCTOR: And his surgical history?
PATIENT: He had his tonsils removed when he was a child, and he broke his arm playing soccer, like he mentioned. He’s had a few dental procedures over the years, fillings and such, but nothing major. No other surgeries that I’m aware of. And he hasn't had any significant illnesses, like pneumonia or a serious infection. He gets colds occasionally, but they don't last long. I think that's everything, as far as his medical history goes. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is… better. Now, let’s discuss your husband’s family history. Specifically, any instances of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or obesity in either side of his family?
PATIENT: Yes, there is. His father died of a heart attack when he was in his early seventies. And his mother had type 2 diabetes. She struggled with her weight for most of her life, and it contributed to a lot of her health problems. On my side of the family, my grandmother had breast cancer, but she was treated successfully. And… my uncle had obesity and developed some complications, but he managed to lose weight and improve his health. So, there’s a history of both heart disease and diabetes on his side, and a bit of cancer and obesity on mine. It's not a very encouraging family history, is it?
DOCTOR: It provides a clearer picture, certainly. Now, concerning your husband’s lifestyle. What is his typical daily diet?
PATIENT: Well, his diet is… not great. He loves rice and lamb, and bread. He eats a lot of carbs. I try to get him to eat more vegetables and lean protein, but he's resistant. He snacks throughout the day, usually on sweets or salty snacks. He drinks a lot of sweet tea and soda. We don't eat a lot of fast food, but he doesn't portion his meals well. I cook most of the meals, and I try to make healthy options, but he’ll often go back for seconds or thirds. He doesn’t really cook himself, so he doesn’t have a lot of control over what he eats when he's alone. I know it’s not ideal, and I try to encourage him to make healthier choices, but it’s a struggle. He just enjoys those foods so much.
DOCTOR: And what about exercise?
PATIENT: That’s… another area where he struggles. He doesn't exercise regularly at all. He walks to the store sometimes, but that's about it. He used to play soccer when he was younger, but he hasn’t played in years. He has a desk job, so he spends most of the day sitting. He gets tired easily, and he doesn’t have a lot of energy. He says he doesn’t have time, and he doesn’t enjoy it. I've tried to get him to go for walks with me, but he usually refuses. I know it’s not a very active lifestyle, and it’s a contributing factor to his weight gain. I worry about his health, and I want him to make changes, but he's resistant. I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the information I’ve gathered, your husband presents several risk factors for complications related to bariatric surgery. He has borderline hypertension, pre-diabetes, a family history of heart disease and diabetes, a diet high in carbohydrates and sugar, and a sedentary lifestyle. He is also resistant to medication and demonstrates limited compliance with healthy lifestyle recommendations. Frankly, Mr. Kochubey, I have significant concerns about your candidacy for this procedure.
PATIENT: I… I understand. I’m not very healthy, I know. I just… I thought this might be a way to get better. My wife has been so worried, and I wanted to try something. But if I’m not a good candidate… What are my options? Is there anything else I can do? I'm willing to try, if you think it will help.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kochubey, the surgery is not the only answer. In fact, given your current health status, it might be too risky. Before we even consider this procedure, you need to address the underlying issues contributing to your weight gain and poor health. I recommend a comprehensive medical evaluation, including a cardiac workup and a referral to a registered dietitian and a certified diabetes educator. You need to focus on improving your diet, increasing your physical activity, and managing your blood pressure and blood sugar levels. I also strongly encourage you to consider behavioral therapy to address any underlying emotional factors contributing to your eating habits. This will require a significant commitment and a lifestyle change. It will not be easy, but it is essential for your health. And, frankly, it will require support from your wife. Are you both willing to commit to this plan?
PATIENT: I… I think we can do that. It won’t be easy, like you said. But I don’t want to just sit here and get sicker. I want to be healthy, for my wife and… for myself. Honey? Are you with me? We’re willing to try. Whatever it takes. If you think it will help, we’ll do it. Please, help us.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m glad to hear that. I’ll write referrals to a cardiologist, a registered dietitian, and a certified diabetes educator. I’ll also provide you with information about behavioral therapy programs in the area. It’s important to follow these recommendations closely and to keep me informed of your progress. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to reassess your health and discuss your options. In the meantime, I want you to focus on making small, sustainable changes to your diet and lifestyle. This document outlines the initial steps you should take, including dietary guidelines, exercise recommendations, and resources for behavioral therapy. Remember, Mr. Kochubey, this is a journey, not a race. It will require commitment, patience, and support. But if you’re willing to put in the effort, I believe you can improve your health and quality of life. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. It's a lot to take in, but... I think we understand. We'll follow your recommendations. Thank you, Doctor. For not giving up on me. We'll do this together. I think that's all. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. I expect to see progress at your follow-up appointment. Here are the contact details for scheduling. Do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Good day.
