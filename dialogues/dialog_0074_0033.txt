DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why I’m here. My assistant… or someone… scheduled this. Something about not being able to see or hear properly? It’s terribly inconvenient, really. I’m a very busy woman, you know. A surgeon. Though, retired now. Still… time is precious. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. It sounds as though the appointment was scheduled due to some concerns about your vision and hearing. That’s a very reasonable thing to investigate, and we'll do our best to be efficient. To start, could you tell me a little more about what you've been experiencing with your vision?
PATIENT: Experiencing? Oh, goodness. It’s… blurry, I suppose. Everything is a bit… washed out. And it came on quite suddenly. I was reading – a very important journal, mind you – and then… not so clear. I don’t recall when exactly. Last week, perhaps? It all feels like one long, hazy blur now, if you’ll pardon the expression. Honestly, I’m not one for dwelling on such trivial things. It’s probably just fatigue. I’ve been working very hard, even after retirement, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sudden changes in vision are certainly concerning, even if you suspect fatigue. “Washed out” and “blurry” are helpful descriptions. And you mentioned this started approximately a week ago?
PATIENT: Approximately. Yes. Though, honestly, time… it slips away, doesn’t it? It could be a bit longer. I really haven’t paid it much attention until… someone insisted I come here. It’s not as if I’m completely helpless. I still manage, you know. I just… prefer things to be clear. It’s important in my profession. Was important. Honestly, I'd rather not discuss this at length. It's a bit… undignified.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Ms. Julie, and respect that you'd prefer to be efficient. We'll proceed as quickly as possible. Just to be thorough, has this blurry vision been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Constant, I believe. Though, now that you mention it… perhaps it’s a bit worse in the evenings? The lighting in my study isn’t the best. It’s rather… atmospheric. I prefer it that way. But yes, generally constant. It’s a nuisance, really. A very disruptive nuisance. I have important things to read, you know. And people to… well, it doesn’t matter. Just constant, generally. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: We are, Ms. Julie, we are. The fact that it’s generally constant and potentially worse in the evenings is helpful information. Now, let’s talk about your hearing. Have you noticed any difficulty hearing, and if so, can you describe what that’s like?
PATIENT: Oh, the hearing. Yes. It’s… muffled. Everything sounds… distant. Like someone is speaking through a thick wall. It's very irritating. I keep having to ask people to repeat themselves, which is simply dreadful. I have a reputation for being quite sharp, you know. Asking people to repeat themselves is… unbecoming. It started around the same time as the vision, I suppose. Perhaps a week ago? Though, honestly, it’s all becoming a bit of a blur. Frankly, I suspect it’s just the television. My housekeeper insists on having it on at a rather high volume. Loud, dreadful music. .
DOCTOR: I see. Muffled hearing, also around a week ago, and potentially linked to the television volume. That's helpful information. Just to clarify, is this muffled hearing in both ears, or is it worse in one ear than the other?
