DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Ka Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you too. Um… I just moved here? I think that's why I'm here. Like, for a check-up since I'm new. I got… Medicare, I think? It's all kinda new, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It is a lot when you’re establishing care somewhere new. And yes, I see here you are covered by Medicare, that’s great. A wellness check-up is a wonderful idea when you’ve relocated. It’s good to get a baseline. First, let's just confirm some details. You said you recently moved here… from where, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Um… somewhere far? I… don’t really remember the name of the place. It was… by the ocean, lots of trees. And… my husband and I moved here for his job. It was a long drive. I mostly slept, I think. Sorry, I'm not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Emileigh. No need to apologize at all. Long drives can certainly do a number on one’s memory! And it sounds like you've had a big change in scenery. We’ll take things at your pace. Just to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little about what brought you and your husband to this area specifically?
PATIENT: He… works with machines? Like, building them and fixing them. He's really good at it. There was a job opening here, at the… factory? Or… plant? Something like that. It was a good opportunity for him. I mostly just… help out where I can. I work too, kinda. With… different things. Not as important as his job, though.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful about your husband’s job – it sounds like a good fit for both of you. And all work is important, Emileigh, don’t downplay your contributions! “Different things” is perfectly valid. To help me get a sense of your overall health, let’s start with a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Um… I think I was sick when I was little? A really bad cough, maybe? It was a long time ago, I don’t really remember. And… I think I broke my arm once, but that was when I was a kid too. I don't really go to the doctor much. My husband usually handles all that stuff. I just… try to stay healthy. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, a childhood cough and a broken arm. And generally you've been pretty healthy, relying on your husband to manage medical appointments. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don't think so. I mean, I don’t remember any surgeries. My mom… she always took care of me when I was sick. I think she just gave me medicine and lots of rest. I really don't remember being in a hospital or anything. Does getting your wisdom teeth out count as surgery? I think I had that done, but it was a long time ago and… blurry.
DOCTOR: Wisdom teeth removal is considered surgery, yes. But if it was a long time ago and you don’t remember details, that’s alright. We can note it as a possible surgery. Now, thinking about your family – your parents, siblings, if you have them – do they have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… my mom is okay, I think. She's… older now. She lives… far away. And my dad… he passed away a long time ago. I don’t really remember much about what he was sick with, if he was sick with anything. I think he just… got old. And I don't have any siblings. It was just my mom and dad. Sorry, I'm not very helpful, am I? I really wish I could remember more.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Emileigh. It’s perfectly understandable that you don’t remember everything, especially details from the past. Many people find it difficult to recall medical histories from family members. Don’t worry about it at all. Let’s switch gears a bit. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t think so. I eat pretty much anything. My husband sometimes gets a rash if he eats shellfish, but I don’t have that problem. And I haven’t really taken any medicine lately, except for… maybe a pain reliever when my head hurts? Nothing major, I don’t think. I’m usually pretty good about avoiding things I know will make me sick. Like, really spicy food. That always makes my stomach hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known drug, food, or environmental allergies. Occasional headaches relieved with over-the-counter pain relievers, and avoiding spicy foods due to stomach upset. That’s good information. Now, are you currently taking any medications regularly – prescription or over-the-counter – vitamins, supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Um… just a multivitamin sometimes. My husband buys it for me. He says I should. And… sometimes I take something for my joints. They ache a little when it's cold. It’s… a little bottle, with pills in it. He gets it for me too. I don't really know what it's called. He just tells me to take two every morning. I think it helps a little, but I’m not sure. Honestly, I just try to keep up with what he tells me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin and something for joint pain, provided by your husband. We'll try to get the names of those medications from him if possible. That would be very helpful. Now, to finish up with the background information, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Um… lifestyle? What does that mean? I work, mostly. And I help my husband with things. We watch TV sometimes. And we go for walks when the weather is nice. It's… pretty quiet, mostly. We don’t really go out much. We used to, before he got this job. Now we just try to settle in. I like gardening, when I have time. I grow tomatoes and… other things. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, Emileigh, that's exactly what I mean. Just getting a sense of your daily activities and habits. That sounds very pleasant – gardening is a wonderful hobby. And it's good you and your husband enjoy walks. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Definitely not. My husband doesn't smoke either. He… used to drink beer sometimes, but he doesn't really anymore. He says it makes him feel tired. And we… don't do any of that other stuff. We’re pretty healthy, I think. Or we try to be. Mostly we just like to relax and enjoy our quiet life. Is that okay? I hope that's a good enough answer. I don't want to seem strange.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly fine, Emileigh. Thank you for being so open with me. It sounds like you and your husband prioritize a healthy lifestyle, and that’s wonderful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to get a baseline and see how things are looking. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. That sounds… alright. I don’t really like going to the doctor, but I guess it's okay. If you have to. Just… be gentle? And tell me what you're doing, so I don't get scared. I’m not very good with needles, if you're going to do that. My husband always handles the shots.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. We'll take it very slowly, and I will explain everything as I go. And I will absolutely let you know before anything potentially uncomfortable happens, like a shot. We don’t have to do a blood draw today if you’re not comfortable with it. We can start with just the basic exam and see how you feel. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Okay… deep breath… … is that right? I feel a little silly. My heart is probably beating really fast now. I get nervous at the doctor. I always have.
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Emileigh. Don't worry about feeling silly – it’s very normal to feel nervous at the doctor. Your heart rate is slightly elevated, which is understandable given your anxiety, but it sounds regular. Your lungs sound clear and open. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. I’ll wrap this cuff around your arm. It might feel a little tight for a moment.
PATIENT: Okay… … that is a little tight. Is that normal? I feel like my arm is going to fall off. I don't like this. My husband said my blood pressure is usually okay, but I always worry when they check it. He says I get stressed easily.
DOCTOR: It is normal to feel some pressure, Emileigh, and I apologize if it’s too uncomfortable. I can loosen it a bit. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 138/88, but again, that’s not surprising given your anxiety. We’ll keep an eye on it. We can recheck it later, after you've had a chance to relax. Now, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen. Could you lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay… … is that okay? I hope I'm not doing it wrong. I always feel awkward when I have to lie down for the doctor. Like, what position should I be in? My husband always knows what to do.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Emileigh. Just relax and let me know if you’re uncomfortable. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness or masses. Everything sounds normal here. I’m going to check your ears and throat now. Do you have any pain in your ears or a sore throat?
PATIENT: No, not really. My ears sometimes feel a little… clogged, but it's not painful. And my throat is fine, I think. It feels a little scratchy sometimes, but that's just from talking too much. I get nervous and I talk really fast. My husband says I should try to slow down. Is that going to hurt? I don't like things going in my ears.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t hurt at all, Emileigh. I’m just shining a light in your ear to take a look. Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums look normal. I do see a little bit of wax buildup, but it’s not significant. And now, I'm going to take a look at your throat. Could you open your mouth wide and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Ahhhh… Is that okay? I hope I’m not doing it wrong. I always feel like I have to hold my mouth open really wide. It makes my jaw hurt. My husband always knows how to do it right.
DOCTOR: Everything looks normal in your throat, Emileigh. No redness or swelling. Just a little bit of normal wear and tear. You’re doing great, just relax. Okay, that completes the physical exam for now. Everything seems generally normal, though your blood pressure is a little elevated, which is likely due to anxiety. We can keep an eye on it. Do you have any questions about the exam?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don't think so. It was… okay. A little scary, but okay. My husband is going to be mad that I didn't get the name of the medicine he gives me for my joints. I always forget. Is that bad? Should I be worried about forgetting things? I'm starting to get a headache now. Maybe I should just go home and lie down.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Emileigh, and forgetting things happens to everyone. Don't worry about it too much. We can always try to get the name from your husband later. As for the headache, it could be a sign of stress, or simply from the exam. Before we finish, let's discuss some next steps. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and your reported headaches, I recommend we schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to recheck your blood pressure and discuss stress management techniques. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Uh… a few weeks? That sounds… okay. I guess. But I don't like going to the doctor. My husband can handle it if you want. He's really good at remembering things and asking questions. He always knows what to do. Is it okay if I just… take it easy for now? And maybe try to relax more? I don't want to bother you too much.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel that way, Emileigh. We can definitely involve your husband. In fact, it sounds like he's a great support to you. We can schedule the follow-up appointment for you both, so he can be there and help with any questions. For now, yes, absolutely take it easy and focus on relaxation. Perhaps some gentle walks, reading, or gardening could help. If your headaches worsen or you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Before you leave, I'm going to give you a handout on stress management techniques. Would you like me to schedule that follow-up appointment now, or would you prefer your husband to call?
PATIENT: Uh… maybe my husband should call. He's better at… all this stuff. And he can remember the days and times. I always get confused. Thank you for… being nice. And for not getting mad that I forgot everything. I think that's all I need for now. I just want to go home and lie down.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. Absolutely no need to apologize for anything. We’re here to help, and we'll work at your pace. Please have your husband call when he has a chance, and we can get that appointment scheduled. Here's a card with the clinic's phone number and address. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a peaceful rest at home.
