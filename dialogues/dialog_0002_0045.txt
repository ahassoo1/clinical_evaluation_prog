DOCTOR: Hi Enrique, welcome! I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… well, my face gets very red. Like, flushing. It happens sometimes, and I wanted to see if it was something bad. It just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Flushing – redness in the face that comes and goes. That can be a lot of things, so it’s good you’re getting it checked out. To start, can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? That is… a good question. It doesn’t seem to be after eating anything special. Or… after exercise. Sometimes it just happens when I’m talking to people. Not always, but… maybe when I feel a little shy? Or… embarrassed? It’s hard to say for sure. It just… appears. Then goes away.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So it seems to be more related to… emotional situations, like talking to people and possibly when you’re feeling shy or embarrassed. And it doesn’t seem consistently linked to things like food or exercise. Does it happen every time you feel those emotions, or is it more random?
PATIENT: No, not every time. Definitely not. I talk to people all the time, and usually nothing happens. It’s… unpredictable. Maybe once or twice a week? Sometimes not for a whole week. It's not… regular. Like the clock.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent, a couple of times a week, maybe less, and not consistently tied to social situations. And it doesn’t feel linked to anything specific you’re eating or doing physically, right?
PATIENT: That is… correct. Nothing I can think of. I drink tea. A lot of tea. Black tea. But I have been drinking tea for… many years. Never had this problem before, maybe… six months ago? It started then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a relatively new symptom, starting about six months ago, and you've been drinking black tea for years without issue. That's good information. Let's talk about other things that might be going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the flushing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… sometimes my heart feels a little fast. Not very fast, just… aware of it. And maybe… a little sweaty. But it could be the weather. It is very hot today.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve noticed a slightly faster heartbeat and maybe some increased sweating at the same time as the flushing. It's good you’re recognizing those things. And you're right, it is hot today, so the sweating could definitely be related to that. To get a better picture, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you'll just have a seat here, we’ll get started. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today – 140 over 90. Your pulse is 88, which is normal. And listening to your heart and lungs, everything sounds clear. I don’t hear anything unusual. Do you know what your typical blood pressure usually is?
PATIENT: No, I do not. I have… not had it checked before. This is… new to me, Doctor. All of this. Checking blood pressure and… pulse.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. That’s why we’re here. A blood pressure of 140/90 is considered slightly elevated, and we'll want to keep an eye on that. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it’s good to know your baseline. Now, just to rule out anything else, I’m going to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been… healthy, usually. Until this flushing. My wife… she took care of all the doctor things. Before… she passed. I am not very good with remembering medical… words.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. It can be a lot to handle, especially when you’re used to someone else managing those things. Don’t worry about the medical words – we can take things slowly, and I'll explain everything as clearly as possible. Okay, so no prior medical diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never had surgery. I avoid… sharp things. If I can. It is not a good feeling, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I take… sometimes a little something for sleep. But only when I… cannot sleep. It is a… herbal tea. With chamomile. My wife bought it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just an herbal tea with chamomile occasionally for sleep. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. I do not think so. No allergies. I eat… many different things. Sometimes spicy food. But I have never had a reaction. I am careful, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… history? Hmm. My father… he had problems with his stomach. Very bad. Always sick. My mother… she was healthy. Very strong. But… they lived in India. A long time ago. I do not know much about their doctors, or… what they had. It was different then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had stomach problems, and your mother was generally healthy. That’s helpful to know. And you're right, medical records weren't always as readily available back then. Finally, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean, Doctor? I… I work. I counsel people. I drink tea. I watch television sometimes. I try to eat healthy. I walk a little. Is that… what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. That’s helpful. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No! No smoking. Never. My wife… she did not like it. Very bad for health. I… I avoid bad things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how much alcohol do you drink, if any?
PATIENT: Sometimes… a little wine. With dinner. Maybe one or two glasses. On the weekend. But not every weekend. It helps me relax. Not very much, Doctor. I promise.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass or two of wine on the weekend. That’s good to know. Okay, based on everything you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing flushing episodes, sometimes accompanied by a slightly faster heartbeat and some sweating. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that could be due to nerves or a number of other things. Given your description, and the fact that it seems to be linked to emotional situations, it could be something like rosacea, but it could also be related to anxiety or a vasomotor issue. It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. I'd like to start with a few blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We can also monitor your blood pressure over the next week or so to get a better baseline. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood tests? What are you looking for, Doctor? Is it… something bad? Monitoring my blood pressure… I can do that, I think. But I do not like needles. I have never been good with needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the blood tests, and it's perfectly normal to be nervous about needles. We're just looking for some basic information – things like your blood sugar, cholesterol, and a complete blood count – to rule out any underlying medical issues that could be contributing to the flushing. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it's always best to be thorough. We'll just need a small sample of blood. The nurse is very good, and we can make it as comfortable as possible. We can also talk about ways to manage your anxiety if you're concerned about the procedure. As for the blood pressure, we can get you a home monitor and have you check it a couple of times a day for a week. We'll review the results together. Would you be comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: Home monitor… yes. I can do that. That sounds… less scary. The blood tests… maybe. But can I… think about it? For a little while? I do not want to faint. My wife… she would be very worried if I fainted. Can we do the blood tests… later? If we need to?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can definitely postpone the blood tests. There's no rush. We can start with monitoring your blood pressure at home for a week, and then we can reassess whether or not we need to do further testing. If you start to feel very unwell, or if the flushing episodes become more frequent or severe, please don't hesitate to call the office. The nurse will come in and show you how to use the home blood pressure monitor, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to review the results. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. Thank you, Doctor. The nurse… will show me how to use it? I am not very good with… machines. But I will try. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. Don’t worry about the machine – the nurse will walk you through everything step-by-step, and it’s actually quite easy to use. I'll have her come in now. And please, don’t hesitate to ask any questions you have along the way. We’re here to help.
PATIENT: .
