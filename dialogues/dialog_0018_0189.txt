DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about my…well, let's just say what comes out when I use the facilities. It’s not right, you see. There was…blood. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to notice. A man notices these things. I haven’t been eating anything unusual, and I certainly don't have any…problems down there. I just thought you ought to know. It's probably nothing, but at my age…you gotta be careful.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concern, and you are absolutely right to have it checked out, especially given your age. It’s good you’re being proactive. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed this blood?
PATIENT: Oh, it was…a couple of days ago, I suppose. Maybe three. It’s hard to keep track these days, honestly. I went to the bathroom, and…there it was. Bright red, not mixed in with anything. Just…streaks. Like someone had added a bit of paint to the bowl, if you catch my meaning. It hasn't happened every time, mind you. Just a couple of times now. I’ve been feeling alright otherwise, no stomach pains or anything. Though, my appetite hasn't been what it used to be…but that's just getting old, I expect.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Mr. Rowbottom. So, bright red blood, appearing intermittently over the past few days. No associated pain, and a decreased appetite. Could you describe the amount of blood you’ve noticed each time?
PATIENT: Well, now, don’t ask me to measure it! I’m not a plumber, you know. It wasn't a flood, if that’s what you’re getting at. More like…a few streaks in the bowl. A teaspoon, maybe? Two? Honestly, I didn’t get the measuring cup out. I just…noticed it. It wasn’t pouring out, certainly. Enough to worry a sensible man, though. And at my age, sensible is the only way to be. It's just… unnerving, you know? Things shouldn’t be coming out that colour.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s unsettling to see blood where it shouldn’t be, and you're right to be concerned. A teaspoon or two each time is helpful information. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits along with this?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, now, let me think. Everything’s a bit…slower these days, if you know what I mean. Takes a bit longer to get things moving. And…well, it's not as solid as it used to be, either. More…formed, shall we say? Not liquid, mind you, just…softer. I wouldn't call it diarrhea, but it's certainly not the…robust movements of my youth. And I've been going a bit more often, too. Not a drastic change, but noticeable. Is that what you mean by changes? Everything's just…less dependable. Like everything else these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mr. Rowbottom. Slower movements, softer stools, and increased frequency. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmph. Medical history. That’s a long story. Let’s see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, back in ’58, I believe. And I broke my arm falling out of a tree – a perfectly good tree, I might add – in ’62. Other than that, I’ve always been a fairly healthy man. I flew planes for forty years, you know. Kept me in good shape. Though, my doctor back in…well, never mind where. He always said my blood pressure was a bit high. Put me on some pills for it, but I stopped taking them. Didn't like the way they made me feel. And I had a bit of a touch of the flu a couple of winters ago. But that’s about it. Nothing serious, really. I’ve always been able to bounce back.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. So, appendectomy in 1958, broken arm in 1962, history of high blood pressure treated with medication that you discontinued, and a bout of the flu a couple of years ago. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I told you, I stopped taking those blood pressure pills years ago. I don't trust those things. I believe in a good diet and fresh air. And a bit of hard work. That's what keeps a man going. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing. Just… normal food, I suppose. Though my daughter keeps trying to get me to take something for my joints. Says I'm getting too stiff. But I told her I'm just getting old, and that’s that. I don’t like filling my body with things it doesn’t need. Makes you feel sluggish, you know. Besides, I’ve lived this long without them.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmph. Allergies. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Used to have to, travelling around the world with the airline. Exotic foods, strange meats... never had a problem. I've been stung by a bee or two in my time, but that’s just a bit of pain. Not an allergy, just a nuisance. My ex-wife was allergic to cats, but that's neither here nor there. No, I can’t say I have any allergies to speak of. I'm a fairly robust individual, you see. Don't get bothered by much. Though dust does make me sneeze sometimes, but that's just common decency.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. No known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Well, that's a bit of a mixed bag. My father lived to be 85, fairly healthy until the end. He was a fisherman, strong as an ox. My mother…she passed away when I was young, cancer, I believe. My sister had a bit of trouble with her heart when she got older, had to have a pacemaker. And my son…well, he’s fine, as far as I know. Lives in California, doesn’t call much. As for any specific illnesses… I don’t recall anyone having anything particularly… concerning. Nothing like what I'm dealing with, certainly. Mostly just old age and general ailments. It’s a long story, my family. A bit disorganized, if I’m honest. Never much talk of illnesses, always just getting on with things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. That’s helpful. Father lived to 85, mother passed away young from cancer, sister had heart trouble. Finally, I’d like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Hmph. Lifestyle. Well, I used to smoke, back when I was flying. A pack a day, easy. But I gave that up when I retired. Too expensive, and not good for the lungs, you know. As for alcohol… I enjoy a glass of scotch now and then. Just one, to relax. Don't go in for all that binge drinking. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Never touched the stuff. I was a professional pilot, you see. Had a reputation to uphold. Never saw the need for any of that foolishness. Just a good, clean life. That's what I believe in. Though my ex-wife…well, that's another story entirely. But as for me, I'm a pretty straightforward individual. Scotch now and then, that's about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. So, former smoker, occasional scotch drinker, no recreational drug use. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. A physical exam. Well, I suppose it's necessary. Don't poke around too much, though. I'm an old man, not a young spring chicken. And be gentle. I bruise easily these days. But yes, go ahead. Get it over with. I've got things to do, you know. Time is precious. And try not to make it too uncomfortable. I haven't got the stamina I used to. Just be quick and efficient, that's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in…and out…Good. And another… Heart sounds are regular, but I do note a slight diminished breath sound in the lower lobes bilaterally. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant, no guarding or rebound. Finally, I will perform a brief rectal exam. This will help me assess for any abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. A rectal exam? Now you're talking. Not looking forward to that, I can tell you. Really, is it absolutely necessary? I mean, I've told you everything I know. Can't you just give me something for it? A cream, perhaps? Look, I'm a private man, you know. Having a stranger poke around down there… it's not dignified. I suppose if you insist... but be quick about it. And gentle! I’m telling you, I bruise easily. Very easily. Just get it over with, and let’s be done with this whole ordeal. Really. Very quickly now. And explain exactly what you're doing, I want to know everything. Don’t just…surprise me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your discomfort, and I will explain everything as I go. It is a standard part of the examination when we are investigating changes in bowel habits and blood in the stool, and it is important to rule out any underlying issues. I will be as gentle and quick as possible. I’m going to apply some lubricant to the glove, and then gently insert a finger into your rectum. This will allow me to check for any masses, tenderness, or bleeding. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know immediately if you experience any discomfort. The stool is dark and guaiac positive – meaning there is blood present. No obvious masses were palpated, but there is mild tenderness on the left side. I did not detect any anal fissures or hemorrhoids.
PATIENT: Guaiac positive? What does that even mean? Is that bad? And tenderness on the left side...that doesn't sound good. So, you found blood...even when you couldn't see it? This is all very unsettling. I knew I should have just ignored it. It's always something with old age, isn’t it? Falling apart, bit by bit. What do you think it is, Doctor? Be honest with me. No beating around the bush. Is it… serious? And what are we going to do about it? I don’t want a lot of invasive procedures, you understand. I've lived a long life, I don't want to spend the rest of it in a hospital bed. Just tell me what’s going on, and what my options are. And please, keep it simple. I’m not a doctor, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that we will take things one step at a time. "Guaiac positive" simply means that there is microscopic blood present in your stool, which we confirmed during the rectal exam. It confirms what you initially reported, but doesn't tell us the source of the bleeding. The tenderness in your lower left quadrant, combined with the blood in your stool, suggests a few possibilities. It could be something relatively minor, like diverticulitis – small pouches in the colon that can become inflamed. However, it could also indicate something more serious, such as a polyp or, less commonly, colon cancer. Because of your age and the presence of blood, it's important to investigate further to determine the exact cause. I want to be upfront with you: the most definitive way to determine the source of the bleeding is a colonoscopy. This involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your colon to visualize the lining and take a biopsy if necessary. I understand your concerns about invasive procedures, and we can discuss alternatives, but a colonoscopy provides the most accurate information. Before we discuss a colonoscopy, I would like to order a complete blood count to check for anemia – low red blood cell count – and a stool test to rule out any infection. These tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Anemia…that doesn’t sound good either. And a stool test…more poking around? Honestly, Doctor, I feel like a science experiment. A colonoscopy…that sounds… unpleasant. And potentially dangerous at my age. I’ve heard stories. Is it absolutely necessary? Couldn’t we just…wait and see? Monitor things for a bit? I haven’t been feeling that bad. A bit tired, perhaps, but that's just old age, isn’t it? And I really don’t want to be subjected to a lot of invasive procedures. Is there anything else we can do? Some sort of scan? Something less… intrusive? I'm not a fan of doctors, you know. Never have been. Too much poking and prodding. Just tell me, honestly, what are the chances it’s nothing serious? And what are the risks of this… colonoscopy? Be straight with me, Doctor. No sugarcoating. I need to know what I'm getting into.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I completely understand your reluctance, and I want to assure you that we will only proceed with tests that are absolutely necessary. You are right to ask about alternatives and potential risks. Let me address your questions. A CT scan of the abdomen can sometimes detect abnormalities in the colon, but it’s not as accurate as a colonoscopy for identifying small polyps or early signs of cancer. It also involves radiation exposure, which we try to minimize. Regarding the colonoscopy, the risks are relatively low, but they do exist. They include bleeding, perforation , and reaction to the sedation. However, serious complications are rare, especially in healthy individuals. The procedure is performed by a highly trained gastroenterologist, and we take every precaution to ensure your safety. Now, to address your concern about the chances it’s nothing serious: It’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation. The guaiac positive stool and tenderness could be due to a variety of less serious conditions, such as diverticulitis or inflammation. However, given your age and the presence of blood, we need to rule out more serious possibilities, such as polyps or cancer. Waiting and monitoring could be an option, but it also carries risks. If it is cancer, delaying diagnosis could allow it to progress to a more advanced stage, making treatment more difficult. I recommend we start with the blood count and stool test to get a clearer picture of your overall health and rule out any infection. If those tests are normal, I strongly recommend a colonoscopy. I understand your apprehension, and I will be happy to answer any further questions you have and discuss the procedure in detail, including the preparation process and potential risks and benefits. We can also discuss alternative options, but they may not provide the same level of accuracy. Would you like me to schedule those initial tests?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Schedule the tests. The blood count and… the stool test. Get it over with. But I'm not promising anything about this…colonoscopy. We'll see what the other tests say. And I want a full explanation of everything beforehand. Every single detail. The preparation, the procedure itself, the risks, the recovery… everything. No holding back. And I want the name of the gastroenterologist. I want to know their experience and qualifications. I'm not going to be subjected to some inexperienced doctor poking around down there. And if the tests come back negative… that's it. No further procedures. Do you understand? I’m an old man, Doctor. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life in a hospital bed. Just get the tests done, and we’ll see what happens. And I want a copy of the results, regardless of what they are. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Mr. Rowbottom. That is not too much to ask at all. I understand your concerns, and I will ensure all your requests are met. I am now scheduling a complete blood count and a stool test. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. I will also provide you with detailed instructions on how to collect the stool sample. I will also obtain a full report on the gastroenterologist who would perform the colonoscopy, including their experience and qualifications. I will then schedule a separate appointment for you to meet with them and discuss the procedure in detail, including the preparation process, risks, and benefits. You will receive a full copy of all test results, regardless of what they are. And, to be clear, we will only proceed with the colonoscopy if the initial tests warrant it and you are comfortable doing so. Here is the lab requisition form. Please take this with you when you go to the lab. Do you have any questions about this process?
PATIENT: No. Just…get it done. I've got things to do, you know. Time is precious. Don’t want to waste it sitting around in doctor’s offices. And make sure that gastroenterologist is experienced. I don’t want any surprises. Alright. That’s enough for now, I suppose. I’ll leave it in your hands. But I’m telling you, if this turns into a whole ordeal, I won’t be happy. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns, and I will do everything I can to ensure a smooth and comfortable experience. I will personally follow up with you to schedule the appointment with the gastroenterologist once the initial test results are available. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Thank you for coming in today, and have a good day. .
