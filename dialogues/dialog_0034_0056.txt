DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s about my…employment. Though I fail to see what you could possibly do about it. It’s the students, you see. Utterly lacking in…discipline. And respect. Honestly, the decline of modern education is… appalling. I suppose you want the details. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like this is related to your work, and some difficulties you’re experiencing with students. I’m happy to listen and see if I can help in any way. To start, could you tell me a bit more about what’s been happening?
PATIENT: “Happening”? Everything, young man. Everything. They don't read anymore. They stare at those…glowing rectangles all day. And when they do attempt to engage with a book, it’s some…frivolous nonsense. No appreciation for the classics. No respect for the Dewey Decimal System, I tell you! It’s chaos. Utter chaos. I used to have order. Order, I say. Now… it’s simply… draining.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like you’re experiencing a great deal of frustration with the lack of engagement and respect from your students, and a change in the learning environment that’s concerning to you. Just to clarify, Mr. Schlatterer, are you a teacher, or do you work in a library?
PATIENT: A teacher, naturally. Postsecondary. Though “teacher” feels…generous, these days. I was a librarian, a very good one, for some time. Before… well, before the university decided they needed more… “interactive” programs. Honestly, the whole thing is a disgrace. Are we quite finished with these questions? I have a perfectly good crossword puzzle waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying. I understand your frustration, and it sounds like this change has been difficult for you. To help me understand what’s going on, and see if there’s anything I can do, could you tell me a bit more about how this is affecting you personally?
PATIENT: “Affecting me”? Really. Must we delve into…feelings? Look, I'm simply…tired. Exhausted. I go to work, I attempt to impart knowledge – a thankless task, I assure you – and I come home feeling utterly depleted. I sleep poorly. I have no appetite. I find myself… less tolerant. Is that sufficient? Honestly, I suspect it's simply the natural result of dealing with…youth. A constant barrage of… noise. And disrespect.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schlatterer. That’s helpful. When you say you sleep poorly, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, it's nothing dramatic. Just… restless. I toss and turn. I think about the day. About the… failings of my students. About the state of the world, frankly. It’s not a deep sleep, shall we say. I wake up feeling…unrefreshed. As if I haven’t slept at all. Is that precise enough for you? I’d rather not spend the entire afternoon recounting my nocturnal tribulations.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very disruptive. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Good heavens, no. I maintain a perfectly reasonable physique. Though, admittedly, my appetite has been… diminished. I simply don’t have the desire to eat. All this… stress, you see. It robs one of their enjoyment. And frankly, the cafeteria food is appalling. I used to enjoy a good roast chicken, but now… the mere thought of it is unappetizing. Do we need to discuss my dietary habits at length? I assure you, it's not a matter of…overindulgence.
DOCTOR: Thank you. It sounds like you're experiencing several symptoms that could be related to stress and burnout. Have you felt any feelings of hopelessness or sadness recently, beyond the frustration you've already mentioned?
PATIENT: Hopelessness? Sadness? Young man, I am a scholar! I deal with facts, with logic, with the accumulated wisdom of centuries! I do not indulge in… sentimentality. Of course I am disappointed in the direction things are going. Of course I lament the decline of standards. But that is a matter of intellectual conviction, not… emotional distress. Are you suggesting I am somehow… weak? Because frankly, I find that quite insulting. I’d like to wrap this up, if you don’t mind. I have a very important crossword puzzle awaiting my attention.
DOCTOR: Please, allow me to apologize if my questions came across as insensitive, Mr. Schlatterer. That was not my intention at all. I was simply trying to get a complete picture of how you’re feeling. Given what you’ve described – fatigue, decreased appetite, restless sleep, and a great deal of stress – it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of depression, which is often linked to stressful life events. However, I want to be clear: I'm not making a diagnosis. Would you be open to me asking a few more questions, just to help me rule out other possibilities and see what might be going on?
PATIENT: Very well. But make it quick. And please, refrain from asking me about my… “feelings”. I’m a scholar, not a… patient. Just get on with it. I have limited patience for these… inquiries. And if you suggest I take up meditation, I shall walk out immediately.
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Schlatterer. I will keep the questions concise and focused. Have you been experiencing any difficulty concentrating, or remembering things lately?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it. Yes. Occasionally. A slight… fogginess. Nothing debilitating, mind you. But I do find myself… misplacing things. Forgetting names. It’s frustrating, naturally. A scholar relies on his memory, you see. It’s… disconcerting. Although, it could simply be… age. I am, after all, not getting any younger. Don’t make too much of it. I assure you, my intellect remains perfectly sharp. Just… occasionally a little…slow. Is that satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Thank you. And have you noticed any changes in your energy levels throughout the day?
PATIENT: Energy levels? They’re…depleted. Utterly depleted. As I mentioned, the fatigue is… constant. I used to have the stamina to work for hours, to delve into research, to engage in intellectual pursuits. Now, I find myself…exhausted after a single lecture. It’s…disheartening. Frankly, it’s appalling. The whole situation is…a decline, you see? A rather steep decline. Are we finished yet? I truly must get back to my crossword puzzle. It’s a fiendishly difficult one today.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schlatterer. I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. Based on what you've described—fatigue, decreased appetite, restless sleep, difficulty with concentration and memory, and feelings of frustration and disappointment—it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of burnout and possibly depression. However, I want to be clear—I can't make a definitive diagnosis without doing a more thorough evaluation. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? Good heavens, no. I assure you, there’s nothing physically wrong with me. It’s a matter of… mental exhaustion. Intellectual fatigue. The sheer weight of dealing with… mediocrity. Honestly, the thought of subjecting myself to needles and laboratories is… distressing. I fail to see what good it will accomplish. I’m a scholar, not a…guinea pig. If you insist on poking and prodding, I shall simply leave. I have no desire to waste my time on… unnecessary procedures. I came here for advice, not a medical examination. Are you quite finished? I believe I’ve endured enough questioning for one afternoon. .
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Schlatterer. I respect your decision. Given your strong aversion to blood work, and based on our conversation, I believe a reasonable approach would be to consider a referral to a therapist or counselor specializing in burnout and stress management. They could provide you with strategies to cope with the challenges you’re facing, and explore coping mechanisms. Would you be open to me providing you with some referrals?
