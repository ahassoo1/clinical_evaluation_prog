DOCTOR: Hi Lindsey, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I got a letter... said my cholesterol was a little high. The nurse, a lovely girl, told me to come in and talk about it. I don’t really know what that means, to be honest. I’ve always been pretty healthy, you know? Just a bit of a worry now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It is good you came in to discuss it. High cholesterol is something we can definitely manage. So, just to clarify, this was from some recent blood work?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It was at the community center, they do free check-ups sometimes. Just a routine thing, really. I didn't think much of it at the time, but then the letter came… I don't usually bother doctors much, if I can help it. Old Swedish ways, you know. Tough it out. But my daughter, bless her heart, she said I had to come see someone. She's a sensible girl.
DOCTOR: That’s good of her to encourage you to come in. It's always best to be proactive, and it sounds like she's looking out for you. Okay, so the results show your total cholesterol is a little elevated. Do you know what your numbers were, or do you recall the nurse mentioning them at all?
PATIENT: No, not a single number. She just said it was “high enough” to warrant a visit. I'm terrible with numbers, always have been. My wife, God rest her soul, she did all the bookkeeping. I remember she used to say something about "good" and "bad" cholesterol, but I never really understood the difference. It all sounded like a lot of complicated science. Honestly, I just want to know if it’s something I need to worry about, and if so, what can I do about it?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It can be confusing. There is "good" cholesterol, called HDL, and "bad" cholesterol, called LDL. LDL is the one we typically want to keep lower, as it can build up in your arteries. HDL helps remove cholesterol from the arteries. Do you have any family history of heart problems or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father… he had some chest pains later in life, but they just said it was indigestion, mostly. He smoked a lot, you know. Terrible habit. And his brother, my Uncle Sven, he had a stroke, but that was when he was quite old, I think. I don't think anyone ever specifically talked about cholesterol, not back then. Things were different. We ate a lot of butter and cream, though! That Swedish cooking... wonderful, but maybe not so good for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And you mentioned you eat a fairly traditional Swedish diet. Besides diet, do you get much exercise?
PATIENT: Not as much as I used to. I used to be a carpenter, very active work, climbing ladders and all that. But I retired ten years ago, and… well, it’s hard to keep up with things when you get older, you know? I walk to the store sometimes, but that's about it. Mostly I like to sit and read. Used to enjoy gardening, but my knees aren't what they used to be. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle, I suppose. The less I move, the harder it gets to move!
DOCTOR: I understand. It is easy to get less active as we get older. Okay, so let's talk about some things we can do. We’ll start with some lifestyle changes. Given your diet, we could focus on incorporating more fiber-rich foods, like fruits and vegetables, and perhaps reducing saturated fats. And even a little bit of regular exercise can make a big difference. Before we jump to medication, let’s see if we can get things under control with these changes. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. No need for fancy pills if I can help it! I can certainly try to eat more fruits and vegetables. My daughter has a garden, she’d be happy to share. And I can take a little walk every day. I’m not promising a marathon, mind you, but a stroll around the block I think I can manage. It's good to know there's something I can do, instead of just relying on a doctor's fix. Do you have any handouts or suggestions on what kind of fruits and vegetables are best? I get confused about all that sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. It's great to hear you’re motivated. Here's a handout with some good information on heart-healthy eating. It lists foods high in fiber and low in saturated fats, and it has some tips on incorporating more exercise into your daily routine. We can also talk about some resources for finding walking groups in the area, if you'd be interested. Now, to get a baseline, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Walking groups… that’s a good idea, actually. It might be nice to walk with other people. Keeps you motivated, you know? And a quick check-up is no trouble at all. Go right ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/86. It's not drastically high, but it’s something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your lungs sound clear. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. To get a more complete picture, I’d also like to order a full lipid panel, which will give us a detailed breakdown of your cholesterol levels, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If you want to check everything, I'm happy to. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I don't mind a few tests if it helps us figure things out. And how long will those tests take to come back? I have a book club meeting next week, I’d hate to miss it. It’s a rather gripping mystery, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. The results should be back within a week, hopefully before your book club meeting. I'll have the nurse call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, let's focus on making some small changes to your diet and activity level. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to discuss the results and see how you’re doing. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A month sounds perfect. That gives me plenty of time to work on things. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better now, knowing what’s going on and what I can do about it. You've been a great help, Doctor. I suppose there’s nothing more for me to do today but walk around the block a few times.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindsey. I'm glad I could help. Alright, so we'll have the nurse schedule that follow-up appointment for a month from today. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you again. Have a good day, and enjoy your book club meeting! .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor Amussen. I certainly will. And I’ll try to keep myself busy with walking and healthy eating! Thank you again for everything. Goodbye now! .
