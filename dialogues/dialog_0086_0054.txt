DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Tati, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Rayshon. Just Rayshon is okay. I think… it's been a long time since I saw a doctor, honestly.
DOCTOR: Well, that's… unfortunate. But we'll get through it. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh… cough. I cough a lot. And… I get tired. Really tired. And my nose… always blocked, feels like. It happens a lot, especially… I dunno, a long time now. Maybe a year? Hard to say. It just… keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: A year, you say. And this cough… is it productive?
PATIENT: Productive? What does that… mean? Like, does it help me get stuff done? Sorry, I’m not good with… doctor words. But yeah, I cough stuff up. Lots of stuff. Green sometimes, yellow sometimes. Always gotta spit it out. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I meant. “Productive” means you're bringing something up when you cough. Green or yellow mucus suggests… something. And this fatigue… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. But mostly comes. Like… I work, you know? Tire shop. Heavy work. But even after sleep, I feel… heavy. Like I didn't sleep at all. It's… hard to explain. And sometimes, the nose… it hurts, you know? Like pressure. Right here. Especially when it rains.
DOCTOR: A tire shop. Right. And this pressure in your sinuses… do you have any fever, chills, or body aches with this?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes. Not high, I think. Just feel warm. And… maybe aches? Hard to tell. I work with my body all day, so I'm always a little achey. Like old man aches, you know? But the nose… it's bad when the weather changes. Makes it hard to breathe. My wife keeps telling me to come see someone. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Your wife is… perceptive. Alright. Let’s do a quick exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. Whatever you need. I just… hope it’s not too bad. I need to work, you know? Got bills to pay.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's get started. Please, have a seat. I'll need to listen to your lungs and check your sinuses. And I'm going to take your temperature and blood pressure. Please remove your shirt.
PATIENT: Remove my shirt? Uh… why? Is it… cold in here? I just want to know. I never… had a doctor ask me to do that before.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, I need to listen to your lungs, and assess your general physical condition. That requires me to listen to your back and chest. It's a standard procedure. Unless you prefer I simply guess what's going on, please remove your shirt. I assure you, I've seen… everything.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay, okay. Sorry. I just… get nervous. It's just… haven't been to a doctor in a long time, like you said. Just let me know when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath. Another one. And another. … Interesting. Tenderness here, and here. Blood pressure is a little elevated, temperature is normal. Alright. Well, Mr. Tati, it seems you have some congestion in your lungs and sinuses. Your blood pressure is a little high, but that could be due to stress. Have you ever been diagnosed with hypertension before?
PATIENT: Hypertension? No. Never. I just… work hard. Long hours. My wife makes me herbal tea. That helps a little. But the cough… it keeps coming back. Is it… serious? Will I need… medicine? A lot of medicine? I can't really afford a lot.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Tati, it's not an emergency, but it's certainly not something to ignore. It could be a simple upper respiratory infection, or allergies, but given the duration and your symptoms, we need to rule out a few other possibilities. I'm concerned about potential sinusitis, and your elevated blood pressure warrants further investigation. I'm going to order a chest X-ray to check for any underlying infection, and a complete blood count. We’ll also need a urine sample. As for your blood pressure, I’ll recommend some lifestyle changes, but we may need to consider medication if it doesn't improve. I'll give you a requisition form for the lab and X-ray. Can you get those done tomorrow?
PATIENT: Tomorrow… Yeah, I think so. The lab… is it far? And the X-ray… is that expensive? I got some money, but not a lot. My wife… she works too. We try. Will it cost a lot? I really need to know. And… what if it’s something bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, I understand your concerns, but I cannot provide a precise cost estimate. Lab and X-ray prices vary. However, I can write a note explaining your lack of insurance; some facilities offer discounts. Here. This is a letter you can present at the lab and X-ray facility. As for "something bad," let’s not jump to conclusions. We need to see the results first. I'm concerned about possible pneumonia or chronic bronchitis, but these are just possibilities. We will know more after the tests. In the meantime, I’m prescribing you an expectorant to help loosen the mucus and a nasal saline spray. Follow the directions carefully. And Mr. Tati, I strongly advise you to quit smoking if you smoke. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Smoking? I don't smoke! Never have. My wife… she wouldn’t let me. I just… work hard. Dusty work. A lot of dust. So… X-ray, lab, spray, medicine… and don’t smoke. Okay. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s not too bad. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Do try to schedule those tests promptly, Mr. Tati. And do get some rest. .
