DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Bartock. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. You’ve come to see me – what seems to be the problem?
PATIENT: Well, it’s rather obvious, isn’t it? This… discoloration. It's on my hands, mostly. And it’s not a pleasant sight, I assure you. It just… appeared. It's quite distressing, really.
DOCTOR: “Obvious” is a rather subjective term, Ms. Bartock. Many conditions present with discoloration. When did this “appearance,” as you call it, occur?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. About… three weeks ago, I suppose. It started as just a faint… unevenness, and then it got progressively worse. I noticed it first after I’d been gardening, but I use gloves! Proper gardening gloves, you understand. Not those flimsy things. It’s quite baffling, really. I haven’t changed anything in my routine.
DOCTOR: Gardening gloves… right. And you say it’s progressively worsening. Can you describe the discoloration, precisely?
PATIENT: Precisely? Hmm. It's… brownish, I would say. Not a nice, even tan, mind you. More like… blotchy. And in some places, almost a greyish hue. It's mostly on the backs of my hands, but it's creeping onto my fingers now. It doesn't itch, thankfully. Though it's quite unsightly. Really ruins a perfectly good manicure.
DOCTOR: “Unsightly” is noted, Ms. Bartock. Let's move past the aesthetics, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, really? I should think my concerns about appearance are perfectly valid! Honestly, some doctors have no sensitivity. But fine. No, it doesn't hurt, and it hasn't changed texture, if that’s what you're getting at. Just… color. A very unwelcome color, I might add. And it's not contagious, is it? I wouldn't want to give anything to my husband.
DOCTOR: Of course it's not contagious. I didn't suggest that. Let's focus on relevant details. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Well… I try to avoid lilies, they give me a terrible headache, but I wouldn’t call it a proper allergy. And I’m rather sensitive to cheap perfume. But nothing… life-threatening, you understand. Nothing I require an EpiPen for. I've always been quite robust, health-wise. My husband says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Medications?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, daily. My doctor prescribed it years ago, for… well, it was a preventative measure. And a multivitamin, of course. I try to be sensible. Nothing else. Absolutely nothing else. I prefer natural remedies when possible. Though frankly, this discoloration is beyond what a bit of chamomile tea can fix.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, finally. I was beginning to think you weren’t going to actually examine me. Honestly, some doctors just like to talk… and type. There you are. Go ahead. Be gentle, though. I have a luncheon tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see the discoloration. Uneven pigmentation, as you described. Brownish-grey hue, mostly dorsally. No obvious lesions, no edema. Capillary refill appears normal. Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? No, not really. My husband does most of the cooking, and he's very particular about his recipes. We eat a balanced diet, you know. Lots of fresh vegetables, lean protein… the usual. Perhaps he's been using a new brand of paprika? That’s the only thing I can think of. He does experiment sometimes. Though I always taste-test, and it seems perfectly normal to me. Honestly, it's probably nothing. Just a strange… fluke.
DOCTOR: "Probably nothing" is not a diagnosis, Ms. Bartock. We need to rule out potential causes. Have you been exposed to any new chemicals or cleaning products?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re asking sensible questions! Well… yes, actually. I did try a new hand cream last month. It was lavender scented, from that fancy organic shop downtown. I thought it might help with my dryness, but it smelled a bit… off, now that I think about it. A bit metallic, perhaps. I stopped using it after a few days, when I noticed a slight rash, but that cleared up quickly. This discoloration started weeks later, so I didn’t associate the two. Honestly, I doubt it's related. It’s probably just… one of those things.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, while a rash clearing does not definitively exclude a connection, your description is… concerning. This could be a form of contact dermatitis exacerbated by photosensitivity. However, to be certain, I need to order some blood work. A complete blood count, liver function tests, and a TSH level. Also, I recommend a dermatology consult. I can write a referral. Now, do you have any further questions, or shall we proceed with the lab requisition?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work? A dermatology consult? Honestly, all this fuss over a bit of discoloration! It seems rather… excessive. But fine. If you insist. A complete blood count… I suppose it can't hurt. And a referral, yes, please. Though I highly doubt a dermatologist will be able to offer anything more than a fancy hand cream. And the TSH level? What on earth for? My energy levels are perfectly fine. Very well, proceed with your tests. But I expect a quick turnaround. I have a luncheon tomorrow, you know.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 48-72 hours. The dermatology appointment may take longer to schedule. I will have my assistant contact you regarding the results. In the meantime, avoid direct sunlight and any potential irritants. And please, refrain from self-treating.
