DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Yes, well, I suppose I'm here about… this discoloration. It's quite bothersome, and frankly, a bit alarming. I feel… tired, constantly. It's all rather inconvenient, you understand. I haven't much time for these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Discoloration and fatigue can certainly be concerning. Let's talk about both of those things. When did you first notice the discoloration?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I can’t quite recall the precise date. Some weeks ago, I should imagine. Everything blurs together at my age. It's… on my skin, naturally. Everywhere, really, but more noticeable on my hands, I believe. It wasn't there before, that much I do know. And the tiredness… well, it’s always been a bit of a struggle, but it’s gotten worse lately. Is that sufficient? I haven't the energy for detailed recollections.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Drahota, we'll piece it together. “Some weeks ago” is a good starting point. And it's helpful to know it's more noticeable on your hands. Is the discoloration a particular color – red, brown, yellow, or something else?
PATIENT: Color? Goodness. It's… darker, I suppose. A sort of… muddy tone. Not bright, certainly. Not a pleasant color at all. It’s a discoloration, Doctor, not a fashion statement. I wouldn't know the precise shade if my life depended on it. Honestly, I’ve better things to occupy my mind than the nuances of skin tone.
DOCTOR: Of course, you do. “Darker” is helpful. And you mentioned it's gotten worse lately. Can you describe what “worse” means?
PATIENT: Worse means… more pronounced, naturally. More visible. I find myself avoiding sunlight, and even then… it’s quite noticeable. People stare, you know. It’s… undignified. And the fatigue is accompanying it. I used to be able to work a full day, reinforcing iron, you understand. Now… I'm lucky to get through half of it. It's simply… debilitating. Are we nearing the end of this questioning? I have a schedule, Doctor.
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Mr. Drahota. Just a few more questions to get a clearer picture. You mentioned reinforcing iron – do you still do that work?
PATIENT: Do I still do it? Of course, I do. What else would I be doing? Though, as I mentioned, it's becoming increasingly difficult. The fatigue, you see. And this…condition. It slows me down. I'm not as…efficient as I once was. I’ve been doing this work for… well, decades. It’s a respectable profession. Not that you would know anything about it, I presume.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that you're still able to do the work, even with the fatigue and discoloration. Has anything else changed recently besides the fatigue and skin discoloration?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. My appetite… isn’t what it used to be. I don’t have the same… enthusiasm for food. And I’ve been…rather irritable, I suppose. My wife has noticed. She says I’m more… difficult to please. It’s probably just old age, naturally. And… no, I can't think of anything else. Really, I'm not one for dwelling on such matters. I prefer to focus on practical things. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Drahota. Reduced appetite and irritability are good things to know. Now, just to cover some basics, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Goodness no. I'm a robust man, Doctor, despite my age. A minor cough perhaps, a sniffle here and there. Nothing serious. I don't have time for illnesses, you understand. I've always been careful to avoid getting sick. I wouldn't bother you with such trivialities. Are we finally nearing a conclusion? I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No, absolutely not. I don’t believe in all those… potions and pills. My body is perfectly capable of functioning on its own. I eat a sensible diet, get enough rest—when I can rest, that is—and that’s all the medication I need. My wife occasionally tries to get me to take something for my… joints, but I refuse. I prefer to suffer in silence, naturally. Is that satisfactory? I find this line of questioning rather intrusive, frankly.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Drahota. No medications at all. And you don’t have any allergies to anything—food, medications, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I’ve lived a long life. I’ve eaten all sorts of things, been exposed to all sorts of environments. I’m not allergic to anything. I’m a robust man, as I’ve already stated. Really, this is quite unnecessary. Are we finished? I have commitments. I don't have all day to answer these… frivolous questions. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
