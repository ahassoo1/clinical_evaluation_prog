DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, that’s all. I’d rather just get it over with if we could.
DOCTOR: I understand. A life insurance physical, alright. While it’s good you're being proactive, these examinations are still important for your overall health assessment. We won't simply rush through it. To begin, can you tell me a bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Look, I’m okay, I guess. I work, I sleep, I eat… you know. Nothing fancy. Divorced a few years back, keeps me busy with the kids, but… generally fine. Is there a form I can fill out instead? This feels like a lot of questions already.
DOCTOR: While a form is available, a direct conversation allows me to better understand your specific circumstances and potential risk factors. It’s rather inefficient to rely solely on written responses, don't you agree?
PATIENT: Look, I just… I don't really have any risk factors. I'm Marshallese, if that matters. We just… are. My mom lived to be 85, dad… not so much, but he smoked. A lot. Can we just… do the tests? I got things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, we will proceed with the tests. However, it's crucial to gather a basic medical history first, for documentation purposes and to ensure a comprehensive assessment. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Putney. Let’s start with your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Nothing regular. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back, when it acts up from work. But that's it. And sometimes a multivitamin, but I forget half the time. Mostly, no. Medicare covers what I need, so I don't go messing around with a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. We eat a lot of fish back home, and… well, everything. Never been hospitalized for allergies, if that helps. I'm pretty tough.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical? Hmm. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. Got the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox, you know. Nothing serious. Never been diagnosed with anything long-term. Back’s been bothering me lately, like I said. Mostly just aches. Nothing a little ibuprofen can’t handle. Is that what you’re looking for? Long list of stuff I don’t have?
DOCTOR: I'm attempting to establish a complete picture of your health, Mr. Putney. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or any other chronic condition?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I told you, no. Never. I work hard, I eat… well, mostly okay. My mom was healthy, I’m fairly certain. I don't go to the doctor unless I have to. This insurance thing is the first time in… I don't know, years. Can we please just get this over with? I’m starting to feel like I’m wasting my time. And yours.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with the physical examination. Please step onto the scale. I'll need your height and weight to start, then we’ll check your vital signs. After that, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs and perform a basic neurological assessment. This will take approximately fifteen minutes.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry, okay?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148 over 92. 150 over 94. Slightly elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Respiration is 16. Now, please sit back and I will listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but I detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but I note some mild wheezing upon exhalation.
PATIENT: Murmur? Wheezing? What does that mean? I told you I was fine. Is this going to mess up my insurance? I need this. This is important. What's wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, a murmur simply means there's an extra sound during your heartbeat. It doesn't automatically indicate a problem, but it warrants further investigation. The mild wheezing could be due to a variety of factors, such as a recent cold or allergies, but it also requires assessment. I am not saying you are not fine, but these findings necessitate further workup to determine the underlying cause. We will need to order some blood tests, an EKG, and potentially a chest X-ray. To be thorough, I would also recommend a consultation with a cardiologist. This doesn't necessarily mean you have a serious heart condition, but it's best to be cautious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Wait… a cardiologist? X-rays? Blood tests? This is just for life insurance! I just need them to say I’m healthy enough to get the policy! This is ridiculous. You're trying to scare me, aren't you? Is this going to cost me a fortune? I’m on Medicare! I think I want a second opinion. This feels… wrong. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I understand your concerns. However, my primary responsibility is to your health and well-being. Dismissing these findings solely to obtain insurance would be irresponsible and potentially detrimental to your long-term health. You are entitled to a second opinion, of course. I can provide you with a list of cardiologists in the area. However, please understand that these recommendations are based on my professional assessment of your condition, and delaying further investigation could have consequences. If you change your mind, please do not hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment. .
