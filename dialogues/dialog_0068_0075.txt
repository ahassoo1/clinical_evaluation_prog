DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this tiredness during the day. Even though I’m using my CPAP machine every night, I still feel sleepy. It’s… frustrating, to be honest. I thought that machine was supposed to fix everything!
DOCTOR: Yes, the CPAP should help significantly… It’s good you're using it consistently. Frustrating is a good word. Okay. So, this tiredness… how long has this been going on, even with the CPAP?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been using the machine for, oh, about six months now, maybe a little more. And the tiredness… it started pretty soon after I got the machine, actually. Maybe a week or two. It hasn’t gotten much better, to be honest. It’s not terrible, but it’s enough to make me want to take a little nap in the afternoon, which I try not to do, but sometimes I just can’t help it. I used to be a very active man, you see. Still am, mostly, but this sleepiness… it slows me down.
DOCTOR: Six months… and it hasn't improved. Okay. And just to clarify, Mr. Paske, when you say “tiredness,” is it more like feeling physically weak, or more like… difficulty staying awake, a constant drowsiness?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. It’s not really weakness, not exactly. It’s… wanting to close my eyes. Like a heavy feeling in my eyelids. And just… a struggle to stay focused, especially if I’m sitting quietly. If I’m busy, doing something, I’m alright. But if I’m reading, or watching television… that's when it hits me. It’s not all the time, mind you, but it’s often enough to be a bother. It’s like… my body just wants to switch off. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Drowsiness, especially with quiet activity. And it doesn't seem to be improving with the CPAP. Okay. Before we go further, let’s just quickly review some other things. Do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, nothing major. And my doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high, but it’s usually okay. I take a small pill for that, once a day. Other than that… not much, thankfully. I try to stay healthy. I eat a good diet, mostly. And I walk every day, when the weather is nice. I used to be a smoker, years ago, but I quit. A long time ago! I'm on Medicare, if that's important.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, hypertension controlled with medication, past smoking… Okay. And just to be sure, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the pill for my blood pressure, Doctor. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And… occasionally, I take an over-the-counter pain reliever for my knees, if they’re really bothering me. Ibuprofen, usually. Nothing else, really. I don't believe in taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it. My mother always said, "Too much medicine is worse than the illness!" She was a wise woman.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, occasional ibuprofen… Alright. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to love peanuts, but my wife… well, my ex-wife, she was very careful. She made sure I didn’t eat too many, said they weren’t good for me. But it wasn’t an allergy, just… a precaution. So, no, I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten everything under the sun, more or less. Though, I try to avoid shellfish these days… just doesn’t sit well with my stomach. But it's not an allergy, just… digestion.
DOCTOR: No known allergies… just a sensitivity to shellfish. Okay. Now, one last thing about your history… any family history of sleep problems, like sleep apnea, or other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My father… he snored like a freight train, if that counts. He always said it was just his constitution. But I don’t know if he had sleep apnea, they didn’t really diagnose things like that back then. My mother… she was healthy as a horse, never had any problems. And my brother… he has diabetes, but nothing with sleep, as far as I know. I haven't really asked, to be honest. We don’t see each other very often. So, not really, I guess. No strong family history of sleep problems. Just my father’s snoring!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. Thank you for that information. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just do a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I’m happy to help in any way I can to figure out what’s going on. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? This tiredness… it’s getting me down. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please, have a seat here. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Blood pressure is 142/88… a little elevated, but not significantly. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Balance appears stable. Everything appears normal so far, physically. However, given your continued tiredness despite CPAP use, and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order some blood work. It’ll help us rule out any underlying causes, like anemia, thyroid problems, or vitamin deficiencies. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it helps figure things out, then absolutely. I don’t mind a bit of blood work. I used to donate blood regularly, when I was younger. So, it doesn’t bother me at all. Anemia… thyroid… I don’t really know much about those things, but if that’s what you think is best, then go ahead. Just tell me what I need to do. And, perhaps, could you explain what these tests are looking for, just so I have a better understanding?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll check a complete blood count - that looks for anemia and other blood disorders. We’ll also check your thyroid stimulating hormone to rule out thyroid problems. And a basic metabolic panel, which checks your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. We’ll also check your Vitamin D level, as a deficiency can cause fatigue. These tests will give us a good baseline understanding of your overall health. It’s a relatively simple blood draw, and the results should be back within a few days. In the meantime, continue using your CPAP as prescribed. And I would suggest keeping a sleep diary, noting the times you go to bed, wake up, and any periods of wakefulness during the night. That information might be helpful when we discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. Complete blood count, thyroid, Vitamin D… I’ll try my best to remember all of that! And a sleep diary… yes, I can do that. I used to keep a journal, years ago, when I was traveling. So, I’m familiar with the idea. I’ll write down the times and… well, anything that seems important. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things so clearly. I feel a little better already, just knowing we’re looking into it. When should I expect to hear back about the results? And is there anything special I need to do to prepare for the blood draw? Like, should I fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Good. Yes, for the basic metabolic panel, we’ll need you to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. So, no food or drinks after midnight tonight, except for water. The rest of the tests don’t require fasting. As for the results, the lab usually takes 2-3 business days to get them back to us. I’ll have my nurse contact you by phone to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. In the meantime, if your tiredness worsens, or you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, Doctor. Fast for 8-12 hours… no food after midnight… I can manage that. And they’ll call me to schedule a follow-up appointment when the results are in. I appreciate you being so thorough and explaining everything so well. I’m much more reassured now. I’ll keep a close eye on my symptoms and call if anything changes. I think that’s everything for now, isn't it? I don't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, you haven't taken up any time at all, Mr. Paske. That’s what I’m here for. Before you go, I’m going to print out a summary of our discussion and the instructions for the blood draw. And I’ll also give you a form for a sleep diary. Here you are. Please, take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. I look forward to discussing the results with you. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your time and attention. I will follow your instructions and I’ll be sure to call if anything comes up. Have a good day to you as well. .
