DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you kindly, Doctor. Well, I’m planning a wee cruise, you see. A nice one, to the Mediterranean. And the cruise line, they’ve asked for some information… medical information, like. Just to be sure I'm fit to travel, they said. I don’t mind a bit, but I haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time, and I was hoping you could help me get everything sorted.
DOCTOR: Right, a cruise. Well, it’s good you’re being proactive. It's always best to be prepared. So, just to clarify, the cruise line requires a basic medical assessment, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A basic assessment, they called it. They sent me a form, a rather long form, actually. It asks about… well, everything, it seems! Past illnesses, operations, allergies… things I haven’t thought about in years, to be honest. I was hoping you could help me fill it out, or at least tell me what information you would need from me. I haven’t a clue where to start with some of it.
DOCTOR: A long form, you say. Cruise lines… always something. Alright. Let’s start with the basics then. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, chronic… that means long-term, doesn’t it? Let me think… Well, my Arthur, my late husband, he always said I had a touch of… well, he called it a “sensitive constitution”. He meant I caught colds easy. But I wouldn’t call that a condition, exactly. The doctor back home, years ago, said my blood pressure was a little high once, but it came down with a change of diet, he said. Nothing serious, mind you. Not like needing pills every day or anything like that. Does that count?
DOCTOR: “Sensitive constitution”...Right. And the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, it was years ago, Doctor, must have been… nineteen ninety-seven, I think. He had me watch my salt intake, and it came right down. I’ve not had it checked since, to be truthful. I felt perfectly fine, so I just… well, I just didn't bother going back. I've always been a healthy eater, you see, mostly vegetables and fish. Very little red meat. I always believed in looking after myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Yes, I had my tonsils out when I was a wee girl, maybe eight years old. And… oh, goodness, Arthur had a bad fall once, and I spent a lot of time in the hospital visiting him, but that wasn't me being ill, was it? As for me… I had a nasty bout of appendicitis when I was twenty-two, I think it was, but it was a long time ago. They removed it, of course, and I recovered perfectly well. No trouble since. I think that’s everything, Doctor. Not much to tell, really. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Now that's a tricky one. I don’t believe I have any serious allergies, like needing an injection if I eat something. But I do get a bit of a sniffle sometimes when the pollen is high in the springtime. And I always found cats made me sneeze. But it’s just a bit of irritation, nothing life-threatening, you understand. I’ve never bothered with antihistamines or anything like that. Just a bit of a tissue handy, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, nothing at all. I don’t believe in relying on pills if I can avoid it. A good night’s sleep and a sensible diet, that’s what I always say. I might take a paracetamol now and again for a headache, but that’s the extent of it. And sometimes, when my joints feel a bit stiff in the winter, I take a spoonful of cod liver oil. Just for the Vitamin D, you see. My mother always swore by it. But that’s all, truly. No regular medications, not a one.
DOCTOR: Cod liver oil, you say. Alright. Now, before we continue with the form, I'd like to get a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. It’ll be nothing extensive, just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look in your ears and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, of course. That sounds perfectly sensible. I wouldn't want to take up your time unduly, though. I'm quite sure I'm as fit as a fiddle, but I understand you have to be thorough. A listen to the heart and lungs, you say? Yes, go right ahead. I haven't had that done in years, so it'll be good to know everything is ticking away nicely. Where would you like me to… sit, or lie down, or…?
DOCTOR: If you’d please just have a seat on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Now, try to relax. 148 over 92… A little elevated. Heart sounds…regular, but a bit fast. Murmur…slight, but present. Lungs…clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Ears…normal. Throat…slightly inflamed, but no obvious signs of infection. Alright. Everything seems… acceptable. However, your blood pressure is a bit high, and I’m hearing a slight murmur. I think we should run some blood tests just to get a clearer picture. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A bit high, you say? And a murmur? I hadn't realised. I feel perfectly well, Doctor, truly. But if you think it's best to run some tests, then I suppose we should. I always trust your judgment. What sort of tests are we talking about? And will they be… painful? I don't have a fondness for needles, if I'm honest. I suppose a bit of discomfort is worth it if it puts my mind at ease, but it's always best to know what I’m letting myself in for. Is it a lot of blood, or just a wee prick?
DOCTOR: No, it won't be a lot of blood, just a standard blood draw. We’ll check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and a complete blood count. And an EKG, just to get a better look at your heart rhythm. It's a quick, painless test where we stick some patches on your chest. An EKG will help us understand the murmur better. We'll also order a urinalysis, just to rule out any underlying issues. It's a standard procedure, really. Nothing to be alarmed about. It's just a precaution, given your blood pressure reading and the murmur. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially with a cruise planned. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that sounds… thorough, doesn't it? A cholesterol test, and kidney function… My mother always said I worried too much about my health! But I suppose you're right, Doctor. Better safe than sorry, as you say, especially with the cruise looming. I wouldn’t want anything to spoil that. An EKG… patches on my chest, you said? That doesn't sound too dreadful. Yes, all right. You can go ahead with all the tests. A bit of discomfort is a small price to pay for peace of mind. And, if you happen to notice anything… anything at all, please do tell me. I’d rather know the truth, even if it’s not what I want to hear. And how long will it take to get the results? I'm hoping it won’t be too long. The cruise departs on the fifteenth of August, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab is quite efficient; results usually take between three to five business days. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and set up the EKG now. We should have everything completed within the hour. While we're waiting for the results, it would be best if you avoid strenuous activity, and monitor your blood pressure at home if you have a cuff available. Otherwise, just try to relax and maintain a sensible diet. And, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It's better to be overly cautious in these situations. Nurse Davies, could you please come in and draw some blood for Ms. Squiers and set up an EKG?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. I'll be very careful. I haven't a blood pressure cuff, I'm afraid. We never bothered with such things at home. I suppose I should have been more attentive. And I will certainly be careful not to overexert myself. No strenuous activity, you say? That's easily done. I'm not much of a runner, anyway. I prefer a gentle stroll, and a nice cup of tea afterwards. Chest pain… yes, I'll certainly keep an eye out for that. And shortness of breath. It's good to know what to look for. I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. It does put my mind at ease, even if it's a bit worrisome. Tell me, is there anything I should be asking you? I feel as though I’ve been rather passive, just answering your questions. Is there anything else I should be telling you about my health, or my lifestyle? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Well, given your age, and the elevated blood pressure, it would be prudent to discuss your family history of heart disease, stroke, or diabetes. Have any of your close relatives been diagnosed with these conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, family history… That's a tricky one. My mother… she lived to a good old age, ninety-two, she did. But she was always a bit secretive about her health. She never talked much about doctors or hospitals. She swore by herbal remedies and a good night's sleep. My father… he died young, sixty-three, it was. But it was a heart attack, I believe. Very sudden, they said. He was a heavy smoker, you see. A pipe smoker, always. And he was fond of a good dram of whisky, too. My brother… he's still alive, thank goodness. But he’s not in the best of health, I’m afraid. He has… well, he calls it “the sugar”. Diabetes, I think it is. He's always complaining about his feet. So, yes, there’s a bit of a history, I suppose. Not a terribly good one, when you come to think of it. Should I have mentioned that earlier? I'm so sorry I didn't. It's just… it never seemed terribly important at the time.
DOCTOR: It is, in fact, quite important. A family history of heart disease and diabetes significantly increases your risk. And given your brother's diagnosis and your father’s early death, it’s even more crucial that we get a handle on your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. It’s good you’ve mentioned it now. Do you have any idea of your father's cholesterol levels?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. No idea at all, Doctor. They didn’t bother with such things back in those days, I don’t believe. He never went to the doctor unless he absolutely had to. He was a bit of a stubborn soul, you see. He thought a good walk and a hearty meal were all anyone needed. And perhaps a wee dram of whisky to settle the stomach. I always thought I was healthier than him, though. I eat a sensible diet, mostly vegetables and fish. And I don't smoke. Never have. So, I always felt… well, a bit insulated, I suppose. From all that. But if you think I'm at risk, given my brother and my father, then I suppose I should take it more seriously. What sort of things should I be doing? Besides the tests, of course. Is there a special diet I should be following? Or exercises I should be doing? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Given your family history, and the elevated blood pressure, a low-sodium, low-fat diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is essential. Regular moderate exercise – brisk walking, swimming, cycling – for at least thirty minutes most days of the week is also crucial. More importantly, you absolutely must stop ignoring your health. Regular check-ups are vital, even if you feel perfectly fine. And you should closely monitor your weight and blood pressure. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, perfectly. A low-sodium, low-fat diet… more fruits and vegetables, less salt and fat. And regular exercise… brisk walking, swimming, cycling. Thirty minutes most days. And regular check-ups, even if I feel well. And monitoring my weight and blood pressure. Yes, I understand. It's… a lot to take in, to be honest. I haven't been very good about looking after myself, have I? I suppose I always thought I was invincible. But you're right. I can’t ignore it any longer. I have to take it seriously. Is there… is there anything else I should be doing? Besides the diet and exercise and check-ups? Any supplements I should be taking? Or anything I should be avoiding? Anything at all? I want to do everything I can to stay healthy. Especially with the cruise looming. I don't want anything to spoil that. It’s been a dream of mine for years, you see. And I want to be able to enjoy it to the fullest.
DOCTOR: Given your age and health concerns, I would recommend a daily multivitamin and a Vitamin D supplement, especially during the winter months. And absolutely avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive alcohol consumption. You should also try to manage your stress levels – yoga, meditation, or simply spending time in nature can be beneficial. And, frankly, you need to start taking your health more seriously. It’s not just about enjoying a cruise. It’s about living a long, healthy life. Nurse Davies, are the blood tests and EKG set up for Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, thank you. A daily multivitamin and Vitamin D supplement… avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive alcohol. Manage my stress levels… yoga, meditation, spending time in nature. Yes, I understand. It’s a lot to take in, but I will try. I promise. I haven't always been very good about looking after myself, but I will do better. I will try. And thank you, Nurse, for setting up the tests. I appreciate it very much. I’m ready whenever you are. I suppose it’s time to get this all done and dusted. I hope it’s not too unpleasant. I’m not terribly fond of needles, you see. But I will try to be brave. For my health, and for my cruise. And for a long and happy life, as you say, Doctor. A long and happy life.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Nurse Davies, if you'll excuse us. Let's get started then. It'll be over before you know it. Proceed as usual, Nurse. And please let me know when the results are available. Please lie down on the examination table, Ms. Squiers. We’ll start with the EKG.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, of course. Thank you. Here we are. As comfortable as can be, I suppose. An EKG… it’s just the patches, you said? I hope they don’t stick too much. My skin is a bit sensitive, you see. Alright, go ahead, Doctor. Whenever you’re ready. I’ll try to lie still. And I’ll try not to think about anything too stressful. Perhaps I’ll think about the Mediterranean. That always cheers me up. The sunshine, and the sea… and the delicious food, of course. Yes, the Mediterranean will do nicely.
DOCTOR: Relax, Ms. Squiers. Just breathe normally. This won’t take long. Okay, that’s all of them. Now, I’m going to start the machine. It doesn’t hurt, it just records your heart’s electrical activity. Just lie still for a few moments. We need a clear reading.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, I’m perfectly still. Just breathing normally. Trying not to think about anything at all. Just the sunshine, and the sea… and the delicious food. It’s a bit chilly, isn’t it? A bit drafty in here. But I’m not complaining. I’m perfectly comfortable, as comfortable as can be. Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem to be frowning. Is there something wrong with the reading? I hope it’s not too bad. I do get a bit anxious sometimes, you see. Especially when it comes to my health. But I’m trying to be brave. For my cruise, and for a long and happy life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers. That’s all done. The EKG shows some… irregularities. Specifically, there’s evidence of atrial fibrillation. It means your heart isn’t beating in a regular rhythm. It’s not immediately life-threatening, but it does require further investigation. We’ll need to run some additional tests, and I’ll likely refer you to a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… atrial fibrillation? Irregular rhythm? A cardiologist? Goodness gracious. That doesn’t sound good at all, does it? A cardiologist… that sounds terribly serious. What… what does it mean? Is it… is it bad? Will I have to cancel my cruise? All my plans… I’ve been saving for years… Please, Doctor, tell me the truth. Is it… is it serious? And will I be able to go on my cruise? I need to know. I simply must know. It's all I have to look forward to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers, please try to remain calm. It's not an immediate emergency, but it does require attention. Atrial fibrillation can increase your risk of stroke, which is why we need to investigate it further. A cardiologist is a specialist in heart conditions. They will run some additional tests – an echocardiogram, possibly a stress test – to determine the underlying cause of the irregularity and recommend the appropriate treatment. Regarding your cruise… it’s too early to say definitively whether you’ll be able to go. It depends on the results of the tests and the cardiologist’s recommendation. We’ll need to get a clear picture of your heart health before making any decisions. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. We'll schedule an appointment with the cardiologist as soon as possible. And I'll write you a referral note. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Tests… a cardiologist… a referral note. Yes, alright. That sounds… sensible. Getting the tests done is a good idea. I suppose I can’t avoid it, can I? If it’s important for my health… But… will it be a long wait for the appointment? And what if the cardiologist says I can’t go on my cruise? All my plans… everything… Please, Doctor, do everything you can to help me. I really want to go on this cruise. It means the world to me. It's a dream come true. And I don't want anything to spoil it. Can you… can you speed things up? Any way at all? I'm willing to do anything. Anything at all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Squiers. And I will do everything I can to expedite the process. I’ll call the cardiologist’s office directly and see if they can fit you in sooner. I’ll also explain the urgency of the situation. However, I can't guarantee a specific timeframe, or influence the cardiologist’s recommendation. They will base their decision on the results of the tests and their professional judgment. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for a low-dose beta-blocker. It can help control your heart rate and reduce your symptoms. And I strongly advise against any strenuous activity until we have a clearer picture of your condition. Let’s focus on getting the tests done first. We’ll take it one step at a time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a beta-blocker… less strenuous activity… one step at a time. Yes, alright. That sounds… manageable. A beta-blocker… I suppose it’s better than nothing. And less strenuous activity… I can certainly do that. No more brisk walks, I suppose. But… will it affect my sleep? I’ve always been a light sleeper. And will it make me feel tired? I don't want to be exhausted on my cruise, if I'm able to go. Please, Doctor, tell me everything I need to know. What are the side effects? And what should I do if I experience them? I want to be prepared. I don't want any surprises. And I really, really want to go on this cruise. It's all I have to look forward to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers. The beta-blocker I’m prescribing – metoprolol – is generally well-tolerated. However, like all medications, it can have some side effects. Common side effects include fatigue, dizziness, and slow heartbeat. Some people also experience nausea, diarrhea, or constipation. It can sometimes cause sleep disturbances, but that’s not very common. If you experience any of these side effects, or if you feel unusually weak or lightheaded, stop taking the medication and contact me immediately. Do not drive or operate machinery if you feel dizzy or lightheaded. I’ll write a detailed information sheet along with the prescription. It will include all the potential side effects and precautions. And I’ll be available to answer any questions you may have. We’ll take it one step at a time, Ms. Squiers. Let's focus on getting the tests done and seeing what the cardiologist says. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. One step at a time. A detailed information sheet… available to answer questions. Yes, alright. That sounds… sensible. A detailed information sheet will be helpful. And I appreciate you being available to answer questions. I’m sure I’ll have plenty. But… what if the cardiologist says it’s too risky to travel? What if I have to cancel my cruise? What if all my dreams are shattered? I don’t know what I’ll do. I’ve been saving for years… It’s all I’ve ever wanted. Please, Doctor, do everything you can to help me. I’m begging you. I really, really want to go on this cruise. It means the world to me. It’s all I have left. Can you… can you just give me a little hope? Just a little bit of hope?
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, I understand your fears, and I truly sympathize with your situation. It's natural to be anxious when facing uncertainty, especially when it involves something you've dreamed about for so long. I cannot guarantee the cardiologist will clear you for travel. That decision will depend on their assessment of your heart health and the potential risks involved. However, I can assure you that I will do everything in my power to expedite the process and provide them with all the necessary information to make an informed decision. We'll run all the necessary tests, and I'll work with the cardiologist to develop a treatment plan that minimizes your risks and maximizes your chances of being able to enjoy your cruise. For now, let's focus on getting the tests scheduled and taking things one step at a time. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I believe in being optimistic, and I hope we can find a solution that allows you to fulfill your dream. Here. Take a deep breath. We'll get through this together. Now, let’s get these tests ordered. I’ll need your insurance information, although you mentioned you are not insured. We’ll need to discuss payment options.
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much. You've given me a little bit of hope, and that means the world to me. I… I'm not insured. I lost my insurance when Arthur passed away, and I haven't been able to afford it since. I… I don't know how I'll pay for all these tests. Is there any way to get financial assistance? Or a payment plan? I really want to go on this cruise, but I don't know if I can afford all of this. I'm on a fixed income, you see. And I've already spent most of my savings on the cruise itself. Please, Doctor, do you think there's any way to help me? Any way at all? I'm willing to do anything. Anything to make this happen.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers. Don't worry. We'll figure something out. Many hospitals offer financial assistance programs for patients who are uninsured or underinsured. I’m going to check if this hospital has a program available. Okay, good news. This hospital does have a financial assistance program. It’s based on income, and you may be eligible. I’ll have the billing department contact you directly to discuss your options and help you with the application process. We can also explore options for payment plans. The billing department can work with you to create a manageable schedule that fits your budget. Don’t worry about that right now. Let’s focus on getting the tests scheduled first. Now, I'm going to write you a referral for a cardiologist, and a script for a beta blocker. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s wonderful, Doctor! That’s such a relief. Thank you so much for checking. I… I don’t know what I would do without your help. No, I don’t have any allergies to medications. I’ve never had a reaction to anything before. I’m very careful about what I take, though. I always read the labels and make sure I understand what I’m taking. Will the cardiologist want to see any of my medical records? I haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time, but I do have some old records from my general practitioner. They’re in a box at home, somewhere. And… is there anything else I should be doing to prepare for the tests? Anything at all? I want to be as prepared as possible. I really want to make a good impression on the cardiologist. I want them to know that I’m serious about my health.
DOCTOR: Yes, the cardiologist will want to see your medical records. It’s important for them to have a complete picture of your health history. If you can bring those records with you to your appointment, that would be great. If not, we can request them from your previous doctor. It may take a few days for them to arrive. As for preparing for the tests, there isn’t much you need to do. Just get a good night’s sleep before your appointment, and avoid caffeine or alcohol the day of the tests. It’s also important to bring a list of all the medications you’re currently taking, including any over-the-counter remedies or supplements. I’m printing out the referral for the cardiologist, along with a script for the beta blocker. The script includes detailed information about the medication, including potential side effects and precautions. I’m also including a list of questions you may want to ask the cardiologist. Here you go. Please read everything carefully. And don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions. Now, let’s get you scheduled for those tests. Do you have a preference for the date and time?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much. You’ve been so kind and helpful. I really appreciate it. I… I don’t have a preference for the date and time. Anything that works will be fine. I’m flexible. I just want to get the tests done as soon as possible. The sooner I know what’s going on, the better. I… I’ll read everything carefully. And I’ll call my office if I have any questions. I’m sure I will. There’s a lot of information here. Is there anything else I should be doing to prepare for the appointment? Anything at all? I want to make a good impression on the cardiologist. I want them to know that I’m serious about my health. And I really, really want to go on this cruise. It’s all I have to look forward to.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, you’ve already done everything you need to do. You’ve come to see me, you’re willing to get the tests done, and you’re committed to your health. That’s more than enough. Honestly, the best thing you can do is try to relax and not worry too much. Stress won’t help anything. Just focus on taking care of yourself, getting a good night’s sleep, and eating healthy. I’m scheduling your tests now. You’ll have an EKG, a blood test, and an echocardiogram. The echocardiogram may take a little longer, but it’s important for getting a clear picture of your heart’s function. I’m going to give you a copy of this schedule, and I’ll also have my office call you to confirm the appointment times. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. That’s… that’s very reassuring. I… I feel a little bit better now. No, I don’t think I have any more questions right now. You’ve answered everything. I… I just want to thank you again for everything you’ve done. You’ve been so kind and helpful. I… I really appreciate it. I really do. I just want to go on this cruise. It’s all I have to look forward to. I just want to be happy again. Is it… is it okay if I just… sit here for a few minutes? I just need a few minutes to compose myself. I’m a little bit overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Squiers. Take all the time you need. There’s no rush. I’ll just sit here with you for a few minutes. You’ve been through a lot, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Just take a few deep breaths and try to relax. We’ll get through this together. I’m going to give you my card, in case you have any questions later. And remember, I’m here for you. Don't hesitate to call my office if you need anything at all. Take your time, Ms. Squiers. There’s no rush. We’ll get through this together.
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much. You've been so kind. I… I think I'm okay now. I just needed a few minutes to calm down. Thank you for being so patient with me. I really appreciate it. I think I'm ready to go now. Thank you again, Doctor. You've given me a little bit of hope. And that means the world to me. I think I'll go home now and try to relax. And I'll call my office if I have any questions. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been so kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. "Atrial fibrillation...uninsured...wants to go on a cruise. Hopefully, we can get her stable enough to enjoy it. It'll be a challenge."
