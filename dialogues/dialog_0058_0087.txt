DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, just need some lab work done, I think. Medicare said to get it checked. Honestly, I don't remember what they want checked, though. It was a while back when I called. Just... the usual, I suppose?
DOCTOR: "The usual" isn't terribly helpful, sir. Medicare does send out blanket orders sometimes, but we still need specifics to ensure you get the correct tests. Do you have any paperwork from them at all?
PATIENT: Paperwork... hmm. I think I stuffed something in my coat pocket... Nope. Just old stuff. I really don't keep track of these things. I just... called them and they said to come here. Surely you have something on your end?
DOCTOR: Let’s see… Croonquist, Early… born 1952… Yes, I see a note here from Medicare dated March 15th, 2025, recommending a Complete Blood Count, a Basic Metabolic Panel, and a Lipid Panel. Standard stuff for your age, really. Have you been feeling any different lately?
PATIENT: Lipid… what now? Look, I don't understand all those fancy names. Different? Not especially. I'm 73, Doctor, things ache all the time. Is this going to take long? I have... things to do.
DOCTOR: A lipid panel checks your cholesterol, sir. It's important for heart health. And yes, aches and pains are common at your age, but we need to rule out anything more significant. It won't be long, but we do need to draw some blood. And I’ll need to ask a few questions, just to be thorough. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Maybe a bit sensitive to dust, but who isn't? Look, can we just get this over with? I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. No known allergies noted. And yes, we’ll get this over with as quickly as possible. One quick question: are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications... hmm. Let me think. I take something for my knees, I think. A little white pill. I get it from the pharmacy down the street. Can’t remember the name, though. And maybe something for... indigestion? It’s all a blur. Honestly, I just ask the pharmacist for whatever helps. They know me there.
DOCTOR: Right. “Something for your knees” and “something for indigestion” are still not helpful, sir. Do you have the bottles?
PATIENT: Bottles? No, I emptied them both. I just keep the pills in a little dish on the kitchen counter. Bad habit, I know. Look, is this really necessary? I just need the lab work done for Medicare. Can we skip this part? It's probably just routine anyway.
DOCTOR: Sir, with all due respect, it is necessary. We need to know what you’re taking to avoid potentially dangerous interactions. It is my professional obligation to ask. We’ll proceed with the blood draw, but if you can't recall the names, I’m going to have to recommend a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician to review your medication list. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: Primary care… uh. I used to, down in the city. Dr. something… Old man, very good. But I haven't seen him in years. Moved out here, things got… complicated. I mostly just go to the urgent care when something’s really wrong. Fine. Just do the blood work. And get it over with. I really haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's get this over with then. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. It's standard procedure: arm cleaned, tourniquet applied, quick poke. Try to relax. We'll have the results back in a few days. And Mr. Croonquist, I strongly recommend you schedule an appointment with a primary care physician. Ignoring your medication list is simply… unwise. .
