DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I am Dr. Yackey. I understand you’re here today. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Dr. Yackey, right? Look, I haven’t got all day. I’m here for a…clearance. For a little…tweak. My daughter insisted. Says I look “tired.” Honestly. I’m 81 years old, what does she expect? But the surgeon wants some doctor to poke around and make sure I won’t…drop dead on the table. So here I am. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: A “tweak,” you say. An elective procedure, then. And a pre-operative assessment, as your daughter correctly advised. Very well. To be thorough, and to satisfy both you and your daughter, we’ll need to go through a standard history. It's rather tedious, I admit, but necessary. First, let’s discuss your overall health. Do you have any significant medical conditions—heart problems, diabetes, lung disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Lung disease? Goodness, no. I worked with stone my whole life, not smoke. Heart…well, it still ticks, doesn’t it? A little flutter now and then, but nothing a good nap can't fix. Diabetes? Absolutely not. I’ve always been a fairly active man. Terrazzo work keeps you moving, you know. It’s not sitting around knitting, that’s for sure. Honestly, I’m probably healthier than half the folks in this town.
DOCTOR: Very good. No diagnosed heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes. That’s…reassuring. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…hmm. Let me think. Oh! Yes, a hernia years ago. Must have been…forty, fifty years ago? Something like that. And…I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was a lifetime ago. Nothing else, not that I recall. A few broken bones from falling off roofs when I was younger, but those healed just fine. It was a rough trade, terrazzo.
DOCTOR: A hernia repair and an appendectomy. Both quite some time ago, it seems. And no significant family history of illness that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, dear. My mother lived to be…well, she lived a good long life. My father, not so much. Worked too hard, I suppose. Died of…something. I don’t remember exactly. It was a long time ago. Everyone on both sides smoked, if that counts as a history. They were Norwegians, you know. We didn’t fuss much over illnesses. You just got on with things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited family history, primarily unremarkable. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in all those pills. They just mask the problem, don't fix it. I take a little fish oil now and then, for the joints, but that’s it. And a multi-vitamin, maybe, if my daughter reminds me. She’s always trying to get me to take something. Honestly, I'm perfectly fine on my own.
DOCTOR: Very well. No regular medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to anything—medications, foods, environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’ve never had an allergy in my life. Dust, maybe, when I’m cutting stone, but that's just common sense. You wear a mask, you don't breathe it in. Otherwise, no. I eat everything. I lived in Norway, you know. We ate a lot of…well, things. Never had a problem. Are we almost done?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, just to complete the assessment, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Standard procedure, Mr. Orwin. It will only take a few minutes. If you could just have a seat…
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke around. All this fuss for a little tweak. Fine, fine. Let's get it over with. But don't expect anything interesting. I'm a perfectly healthy 81-year-old man. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds…regular rate, but I do detect a slight murmur. Not particularly concerning in a patient of your age, but worth noting. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Good. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 145 over 88. Again, not alarming, but something to keep an eye on. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable for acute findings. Now, just to be thorough, I'd like to order a basic blood panel—complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and an EKG. It will give us a clearer picture of your overall health before your procedure. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Blood panel? EKG? For a little tweak? Honestly, the things they make you do these days. Look, I'm not made of money, you know. And all this poking and prodding is just going to upset my routine. I suppose...if it’s absolutely necessary. But I expect a quick turnaround. I don't want to be waiting around for weeks. And my daughter is paying for it, so you'll have to talk to her about the money. I don't handle those things.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will order the blood panel and EKG. The results should be available within a few business days. We can discuss them when they are ready. In the meantime, I would recommend that you continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle—stay active, eat a balanced diet, and get adequate rest. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No. I think you've poked and prodded enough for one day. Just tell me when I can schedule this…tweak. I have things to do, you know. Terrazzo doesn’t lay itself. And make it quick. The sooner this is over with, the better.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will have my staff contact you to schedule your procedure once the lab results are available. They will coordinate with the surgeon’s office. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or anything else of concern—please contact the office immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s all. Don't bother calling me about every little thing. My daughter will handle it. Good day. And try not to overcharge her, alright? .
