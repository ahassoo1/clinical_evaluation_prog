DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have limited time, so if you could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, I suppose. Lower part. It’s been hurting, and it comes and goes, you see. Quite a bit of discomfort, really. I… I have something called SLE, the doctor told me a while back, and I think it might be connected to that. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, so details are… difficult.
DOCTOR: SLE, yes. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. A complicated condition. “Comes and goes,” you say. Can you be more specific about the nature of this discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, Lupus. That’s right. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not a constant ache, not like a pulled muscle. More like… sharp pains, twisting around. And sometimes it feels… full, bloated even when I haven’t eaten much. It comes on suddenly, then fades, and I truly don't know what triggers it. Does that make any sense? I apologize if I’m being vague.
DOCTOR: “Sharp pains, twisting around… bloating.” Vague is… unhelpful, Ms. Glymph. When did these episodes begin?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I wish I could be more precise, Doctor. It’s… a few months, I believe? Perhaps six? It's difficult to say exactly. I started noticing it around the time… well, around the time the weather changed, warmer weather I think. But it could be before. I really can’t be certain. It started subtly and slowly worsened, I suppose. I apologize again. My mind… it plays tricks on me.
DOCTOR: Six months. And this coincides with warmer weather. Do you experience any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation with these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… nausea, sometimes. A little queasy, but I haven’t actually been sick. No vomiting, thankfully. As for the other… I do have trouble, sometimes. With… going to the bathroom, you see. Constipation, mostly. It comes and goes with the pain, I think. Not every time, though. It's all rather confusing, isn't it? I do try to drink plenty of water, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for your Lupus, or any other condition?
PATIENT: Oh yes, medications. Let me think… I am taking… Plaquenil, I believe? And sometimes, when the joints are particularly bothersome, a pain reliever. Ibuprofen, usually. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were low. I… I write these things down, but I seem to misplace the list often. It's terribly frustrating, I assure you. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Plaquenil, ibuprofen as needed, Vitamin D. Adequate, for now. Now, Ms. Glymph, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with palpation of your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think best. Palpation, you say? Yes, certainly. I do hope it won't be too… uncomfortable. I am rather sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat, Ms. Glymph. I will begin shortly. I am assessing for tenderness or any masses. I detect mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant upon deep palpation. No palpable masses. Bowel sounds are present, though somewhat diminished.
PATIENT: Oh… yes, that is a little uncomfortable, Doctor. Just there, on the left. Not terribly painful, but… noticeable. Diminished bowel sounds? That doesn’t sound good, does it? I do sometimes feel rather… blocked up, as I mentioned earlier. Is that a sign of something serious, Doctor? I do apologize for being such a worry.
DOCTOR: “Blocked up” is a subjective complaint, Ms. Glymph. Diminished bowel sounds can indicate a number of things, none of which necessitate immediate panic, but warrant further investigation. Given your history of Lupus and the intermittent abdominal discomfort, I suspect this may be related to serositis - inflammation of the lining of the abdomen. However, we must rule out other possibilities. I am going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool analysis. Additionally, I recommend an abdominal ultrasound to assess for any abnormalities.
PATIENT: Oh… serositis. That sounds… complicated. And an ultrasound? I understand you want to be thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate that. But… will those tests be unpleasant? I am not a fan of needles, you see. And an ultrasound… will it show something dreadful? I truly appreciate your attention, Doctor. It’s just… I get so anxious about these things. Perhaps I should have stayed home and just… rested.
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, anxiety will not improve your condition. The blood work is a routine procedure, a small prick, frankly. The ultrasound is non-invasive; it involves gel and a probe, nothing more. We are taking these precautions to rule out anything serious. I understand your apprehension, but unnecessary worry is counterproductive. I will have the lab requisitions printed for you. Schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible. And please, try to remain calm. We are simply gathering information. Here you are. Follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. If your pain worsens significantly before then, please go to the emergency room. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, of course. I apologize for being such a… bother. One week. An ultrasound… and blood work. No, I don’t think I have any further questions, Doctor. Just… thank you. For everything. I will… try to remain calm, as you suggest. And I will schedule the ultrasound right away. I do hope it’s nothing serious. Good day, Doctor. .
