DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… what bring me in? My wife… she want baby. We… old. She say maybe need… help? I don’t… I don’t really know what help. She make appointment for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your wife would like to start a family, and she thought it might be good to come in and discuss options, given your ages. That’s very thoughtful of both of you. It's completely normal to have questions, and we can certainly explore what's possible. To start, how old are you, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Ah… age. Yes. I think… seventy? Maybe sixty-nine? It all… goes so fast, you know? I forget. My wife, she remember everything. She is… sixty-five, I think.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. It does go fast! And your wife remembering everything is helpful. So, you’re seventy years old, and your wife is sixty-five. Now, just to be clear, are you looking to conceive a child naturally, or were you thinking about other options, like assisted reproductive technologies – things like in vitro fertilization, or IUI?
PATIENT: Conceive…? What is… assisted…? Those are… big words, Doctor. I just… we want baby. If… if possible. My wife, she read things on the internet. She talk about… tubes? And… little seeds? I don’t understand those things. I make models, you know? Metal and plastic. Not… babies.
DOCTOR: Models, that sounds fascinating! And you're right, those are big words, and it’s perfectly okay if you don’t know them. The internet can be… overwhelming with medical information. Let me explain. “Conceiving” just means getting pregnant. And when we talk about having a baby later in life, sometimes it's harder to conceive naturally – meaning through regular intimacy. Assisted reproductive technologies are ways to help with that. Your wife may be referring to In Vitro Fertilization – IVF – where we combine the egg and sperm in a lab, and then place the fertilized egg into the uterus. And IUI, or Intrauterine Insemination, involves placing sperm directly into the uterus. Before we get into any of that, though, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Okay… tubes and seeds… I think I understand a little bit. My wife, she explain some. But… confusing. Health… hmm. Let me see. I take pills for… water. The doctor say my water pressure is… not good. And… my back. My back always hurts. Old age, you know? I don’t think I have anything else… Maybe a little cough sometimes, but everyone coughs. I go to the doctor regular for… the water pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're taking medication for high blood pressure – that’s good you're being proactive about that. And you experience some back pain. And occasional cough, alright. Do you know the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ah… the name. My wife, she handles all the pills. I just… take them. It is… a little white one. And a little blue one. I think the white one is the main one. She say it starts with… an ‘A’? Maybe. I’m sorry, Doctor. I really don't remember. She always tells me what to take, and when.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. Don't worry about it at all. We can easily look that up in your records. It’s very common for people to rely on a partner to manage medications. Let me quickly access your file here… Okay, I see here you are taking Amlodipine 5mg and Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes! That… that is right! Amlodipine… Lisinopril… You are… very clever, Doctor! My wife… she would be impressed. She always say I forget everything.
DOCTOR: It’s my job, Mr. Carlotta. And your wife is very observant! Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Never had… rash or… trouble breathing. Maybe a little sniffle when the dust is bad, but everyone sniffles in the dust. My wife, she is allergic to… cats. She can't be near cats. But I… no allergies, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies for you, but your wife has a cat allergy. Good to know. Now, before we talk about the possibility of conception, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than a routine check-up?
PATIENT: Hospital… no. Never been in hospital. Just… doctor visits. For the water pills. And… a broken arm when I was a boy. Playing football. But that was… a long time ago. Everything is working… mostly. Old age is… a little painful sometimes, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant hospitalizations besides the broken arm you had as a child. And you are currently taking medication for high blood pressure. Have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I think… when I was young, they took out my… appendix. But that was a very long time ago. And… I had my teeth taken out when I got old. Not surgery, really. Just… teeth. So, only the appendix, I think. A very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had your appendix removed at some point, and some dental work. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… history. That is… long story, Doctor. My father, he… he had trouble with his heart. Very sick. Died when I was young. My mother, she… she lived long time. Very strong woman. She died when I was old. My brothers and sisters… they are all… gone now. They all had… old age problems. That is all I really know. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your father had heart problems, and your mother lived a long life. And you’ve lost your siblings. I’m sorry to hear that. Knowing that your father had heart issues is helpful. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. My wife, she would not allow it! Very bad for you, she say. Always telling me to take care of myself. She is very… particular about health. I don’t like smoke. Makes me cough.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. That's very good. Do you drink alcohol, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Alcohol… sometimes. A little glass of wine with dinner. On special occasions. My wife, she likes a little glass too. Not every day. Just… when we celebrate. Or when we sad. A little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little bit of wine occasionally. That's helpful to know. Now, I'm going to ask about your general activity level. How would you describe your typical day?
PATIENT: Typical day… I make models. In my workshop. I sit a lot. My wife, she does the gardening. And the cooking. I walk a little, to the shop for newspaper. And… sometimes to the park. But mostly, I sit. Old age, you know? Not much energy for running around.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly sitting, making models, with some light activity. And finally, let's talk about your current symptoms. Aside from the back pain you mentioned, are you experiencing any other aches, pains, or unusual feelings?
PATIENT: Hmm… aches and pains… sometimes my knees hurt. When the weather is cold. And… I get tired easily. Very easily. Especially in the afternoon. I need to sit down. And… I sometimes feel… a little dizzy. When I stand up too fast. But that doesn’t happen often. Just… old age. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some knee pain with the weather, fatigue, and occasional dizziness when standing up quickly. That’s all helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… don’t make me stand up too fast, please. The dizzy… not good.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll take things slowly. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90 – a little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen now. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any unusual masses or tenderness. Now, could you please stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: There we go… a little dizzy… just a little…
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Just take a few deep breaths. You’re doing well. I see a little bit of lightheadedness, but nothing too concerning. Pulse is regular, and reflexes are normal. Now, could you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: One… two… three… a little wobbly…
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Just take your time. You have a slightly unsteady gait, but it doesn't seem significantly impaired. Alright, that’s all I need for the physical exam for now. Based on everything we've discussed and the exam, you have a few things going on – slightly elevated blood pressure, some fatigue, occasional dizziness, and some unsteady balance. Your knee pain is likely related to age and weather changes. Now, let's talk about the possibility of your wife wanting to conceive a child. Given your ages, it's important to be realistic about the challenges. There's a higher risk of complications, and the success rate is lower. But it's not impossible. Would you like me to explain the options in more detail, such as assisted reproductive technologies?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. Explain the… tubes and seeds. And the risks. My wife, she is very excited. But I… I worry. Old age… not good for making babies. I want to know… is it safe? For my wife? And… for the baby?
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's start with the basics. The “tubes” your wife mentioned are the fallopian tubes, which connect the ovaries to the uterus. The “seeds” are the sperm, produced by you. For a pregnancy to occur, a sperm needs to reach the egg, fertilize it, and then the fertilized egg needs to implant in the uterus. Now, as you age, both the quality and quantity of sperm and eggs decline. For you, that means it might take longer to conceive, and there’s a higher risk of genetic abnormalities in the sperm. For your wife, there's an increased risk of miscarriage and other pregnancy complications. As for assisted reproductive technologies – IVF and IUI – IVF involves fertilizing the egg with sperm in a lab and then implanting the embryo into the uterus. It's more invasive and expensive, but it has a higher success rate. IUI involves placing sperm directly into the uterus, which is less invasive but also less effective. The risks for your wife include multiple pregnancies – which can be dangerous – infection, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome – a condition caused by the medications used to stimulate egg production. The risks for the baby include a higher risk of genetic abnormalities and premature birth. Before proceeding with any of these options, we would need to do some tests – a semen analysis for you, and a blood test for your wife to assess her egg reserve and overall health. We would also need to consider your overall health conditions, such as your blood pressure, and make sure they are well-managed. Does this make sense so far?
PATIENT: Tubes… seeds… it is… complicated. Risks… many risks. My wife… she is strong. But… multiple babies? That sounds… dangerous. And the genetic… abnormalities? I don't want to… put her through that. And I don't want a… sick baby. The tests… that sounds… sensible. We need to know… everything. Before we… try anything. My wife, she wants a baby… very much. But I… I want her safe. And the baby… healthy.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Mr. Carlotta. It's completely natural to want to protect your wife and ensure a healthy outcome. It’s very good that you’re thinking through all of these things. The first step is to get some baseline information with the tests – the semen analysis for you and the blood tests for your wife. These tests will help us assess your fertility potential and identify any potential risks. If the tests come back positive, we can discuss the options in more detail – IVF or IUI – and weigh the pros and cons. We can also discuss preimplantation genetic testing – which involves testing the embryos for genetic abnormalities before implantation – to reduce the risk of a sick baby. But we need to get the results first. Would you like me to order those tests for you today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Order the tests. We… need to know. Even if… it is not good news. We need to know. My wife… she will want to know. And I… I need to be prepared. What do I… what do we need to do? For the tests? Where do we go? And… how long will it take?
DOCTOR: Okay, I've ordered the tests. For the semen analysis, you’ll need to provide a sample at the lab. They’ll give you instructions on how to do that – usually, it involves collecting the sample in a private room. The lab is located at the hospital – I’ll give you a referral and the address. For your wife’s blood tests, she'll need to go to the hospital lab as well – fasting is required, so she shouldn't eat or drink anything for 8-12 hours beforehand. We'll send the paperwork to the lab, so they'll be expecting her. The results usually take about a week to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and explore the options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… alright. Lab… fasting… one week. I think… I can remember that. My wife… she is good at remembering things. She will take care of it. Thank you, Doctor. You have… explained everything very clearly. It is… still complicated. But… I feel… a little better now. Knowing what to do. One more thing… will the insurance… cover the tests? Medicare, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Let me check that for you… Okay, it looks like Medicare will cover the majority of the costs for the semen analysis and blood tests, as long as they are deemed medically necessary. There may be a small co-pay or deductible, depending on your specific plan. We'll provide you with a detailed cost estimate before the tests are done. I’ll also have the billing department contact you to confirm your coverage details. Here's a summary of what we discussed today, along with the referrals and lab information. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that is… all. Thank you, Doctor Asami. You have been very patient. And… kind. I will talk to my wife. And we will… schedule the tests. I hope… I hope it is not too late.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I'm glad I could help. And don't worry about being too late. We'll take things one step at a time, and we'll do everything we can to help you both make the best decision. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. .
