DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out first, I guess. Want to get it over with, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Right. A life insurance physical. Well, we’ll certainly do our best to make it quick and efficient. Though, it's still a medical exam, so we need to be thorough. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Been…okay, I used to, a few years back. But things got tough, you know? Divorce and all. Haven’t been to a doctor in…a while. Probably close to five years. Just go to the emergency room if something really happens. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Putney, the emergency room doesn’t quite substitute for regular check-ups. It’s good you seeked care now, even if prompted by the insurance company. Five years is…a significant gap. Okay. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all – like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My dad, he had high blood pressure. Real bad. But…I don’t think I do. Never been told, anyway. I get a little tired sometimes, but everyone gets tired, right? Nothing else comes to mind, honestly. I used to get bad headaches, but those stopped a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Right. And those headaches…when did they stop?
PATIENT: Oh, geez…must be ten years ago, maybe more. Right around when…well, around when things started getting rough with my ex-wife. They just…faded away. I don't really remember the last time I had one, to be honest. I was younger then, probably stressed.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any surgeries, hospitalizations, or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree…but that was a long time ago. Just the usual bumps and bruises, you know? Nothing major. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just…nothing regular. I take ibuprofen sometimes for my back, if it's acting up. And…that's it. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. They always make me feel weird.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. My ex-wife was always the one with the weird food restrictions, not me. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Seriously, I think I'm pretty allergy-free.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh boy. Family history… That’s a tough one. My dad, like I said, had high blood pressure, and he…he had a heart attack when he was in his sixties. My mom…she had arthritis, real bad in her hands. And my grandma on my mom's side…she had diabetes. But that's about all I know, to be honest. My family doesn’t really talk about this kind of stuff. It’s kinda… taboo.
DOCTOR: I see. Alright, that’s helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. Never smoked a day in my life. Tried it once in high school, didn't like it. I’ll have a beer with dinner sometimes, maybe a couple on the weekend. But I don't drink to excess. And I stay far, far away from drugs. Never been my thing.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about exercise?
PATIENT: Ugh, exercise. Not much. I walk around at work, I guess. I’m a lodging manager, so I'm on my feet a lot. But I don’t go to the gym or anything. Honestly, I'm pretty tired after work, just want to relax. It’s not like I'm training for a marathon.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…okay. I try to eat healthy, but it's hard sometimes. I eat a lot of rice, fish, and…whatever’s easy. I cook for myself mostly. Sometimes I get fast food, if I'm really busy. It's not the best, I know, but it's quick. And it's not like I'm overweight or anything.
DOCTOR: Actually, Mr. Putney, your chart indicates a BMI of 32. That classifies as obese. Now, before we proceed, are you aware of your weight?
PATIENT: Obese? Really? Thirty-two? I…I hadn't really looked at it like that. I mean, I know I've put on some weight since the divorce. But I didn’t think it was that bad. I thought I was just…solid. Yeah, solid. I guess the chart knows better, huh?
DOCTOR: Charts are generally accurate, Mr. Putney. Being overweight significantly increases your risk for a number of health problems. Now, let’s move on to a physical exam. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick abdominal exam. Can I ask you to remove your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. You’re right, I probably should be taking better care of myself. It’s just…hard. Okay, shoes are off, socks are coming off now. Let’s just get this over with, yeah? The quicker the better.
DOCTOR: Very well. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Blood pressure is 150/95. Elevated. Lungs are clear, but there's a slight murmur…not concerning at this moment, but we’ll need to monitor that. Any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: Nope. No pain. Feels…normal, I guess. A little soft, maybe? I do enjoy a good meal. But no pain or anything. Just…soft. Is that bad? Should it be hard? I don't know anything about this stuff, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Softness isn't inherently bad, but in conjunction with your weight and elevated blood pressure, it's something to note. Now, I'd like to order some blood work: a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a fasting glucose test. This will give us a better understanding of your overall health and help us determine if there are any underlying issues. We'll also need a urinalysis. Would you be able to provide a sample before you leave?
PATIENT: A lot of tests? Blood work, urine… jeez. I guess so. If you need it. It just…sounds like a lot. Can't we just…skip some? Or is all this really necessary for the insurance thing?
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, this isn't simply for the insurance company. This is a basic health assessment. You have multiple risk factors—elevated blood pressure, obesity—and these tests are essential to rule out serious conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and kidney problems. Skipping tests would be irresponsible. I understand it's not ideal, but it's necessary. The lab is just down the hall. I'll have the nurse give you the requisitions and a collection cup. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, okay. All the tests. I guess. No, I don’t think so. Just…take the blood, check the pee… whatever you need to do. Just tell me when I’m done, alright? And how long will this all take? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: The tests themselves shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes. The results will take a few days to process. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they are available. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to make some lifestyle changes: reduce your salt intake, eat a healthier diet, and incorporate some regular exercise into your routine. I can provide you with some resources if you're interested. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s enough for now. Just…get it over with. And tell the nurse to hurry, alright? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll have the nurse come in shortly. I hope you’ll take my advice seriously, Mr. Putney. Your health is your responsibility.
