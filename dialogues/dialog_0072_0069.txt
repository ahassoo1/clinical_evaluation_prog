DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguiо. I’m Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s about getting some vaccinations, if you don’t mind. I think I’m due for a few, but honestly, I get a bit mixed up with what I’ve had and when. That’s why I scheduled the appointment, really – to get things sorted out.
DOCTOR: Certainly. That’s quite sensible, Mr. Paguiо. Many people find it difficult to keep track. Let’s review your records first. Ah, yes. I see you’re Medicare eligible, and we have some documentation here, but it appears incomplete. To ensure we provide you with the appropriate vaccinations, could you tell me about any vaccinations you do recall receiving, and approximately when you had them?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… I remember getting a tetanus shot, I’m pretty sure, when I was maybe… 10 years ago? When I scraped my knee pretty badly gardening. And I definitely had a flu shot every year for a while, when my work required it. That would have been… up until maybe five years ago. Other than that… honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I wasn’t very good at keeping those cards. Is there a way to check, perhaps?
DOCTOR: While some records may be available through the state health department, those are not always comprehensive and can be difficult to obtain in a timely fashion. It truly is best to have a personal record, Mr. Paguiо. Alright. Tetanus within the last 10 years is good. We’ll consider that provisionally. And annual influenza vaccinations for five years… that’s helpful. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any significant medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, right, sorry about the record thing. I should have been better about it. Let’s see… I have high blood pressure, I take medication for it. Been diagnosed for about eight years now. And I had pneumonia once, about fifteen years ago. It was pretty bad, I was in the hospital for a week. Other than that… I think I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. Do you need to know about childhood illnesses? I had chickenpox, of course, when I was little.
DOCTOR: Chickenpox is noted, though generally irrelevant at your age. High blood pressure for eight years, and a history of pneumonia…that is relevant. What medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure, Mr. Paguiо?
PATIENT: It’s Lisinopril, I think. Ten milligrams, once a day. Yes, Lisinopril. The doctor prescribed it, and I’ve been taking it regularly. I haven't changed the dosage recently, if that helps. I get it refilled at the pharmacy down the street.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, ten milligrams daily. Excellent. And are you allergic to any medications, Mr. Paguiо?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything the doctor’s given me before. I’ve taken a lot of different things over the years, mostly for colds and headaches, but never anything serious. No allergies, no. I don’t have any food allergies either.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, before we proceed with vaccinations, I need to ask a few questions regarding your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke, and I never have. My mother smoked, and it wasn't a pleasant experience growing up around it, so I stayed well clear. No, definitely not a smoker.
DOCTOR: And how about alcohol consumption, Mr. Paguiо?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe three or four times a week? Nothing more than that. It’s just… a habit, really. I don't drink to excess, and I definitely don’t drink and drive.
DOCTOR: Habitual alcohol consumption, even in moderation, can interact with certain medications and affect your overall health. But, given your stated frequency, it is unlikely to be a major concern at this juncture. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had heart disease, he passed away when he was 75. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, had diabetes. Oh, and my grandfather had… I think it was Alzheimer’s, but I wasn’t very close to him, so I don’t know much about it. That’s about all I can think of, really. Nothing else major that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paguiо. Given your age, medical history, and family history, I recommend the following vaccinations: an updated Tdap booster – given your last tetanus shot was ten years ago – and an influenza vaccination, as you haven't had one recently. I also recommend a pneumococcal vaccination, given your history of pneumonia and your age. Would you like to proceed with these vaccinations today?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. If you think they’re necessary, I trust your judgement. Let’s go ahead and get them done today, if you don't mind. Just… let me know if anything feels particularly unpleasant. I'm not a fan of needles, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. I assure you, the discomfort is minimal and brief. The nurse will be in shortly to administer the vaccinations. I will be back in a few moments to review post-vaccination instructions. Please let the nurse know if you experience any unusual reactions, and do not hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns following the procedure.
