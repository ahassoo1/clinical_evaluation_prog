DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. My name is Dr. Vodzak. It’s lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I’m planning a cruise, you see. A rather lovely one, actually. And they require some medical information before I can confirm my booking. I thought it best to get it sorted properly with a doctor, rather than just…guessing at things.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you, Ms. Squiers. It’s always best to have accurate medical information, especially when travelling. A cruise sounds wonderful! So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’m generally quite fit for my age, I think. I don’t get breathless easily, and I enjoy a good walk. I lost my husband a few years back, and keeping busy helps, you see. I do get the occasional ache, as one does getting older, but nothing serious. I haven’t been to a doctor in…oh, goodness, it must be five years now, maybe more. Just the usual check-ups when I needed a prescription, and such.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that you're generally feeling well and staying active. Losing a spouse is incredibly difficult, and finding ways to cope is important. And when you say "occasional ache," could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly in my knees, really. Nothing debilitating, mind you. Just a bit stiff when I first get up in the morning, or if I’ve been standing for a long time. It eases off after a bit of movement. I put it down to the weather, mostly. We get some damp days here, you see, and that always seems to aggravate it. I don’t take anything for it regularly. A bit of liniment now and then is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness in the knees, worse with damp weather and relieved with movement. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any swelling in your knees, or any redness or warmth?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No swelling, and certainly no redness or warmth. It’s just…stiffness. Like they need a bit of oiling, if you know what I mean. It comes and goes, really. Some days I barely notice it, and other days it’s a bit more prominent. But it never stops me from doing anything I want to do, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Let's talk about your medical history a bit more broadly. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never been told I have anything like that. My husband, bless him, had a touch of high blood pressure towards the end, but I always seemed to be perfectly fine. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing major since then. I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but that was all. And tonsils out as a child. Nothing else springs to mind, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical diagnoses, childhood illnesses and tonsillectomy. That’s good information. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the tonsils, as I said. And…oh, I had a rather small cyst removed from my arm when I was a girl. It wasn’t anything serious, just a little lump that the doctor wanted to take off. It was a very quick procedure, done under local anesthetic. Nothing since then. No broken bones, no major injuries, thankfully. I’ve always been quite careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy and a small cyst removal. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother, bless her soul, had a touch of arthritis in her hands towards the end, but she lived to a good age, nearly eighty. My father was quite healthy, actually. He had a strong heart. My brother…well, he’s always been a bit of a worrier, but he’s generally alright. He has high blood pressure, I believe, but he doesn't take much notice of it. Nothing really stands out, I’m afraid. No one with anything serious, thankfully. We’re a fairly sturdy bunch, on the whole.
DOCTOR: Okay, some arthritis in your mother and high blood pressure in your brother. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, thankfully. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times, of course, and painkillers when I’ve needed them, but never had any trouble. I’m quite lucky in that regard. No itchy skin, no swelling, no difficulty breathing. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. As I said, I don’t take anything regularly. I might take a paracetamol now and then for a headache, but that’s it. No vitamins, no herbal remedies, nothing at all. I try to eat a healthy diet and get plenty of fresh air, and that seems to keep me going. I don’t really believe in relying on pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, as I said, I like to keep busy. I do a bit of gardening, mostly. And I enjoy walking, when the weather allows. I also do a bit of knitting, and I’m a member of the local book club. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a small glass of wine with my evening meal now and then. I wouldn’t say I’m overly active, but I’m not a complete couch potato either. Just a fairly normal, quiet life, really. I used to travel a lot more with my husband, but…well, that’s another story.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you have a lovely, fulfilling life. Now, would you mind if I conducted a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Go right ahead. I haven’t had one in years, so it will be nice to see how I’m doing. I’m sure I’m perfectly fine, but it’s always best to be sure, isn’t it? Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I’ll feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. A thorough check is just what I’d expect. Please don’t hesitate to ask me if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm ready whenever you are. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 138 over 82. It can fluctuate depending on various factors, so we don’t need to be alarmed just yet. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is normal at 98.6. And your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear, no wheezes or crackles. Ears appear normal, no signs of infection. Nose is clear. Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Everything appears within normal limits. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and it would be worth monitoring it at home. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No, I don’t, Doctor. We never really needed one before. My husband always had perfect blood pressure, and I just sort of assumed mine would be the same. I hadn’t thought to get one. Is it something I should definitely do? And if so, would you recommend a particular type? It all seems a bit…complicated.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking. It’s always best to be informed. While your blood pressure isn’t drastically high, it’s slightly elevated, and monitoring it at home would give us a better picture of your overall cardiovascular health. I would recommend an automatic upper arm blood pressure monitor. They’re generally the most accurate and easy to use. Look for one that has a cuff size appropriate for your arm circumference, and one that has been validated by a reputable organization, like the British and Irish Hypertension Society. I can print you a leaflet with some recommended models. Would you like me to do that for you now?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be very kind of you, Doctor. A leaflet would be wonderful. I’m not very good with all these gadgets, so knowing which ones are reliable would be a great help. Thank you. And if I do get one, how often should I be checking my blood pressure? And what numbers should I be looking out for? I don’t want to worry unnecessarily, but it’s always best to be prepared, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Certainly. This leaflet details some recommended monitors and provides information on proper technique. As for how often to check, I would suggest taking your blood pressure twice a day – once in the morning before you have breakfast or take any medication, and once in the evening before dinner. For the first week, take it twice a day for seven days, and then record your readings. Ideally, you want your blood pressure to be below 120/80 mmHg. Readings consistently above 140/90 mmHg would warrant a follow-up appointment. If you experience any symptoms like severe headache, vision changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please seek medical attention immediately, regardless of your blood pressure reading. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s very clear, thank you. Twice a day for a week, and keep an eye out for those numbers. Under 120/80 is good, over 140/90 is bad, and if I feel unwell, get help straight away. I think I can remember that. So, just to summarise, you don’t think there’s anything seriously wrong, but you’d like me to monitor my blood pressure at home, just to be on the safe side. Is that right? And do you think this is enough information for my cruise booking, or is there anything else they might need? I don't want to cause any delays.
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent summary, Ms. Squiers. Yes, that’s correct. Everything appears within normal limits, but monitoring your blood pressure will give us a more complete picture. As for the cruise booking, they typically require a general health questionnaire, and potentially a brief summary from your doctor. I can write a letter outlining your overall health, stating that you are generally fit for travel, and that we are monitoring your blood pressure as a precaution. I’ll include your vital signs and a brief list of any medications you’re not taking, and any allergies you don’t have. Would you like me to do that for you?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be absolutely wonderful, Doctor. A letter would be perfect. It would put my mind completely at ease, and hopefully prevent any hiccups with the booking. You’ve been so helpful and thorough, I can’t thank you enough. And how quickly do you think you could have that ready? I believe the cruise line needs the information within the next week. I don't want to be a nuisance, but the trip is quite special, you see.
DOCTOR: Not a nuisance at all, Ms. Squiers. I understand. I can have that letter ready for you by tomorrow afternoon. I’ll email it to you, and I can also print a hard copy for you to take with you if you prefer. Just let my receptionist know when you’re leaving, and she can get it for you. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. We’re always happy to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been so kind and patient, and you’ve answered all my questions beautifully. I feel much more confident now, and I’m really looking forward to my trip. Thank you again for everything. You’re a very good doctor. And please, tell your receptionist I'll collect the letter tomorrow afternoon. Have a lovely day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. It was a pleasure meeting you. Enjoy your cruise, and please do take care. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns before you go. Have a wonderful day to you as well.
