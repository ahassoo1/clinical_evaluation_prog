DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my… well, my business. It was in my stool. Blood, you see. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be concerning. And I don't appreciate having to explain this to just anyone. I used to fly planes, you know. Important work. Not sitting around worrying about… things.
DOCTOR: I understand your… discomfort, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s certainly prudent to investigate any rectal bleeding. Now, to be clear, you noticed blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Prudent? Is that what the young people say these days? Look, yes, blood. Bright red, mostly. Though, once, it was darker. Like… coffee grounds. Now, don't tell me about coffee, I haven’t touched the stuff in forty years. It makes you jittery. And I've had enough jitters in my life, thank you very much. Is that important? This coffee business?
DOCTOR: It can be important, Mr. Rowbottom. Bright red blood usually indicates bleeding closer to the rectum, while darker, coffee-ground-like stool suggests bleeding higher up in the digestive tract. Now, has this happened before?
PATIENT: Higher up? What do you mean, higher up? Everything goes through there, doesn’t it? And no, never exactly like this. I've had…trouble…down there before, a bit of discomfort. Old age, you know. But not blood. Not this bright red stuff. And certainly not coffee grounds. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming in. Are you even listening to me? It’s a very specific color, you know. Very specific.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Rowbottom, I am listening. And the color is, indeed, important. Now, when did you first notice this blood?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it was… last week, I suppose. Tuesday, maybe? No, Wednesday. Yes, Wednesday. I had a… a rather tough piece of steak. Though I usually chew my food very well. I always have. A pilot has to be precise, you see. Everything has to be just so. Perhaps it was the steak. Though it was a good cut. Very good. Are you writing all this down? You should be.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am documenting everything, Mr. Rowbottom. And the steak is helpful information. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the blood?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I feel…old. Is that a symptom? My knees ache, my back creaks, I forget where I put my glasses… But those are just…being eighty-eight. You want to know about… down there? No, nothing specific. Just a bit of…unease. And a bit tired, now that I think about it. Coming here is exhausting. Though I suppose I should be grateful for modern medicine. Even if the young doctors don’t understand a good steak when they see one.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Rowbottom, given your age and the presence of blood, even if it's not a large amount, we need to investigate this thoroughly. I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you're agreeable. That includes a rectal exam and abdominal palpation. It will help me assess the situation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? You mean… down there? Look, I’ve been examined by the best mechanics in the country, checking over my aircraft. I don’t need poking and prodding. And I certainly don’t appreciate the implication that you think I’m… fragile. I flew bombers in the war, young man. Bombers! I’ve faced worse than a little… palpation. But still… I’d rather not, if you don’t mind. Is there anything else you can do? Some kind of…scan? Anything less…invasive?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, a physical exam is a crucial first step. While scans can be helpful, they don't always provide the information we need initially. However… I understand your reluctance. We could start with a fecal occult blood test – that checks for hidden blood in a stool sample. It’s non-invasive. But if that’s positive, we will need to proceed with further investigation, including a colonoscopy, to rule out anything serious. Does that sound…reasonable?
PATIENT: A… stool sample? Well, that I can manage. Better than poking and prodding, certainly. A colono-…what did you call it? Sounds dreadful. But alright. A stool sample. But no promises about the colono-thing. And make it quick, alright? I haven’t got all day. My bridge game starts at three. And I'm usually rather good. A good pilot needs a sharp mind, you know. Very sharp.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse bring in a collection kit. It needs to be a small sample, and there are specific instructions to follow to ensure accurate results. I’ll also have her explain the process of a colonoscopy, should it become necessary. It’s a standard procedure, Mr. Rowbottom, and can be very informative. Now, let's move on to your medical history… Have you had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hospitalizations... Goodness. Let me think. Years ago, when I was learning to fly, I had my tonsils out. A dreadful experience. And I broke my arm once, trying to land a particularly tricky aircraft in a storm. Apart from that… nothing much. A few scrapes and bruises, you know, the usual pilot’s ailments. I was a very careful flyer, always was. And I've never had anything major done. I took care of myself. A good pilot has to be in top condition. Though, admittedly, I haven’t been quite as careful lately. Eighty-eight years takes its toll. But still, nothing major.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy and a fractured arm. Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, that’s a long story. My mother… she passed away when I was young. Heart trouble, I think. My father was a fisherman, very strong man. He lived a long life, but he never went to doctors. Stubborn as a mule, that one. My sister… she had some kind of… stomach ailment, years ago. But I don’t recall the details. We weren’t terribly close, you see. A pilot’s life keeps you away from home, you know. Very demanding. Is this important? All this family history? I doubt it. People lived and died, that’s all. It’s the way of things.
DOCTOR: It can be helpful, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no! I’ve never been one for pills and potions. A good night's sleep and a strong cup of tea are all a man needs. Though… the doctor did give me something for my knees a few years back. Something white and small. But I didn’t like the way it made me feel, so I stopped taking it. Interfered with my bridge game, you see. A good pilot has to have quick reflexes. And I’m a rather good player, if I do say so myself. Apart from that… nothing. Just the tea. Earl Grey, you know. Best kind.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, bother. Let me think… Bees, I think. When I was a boy, I got stung by a bee and my face swelled up something awful. Apart from that… nothing that I recall. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, travelling the world as a pilot. Exotic fruits, strange meats… I’ve a strong stomach, you see. Apart from the bee… nothing to worry about. Now, can we get on with this… stool sample business? My tea will be getting cold. And I have a rather important hand to play later this afternoon. A good pilot… well, you get the idea.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll have the nurse bring in the collection kit. Please follow the instructions carefully. And I strongly advise you to consider scheduling a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. This isn’t something to be taken lightly. If you experience any worsening symptoms – increased bleeding, dizziness, or severe abdominal pain – go to the emergency room immediately. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. .
