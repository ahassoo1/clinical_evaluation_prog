DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure, I suppose. I received a notice… from a colleague, actually, suggesting I look into these… Advance Directives. And a POLST form, was it? She said it’s… prudent. Frankly, I think it’s a bit morbid to plan for such things, but my husband insisted. So here I am. I would like the forms, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. It’s very responsible of you to consider this, and your husband is correct – proactive planning can be quite beneficial. It’s not necessarily about planning for the worst, but rather ensuring your wishes are known and respected should you ever be unable to communicate them yourself. We have several documents regarding Advance Directives, including a Living Will and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare. The POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a bit different; it’s a medical order specifically outlining your preferences for interventions like CPR or intubation. Before we simply hand out the forms, however, I’d like to briefly discuss what each one entails to ensure you fully understand them. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Discuss? Honestly, Doctor, I teach literature. I’m quite capable of understanding written documents. I’ve read the brief summary the clinic sent. It's all rather… elementary. However, if you insist, a very concise explanation would be acceptable. But please, spare me any unnecessary detail. My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Chilla. I apologize if I seemed to imply anything otherwise. I simply aim to ensure complete understanding. Very well. A Living Will outlines your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment should you become incapacitated and unable to communicate. This includes things like mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, and resuscitation. A Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare designates a person – your husband, perhaps – to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so. The POLST form, as I mentioned, is a medical order. It's more specific than a Living Will and requires a physician's signature. It outlines your current wishes regarding CPR, intubation, and artificial nutrition. Does that clarify things, or would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect?
PATIENT: It’s… adequate. Though I fail to see why I need a separate form simply to state what is perfectly clear in the Living Will. It seems redundant, frankly. And this “Physician Orders” nonsense... are you suggesting I need your permission to decide what I want? I assure you, Doctor, I have a perfectly sound mind. Just… provide the forms. All of them. I’ll review them at my leisure. And then I’ll decide if I require any further… explanations.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. I understand your perspective, and I respect your wishes. The reason for the separate POLST form is primarily logistical. It’s a standardized order that emergency medical personnel can readily follow, ensuring your preferences are honored even if they are unfamiliar with your prior healthcare directives. It provides clarity in urgent situations. However, you are absolutely correct—it’s entirely your decision. Here you are. Please take your time reviewing them. I’m happy to answer any questions you may have, should they arise. There’s no rush at all. Would you like me to briefly explain the process for completing and notarizing these documents as well?
PATIENT: Notarizing? Really. Doctor, I appreciate the… thoroughness. But I assure you, I am familiar with basic legal procedures. Just tell me where to find a notary. And please, no further lectures about the importance of “honoring my wishes”. It’s rather patronizing. I’ll manage. Thank you. Are there any fees associated with this visit?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. There are no fees associated with this visit today. As a matter of routine, we aim to provide patients with access to essential healthcare planning resources, regardless of insurance status. Regarding notarization, there are several notaries public in the area. The clinic maintains a list, which I can provide you with. Alternatively, many banks and legal offices offer notary services as well. Here is the list. It includes contact information and hours of operation. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That will be all. Thank you for your time, Doctor. Although, I must say, the whole experience has been… unnecessarily drawn out. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Chilla. I understand your time is valuable, and I apologize if the process felt protracted. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or require further assistance with these documents. We are here to help in any way we can. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Chilla. .
