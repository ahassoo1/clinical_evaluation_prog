DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, you know? It’s… a medical thing for the insurance. I’d like to get it over with quick if we can.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A life insurance physical. We can definitely work through this efficiently. Just to be clear, are you currently experiencing any health problems, or is this purely for the insurance requirements?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean, I'm a little… out of shape, maybe? But nothing the doctor hasn’t seen before, I’m sure. Just… regular stuff for someone my age. Honestly, I think they just want to be sure. My ex-wife… she made me get this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll do a standard check-up to cover everything the insurance company needs, and we'll see how you're doing overall. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. High blood pressure, yeah, the doctor told me a few years back it was a little high. He put me on something for it, but I… I stopped taking it. It wasn't agreeing with me, and he said it wasn’t that bad. Diabetes… no, never. And my heart feels okay, I guess. I get a little winded walking up hills, but… that's just from being out of shape, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of elevated blood pressure, previously treated but currently not on medication. And you experience some shortness of breath with exertion. Do you remember what the doctor said specifically about your blood pressure readings when he initially diagnosed it?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. It was a while ago. He just said it was a little high, and gave me a pill. I think it was a white pill. Small one. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to the numbers. I just know he said to take it. I stopped when it made me feel kinda dizzy. I don’t like feeling dizzy. Does it matter what the numbers were?
DOCTOR: It does matter, Mr. Putney. Knowing the specific readings helps us understand your current risk. We'll need to check your blood pressure today, of course. Have you had any other medical problems or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… let me see. Not really. When I was a kid, I broke my arm playing baseball, but that was a long time ago. And… oh! I had my appendix out when I was in college. Other than that, nothing. Just the usual colds and flu. I’m pretty healthy, honestly. Just… not in good shape. Can we just get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant hospitalizations other than childhood broken arm and appendectomy. Let’s move on to family history. Are there any health problems that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my dad, he had something with his heart, I think. He was always tired. And my mom… she had cancer, a long time ago. Lung cancer, I think it was. She smoked a lot. And my brother, he has diabetes. He eats a lot of sweets, that one. Does that help? I'm not really good at remembering all this stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, so family history of heart disease in your father, lung cancer in your mother, and diabetes in your brother. That's helpful. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. I don't smoke. Never have. I used to drink a little beer sometimes, but not anymore. Makes me feel sluggish. And I definitely don’t do… those things. I'm a pretty simple guy, Doctor. Just trying to get this insurance thing done.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Like I said, I stopped taking the blood pressure pills a while back. And I don't really bother with vitamins or anything like that. Waste of money, if you ask me. Can we just get to the… the checking part now? I’m getting a little impatient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Please sit back and relax. I’m listening to your heart now. Take deep breaths… … Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I’m hearing a slight murmur. We’ll want to investigate that further. Your lungs sound clear, but we'll check again after your blood pressure reading.
PATIENT: A murmur? What’s a murmur? Is that bad? I don’t like the sound of that. I just want to get this insurance thing done, not find out I’m… falling apart. Can you just tell me if I’m healthy enough for the insurance? That’s all I care about.
DOCTOR: A murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes when it’s beating. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it does warrant further investigation. We’ll need to check your blood pressure and do a few more tests to get a clearer picture. I’m going to take your blood pressure now. It’s important to get an accurate reading…… Your blood pressure is elevated, 150 over 90. This confirms the previous diagnosis of hypertension. Given your elevated blood pressure, the murmur I heard, and your family history, I recommend we schedule an EKG and a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist. For the insurance company, I can provide a report detailing your current health status, but it’s important you get these tests done for your own health.
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Tests? That sounds… expensive. And time-consuming. Look, Doctor, I just need a form signed so I can get this insurance. Can’t you just… say I’m healthy enough? I'll take better care of myself, I promise. I’ll eat better, maybe even start walking. Just… help me out here. I really don’t want to deal with all this. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I understand your frustration, but I have a professional and ethical obligation to provide accurate and honest medical information. Signing a form stating you're healthy when I know you have elevated blood pressure and a heart murmur would be irresponsible and could potentially jeopardize your health. I can provide a report detailing your current health status to the insurance company, including the elevated blood pressure and the murmur. They may require further testing before approving your policy. I strongly recommend scheduling an EKG and a cardiology consultation. It's the best way to determine the cause of the murmur and ensure you're receiving the appropriate care. I can help you with referrals and scheduling if you’d like. Would you like me to provide those now?
