DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about this tiredness. It’s just… getting worse. And it’s embarrassing to even say, but… I’ve been eating dirt. Not a lot, mind you, but enough that I figured I should probably get it checked out. It sounds ridiculous, I know.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt. Clay, specifically. I find it… comforting, I suppose. It started a few months ago, just a little taste here and there, but now I crave it. Don’t look at me like that, young lady. I know it’s not normal! It’s just… it helps, and I'm tired. Really, really tired.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I assure you I'm not judging. It’s my job to understand what’s going on with your health, and we'll get to the bottom of this. This behavior you're describing is known as pica, and it can be associated with nutritional deficiencies. Let's start with a detailed history. Could you tell me a bit more about when this started, how often you're consuming the clay, and roughly how much each time?
PATIENT: Oh, "pica," fancy. Like I said, started maybe… four months ago? It's not every day. More like a few times a week. And how much… well, a spoonful, maybe two? It’s not like I’m shoveling it in, Dr. Pipkorn! I just… get this feeling, like something’s missing, and a little bit of dirt seems to help. I mostly get it from the garden, it's the red clay. Don’t you have anything better to ask? It feels like you're accusing me of something.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I came across that way, Ms. Hardenburgh. I am simply trying to gather information. It’s important to understand the context. Now, let's move on to other aspects of your health. Do you experience any other unusual cravings?
PATIENT: Unusual cravings? Goodness. What a question. Not really. Just… the dirt. And sometimes I want ice, but who doesn't like ice? I don't go around eating paper or anything strange like that. Honestly, I mostly just want to feel… normal. This tiredness is awful. Everything is a struggle. And frankly, I don’t have time for a long investigation of my eating habits. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will try to be efficient. The tiredness is what brought you in today, and that's what we'll focus on. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, you bet. Everything feels… weak. My hands ache, I get dizzy standing up sometimes, and I'm just… forgetful. Although, at my age, that’s probably just… well, you know. But it’s worse lately. And my skin feels dry, like sandpaper. Does that help? I'm not going to list every little ache and pain, I have a life!
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. The dizziness, weakness, forgetfulness and dry skin are all important details. Now, let's review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I can recall. Usual things for a woman my age. High blood pressure, they said, years ago. But it's been managed, with pills. I stopped taking them a while back, though. Didn’t seem to be doing much good, and I didn't like the side effects. I had a bad bout of the flu a couple of years ago, but I recovered. Honestly, I don't go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. They never seem to figure anything out anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No, not really. A tonsillectomy when I was a child, but that was ages ago. And a broken wrist once, when I fell off a horse. But that’s it. I’m a fairly healthy woman, despite all this… dirt business. I used to be very active, worked in the garden all the time, but now… it’s just harder and harder to get things done.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, do you happen to know if anyone in your family has a history of anemia, or any blood disorders?
PATIENT: Anemia… Let me think. My mother, she was always tired, always complaining of being weak. The doctor said something about her blood, years and years ago. Something about needing iron. She took pills for it, I think. But that was a long time ago, and frankly, I wasn’t very involved in her medical care. She didn’t like doctors much either. Does that help? Honestly, I don’t keep track of all that family history. It’s not something we discussed much.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, regarding your current medications… you mentioned you stopped taking your blood pressure medication. Are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements at all?
PATIENT: No. I quit all the pills. Didn't see any benefit, just felt worse. I tried some vitamins once, a multi-vitamin, but I can't even remember if it helped. I don’t really believe in all that stuff, to be honest. I try to eat a healthy diet when I can, mostly vegetables from my garden. Though, I suppose I haven't been eating much lately, just haven’t had the energy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, including checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your skin. We’ll also check your hands for any signs of paleness. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. But please be quick about it. I have things to do, you know. And don’t poke and prod too much. I don’t like being fussed over. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly faint. Lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your hands. I’m noticing some paleness in your palms, and your nail beds appear a little pale as well. Your skin is indeed dry, and appears slightly flaky. Now, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, iron levels, and kidney function tests. This will help us determine the cause of your fatigue and other symptoms. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? Honestly. More poking and prodding. Fine, do what you have to do. Just get it over with quickly. I don’t understand why all this is necessary. I eat vegetables. I’m tired. I eat a little dirt. Is that really so complicated? Just tell me what the pills are for when you make me take them. And don’t keep me waiting all day for the results.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh. The blood work is necessary to identify the underlying cause of your symptoms. It’s possible your fatigue is related to a nutritional deficiency, such as iron deficiency anemia, which can be common, especially given your mother's history and your… unusual dietary habit. I will order the tests now and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us in one week to discuss the results. In the meantime, I’d like to recommend temporarily stopping the clay consumption, as it could be contributing to the problem. I realize this may be difficult, but it’s important for us to determine the root cause. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Stop eating the dirt? Are you serious? That’s the only thing that helps! You’re asking me to stop the one thing that gives me any relief while you poke and prod and make me wait for… what? Some vague test results? No. I won’t do it. I’ll continue eating what I need to, and you can try to figure out what’s really wrong with me. Honestly, this has been a waste of time. I have better things to do. Now, can I leave?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand your reluctance, but continuing the clay consumption may impede our ability to accurately diagnose and treat your condition. I strongly advise against it, but ultimately, the decision is yours. However, I must document your refusal to discontinue this practice in your chart. Given your refusal, I will proceed with the blood work as requested, but I will also recommend a referral to a hematologist, a specialist in blood disorders, for further evaluation. We’ll get the results as quickly as possible and will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. I will also provide you with a work note to excuse you from any strenuous activities. Do you agree to the referral to the hematologist?
PATIENT: A hematologist? Now you’re just piling it on! Fine. Whatever. If it means I can get out of here and back to my life, yes, send me to your hematologist. But don’t expect me to jump through hoops for vague diagnoses. Just get it done. And please, for the love of everything, don’t make me come back here until you have actual answers. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I need a nap.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’ll have my staff schedule the hematology appointment for you and will ensure you receive a copy of the blood work results as soon as they are available. Thank you for your time. Please, take care.
