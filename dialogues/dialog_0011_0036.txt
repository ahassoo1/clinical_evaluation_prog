DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… good to meet you as well. I am here for… the check-up. Before the insurance starts. They said I need this, yes? A full look-over. I do not know much about these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are quite right. A preventative check-up is an excellent idea, and a very good use of your insurance benefits. It’s important to establish a baseline of your health. “Full look-over” is a perfect way to describe it. To start, I'd like to gather some information about your medical history, if that’s alright. We'll cover your current health, past illnesses, family history, and any medications you may be taking. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds fine. Though I do not have a long history, Doctor. I am a healthy man. I work hard, eat… reasonably, and do not cause trouble. My family… well, we are from Yemen, as you can see. They are mostly… still there. Not much history to share, really. No… big problems. I do not take any pills.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Barban. Even a lack of significant medical history is valuable information. Knowing that you’re generally healthy is a great starting point. Just to clarify, when you say “reasonably” with your diet, could you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: A typical day? Well, breakfast is usually… tea. Strong tea. And maybe some bread. If I have time. Lunch is often… whatever I can get at the factory. Sometimes rice, sometimes… meat. Not always the best quality, but it is food. Dinner… my neighbor, she is kind. She sometimes shares her cooking. She makes good stew, with lamb. Or chicken. It varies. I do not… plan much.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. It gives me a better understanding of your dietary habits. You mentioned working at a factory. Could you tell me a bit about the type of work you do there?
PATIENT: It is… food processing. I work with the… machines. Cleaning them, mostly. And checking the… the product. Making sure it is… correct. It is… repetitive. Long hours. But it pays the bills. It is not… glamorous work. Mostly, I stand. A lot. And it can be… loud. Very loud. I wear the… ear covers, of course. But still.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. Long hours on your feet in a loud environment… we’ll need to consider that as we go through this exam. Now, let's talk about any current symptoms you may be experiencing. Are you having any pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, changes in bowel habits, or any other health concerns at all?
PATIENT: Pain… not really. Sometimes my back aches, after a long day, but… I am not old. It is normal. Fatigue… yes, I am often tired. But again, the work is long. Everyone is tired. Shortness of breath… no. And… bowel habits? I do not… understand the question, Doctor. I eat food, it… goes away. It is a private matter. Is there a problem?
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Barban. I apologize if that was a bit… direct. It’s simply a routine question to ensure we cover all possibilities. And you are right to point out that fatigue is common with physically demanding work. So, you experience some backache after long days, and general fatigue, but nothing else that concerns you?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… correct. Backache and tiredness. And… sometimes my ears ring. Even with the covers. It is… annoying, but I get used to it. It is probably just the noise. I do not… make a fuss about it. It is not worth the trouble to bother anyone.
DOCTOR: The ringing in your ears, or tinnitus, is something we should definitely investigate further, especially given your work environment. Even if you’ve “gotten used to it,” it could indicate some degree of hearing damage, and we want to protect your hearing. Before we move on to a physical exam, let me ask about any allergies you might have – to medications, food, or anything else. And do you have any past medical conditions or have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Allergies… No. I do not think so. I eat many things. I have never had a… reaction. Not to food, not to anything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Hospital… no. Never been in a hospital. I try to avoid doctors, if I can be honest. I do not like being… poked and prodded. Is this check-up going to involve… that?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Barban. I assure you, this check-up will be as comfortable as possible. It will involve some basic physical observations – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick examination of your general physical state. It's all fairly routine. We can certainly discuss any part of the exam you’re uncomfortable with. Just to complete the medical history, could you tell me if anyone in your family has a history of significant medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family… as I said, mostly still in Yemen. It is… difficult to know. Communications are… limited. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. He was always tired. But he was old. And the life there is… hard. My mother… she was healthy, I believe. But she died a long time ago. And… that is all I really know. No one speaks of these things. It is not… polite.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Barban. It’s helpful to have even a limited family history. Knowing your father had heart issues is something we’ll keep in mind. Alright. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, I want to confirm that you aren’t currently taking any medications – over-the-counter medications, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I do not take pills. I drink tea. That is all. I do not believe in… unnecessary things. I eat food, I sleep, I work. That is enough. I do not need… chemicals.
DOCTOR: Very good. That completes the initial medical history. Thank you for being so thorough, Mr. Barban. Now, if you’re comfortable, we can proceed with the physical exam. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Would you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Very well. But… be gentle, Doctor. I am not fragile, but… I do not enjoy being… handled. And please, no sudden movements.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Barban. I will be as gentle and considerate as possible. I’ll explain each step as I go. This just involves wrapping this cuff around your arm and inflating it briefly to measure your blood pressure. Okay, I’m going to inflate this now. It will feel a little tight for a few seconds. Just relax your arm, and breathe normally. …Okay, that’s good. Your blood pressure is 130 over 85. A bit elevated, but not concerning at this point. Now let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that mean, Doctor? Is something wrong? My father… he had heart trouble. Is this… like him?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. An elevated blood pressure reading doesn’t necessarily mean you have the same condition as your father. Many factors can cause a temporary increase in blood pressure, such as stress or even just the fact that you’re at the doctor's office. 130 over 85 is considered slightly elevated, but it’s not a cause for immediate alarm. We’ll need to take a few more readings throughout this exam, and we can also repeat it on another day to get a better picture. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. This will help me check for any unusual sounds or irregularities. Take nice, deep breaths for me, please. In and out… good. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles.
PATIENT: Clear? That is… good, yes? But what about the ringing in my ears, Doctor? Is that… serious? I have had it for many months now. It is… constant. It makes it difficult to sleep sometimes. And what about the backache? Is that… from the work, or is something else wrong?
DOCTOR: Those are both very valid concerns, Mr. Barban, and we will definitely address them. The ringing in your ears, or tinnitus, needs to be investigated further. Given your work environment, noise exposure is a likely cause. However, it's important to rule out other potential causes as well. I'd like to perform a brief hearing test to assess the extent of any hearing loss. It’s a simple procedure, and it will give us a better understanding of the problem. As for the backache, it could certainly be related to your physically demanding job. However, we should also rule out any musculoskeletal issues. I'll need to examine your back and assess your range of motion. Before we proceed with those tests, would you mind stepping onto the scale so I can get your weight?
PATIENT: Very well. A test… and poking. It is… unpleasant, but I suppose it is necessary. Noise… yes, the factory is very loud. Everyone complains about it. But they say it is the price of work. And what then, Doctor? If I have hearing loss… what can be done? Will I need… machines? I do not want machines. And poking my back… be gentle, please. It is… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Your weight is 90 kilograms, which is within a healthy range for your height. Now, regarding your concerns about hearing loss, there are several options available if a loss is detected. Hearing aids are one possibility, but we would only recommend them if they are truly necessary and beneficial. We can also discuss strategies to protect your hearing further, such as wearing earplugs or earmuffs in the factory. As for your back, I’ll be as gentle as possible. I’ll simply assess your range of motion and check for any areas of tenderness or pain. I promise not to do anything that will cause you discomfort. If you’re comfortable, could you lie on your stomach on the examination table?
PATIENT: Very well. But… no sudden movements, Doctor. I am not fragile, but I do not enjoy being… manhandled. And if it becomes… painful, I will tell you. Do not… push me. I understand you are trying to help, but I am a grown man. I know my own body. Proceed… but be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Barban. I will be very gentle, and I will stop immediately if you experience any discomfort. I promise not to push you beyond your limits. Okay, I’m just going to gently feel your lower back to check for any areas of tenderness or muscle spasm. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Does this feel painful at all?
PATIENT: A little… yes. There. Not sharp… but… achy. It is always like this after a long day. It feels… tight. Like a knot. And… when I bend over… it hurts more. It is… tolerable, but it is there. All the time. Be careful, Doctor. Do not… push too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It does feel slightly tight and tender in that area. It sounds like you might have some muscle strain or spasm in your lower back. Now, I’m going to ask you to gently bend forward and touch your toes. Just go as far as you comfortably can. Stop immediately if you feel any sharp pain. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Ouch… that hurts. Not… unbearable, but… definitely painful. It feels like something is… pulling. And it is stiff. I cannot… go much further. It feels like I will… snap. No. I cannot… do that again. It is… too painful. And it is not improving. It is… getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s enough. You don’t need to push yourself. It sounds like you’re experiencing some significant discomfort in your lower back. Based on what you've told me, and the physical examination, it’s likely that you have a muscle strain or spasm in your lower back. It’s probably related to your physically demanding job. However, to rule out any other potential causes, such as a disc problem, I would like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An X-ray… more machines. I do not like machines, Doctor. But… if it is necessary to know what is wrong… then very well. But no… poking. And no… sudden movements. I do not want to… snap something. But what if the X-ray shows something… bad? What then, Doctor? Will I need… surgery? I do not want surgery.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Barban. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about the possibility of an X-ray and its potential findings. The X-ray is simply a way for us to get a better look at your spine and rule out any serious problems, such as fractures or disc abnormalities. It doesn't necessarily mean that anything is seriously wrong. And no, surgery is rarely necessary for muscle strains or spasms. Most cases can be effectively treated with conservative measures, such as rest, pain medication, physical therapy, and stretching exercises. The X-ray itself is quick and painless. You'll simply lie on a table, and a technician will take a few images of your lower back. It won't take long at all. Would you like me to explain the process to you in more detail?
PATIENT: Very well. Explain it… in detail. But… no sudden movements, Doctor. I repeat… no sudden movements. And… what about the ringing in my ears? Will the X-ray show anything about that? It is… constant. And it makes it difficult to sleep. It is… annoying. I just want to… feel better. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Barban, that’s not too much to ask at all. And we’ll do everything we can to help you feel better. The X-ray machine uses a small amount of radiation to create images of your bones. The technician will position you on a table, and you'll need to remain still for a few seconds while the images are taken. It's completely painless, and the radiation exposure is very low – comparable to the amount you receive from a short airplane flight. The images will then be reviewed by a radiologist, who will send a report to me. Regarding the ringing in your ears, the X-ray won't show anything directly. It’s a problem with your inner ear and auditory nerve. However, we’ll need to do a hearing test to assess the extent of any hearing loss. And I would also like to refer you to an audiologist – a specialist in hearing – for a more comprehensive evaluation. So, to summarize, we’ll order an X-ray of your lower back to rule out any serious problems. We’ll also do a hearing test and refer you to an audiologist for a more comprehensive evaluation of your tinnitus. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well. X-ray… hearing test… audiologist… It is… a lot. But… if it will help me… then very well. But no sudden movements, Doctor. And be gentle. I repeat… be gentle. When can I have this X-ray? And the hearing test? I just want to… get it over with. And then… hopefully… feel better. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Barban, that’s not too much to ask at all. I completely understand your desire to get this over with and start feeling better. We can schedule the X-ray for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. It will only take about 15-20 minutes. The hearing test can be scheduled for later this week, on Thursday at 2:00 PM. Here are the appointment details. The X-ray will be done in the radiology department, and the hearing test will be done in the audiology department, both located on the second floor of the building. In the meantime, I recommend that you rest your back as much as possible. You can also apply a warm compress or take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, to help alleviate the pain. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Tomorrow… Thursday… It is… a lot to remember. And what about the audiologist? What will they do? More machines? More poking? Will they… try to sell me something? I do not want machines. I just want… to hear normally again. Is that too much to ask? I just want… peace and quiet. And… less ringing. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Barban, that’s not too much to ask at all. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about what the audiologist will do. The audiologist will conduct a comprehensive hearing test to assess the extent of your hearing loss, if any. They'll use headphones to play a series of tones at different frequencies and volumes, and you'll simply indicate when you can hear them. It's completely painless and non-invasive. And no, they won’t try to sell you anything. Their primary goal is to diagnose the cause of your tinnitus and recommend the best course of treatment, which may include hearing aids if necessary, but it’s entirely up to you whether or not to proceed with any treatment. They can also recommend strategies to manage your tinnitus, such as sound therapy or relaxation techniques. They will explain everything to you in detail and answer any questions you may have. They're there to help you, not to sell you anything. Is there anything else I can clarify for you?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. X-ray tomorrow… hearing test Thursday… no selling… just… helping. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… patient. I am not used to… kindness. But I am still worried. But maybe… a little less worried now. I should go now. I have… work. And I need to rest my back. And… try to sleep. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Barban. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And remember to rest your back and try to get some sleep. Have a good day, Mr. Barban, and I’ll see you tomorrow.
