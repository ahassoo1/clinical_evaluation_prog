DOCTOR: Hi Delron, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, to be honest. Waste of time, most of 'em. But the army… they want me to get checked out first. Some kind of exam. For recruitment. That's all. It’s August 2nd, by the way. Just so you know.
DOCTOR: Right, recruitment exam. Understandable. And yes, I see it’s August 2nd. Thanks for the reminder – sometimes the days blur together. So, they haven't specified what they want me to check for, have they?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a general "physical," they said. Make sure I'm not falling apart, I guess. Honestly, I'm in better shape than half the folks I work with. I build engines, you know? Real work. Not like… sitting behind a desk all day. Do I need to tell you all this? Seems obvious.
DOCTOR: It is good to know you’re active. And no, you don’t need to tell me anything you don’t want to, but it helps me get a better picture of your overall health. Building engines definitely sounds physically demanding! Okay, so a general physical. Let's start with the basics. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well? Look, I get up, go to work, come home. Sometimes my back aches, but that's it. It's work. Everyone's back aches. My wife nags me about it, wants me to see a chiropractor. Waste of money. I don't get sick. Not like some folks. Haven’t had a fever in… well, I can’t remember. Is this what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain is good to know. And it's helpful you haven’t been sick recently. When was the last time you did see a doctor for anything, even a minor issue?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… honestly? A long time. Maybe… when my wife made me go get a tetanus shot, must be… ten years ago? Something like that. Before that… I don’t remember. I really don't go to doctors. Never really needed to. I fix things. People, machines, doesn’t matter. I don’t get fixed.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in all that stuff. Pills for everything. Makes people weak, if you ask me. My wife takes something for her… something. But I don’t bother with it. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’m Swedish, for goodness sake. We’re hardy folk. Maybe a bit of dust sometimes, but who doesn’t get a little dusty? No serious allergies. I eat everything. And I mean everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a little about your past. Have you ever had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never. Not once. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that's it. Didn't even go to the hospital. My dad set it himself. Good man, my dad. Knew what he was doing. Serious illnesses… no. Never been sick enough to need a hospital. I told you, I fix things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. I don't do surgeries. People cutting you open… ridiculous. Never needed one, never will. Waste of time and money. What do I look like, a delicate flower?
DOCTOR: Alright. How about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My wife, mostly. And… some relatives. My dad passed away a few years back, good man. Mom’s still around, she’s… old. Everyone’s pretty healthy, as far as I know. Nothing major. No heart disease or anything like that. Just… old age, mostly. My wife’s side… they have some… problems. But I don’t really pay attention to that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Drink? Sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe. Nothing crazy. Recreational drugs? Are you serious? I build engines, not… whatever you’re thinking. I need a clear head. I don't have time for that nonsense.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. It shouldn't take long.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect anything interesting. I told you, I'm in good shape. Just… hurry up. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and again… good. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, 88 beats per minute, but that could be from talking. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is slightly high. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Now, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears and throat… everything looks clear there too. Finally, let's do a quick palpation of your abdomen… nothing feels abnormal.
PATIENT: Hmph. See? Told you. Nothing wrong. Everything's in order. Can we be done now? This is… uncomfortable. And frankly, a waste of my time. Is that it? Do I pass or what? I need to get a form signed for the army.
DOCTOR: Okay. Everything appears normal on the initial exam, but your blood pressure is a little elevated, and you reported some discomfort in your abdomen. While you appear generally healthy, the slightly high blood pressure does warrant further investigation. To be thorough, and to ensure you're fit for recruitment, I recommend a few blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel – to check your overall health and kidney function, and cholesterol levels. I also recommend an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would you be willing to do those?
PATIENT: Blood tests? An EKG? Look, I told you, I'm fine. I don't need all this… poking and prodding. It's just a waste of time and money. The army doesn't ask for all this, do they? Just want to make sure I'm not… falling apart, like you said earlier. Can’t I just… sign a waiver or something? I don’t have time for this. And frankly, I don't trust you and your fancy tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance. However, the army does require a certain level of health screening, and these tests will provide a more comprehensive picture of your health status. They're not meant to say you aren't healthy, just to ensure you are, and to identify any potential issues that might require attention. Without these tests, it may be difficult for the army to clear you for recruitment. While I can’t force you to undergo testing, I strongly advise it. If you are unwilling to proceed, I can document my findings, which include slightly elevated blood pressure and reported abdominal discomfort, and you would need to discuss this with the army recruitment office. They may have specific requirements, or they may require additional testing on their end. I'm happy to provide you with a written summary of today’s exam if you’d like.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Blood tests, EKG… whatever. Just get it over with. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time. And I expect you to be quick about it. And no, I don't want a lecture about my health. Just do the tests. And get me the form signed. That's all I want. A signed form. Do I need to schedule another appointment or can we do it now?
DOCTOR: Alright. We can do the blood tests and EKG right here in the clinic today. It will take about 30-45 minutes in total. I'll have the lab technician draw the blood samples first, then we’ll proceed with the EKG. I’ll also have the nurse prepare the form for you to sign once the results are available. If you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the lab technician. And rest assured, I won't lecture you about your health. Just routine testing, that’s all.
PATIENT: Fine. Let's just get this over with. And tell your technician to be gentle. I don't like needles. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll let her know. She’s very experienced and gentle. .
