DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's a bit... complicated. I think it's about... starting a family. My, uh, partner and I are thinking about it. I just... want to make sure everything is okay, you know? Before we really start. It's...pre-planning, I guess? I'm not sure what it's called.
DOCTOR: I see. Pre-conception planning is an excellent idea, Mr. Verrall. Very responsible of you both. It's good to address any potential concerns beforehand. Let's gather some information, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds good. I... I don't really know where to begin. I haven't... done this before. Or, it was a long time ago, and I don't remember much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. We’ll take it step-by-step. Let’s start with your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else that your primary care physician manages?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I... I don't think so. Not that I know of. I see a doctor, yes, but mostly for check-ups. Old man stuff, you know? Nothing... serious. I had a bad knee for a while, but it's mostly okay now with some... pills. But nothing regular. I don't think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Verrall?
PATIENT: Surgeries... Now that you mention it... yes. A long time ago. When I was young, I broke my leg. They had to put in... pins, I think? And... and maybe something with my appendix when I was a boy. But it was so long ago, I barely remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken leg with pins and an appendectomy. We’ll make a note of those. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family... hmm. My father... he had a bad heart, I think. He was sick for a long time before he... passed. And my mother... she had problems with her... memory, towards the end. She forgot things easily. That's all I really remember, to be honest. They lived far away, so I didn't see them much.
DOCTOR: I understand. Heart problems in your father and memory issues in your mother. That's helpful information. Now, let's talk about your social history, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh. Um... well. I used to smoke, a long time ago. But I quit. Maybe twenty years ago? And I... enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just one. Maybe two. I... definitely don’t do any drugs. Never have.
DOCTOR: Alright, former smoker, occasional alcohol consumption. Thank you for being open with me, Mr. Verrall. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies... hmm. I don't think so. I remember being itchy once after taking some… pink pill? But I don’t remember what it was for. It was a long time ago, and I don’t think it was that bad. Nothing serious, anyway. I haven't had any bad reactions lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible mild reaction to a pink pill in the past. Now, Mr. Verrall, to get a clearer picture, and with your permission, I'd like to do a brief physical exam and order some blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds... sensible. If that's what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Blood tests are... okay, I suppose. Just... try to be quick, okay? I don't like needles much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. We’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. First, let's check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick abdominal exam. After that, we’ll draw some blood for the tests. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds... okay. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have... things to do later. But, you know, it's important. This is important. Just... please be gentle?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Verrall. I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me, please... Good. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll monitor that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me... and exhale... Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Another deep breath... and exhale... Lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Does this cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no pain. A little... pressure, maybe? But nothing bad. It feels... normal. Like a doctor touching my stomach, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No significant tenderness. Now, for the blood tests, we'll need to check a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, your thyroid function, and some tests to assess your reproductive health. I’ll have the nurse draw those for you. Please remain seated, and I'll be right back with the lab requisition form. Here you are. The nurse will explain the procedure to you. Do you have any questions before she comes in?
PATIENT: Reproductive health? What does that... mean, exactly? I mean, I know why we’re doing this, but… will it be uncomfortable? And how much blood do they need? I get lightheaded easily.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Verrall. The reproductive health tests are just to assess your sperm count and motility – essentially, the quality and quantity of your sperm. It's a standard part of the pre-conception evaluation. As for discomfort, it’s a simple blood draw, similar to what we just did for the other tests. And yes, we'll make sure they take only the necessary amount of blood, and you can let the nurse know if you're prone to lightheadedness. She’s very experienced and will take good care of you. We can have you lie down during the draw if you prefer. Does that ease your mind a little?
PATIENT: Yes, that... that does help. Lying down sounds... good, actually. Thank you, Doctor. You explain things well. It's just... it's all a bit new to me, you know? And a little scary.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Verrall. It's perfectly natural to feel anxious when facing something new. Please don't hesitate to ask any questions that come to mind. I’ll be here to help you every step of the way. Let’s wait for the nurse, and we’ll proceed from there. Once we have the blood test results, we’ll discuss them in detail and create a plan that’s best for you and your partner. Is there anything else I can address for now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… all. I just need to… breathe, I guess. And let the nurse do her job. Thank you, Doctor. Really. You've put my mind at ease a bit.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. That’s my job. I'll just step out and let the nurse come in. Please don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. .
PATIENT: .
