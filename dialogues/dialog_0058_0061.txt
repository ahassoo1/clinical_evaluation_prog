DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Doctor… Todoro…vich? Yes. Well, my… the team, you see. The young fellas. They want me to… to check if I’m still good to go. For the… the tryouts. It’s a bit silly, really, at my age. But they insisted! I used to be pretty good, you know. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Right. “Good to go” for tryouts. And how old are you, Mr. Murph?
PATIENT: Seventy. Seventy years, give or take. It feels like a lot of years, I tell you what. My wife, bless her heart, she keeps track of these things. I… I forget sometimes. It’s just… time flies, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Seventy. Okay. And what exactly do these tryouts involve?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… that's a good question. They mostly want me to… run a bit. And… and throw the ball. And maybe… maybe do some stretches. It’s not like the old days, you know. Back then, it was… well, it was rougher. More… tackling, I think? But now it’s more… showing them I can still move without… breaking. That’s what my grandson said, anyway. He's the coach. A good boy.
DOCTOR: So, running, throwing, and stretching… and you're concerned about… injury?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That's right. Not breaking anything! My bones aren’t what they used to be, Doctor. And I get a little… a little winded, if I push myself too hard. My wife worries about that, too. She says I need to take it easy. But these boys… they look up to me. It's hard to say no.
DOCTOR: And have you experienced any pain recently?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm… Well, my knees sometimes ache, especially when it’s cold. And my shoulder… my right shoulder, it gets a little stiff. I just thought it was… old age, you know? Nothing too serious. I put some cream on it, and it usually helps. But… sometimes, when I try to throw, it feels… a little pinched. But it goes away. Usually.
DOCTOR: "Pinched" in your shoulder when throwing. Okay. And aside from the knees and shoulder, any other aches, pains, or… difficulties with movement?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh, my back! Sometimes my back gets a little sore if I bend over for too long. Gardening, mostly. I love gardening. My wife and I, we have a beautiful garden. But bending… yeah, bending over isn't as easy as it used to be. And… and sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. Nothing major, just a little whoosh. Is that… is that bad? I don’t want to be a bother, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. So, knees, shoulder, back, and occasional dizziness. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything, Mr. Murph?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… hmm. Now that’s a good question. I… I think the doctor, a long time ago, said I had a little… high blood pressure? But I take a pill for that, and it seems to keep it under control. And… and I think I had a little arthritis in my hands, but it's not too bad. Mostly just a little stiff in the mornings. My wife keeps telling me to take my vitamins. She’s a very good wife, you know. Always looking out for me. I don't remember the names of the doctors, though. It was a long time ago!
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications besides the pill for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Let me see… I take something for my… for my stomach. It gets a little upset sometimes. And… and a little something for sleep. I don’t sleep as well as I used to. And… oh, and my wife gives me a lot of vitamins! Fish oil, I think? And something with… with C in it. She says it’s good for my… for my everything! I can’t remember all the names, Doctor. There's a lot of little bottles. I just take what she gives me. She knows best.
DOCTOR: Right. So, blood pressure medication, something for your stomach, a sleep aid, and a variety of vitamins... without knowing the names or dosages. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Murph?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. That’s a tough one. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, a long, long time ago. And… and I think I had a little something done on my… on my knee? A long time ago, too. It was bothering me, and the doctor said I needed to… fix it. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t remember much about it. It doesn’t bother me now. Mostly. My wife will probably know more. She remembers everything! I just… I just get a little foggy sometimes. Is that alright? I don’t want to waste your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsils as a boy, something on the knee… vaguely. And finally, Mr. Murph, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Now that’s a good question. I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. My wife makes wonderful food, and I don’t want to complain! I’ve never really had a reaction to anything. Maybe a little… a little itchy sometimes, but nothing serious. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But… you know, my grandson, he’s a little allergic to peanuts. Is that… does that count? He gets a little puffy, my wife says. But I’m not allergic to peanuts. I love peanuts!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. So, to summarize… you're a 70-year-old male presenting for evaluation prior to tryouts, with a history of high blood pressure, stomach issues, sleep problems, and multiple vitamins. You have vague memories of tonsil removal and a knee surgery, and no known allergies. You report pain in your knees, shoulder, and back, with occasional dizziness. Is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: Oh… oh, yes, Doctor! That sounds… that sounds about right. Yes. You’re very good! You put it all together nicely. My wife would be very impressed. Yes, that’s… that’s me, alright. A little foggy on the details, but… yes. That’s me. Now… what happens next? I hope I’m still good enough to run around a bit with the young fellas!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look at these knees. Please sit on the examination table and extend your legs. Okay. Range of motion is somewhat limited in both knees, with mild crepitus noted on extension. No acute swelling or warmth. Now, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor! Oh, that's… that's a little stiff. Getting old isn't for the faint of heart, you know. There we go… a little wobbly, but I'm still standing! My wife says I need to build up my strength. But it's hard to find the motivation sometimes. Now, what's crepitus? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Crepitus is just a little… grating sensation in the joint. It’s common with age, and doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. No tenderness to palpation, but some mild swelling noted around the patella of the right knee. Now, let’s check your shoulder. Can you reach behind your back and try to touch your shoulder blades together?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, that's… that's good to know. Not serious, you say? That's a relief! Oh… oh dear. That’s… that’s a little difficult. I can’t quite reach. It feels… tight. And… and a little pinched. Just like I told you. Is that the shoulder that’s bad? I hope I haven’t done any damage! I used to be able to do all sorts of things with my shoulders. Now… now it’s just a little… stubborn.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation of the rotator cuff muscles, with limited range of motion on external rotation. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Please take a deep breath for me. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, what is your blood pressure, Doctor?
PATIENT: Oh… a murmur? That doesn't sound good, does it? Is that serious? My wife always worries about my heart. She says I need to take it easy. I try, Doctor, I really do. It's just… it's hard to slow down when you enjoy things! And the young fellas… they need someone to… to keep them in line! But… a murmur… what does that mean?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140/90. The murmur is mild and has been present for some time, according to your records. It's not immediately concerning, but it does warrant monitoring. Look, Mr. Murph. Based on what you've told me, and the brief exam I've performed, you have several issues—arthritis, shoulder impingement, mild hypertension, and a heart murmur. Running around with these young fellas, without proper evaluation and treatment, is risky. I’m concerned about potential injury, particularly to your shoulder and knees. And I wouldn't want you putting undue stress on your heart.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Arthritis… impingement… hypertension… It all sounds very… complicated. I just wanted to have a bit of fun, you know? Keep up with the boys. But… injury, you say? That wouldn’t be good. My wife would be furious! So… what do you recommend, Doctor? Should I… should I just hang up my cleats? I don’t want to be a bother, but… I don’t want to hurt myself either. And I definitely don’t want to worry my wife. Maybe… maybe I should just stick to watching from the sidelines. What do you think?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Murph. I understand wanting to stay active, and I commend you for that. But at your age, and with your medical history, pushing yourself too hard is a bad idea. I recommend a few things. First, I want you to see a physical therapist for a comprehensive evaluation of your shoulder and knees. They can develop a targeted exercise program to improve your strength and range of motion. Second, I want you to follow up with your primary care physician to discuss your blood pressure and heart murmur. They may want to perform further testing. And third… …I strongly advise against participating in any strenuous activity, including these tryouts, until you’ve been cleared by both the physical therapist and your primary care physician. It's not about "hanging up your cleats" entirely. It’s about being smart and taking care of yourself. And honestly, Mr. Murph, watching from the sidelines and offering your wisdom to these young fellas is a perfectly respectable way to stay involved. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… oh, I understand. Physical therapy… primary care physician… no strenuous activity. It’s a lot to take in, Doctor. I suppose you’re right. I don’t want to hurt myself, and I definitely don’t want to worry my wife. She’s already worried enough about me getting older. Watching from the sidelines… it’s not the same, but… I can still offer advice, can’t I? And maybe I can help coach a little, from the bench. Alright, Doctor. I’ll make an appointment with the physical therapist and my doctor. And I’ll tell the boys… I’ll tell them I need to take it easy for a while. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve given me a lot to think about. Is there anything else I need to do? Or… are we finished here?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Murph, we're finished here. I’ll write you a referral for physical therapy, and a note to your primary care physician outlining my concerns. I also recommend you take an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed for any discomfort. And please, listen to your body. If something hurts, stop doing it. Here's the referral. And please, follow up with both the physical therapist and your primary care physician as soon as possible. Don’t delay. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Ibuprofen… naproxen… listen to my body… chest pain… shortness of breath… dizziness… I’ll remember. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And… I appreciate you being honest with me. It’s not what I wanted to hear, but… it’s what I needed to hear. I’ll make those appointments right away. And I’ll tell my wife. She’ll be relieved, actually. She’s always telling me to take it easy. Well… I guess I’ll see you another time, Doctor. Take care now. .
DOCTOR: You too, Mr. Murph. Take care of yourself. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
