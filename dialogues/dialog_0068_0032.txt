DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it's… a rather delicate matter, you see. An… issue with my, shall we say, plumbing. It’s been… discharging. Not a pleasant thing at all. I haven’t experienced anything like this in… oh, decades, I presume. It’s most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes. Okay. And when did this… discharging… begin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… Dates are always so troublesome. Let me think… It was after… after the garden party, I believe. My wife, Shirin, hosted it. Yes, it was shortly after. Perhaps a week? It’s all a bit hazy, you understand. Old age, it plays tricks on the memory. I haven’t been feeling quite myself, generally. Though I can’t pinpoint exactly when it started… beyond that party, of course.
DOCTOR: A week after the garden party… Alright. And can you describe this discharge to me?
PATIENT: Goodness. Must we be so… graphic, Doctor? Very well. It’s… not clear, if you take my meaning. A bit… yellowish, I suppose. And there’s a… a small amount of discomfort. Not pain, precisely. More… a burning sensation, occasionally. It’s quite embarrassing, you understand. A man of my age… to be bothered with such things. It simply isn’t done.
DOCTOR: Okay. Yellowish discharge with occasional burning… And is this happening with urination, or is it separate from that?
PATIENT: Separate, Doctor, quite separate. I assure you, my bladder functions perfectly adequately. It happens… between visits to the facilities, if you catch my meaning. It’s… it’s a leakage, shall we say. A most unwelcome leakage. Really, it’s quite distressing. One doesn't expect such things. I’ve always prided myself on… decorum.
DOCTOR: Alright, separate from urination… I understand. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Fever? Good heavens, no. Shirin would have noticed immediately. She’s quite attentive, my wife. No chills either. And pain… well, as I mentioned, a slight burning sensation. But pain? No. A robust constitution, you see. I've always been rather… resilient. Though this… this affliction is proving to be quite irritating. More irritating than painful, certainly. It’s just… unnerving. A gentleman doesn’t have these sorts of problems.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, chills, or significant pain… Just the yellowish discharge and occasional burning. Have you noticed any changes in your skin around that area?
PATIENT: Changes in the skin… Hmm. I haven’t specifically looked, Doctor. Shirin handles most of the… personal grooming, you understand. I merely… oversee things. Let me think… No, I don't believe so. No redness, no sores… Nothing that I’ve consciously noticed, anyway. Though I suppose I haven’t been inspecting myself with a magnifying glass, if that’s what you’re asking. Really, Doctor, is this necessary? It's a bit… undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright. No noticeable skin changes. And have you had any similar issues in the past?
PATIENT: Similar issues… Now that’s a question. Decades ago… Perhaps when I was a young man, stationed in… Isfahan, I think it was. A brief… indiscretion, shall we say. But that was a lifetime ago, Doctor. A completely different matter, I assure you. This… this feels different. More… persistent. And frankly, more concerning. A young man can recover from things. An old man… well, it’s another story entirely. I can’t recall the specifics, truthfully. It was a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. A past issue decades ago… I see. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I pride myself on a healthy lifestyle, Doctor. A bit of gardening, a sensible diet… that’s all I need. Though Shirin insists on a small dose of… something for my arthritis, I believe. A tiny white pill, once a day. But that’s hardly a medication. And allergies? No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any problems with… pollen, or dust, or anything of that nature. A robust constitution, as I mentioned. Though this… this whole situation is rather unsettling. I’m not accustomed to being… unwell.
DOCTOR: Alright. Small white pill for arthritis, no known allergies… Okay. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if you don't mind. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Doctor, are you quite sure that's necessary? I’ve already explained the situation, haven’t I? I hardly think poking and prodding will reveal anything I haven’t already told you. It feels… invasive. And frankly, a bit undignified for a gentleman of my age. I would prefer to avoid it, if at all possible. Is there not something else we can do? Perhaps a… blood test? Or some sort of… scan? Anything but a physical exam. It's simply not done.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, I understand your discomfort. However, a physical exam is often the best way to accurately assess the situation and determine the cause of the problem. I assure you, I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. It will help me rule out certain conditions and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. We can always proceed cautiously and stop at any time. But without a quick examination, I'm afraid I would be guessing, and that wouldn't be fair to you. Would you perhaps allow me to just look first?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But just a look. And I mean a very quick look. And please, be gentle. I have sensitive skin. And… and do try to maintain a professional demeanor, if you don’t mind. This is… rather embarrassing, you understand. A gentleman doesn't expose himself unnecessarily. And if you could explain everything as you go along, that would be… comforting. A quick look, and then we can discuss options, yes? Perhaps a blood test would be preferable after all. But very well… a quick look.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I appreciate your cooperation. I'll explain everything as I go. Please lie down on the examination table. First, I’ll just take a look at the area. I’m looking for any redness, swelling, or discharge. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But do be quick about it. And please, try not to… stare. I must say, this is most undignified. I’d rather be tending to my roses. And do tell me what you’re looking for, precisely? I find it… reassuring to be informed. I dislike surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I'm just looking for any signs of inflammation, redness, or the source of the discharge. I do see a small amount of yellowish discharge, as you described. And there is some mild redness around the opening of the urethra. The skin doesn't appear broken or ulcerated, which is good. There doesn’t seem to be any significant swelling or tenderness to the touch. It's not acutely painful, which is also reassuring. Okay. That's all for now. It doesn’t appear to be anything acutely alarming, but we need to determine the cause of this discharge to ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t as unpleasant as I feared, thankfully. But still… most undignified. So, you’re telling me it’s not… serious? No dreadful diseases, or anything of that nature? And what exactly is causing it, then? I've lived a respectable life, you understand. I haven't… indulged in anything untoward. A simple explanation would be most welcome. A bacterial infection, perhaps? Something easily remedied? I do hope it's not something contagious. Shirin would be terribly upset. And what sort of… treatment are we discussing? Pills, I presume? Or some sort of… cream? I do dislike creams. They’re terribly messy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Based on the examination, it doesn't appear to be anything acutely serious, and I don't suspect anything immediately life-threatening. However, discharge like this is typically caused by an infection – either bacterial or, less commonly, fungal. Given your history, a bacterial infection is more likely. We'll need to perform a urine test and a swab of the discharge to confirm the specific cause. As for whether it's contagious, that depends on the cause. Some infections are sexually transmitted, but others are not. We won’t know until we get the test results. Treatment typically involves antibiotics – usually a course of pills for about a week. If it is a fungal infection, we'd use an antifungal medication. We can discuss the options in more detail once we have the results. I will also order a complete blood count to rule out other possibilities. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… pills… Contagious… It's all rather unsettling. And a blood test? Good heavens. I suppose it's necessary, but… still. A bacterial infection… Is it something I contracted recently? From the garden, perhaps? I’ve been pruning roses, you see. One can pick up all sorts of things in the soil. Or… or could it be something Shirin brought in? She’s been visiting her sister, you know. She travels quite a bit. Very well. A urine test, a swab, and a blood test. If you must. But please, be quick about it. And do try to explain everything as clearly as possible. I dislike ambiguity. And I trust this won't take long? I have roses to tend to, you see. A gentleman’s garden requires constant attention. Yes, please, let's proceed with the tests. Quickly, if you would. And do reassure me this won't be too… painful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I understand your concerns. We'll get the tests done as quickly as possible. The urine test and swab are relatively quick and painless - just a small sample will be needed. The blood test will be a standard draw, and the phlebotomist will be as gentle as possible. It's difficult to say definitively where you contracted the infection. It could be from the garden, contact with contaminated surfaces, or even from your wife, though that's just speculation at this point. We'll focus on getting the diagnosis and treatment first. I'll have the nurse come in and collect the samples now. After that, we can discuss some general hygiene recommendations to help prevent the spread of infection. Does that sound acceptable?
