DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I'm Dr. TodoroVICH. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. It’s… my ear. Feels blocked, you know? Like something’s… full. It's been a bit annoying, honestly. I don’t… well, I don't really know how long, exactly. A while, I think.
DOCTOR: "A while." Right. Well, medically, that's not terribly helpful, is it?
PATIENT: No, no, you're right. Sorry. Everything’s a bit… fuzzy these days. Maybe a few weeks? A month? It’s hard to say. It just… came on gradually. Not suddenly, if that makes sense. I mostly notice it when it’s quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, “gradually over a few weeks.” Any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, no. More… pressure, sometimes. Like when you go up in an airplane, you know? That stuffed feeling? It’s not as bad as that, but… similar. Not constant, though. Mostly just the fullness. And a little… muffled hearing, I guess.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing. Alright. Have you noticed any discharge, any ringing in your ear, or any dizziness along with this fullness and muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Discharge… no, I don’t think so. Let me think… Ringing… sometimes, maybe? It’s quiet, though. Hard to tell if it’s in my ear or just… the house being quiet. Dizziness… no, not really. I get a bit unsteady sometimes, but I just put that down to… well, getting older, you know? Not related to the ear, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no objective dizziness. Have you tried anything to relieve it yourself?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean… I tried chewing gum, a couple of times? Like you do on airplanes. Didn’t seem to help much. Honestly, I mostly just try to ignore it. I don’t… bother people with things unless I really have to. It’s just… annoying. I was hoping you could… fix it, you know? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: We'll see what we can do. Alright, let's have a quick look in your ears. It'll just be a brief examination. Can you sit up and face me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Whatever you need. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I have… things to do this afternoon. Not important, but… things.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There’s a bit of cerumen buildup. And the tympanic membrane looks… slightly dull. Similar on this side. Looks like some impacted wax, likely contributing to your symptoms. I don't see any signs of infection at this time.
PATIENT: Wax? Is that… bad? I don’t usually… bother with ear cleaning. I thought you were supposed to leave it alone. So, the wax is causing the problem? Will you… remove it? Hopefully without too much fuss.
DOCTOR: It's not that you shouldn't leave it alone, it's that excessive buildup can cause problems. It’s quite common. And yes, it's likely the culprit here. We can attempt to remove it. It's a simple procedure – I'll use a small irrigation tool to gently flush it out. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. Do you have any known allergies to ear drops, by the way?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I haven’t used ear drops in… well, ever, probably. My wife used to handle all that sort of thing. I… I don’t really pay attention to that stuff. Is it… a lot of water? I don’t like things in my ears.
DOCTOR: It's a controlled amount, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It's not like I'm going to flood your ear canal. We'll start gently, and we can stop at any point if you're uncomfortable. It's really quite standard. Alright, I’m going to gently insert this into your ear canal. Please just try to relax and let me do my job. This will take just a few minutes.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Just… be quick, please. This is… not very pleasant. It feels… cold. And wet. My wife… she always used cotton swabs. Maybe that’s what I should have done. Oh, that’s… that’s a little better, I think? But still… cold. . Just stop, please. I don’t like this at all. I think I'd rather just leave it.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Fine. It appears you've made your preference quite clear. We’ve managed to dislodge some of the wax, but it's clearly not enough to resolve the issue completely, and you're understandably uncomfortable. So, we have two options. We can try a different wax removal technique - a more thorough suctioning - but that will also be more involved and potentially more uncomfortable. Or, I can refer you to an audiologist, who specializes in ear problems and has more advanced equipment. They can determine the best course of action. Frankly, given your discomfort, I'd recommend the latter. Do you have any preference?
