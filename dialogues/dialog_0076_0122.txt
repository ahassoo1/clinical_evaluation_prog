DOCTOR: Right, Venus Alvara. 53 years old… Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Doctor Ruocco, thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, but I am noticing things. Things I forget. Small things, mostly. But more often now. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes. Not…large things, Doctor. I remember dates, names of people I should remember. But where I put my keys, what I went to the store for… these things escape me. And it is happening more frequently. It began, I think, after my husband passed. Though, the blood pressure has been… difficult to manage since then.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure, yes. Uncontrolled. And… after your husband’s passing. Right. So, this forgetfulness… is it interfering with your daily life?
PATIENT: It is becoming… troublesome, Doctor. I manage properties, you see. Real estate. Many details. I must remember appointments, payments… things like that. I worry I will make a mistake. A serious mistake. It is causing me… anxiety.
DOCTOR: Anxiety can do a lot of things. It’s not uncommon, especially with… life changes. We’ll do a basic cognitive assessment, just to be thorough. But I suspect it's stress. Now, have you been sleeping alright?
PATIENT: Doctor, I understand stress can cause many things. However, these are not simply worries. It feels… different. As for sleep… no. Not consistently. I wake often. Perhaps two, three times a night. It is difficult to fall back asleep, usually. I find myself…thinking. It is not restful.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Insomnia and forgetfulness. Let's get through this. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Sometimes…a slight dizziness. Not often, and not severe. And I have noticed…difficulty finding the correct words, sometimes. It is very frustrating. It is like… the word is on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot grasp it. It is… embarrassing. And my hands… they sometimes shake a little. Not constantly, but when I am… nervous. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Dizziness, word-finding difficulties, tremors… Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. No, not that I have noticed. Everything seems… the same. I wear glasses, you see. For reading. But my usual check-ups have been normal. Though it has been…some time since my last eye exam. Perhaps six months? A little longer, maybe. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any history of head injuries?
PATIENT: Head injuries? No, Doctor. Nothing significant. A few bumps as a child, of course. Nothing that required a visit to the hospital. Just… minor falls. Nothing recent, certainly. I am quite careful, you see. I always have been.
DOCTOR: Okay. Family history?
PATIENT: Family history… my mother, she had… some problems with memory, towards the end of her life. But it was dismissed as “old age”, you see. She lived to be 87. My father was healthy, very healthy. No such problems. It was… difficult to tell, honestly. They lived in Russia, and medical care was…different. Not as thorough as here. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. I prefer not to take them, if possible. I try to manage everything myself. A healthy diet, regular walking… But with the blood pressure, it has been…difficult. My usual doctor suggested medication, but I… I have been hesitant. I do not like the side effects, you see. I prefer…natural remedies. Though I understand they are not always effective.
DOCTOR: Uncontrolled blood pressure and… natural remedies. Right. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes and do a neurological assessment. Can you follow my finger?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. I can follow your finger. Please, do what you need to do. I am… anxious to know what is happening. I want to manage this, you see. I do not want this to… worsen.
DOCTOR: Okay, follow my finger. Don’t move your head. Good. Now, close your eyes… Can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can feel that. A little… cold. Is that normal? It feels… distant, perhaps. Not quite as strong as I would expect. But yes, I feel it.
DOCTOR: Reflexes slightly diminished bilaterally. Strength appears normal. Now, stand up. I want to see your gait. Walk for me. Nice and slow. A little unsteady, but within normal limits. Alright. I'm ordering some blood work. A complete metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. And I want you to schedule an MRI of the brain. We need to rule out anything structural.
PATIENT: An MRI, Doctor? Is that… serious? What are you looking for, specifically? I understand you must be thorough, but… my heart is racing a little. Is there something you suspect? And the blood work… how long will that take? I have many appointments tomorrow.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mrs. Alvara. Don’t jump to conclusions. The MRI will rule out a stroke, a tumor… things like that. As for the blood work, the lab is right down the hall. Should be a couple of hours. I’ll have the results sent to my office, and we can discuss them next week. In the meantime, try to relax. And please, consider talking to your primary care physician about blood pressure medication. It’s important for your overall health. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I believe that is all. Thank you for your time. Though I am… worried. An MRI is a very…significant test. I will speak with my primary care physician about the medication, as you suggest. I just… I hope it is nothing serious. I have many responsibilities. I will wait for the results, then. Thank you again, Doctor. .
