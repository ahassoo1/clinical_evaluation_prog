DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Villarreal, yes. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hi Doctor. Look, I don't really have a lot of time. Just… I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be easy, you know? My husband… well, he passed, and I don't want any complications. I’m not getting any younger, and frankly, I just want a baby without a fuss. Is that… is that possible?
DOCTOR: "Easy" isn’t a medical term we often use, Ms. Villarreal. It’s…a complex process, regardless. But I understand your desire for a straightforward path. You’re 43, and recently widowed, I see. We’ll certainly want to assess your overall health and potential factors that could impact conception. Have you been trying for a while now?
PATIENT: Trying? Not… not really. It hasn’t been long since… everything. Honestly, I just figured it would happen, you know? Like it did before. But I've heard stories, and I don't want to be one of those women. I want to make sure everything’s… working properly, if you catch my drift. Is there a test for that? A quick one? I really don’t have time for a lot of poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: A “quick test,” as you put it, will give us limited information. But we can start with some basic blood work to check your hormone levels – FSH, estradiol, AMH, that sort of thing. That will give us a baseline idea of your ovarian reserve. It is possible for fertility to decline with age, though everyone is different. And, naturally, we’ll need a full medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A medical history… Honestly, it’s been a while since I had to think about all that. Um… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, and… I think I had the flu a few times? I really don't remember details. And, well, there was my husband's… everything. That was… a lot. Do you need to know about that? It wasn’t… a healthy situation, towards the end. But I just want to know if I can get pregnant, Doctor. Not relive old… things.
DOCTOR: While the details of your husband’s health aren’t directly relevant to your fertility, a significant stressor like that can impact hormonal balance. But we’ll focus on you. Let's skip the details for now. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so. I’m not really one for taking pills, if I can help it. Maybe penicillin? I think I had a reaction once, years ago. But it wasn’t… awful. Just a rash, I think. Really, I just want to get this done, if you understand. I don't want to be doing this forever. Can we just run some tests and tell me if it’s going to be… a problem?
DOCTOR: A rash could indicate a penicillin allergy, yes. It's important we document that. And I understand your desire for expediency, Ms. Villarreal, truly. However, a comprehensive evaluation is… prudent. Beyond the blood work, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, including a pelvic exam. That allows us to assess your reproductive organs directly. It's standard procedure. And frankly, it's much more informative than simply running tests.
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Really, Doctor? I just told you I don’t have time for poking and prodding! I’m not… I don’t understand why that’s necessary. I'm 43, not… broken! Just tell me if my numbers are good, and I can go on with my life. This is ridiculous. I thought doctors were supposed to help people, not… interrogate them.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, with all due respect, a physical examination is not an interrogation. It's a fundamental component of medical care. It allows me to rule out any structural abnormalities that could be impacting your ability to conceive. And I assure you, it is a quick and discreet process. I understand your hesitation, but proceeding without it would be… irresponsible. If you are unwilling to allow a basic physical exam, I'm afraid I cannot provide you with a reliable assessment. I can, of course, refer you to another physician.
PATIENT: You know what? Never mind. I’ll find another doctor. One who actually listens to their patients. This is a waste of my time. Good day.
DOCTOR: As you wish, Ms. Villarreal. Perhaps a second opinion will be more… suitable. .
