DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, nice to meet you too. Uh... travel, I think? My wife... she booked something. I don't really... remember where. Somewhere far, I guess. She always liked the... fancy places. Now she not here, so... I need to go. Doctor said I need… shots? For travel?
DOCTOR: Okay, travel vaccinations. That makes sense. And you're seeing me to discuss what you might need before your trip. It’s good you're getting this sorted out beforehand. Just to clarify, you said your wife booked the trip…and she's not with you now?
PATIENT: Yeah. She… passed. Last year. She did all the planning. Always did. I just… go where she said. Now I need to go… somewhere. She booked it before… you know. And they said I need these… things, for travel. For the germs? I don’t even know where I’m going.
DOCTOR: I am so very sorry to hear about your wife. That must be incredibly difficult. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed right now, especially with trying to manage travel plans she arranged. It's perfectly alright that you don't know all the details. We can absolutely work through this. Let's start with what information do you have?
PATIENT: Not much. Ticket… says Kathmandu to… Paris. Then… something else? Some island. A small one. She liked small islands. I think it was… Fiji? Maybe? They sent me some papers. Lots of writing. I didn't read it. Too much. Just… the ticket and… this card for the doctor. That's why I'm here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kathmandu to Paris, then possibly Fiji. That gives us a good starting point. And you have the travel card, excellent. Do you happen to know when your trip is scheduled to depart?
PATIENT: Here. August 15th. That's… soon. She booked it for… our anniversary. It was supposed to be… special. Now… it’s just… a trip.
DOCTOR: August 15th. Yes, that’s approaching quickly. It’s understandable that this feels… complicated, given the circumstances. Let me quickly check what vaccinations are typically recommended or required for France and Fiji. Just to give you a complete picture, have you had any vaccinations in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I remember. Maybe when I was little? In Nepal? But… I don’t have the papers. She kept all the papers. Everything. I just… work. Build the airplanes. Not think about… this kind of thing. She did it all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We’ll proceed as if you haven’t had any recent vaccinations. It's always best to be cautious. Given your travel itinerary and the short timeframe, we need to prioritize. The typical recommendations for France don’t usually require much beyond a standard tetanus booster, but Fiji has a few more considerations. Do you know if you've ever had a hepatitis A or typhoid vaccination?
PATIENT: Hepa… what? And… tie-foid? No. No, I don’t think so. Sounds… complicated. Like the things she used to talk about. About… germs and… diseases. I just… went where she told me to go. I fix airplanes. Not… doctors.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Odell. You fix airplanes, and that’s important work. I'll handle the "doctor" part. Hepatitis A and typhoid are important to consider for Fiji, as they can be contracted through contaminated food and water. To be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I take… some pills sometimes. For my back. From working. But… no, nothing I know of. She always asked about allergies, but… I never had any. I don’t think. Just… the back pills. Sometimes they make me… sleepy. But that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies, and you experience some drowsiness with your back pain medication. That’s good to know. Let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline, and then we can discuss the necessary vaccinations. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Like… poking and… prodding? I don’t… really like doctors. But… if you need to. I just want to get this done. So I can… go. And… maybe visit her. Wherever she is. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. I just want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your general health. First, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Okay. Just… be quick. It makes me… nervous, all this. She always… held my hand. When I got shots.
DOCTOR: I understand. This is perfectly normal to feel anxious. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Taking a deep breath can help. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That's slightly elevated, but not concerning at the moment. We can discuss that briefly at the end if you'd like. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay. It… feels tight. Like when I climb the ladder. Hard to breathe. But… okay. Is something… wrong? She always… knew what was wrong. Before I even said anything.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don't hear any wheezing or unusual sounds. The slight tightness you feel is likely related to the anxiety and the fact that you mentioned it’s difficult for you to breathe when climbing ladders - perhaps some mild exertion. Now, I'm just going to quickly check your temperature and pulse. Temperature is normal at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and your pulse is 72 beats per minute. Everything seems within normal limits.
PATIENT: Normal? That’s… good. She always said I was… strong. Even though I didn’t feel it. So… the shots? Can we… get it over with now? I want to go home. And… make arrangements. For the trip. Even if it’s… just me.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We can proceed with the vaccinations now. Based on your travel itinerary and lack of prior vaccination records, I recommend the hepatitis A vaccine, the typhoid vaccine, and a tetanus booster. These vaccines will help protect you from potential infections during your travels. They may cause some mild side effects, such as soreness at the injection site or a low-grade fever, but these are usually temporary. Do you have any questions about the vaccines before we begin?
PATIENT: No. Just… do it. Quick. I don’t like needles. She always… rubbed my arm after. To make it feel better. Just… get it over with. Please.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'll also rub your arm afterward. Okay, that's the first one. It's quick, right?
PATIENT: Yeah. Quick. But… not nice. Just… how many more? Please tell me it's not many. I don’t think I can… do many.
DOCTOR: Just two more, Odell. This one is the typhoid vaccine, and it will go into the opposite arm. There you go. That's number two. And finally, we’ll just need a quick tetanus booster to ensure you're fully protected. It's a very small injection. And that’s it. All done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Sore. Both arms… sore. And… dizzy. A little. Is it… normal to feel like this? She always… made me lie down after. With a cold compress. Do I need to… lie down?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's perfectly normal to feel a little sore and dizzy after vaccinations, especially when receiving multiple injections at once. Your blood pressure is still slightly elevated, but nothing to be overly concerned about at the moment. It's a good idea to sit and rest for about 15 minutes before you leave. We have a comfortable chair in the waiting room. I can also get you a cold compress if you’d like. Just relax and take some deep breaths. The dizziness should subside shortly. Would you like me to get you anything?
PATIENT: A cold compress… yes, please. That would be… nice. Like she used to do. Thank you. You’ve been… patient. Even though I was… difficult. She always said I was… stubborn.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Odell. It's my job to make you feel as comfortable as possible. And you weren't difficult at all. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about vaccinations, especially given your situation. Here you go. Place this on your arm. It should help with the soreness. Let's sit here for a few minutes, and I’ll document everything in your chart. We can also briefly discuss some preventative measures to take during your travels, such as food and water safety. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay. That… feels better. Thank you. Food… and water? She always… packed everything. Disinfectant wipes… special water bottles… everything. I never had to… think about it. What do I need to… know? Just… the basics. Please. Don’t… overwhelm me.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll keep it simple. The most important thing is to be cautious about what you eat and drink. Always drink bottled or boiled water. Avoid ice cubes, as they may be made from contaminated water. When eating out, choose restaurants that appear clean and hygienic. Make sure your food is thoroughly cooked and served hot. Avoid raw or undercooked meats, seafood, and eggs. And be cautious about fruits and vegetables. Wash them thoroughly with bottled water or peel them yourself. These simple precautions will significantly reduce your risk of getting sick during your travels. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No. Too much. I… remember. Sort of. She always… said the same things. Bottled water… hot food… wash everything. I just… want to go. And… visit her. Even if it’s… just the place. Is that… okay? To just… go? Even if I’m… sad?
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. It is absolutely okay to go. It is more than okay. It is good to go. Grief is a complex process, and there’s no right or wrong way to cope with it. Traveling to a place that was special to your wife, even if you're feeling sad, can be a healing experience. Don’t feel pressured to do anything you’re not ready for. Take your time, and allow yourself to grieve in your own way. I've documented everything in your chart, including the vaccinations and travel advice. Here's a copy of your vaccination record for your reference. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s all. Thank you. For everything. You’ve been… very kind. I just… need to go home now. And… pack. And… try to remember. Thank you. Really. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Odell. Take care of yourself, and safe travels. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns down the line. .
