DOCTOR: Hi Claudene, welcome. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Thank you. Well, it's… my water. I keep getting sick, you see. It’s… a trouble, really. Happens again and again. I don't… well, I don't recall exactly when it started, but it’s been a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You've been experiencing some sickness related to the water you're drinking, and it's been going on for a little while. To help me figure out what's going on, can you tell me a little more about what you mean by "sick"?
PATIENT: Oh dear. “Sick”... yes. It’s… a burning. When I… go to the bathroom. And a pain, low down. It’s not… comfortable, not at all. Sometimes I feel a bit chilly too, afterwards. It just comes and goes, you see. I don't… I don't really know what else to say. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. So, burning with urination, lower abdominal pain, and sometimes chills afterward. Does it happen every time you use the bathroom, or is it more intermittent?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Inter… intermittent? I… no, not every time. No. Sometimes I'm fine for a bit, and then it comes back. It’s… unpredictable, really. I wish I could tell you more clearly. It's just… a nuisance, mostly.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Claudene. You're doing great. "Intermittent" just means it comes and goes. Okay, so it’s unpredictable. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any unusual odor?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I… I don’t think so. I haven’t looked, if that makes sense. I just… go when I need to, and then… well, you know. And odor? I… I can’t say I’ve noticed anything different. I don’t have a very good sense of smell, these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. No blood noticed and no change in odor that you’ve detected. Have you had any fever, or felt generally unwell – like tired, achy, or nauseous – along with these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Sometimes, I feel… a bit weak. And tired, you’re right. Not all the time, but when the… the burning is bad, I just want to lie down. Achy… sometimes my back aches a little. Nauseous… no, I don’t think so. I eat alright, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. So, weakness, tiredness, and some back pain when the burning is worse. Now, let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical… history. Well, I was… divorced, a long time ago. Does that count? No, seriously… I don’t… I don’t really have any medical conditions, as far as I know. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I try to stay healthy. I eat my vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions and haven’t been to the doctor in a while. That's good you're trying to stay healthy. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A long, long time ago. And… I think I had a stitch or two after I fell off a bicycle when I was younger, but that was hardly a surgery. Nothing… major, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a few stitches. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Sometimes my skin gets a bit itchy, but that’s just… old age, I think. I don’t take many medicines. Just a little something for my joints sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies besides some occasional itchy skin. What medication do you take for your joints, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… Ibuprofen. The… the blue tablets. When they ache really bad. Not every day, you understand. Only when I need them. I get them at the… at the shop, you know. The one down the road. I don’t… I don’t know the proper name.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for joint pain. Now, are you currently taking any other vitamins, herbal supplements, or over-the-counter medications besides the ibuprofen?
PATIENT: No, no. Just the ibuprofen. I don't really believe in all that… fancy stuff. Vitamins and… supplements. I try to get what I need from my food. Plain and simple, you see. I don’t want to be taking a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, just ibuprofen as needed. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do any of your close family members have any medical conditions, like kidney problems, urinary issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family… That’s a bit tricky. My… my husband’s mother… she had trouble with her legs, I think. And my sister, she had… something with her stomach. But I don’t really remember the details. It was a long time ago. We weren’t very close, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, some leg trouble with your husband’s mother and stomach issues with your sister. Finally, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… history? Oh my. What does that even… mean? I live alone, now. I used to work, repairing… those big holiday homes, you see? Recreational Vehicles, they called them. But I'm retired now. I mostly… read and… watch television. I don’t go out much.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone, retired from repairing Recreational Vehicles, and mostly read and watch television. And do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not me. Never. I drink… tea. Sometimes, with a biscuit. And that’s it. I don't smoke, never have. And… those other things… well, that’s not my style. A quiet life, you see. That’s what I prefer.
DOCTOR: Okay, just tea and biscuits, no smoking or recreational drug use. Thank you, Claudene. That gives me a good picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen, check your back, and I'll also want to do a simple urine test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A test? Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have… a program on television I like. But… yes. Do what you need to do. Quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It won't take long, I promise. Alright, everything seems fairly normal so far. Now, if you could just give me a urine sample?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. The… sample. Where… where am I supposed to…? Is there a… a private room? I feel a bit silly, asking.
DOCTOR: Of course. There's a private bathroom just down the hall. I'll leave you a cup, and you can just bring it back when you're finished. It's perfectly normal, Claudene. Take your time. I'll be right outside when you're ready.
PATIENT: Oh. Thank you, Doctor. I hope… I hope I remember how to do it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Claudene. Okay, the dipstick shows some leukocytes and nitrites present in your urine. This suggests a possible urinary tract infection. It's not definitive, but it's a good starting point. We should also do a microscopic analysis to confirm and identify any bacteria present. It will take about 15 minutes. In the meantime, do you feel any pain when you urinate now?
PATIENT: Oh dear. An infection? That doesn’t sound pleasant. Fifteen minutes… very well. Pain… yes, a little. It’s not terrible, but… it’s there. A burning sensation, you see. It’s worse at the end. Just a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. That confirms my suspicion. While we wait for the full analysis, I want to be upfront. A urinary tract infection, if left untreated, can become more serious. We need to start treatment as soon as possible. I'm going to prescribe you an antibiotic. It's called Nitrofurantoin. You'll take one hundred milligrams orally three times a day for seven days. Do you have any known allergies to sulfa drugs?
PATIENT: Sulfa… drugs? Oh my. I don’t… I don’t think so. I’ve never heard of them. I haven't taken anything… complicated, ever. I just… take the Ibuprofen, when I need to. But no. No allergies, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Nitrofurantoin is generally well-tolerated, but some side effects can include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. It can also turn your urine a darker color, which is harmless. It's important to finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better before the seven days are up. Now, this is really important. If you develop a fever, chills, back pain, or if the burning sensation gets significantly worse, you need to go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Those could be signs of a kidney infection. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A kidney infection… that sounds very serious indeed. Fever, chills… yes. And… back pain. I understand. Finish the medicine, even if I feel better. And go to the hospital if… those things happen. It seems… a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: I understand it's a lot, Claudene. Here, I’ve made a quick summary for you. We also need to talk about prevention. Drinking plenty of water helps flush out bacteria, and it's important to urinate when you feel the urge. Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… kind of you. Thank you. Water… and go when I need to. Yes. No. Not anymore. I’m… divorced, you see. Been divorced for a very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That's good to know. Even if you are not sexually active, it's still important to maintain good hygiene to prevent infections. Now, do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No. I… I don’t think so. You’ve been very patient with me, Doctor. It’s… a lot to take in. I just hope I can remember everything. And I hope this medicine works. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Claudene. I understand it's a lot to process, and you've been a very good patient. If you do have any questions later, don't hesitate to call the office. We're here to help. Please, get some rest, drink plenty of water, and follow the instructions carefully. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to make sure the infection is clearing up. Do you need a work note for any time off?
PATIENT: Oh. A work note… no. No, thank you. I’m retired, you see. I don’t work anymore. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. .
