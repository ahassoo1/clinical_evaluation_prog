DOCTOR: Hi Amy, welcome. I'm Crystale Rosanova, but you can call me Crystale. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s very nice to meet you too, Crystale. Thank you for having me. Well, I’ve been noticing a… a lump, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. That's definitely good thinking to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's… not particularly painful, to be honest. More of a… constant awareness of it, if that makes sense? It doesn’t hurt to touch, really. I first noticed it maybe a month or two ago, and I haven't really noticed it getting much bigger, but it hasn’t gone away either. It just… is there.
DOCTOR: Alright, a constant awareness, not painful to the touch, and present for a month or two without significant change in size. That’s helpful. To get a better picture, could you describe the lump itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It feels… firm, but not hard, you know? Like, if you pressed on it, it would give a little. It’s… roughly round, I suppose, maybe the size of a golf ball? Though, it’s difficult to be precise. It’s not right on the surface, either – you have to feel for it a bit. It's sort of… under the skin a little. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a much clearer idea. Firm but with some give, roughly golf ball sized, and located somewhat under the skin. Do you notice any changes with it – like if it feels different at certain times of the month, or after you eat, or when you’re more active?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I hadn’t really thought about it specifically… Now that you mention it, I think it feels slightly… fuller, maybe, after I’ve eaten a large meal. But it's very subtle. And I don't think it changes any other time, honestly. I haven’t noticed anything different with activity or… well, with anything else, really. My wife hasn’t noticed anything either, and she’s usually pretty observant.
DOCTOR: Okay, subtle fullness after a large meal, but otherwise no significant changes. That’s good information. Now, let’s back up a bit. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this lump?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. No, not really. I haven’t had any pain, like you asked before. No fever, no weight loss, no changes in my bowel habits… nothing like that. I’ve felt perfectly healthy otherwise, to be honest. That’s why I almost didn’t bother coming in, but it just… felt like I should get it checked out, you know? Just to be safe.
DOCTOR: I completely understand—it's always best to be cautious and get things checked out when you have a concern. Now, let’s go through some of your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing – but nothing serious. No surgeries, no major injuries… I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of either. My wife says I’m annoyingly healthy! I do have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear! No significant medical history is always a good thing. And Medicare is definitely relevant, thank you for letting me know. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my parents are both still living, and they’re both in reasonably good health for their age. My father has high blood pressure, and my mother has arthritis, but nothing major. As far as I know, there's no history of cancer in the immediate family – no grandparents or aunts and uncles who’ve had it, anyway. It's a fairly small family, to be honest. My wife’s family… she says her grandmother had something with her stomach, years ago, but I don’t know the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, no immediate family history of cancer, and only some minor health concerns in your parents. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those, thankfully. I’ve never been a smoker. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a month, but I don't drink regularly. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to eat a healthy diet – lots of fruits and vegetables – and I try to get regular exercise, though my choreography keeps me pretty active anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very good. No smoking, minimal alcohol, healthy diet and active lifestyle. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, can you tell me about your work?
PATIENT: Certainly. I'm a choreographer. I’ve been doing it professionally for about ten years now. It’s… physically demanding work, actually. Lots of long hours on my feet, demonstrating steps, adjusting positions… it's quite a bit of activity. It also involves a fair bit of travel, though that's been reduced recently. I’m married, as I mentioned, and my wife is very supportive. She helps me manage the travel and keeps me grounded. It's a demanding job, but I enjoy it very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a demanding but fulfilling career as a choreographer. That information is helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if that's alright with you. It’ll just involve me listening to your abdomen with a stethoscope and feeling for the lump we discussed. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgement completely. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could lie back on the exam table, that would be fantastic. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen first, then gently feel for the lump. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, I’ve palpated the lump. It's approximately two centimeters in diameter, firm but not hard, and a little tender when I press on it. It doesn't seem to be connected to any deeper tissues, which is good. I'm also not detecting any other abnormalities in your abdomen. However, it's difficult to determine the exact cause without further investigation. Given your history and the physical exam findings, I'd like to order a few tests just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. I appreciate you being thorough. Ordering some tests sounds perfectly alright with me. What sort of tests are you thinking of? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’m thinking we should start with a complete blood count to rule out any infection or underlying blood disorders. Then, I'd like to order a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. And finally, I’d like to get an abdominal ultrasound to get a better image of the lump and see what it looks like internally. That will help us determine if it's a cyst, a lipoma, or something else entirely. These tests can usually be done at the clinic's lab, and the results should be back within a few days. Would you like me to schedule those for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please, that would be wonderful. Scheduling them now sounds perfect. A few days sounds reasonable. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Crystale. It puts my mind at ease knowing we’re being thorough. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Anything I should avoid eating or drinking beforehand?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I can reassure you. For the CBC and CMP, you don't need to do any specific preparation—you can eat and drink as normal. However, for the abdominal ultrasound, you'll need to fast for six to eight hours beforehand—that means no food or drink after midnight tonight. You can still take your regular medications unless I've specifically told you otherwise. I’ll schedule you for these tests first thing tomorrow morning. They shouldn’t take too long. After the tests are completed, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Fasting overnight is no problem at all. And I'll continue taking my medications as usual. First thing tomorrow morning works great. Thank you so much for being so clear and patient with me. I really appreciate it. A follow-up appointment to discuss the results sounds excellent. I suppose there’s nothing more to do for today then?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm happy to help. No, there's nothing more to do for today. Just remember to fast overnight, and we'll see you tomorrow morning for the tests. I'll have the lab technician expect you. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good evening, and try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Crystale. I appreciate your kindness and reassurance. I will try not to worry. And I will definitely call if anything comes up. Have a good evening as well.
