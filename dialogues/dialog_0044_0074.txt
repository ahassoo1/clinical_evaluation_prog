DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Steines. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Just Venna is fine. My blood pressure’s been actin’ up, that’s what my sister told me to come about. She worries somethin’ awful. Been feelin’ a little tired too, but mostly just…old, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Venna, that’s perfect. It’s good your sister looks out for you. High blood pressure is something we definitely want to take a look at. And feeling tired is important too, especially at any age. When you say “actin’ up,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I don’t really feel it, ya know? My sister, Darla, she’s a nurse, she checks it when she visits. She says it's too high a couple of times now. I mostly just notice I get kinda breathless walkin’ up the steps to my porch, and sometimes my head feels a little…full. Not a headache exactly, just…heavy. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Venna. It's very common for high blood pressure to not have obvious symptoms, and those feelings – the breathlessness and the heaviness in your head – those are both things that can be related. So Darla's been checking your blood pressure – that's good of her. Do you happen to know what the readings have been, if she wrote them down?
PATIENT: She does write ‘em down, bless her heart. Let me see… Here it is. Last week it was… 150 over 90, she said. And the week before that, 145 over 95. She kept sayin’ numbers at me, but I mostly just remember them bein’ high. I don’t rightly know what that means, just that Darla looked worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, 150/90 and 145/95 – yes, those are a bit elevated. Generally, we like to see blood pressure below 130/80. So Darla is right to be concerned, and it’s good you came in to get it checked. Now, let’s get a better picture of things. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure myself. Then we can talk a little more about your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, Doctor. I don’t mind a bit of checkin’. Never been one to shy away from the doctor, though I don’t come often. Just when somethin's botherin’ me, or Darla makes me. Go ahead, then.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Venna. We only need to see you when you need us. Alright, let’s start with your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. And another one… Okay, your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Your pulse is a bit strong, but not overly concerning. And your blood pressure… 158 over 92 right now. Consistent with what Darla's readings were. I’m also noting you have a slightly increased heart rate. Now, to get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your health history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, like diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh my. 158, huh? That is high, ain’t it? Let me think… No, nothin' major, really. When I was a little girl, I had the measles, and chickenpox, of course. But as an adult? No. I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder a long time ago, had it taken out when I was maybe fifty. And my arthritis bothers me somethin' awful when it rains, but Doc always just told me to take some pills for it. Oh! And I had a hysterectomy when I was 38. But that was a long time ago. I don’t rightly recall any other diagnoses, if that makes sense. I try not to dwell on things.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Venna. Measles and chickenpox, gallbladder removal, hysterectomy, and arthritis… thank you for sharing that. It’s good to have a complete picture. And you're right, it’s best not to dwell, but it’s important to know what we’re working with. Now, regarding your arthritis, what kind of pills are you taking for that?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Here it is. Naproxen, 500 milligrams. I take two of ‘em usually, when my joints are botherin’ me. Sometimes three, if it’s a really bad day. Darla says I shouldn’t take so many, but it’s the only thing that helps the pain sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen 500mg. It’s good you mention that. Naproxen, like other NSAIDs, can sometimes raise blood pressure, and it can also affect your kidneys. It's something we need to consider. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything put in front of me, bless my soul. I used to get a little itchy sometimes when I was a girl and played in the poison ivy, but that was a long time ago. And I never had any trouble with penicillin or nothin’ like that. I can’t think of a thing I’m allergic to, Doctor. Though, Darla always makes me careful with shellfish. Says a lot of folks her age have reactions to it, so I mostly just avoid it. Better safe than sorry, she says.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Venna. No known allergies, just Darla’s wise advice about shellfish. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there a history of high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, Lord. Yes. My daddy… he had high blood pressure, I reckon. He didn’t take care of himself much, smoked like a chimney, and ate salt with everything. He had a stroke when he was about seventy, it took him quick. And my grandma on my mother’s side, she had heart trouble. Weak heart, they said. She was a good woman, but she didn’t live to be very old. It seems like it runs in the family, don’t it?
DOCTOR: It does seem that way, Venna. A family history of high blood pressure and heart disease is definitely a factor we need to consider. Knowing this helps us understand your risk and plan the best course of action. Finally, just a few questions about your daily life. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Lord, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My daddy smoked enough for all of us, thank you very much. And I don’t drink either. Not a drop. Used to take a little sip of wine with my husband on special occasions, but he's been gone a long time now. Mostly just drink water, these days. And a little bit of sweet tea when I’m feelin’ fancy.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Venna. No smoking, minimal alcohol, and mostly water. That's a very healthy lifestyle choice. Okay, I think I have a good understanding of your health history now. Based on what you’ve told me, and the readings I’ve taken, it seems likely you have essential hypertension – high blood pressure without a clear cause. Your family history and Naproxen use are contributing factors to consider. To get a better picture of the impact of your blood pressure on your heart and kidneys, I’d like to order some blood tests and an EKG. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests, huh? Well, I suppose so. I don’t much like needles, but if it’ll help figure out what’s goin’ on… Yes, alright. Do what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just… try to be quick, if you can.
DOCTOR: I understand, Venna. I will certainly be as quick as possible. The blood tests will check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and some other important markers. The EKG will look at the electrical activity of your heart. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now, and we can get the EKG done right here in the room. In the meantime, I'm going to start you on a low dose of a medication called Lisinopril. It’s an ACE inhibitor that can help lower your blood pressure. We’ll monitor your blood pressure closely to see how you respond. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Lisinopril, you say? Never heard of it. Medication… I don’t rightly like the sound of that. But… if you think it'll help, I suppose I'll try it. Just… what kind of side effects does it have? And will it interact with my arthritis pills? I don't want to be stoppin' and startin' everythin', ya know?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Venna. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned about starting a new medication. Lisinopril is generally well-tolerated, but some common side effects can include a dry cough, dizziness, and fatigue. It can also sometimes affect your kidney function, which is why we're doing the blood tests. As for interacting with your Naproxen, yes, that’s something we need to consider. Both medications can affect your kidneys, so taking them together can increase the risk of kidney problems. We will monitor your kidney function closely. If your kidney function is borderline, we may need to adjust your Naproxen dosage or consider a different pain reliever. We will make sure everything is safe. I'll write you a prescription for a low dose of Lisinopril, and I'll give you some information about the medication and potential side effects. If you experience any concerning symptoms, like severe dizziness, swelling in your feet, or difficulty breathing, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Swelling in my feet… that happens sometimes, especially when it rains. Could that be from the blood pressure, or somethin' else? And… will this pill make me feel tired? I don't need to be feelin' any more tired than I already am.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Venna. Swelling in your feet, especially when it rains, could be related to the high blood pressure, or it could be due to other factors like arthritis or venous insufficiency. We'll need to monitor it closely to see if it worsens after starting Lisinopril. If it does, we may need to investigate further. And yes, Lisinopril can sometimes cause fatigue, especially when you first start taking it. It's usually temporary, and it often improves as your body adjusts to the medication. However, if you experience significant fatigue, we can adjust the dosage or consider a different medication. We will get you started with a low dose and see how it goes. I'll also recommend some lifestyle changes that can help lower your blood pressure, like reducing your salt intake, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and go over the instructions for taking Lisinopril. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
