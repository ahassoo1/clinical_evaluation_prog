DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s my breathing. It's been… difficult. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. I don’t… I don’t quite remember when it started, exactly. It just… gradually got worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficult breathing and dryness in your mouth and eyes. It's good you came in to get it checked out. “Gradually got worse” is helpful – can you tell me a bit more about how it’s gotten worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I find myself… needing to take more breaths to do… simple things. Like walking across the room. Or even talking for a little while. And the dryness… it’s constant. It doesn’t… go away, even when I drink water. I’m not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Kobler. Thank you for explaining that so clearly. So, more breaths needed for simple activities, and the dryness persists despite drinking water. Has this been interfering with your daily life at all?
PATIENT: Yes… it has. I… I write, you see. Stories. And it’s… hard to concentrate when I’m feeling so… breathless. And the dry eyes… they make it difficult to read, and certainly to look at the computer screen for very long. It means… I haven't been writing as much. Which… is upsetting.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very frustrating, Ms. Kobler. It's important to address things that are impacting your quality of life, and especially things you enjoy. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Before we move on, can you describe the type of breathing difficulty you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. It isn't… like I’m wheezing, or coughing. It’s more… like I can’t get enough air. Like my lungs are… tight, maybe? And it feels like it takes extra effort to pull each breath in. It isn't painful, exactly, just… tiring. I hope that makes sense. I am… not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: You're explaining it perfectly well, Ms. Kobler. Don't worry about being "good" at it - you’re doing great. “Can’t get enough air,” “lungs feel tight,” and “extra effort to pull each breath” are all very helpful descriptions. Now, let's go through some other things to get a fuller picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the breathing issues and dryness?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. I… I have been feeling more tired than usual, yes. And… sometimes my heart feels like it’s racing a little bit, even when I’m not doing anything strenuous. And… oh! I've been having a little bit of trouble sleeping. I wake up feeling… unrested, even if I’ve been in bed for a long time. I don’t… I don’t know if that is related.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Increased fatigue, a racing heart, and trouble sleeping. Those could be related, yes. Have you had any fever, chills, or recent weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And… no, I haven’t lost any weight, I don’t think. I… I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes feel the same. I’ve… perhaps even gained a little weight, if anything, because I haven’t been as active. Mostly because of the… breathing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or recent weight loss. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: That is… a tricky question. I… I was divorced some years ago. Does that count? No, seriously… I don’t… I don’t really remember being diagnosed with anything, Doctor. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, mumps… things like that. But nothing… serious. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in… well, quite a long time. I am… not very good at keeping track of these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kobler. Divorce definitely doesn't count as a medical condition! And it’s very common for people to not see a doctor regularly. Childhood illnesses are good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No… no surgeries. And… no hospitalizations. Not that I remember, anyway. I… I broke my arm when I was a child, I think. But that was… a long time ago. And it wasn’t a serious break. Just… a cast for a few weeks. I… I’m trying to remember if I had… tonsils removed? But I… I really can’t be sure. It was so long ago. I apologize for being so… vague.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Kobler. It's very helpful to know what you do remember, even if it's just that you don't recall something. No surgeries or hospitalizations is good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. My family… we weren't very close. I… I didn't grow up with my parents. And I don't have any siblings. I… I don't really know much about their medical history. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, I think she had… arthritis? But I’m not sure. It was… a long time ago. And no one really talked about these things, even then. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kobler. It’s not your responsibility to know your family’s medical history if that information wasn’t available to you. It's good to know what you do know, and it’s perfectly acceptable that you don’t have much information. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. And… I do not use any other tobacco products either. I… I find the smell quite unpleasant, actually. I prefer the fresh air. I… I used to spend a lot of time outdoors, when I was younger. But… not so much lately. Because of… well, you know. The breathing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. Perhaps… one or two glasses of wine a week? Sometimes. When I’m… feeling particularly stressed. Or… lonely. But… not very often. And… never to excess. I… I don’t enjoy the feeling of being… unwell. Even a little bit. It… interferes with my writing.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional alcohol use. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not. I… I haven’t been taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements. I… I prefer to… avoid them, if possible. I… I’m not sure I trust them, really. I prefer to try and… manage things on my own. If I can. Which… isn’t always possible, I suppose. That's why I am here.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Thank you, Ms. Kobler. That gives me a good overall picture of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your throat and eyes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. Please, do what you need to do. I… I trust your judgment. I… I am ready when you are. I… I hope you can find out what is wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Please relax your arm. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not critically high. Pulse is 88, also a bit on the higher side. When I listen to your lungs, I hear some slightly diminished breath sounds, particularly towards the bases. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a very faint… murmur. It’s quite subtle, but worth noting. Your throat appears a bit dry, but no obvious inflammation. Your eyes… are also dry, with some mild injection. Based on what you've told me and what I've heard during the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The diminished breath sounds and the murmur suggest a possible cardiac or pulmonary issue. The fatigue, racing heart, and trouble sleeping could be related to either of those. The dryness could be a separate issue or related to an underlying condition. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some tests. I recommend a complete blood count , a basic metabolic panel , an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds sensible. Please, order whatever tests you think are necessary. I… I want to find out what is wrong. And… hopefully, get it fixed. I… I trust your judgment. Whatever you need, please just let me know. I… I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’m ordering those tests now. The lab will call you to schedule an appointment for blood work. The X-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street – I’ll give you a referral slip. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. This usually takes a few days. In the meantime, I recommend you stay hydrated. Avoid strenuous activity that makes your breathing worse. And if your symptoms suddenly worsen – if you experience severe chest pain, difficulty breathing at rest, or feel like you’re going to pass out – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You have explained everything very clearly. Just… one thing. Will these tests… be painful? I… I am not very good with needles.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Kobler. And it’s perfectly understandable to be anxious about needles. The blood draw itself is usually quick – just a brief pinch. Most people find it tolerable. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will do their best to make you comfortable. If you’re particularly nervous, let them know, and they can take extra precautions – like applying a numbing cream beforehand. As for the X-ray, it’s completely painless – you just stand still while the machine takes a picture. Is there anything else I can clarify for you right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that answers my question. I appreciate your patience. And… your kindness. I… I feel a little less anxious now. Thank you. I… I will schedule the tests as soon as possible. And… I will be in touch when I have the results.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kobler. I’m glad I could help ease your anxiety. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, if your symptoms worsen, go to the emergency room. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well.
