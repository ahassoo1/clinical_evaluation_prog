DOCTOR: Hi Lawton, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time. It's my stomach, okay? Bloated. Feels…fuller than it should. It's been going on for a bit now. Honestly, I just want something to fix it, and I need to get back to work. Pile driving doesn't exactly wait for a guy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time and want to get this sorted quickly. Bloated and feeling full – that sounds uncomfortable, especially with your job. “A bit now” is a little vague – could you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, details. Honestly? Weeks, maybe a month? It all kinda blends together. I just…eat, work, sleep. Repeat. It's not like I'm keeping a calendar of when my stomach puffs up. Is it important? Can't you just give me something for it?
DOCTOR: I hear you – life gets busy! And it’s okay if you haven’t been tracking it precisely. A month is helpful to know. It is important because the longer something goes on, the more we need to understand what’s causing it. Just giving something to mask the symptom might not fix the underlying issue, and we want to make sure nothing serious is going on. Now, besides feeling bloated and full, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like…what do you mean? Pain? No, not really. Just…uncomfortable. Maybe a little gassy. Look, I eat normal stuff. Steak, rice, sometimes some vegetables. It's not like I'm living on junk food. I'm a working man. I need fuel. This is probably just…something I ate. Honestly, I doubt it’s anything serious. My wife… she always worried about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain is good to hear. And you're eating a fairly typical diet, that’s helpful. “A little gassy” – is that new, or has that been happening along with the bloating for the whole month?
PATIENT: The gas…yeah, it’s been happening with the bloating. Pretty much the whole time. Like I said, uncomfortable. Look, I’m not a doctor, okay? I just know I feel…off. Is this going to take long? I got a job site waiting. They’re paying me by the hour.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, and I’ll be as quick as possible while still making sure we cover everything. Okay, bloating and gas for a month… have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? Seriously? Look, I go when I need to go. Normal, I guess. Maybe a little…different. Harder, sometimes. I don't pay that much attention. I’m a pile driver operator, not a… a bowel movement expert! Is this really necessary? I just want something to stop the swelling. Can't you just give me something for that?
DOCTOR: I apologize for asking detailed questions, it's just important to get a clear picture. “A little harder sometimes” is good information, thank you. It helps us narrow things down. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But if this takes long, I’m gonna need to reschedule. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s get this done quickly. If you could lie down on the exam table, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I'll gently press on your belly to check for any tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels painful. Okay… I'm hearing normal bowel sounds. There’s a little bit of tenderness in your lower abdomen, but nothing too concerning right now. No masses that I can feel. Your abdomen is a little distended, which is consistent with the bloating you’ve described.
PATIENT: Distended? What does that mean? And tenderness? Is that bad? Look, I’m not a medical professional. Just tell me if I need a pill, or if I can go back to work. This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: “Distended” just means your belly is a little bit bigger than usual, likely from the gas and bloating. And “tenderness” means it’s a little sensitive to the touch. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Given the length of time you’ve been experiencing this, and the tenderness I’m feeling, I want to run a couple of blood tests to rule out anything more serious. It could be something simple like a dietary issue, but it's best to be thorough. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Look, I really don’t have time for this. My wife… she always wanted me to get every test possible. I hate needles. And honestly, this feels like a waste of money. Can’t you just give me something for the gas? Something to…deflate me? I need to get back to work. This job… it’s important.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I wish we could just skip to a quick fix. But given how long this has been going on – a month – and the tenderness I found during the exam, it's really important to rule out anything more serious. It’s not about doing every test, but about being responsible and making sure we're not missing something important. The blood tests will give us a lot of information quickly and can help us determine if we need to do any further investigation. We can check for things like inflammation, infection, or any other underlying conditions. If the blood tests come back normal, then we can focus on simple solutions like dietary changes and medications for the gas. But we need to start with the tests first. Would you be willing to get them done?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…fine. Get it over with. But if it’s going to take long, I’m leaving. Seriously. My crew is waiting. And I expect a quick turnaround on these results. I don’t have time to sit around waiting for weeks. .
DOCTOR: Okay, I completely understand. We can get the blood work done right here in the clinic. It should only take a few minutes. And I'll make sure the lab prioritizes the results, so we can get them back to you as quickly as possible - hopefully within 24-48 hours. Let me get the phlebotomist in here to draw your blood. Then, I'll give you some instructions on what to expect and how to access the results. In the meantime, try to avoid any heavy or greasy foods, and drink plenty of water.
