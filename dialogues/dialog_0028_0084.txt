DOCTOR: Alright. Mystery Kobler, 25 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Memmolo, is it? Yes. Um, it’s… well, it's been getting harder to breathe, I suppose. Not suddenly, but… slowly. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry, all the time. It’s quite bothersome. I don't quite know why it’s happening, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, Memmolo. Getting harder to breathe… and dry mouth and eyes. Slowly, you say. Hmm. Any fever, chills, cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, chills, or cough. Not that I've noticed, anyway. It's… just the breathing and the dryness. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but I just thought that was… life, you know? I’m not sure if that’s connected.
DOCTOR: Tiredness… of course. It's always tiredness. Alright. Any history of allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s a good question. I don't think so. Not that I remember being told I had any, anyway. I grew up… well, it wasn’t exactly near a lot of common allergy things, if that makes sense? Lots of… ocean air. Not a lot of pollen. Does that help? I'm sorry, I’m not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Ocean air… right. And no medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications at all. I try to avoid them, if I can. I haven’t been on anything regularly… not for a long, long time. Just… over-the-counter things when I have a headache, maybe. Nothing for anything… lasting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just quickly do a basic exam. I want to listen to your lungs, check your throat, and maybe a quick look in your eyes. It's standard procedure. Just sit back on the table.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Lung check… very well. Please, do go ahead. I hope I’m not… too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear bilaterally, though slightly diminished breath sounds. Throat is a little dry, as you mentioned, but no significant inflammation. Eyes appear… normal. Though, I’m noticing some mild redness around the corners. Blood pressure is 118 over 72, pulse is 68. Overall… unremarkable.
PATIENT: Unremarkable… that’s… good, isn’t it? Although… what does “diminished” mean? Is that… bad? I'm sorry to ask so many questions, Doctor, but I worry a bit when I don't understand. And the redness… is that something to be concerned about?
DOCTOR: "Diminished" simply means your breath sounds aren't as strong as they typically should be. It could be nothing, or it could indicate something minor. The redness around your eyes… again, could be a multitude of things. Dryness, irritation, allergies… We need to rule things out. I’m going to order some basic blood work - a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. We’ll also test for Sjögren’s syndrome – it causes dryness like you’re describing. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… and a test for… Shogren’s? That’s a lot of things. But, yes, that sounds… reasonable. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. So, blood work and the… other test. Where do I go for that? And will it take long? I have… a bit of a schedule, you see. Not a strict schedule, but… things.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, room 203. You’ll need to give them your insurance information. It should take about an hour or so. The results usually come back in a few days. I'll have the nurse give you the requisition forms. In the meantime, try using artificial tears for the dry eyes. And drink plenty of fluids. We'll go from there once we have the blood work back. Do you have any other questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: Artificial tears… and more fluids. Yes, I can do that. Down the hall, room 203, insurance information… I think I can manage that. No, I don’t believe I have any other questions at the moment, Doctor. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so… clearly. I appreciate it very much. It helps to know what’s going on, even if it's just… a little bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
