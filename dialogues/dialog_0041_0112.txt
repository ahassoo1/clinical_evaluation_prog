DOCTOR: Hi Keoni, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well… it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been needing to go to the bathroom quite a lot recently. More than usual, certainly. It’s… disruptive, and I'm starting to get worried. I’m afraid I don’t have a very good grasp on why it’s happening, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out – no need to be embarrassed at all, these things happen. "Quite a lot" is a little vague, though. Could you give me a rough idea?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You’re right, that is vague. Let me think… normally, I’d go perhaps three or four times a day? But lately… it feels like every couple of hours. Sometimes more often, especially if I’ve had something to drink, even just water. It’s… frequent. And it doesn’t always feel like a full bladder, either, which is… odd, isn’t it? I apologize for being so unclear. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No worries at all about the memory – it happens to the best of us. Okay, so significantly more frequent than your usual three or four times a day, even with just water intake, and not always a full feeling. Alright. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not exactly pain, no. But… a bit of discomfort, sometimes. A sort of stinging sensation, right at the very end. It’s fleeting, and not every time, but it’s there occasionally. It’s… mild, thankfully. Nothing debilitating. And no, there’s no burning, not exactly. Just that slight stinging.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional mild stinging at the end of urination, not a full burning sensation. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color… well, I haven’t been paying close attention, I must confess. It seems normal, but I wouldn’t swear to it. Smell… now that you mention it, perhaps a little stronger than usual? It’s subtle, and I could be imagining things. I suppose I’ve just been more aware of it because I’m going so frequently. It's difficult to say definitively, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major changes in color, possibly a slightly stronger smell. Okay. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain alongside this?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fever, no chills, and no abdominal pain at all. Just the frequent urination and that occasional stinging. I have been a little more tired lately, but I just assumed that was… well, life, really. I’ve been rather stressed at work, and my divorce was finalized just last month, so… there’s a lot going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, chills or abdominal pain. A little more tired lately, which you attribute to stress and a recent divorce. That all makes sense. Now, just to get a full picture, have you had any changes in your thirst recently?
PATIENT: Thirst… that’s an interesting question. I think I’ve been drinking more water, yes. Perhaps because I’m trying to… well, compensate for going to the bathroom so often? It’s hard to say if it’s a genuine increase in thirst or just a habit I’ve developed. I don't feel particularly thirsty, if that makes sense. Just… drinking more, possibly.
DOCTOR: Okay, possibly drinking more water but not necessarily feeling more thirsty. Alright. Do you have any family history of diabetes, kidney problems, or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult one, Doctor. My mother passed away when I was quite young, and I didn’t know my father. As for extended family… I’m afraid I don’t have much contact with them. I vaguely recall my aunt having some sort of… bladder issue, perhaps? But it was years ago, and I don't recall the specifics. I honestly couldn’t say with any certainty. I apologize for being so unhelpful. My family history isn’t something I’m very knowledgeable about.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all – these things happen. It’s good you’re letting me know what you do know. Alright. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I'd also like to do a simple urine test, just to rule out an infection. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Yes, please, go ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. A urine test seems sensible. I do appreciate you taking the time to investigate this.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could just hop up on the table, and lie down for me. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen. Okay, abdomen feels soft and non-tender. No masses. Now, I need a urine sample. I'll give you a cup, and I’ll step out while you collect it, to give you some privacy. Just try to catch the sample mid-stream, and let me know when you’re finished. Do you know how to do a mid-stream urine sample?
PATIENT: Mid-stream… yes, I think so. I remember being told about it years ago, but it’s… fuzzy. Do you mind if I ask you to remind me just to be sure? My memory is proving rather unreliable today.
DOCTOR: Of course, no problem at all. So, you start to urinate, and let a small amount go into the toilet. Then, before you finish, catch the sample mid-stream in the cup. Try to collect at least a couple of ounces, if you can. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that clarifies it perfectly, thank you. Start, stop, catch mid-stream… I think I can manage that. It’s… rather embarrassing discussing all of this, but I appreciate your patience and clear explanations.
DOCTOR: It’s completely normal, Keoni, and I’m here to help. Take your time. I'll be just outside when you're ready.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Okay, the urine looks clear, no obvious blood. I’m going to send this off to the lab for a more detailed analysis, just to check for any infection or other abnormalities. It'll take a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, based on what you've told me, and the initial examination, it's possible this could be a simple urinary tract infection, or it could be related to stress and increased fluid intake. It could also be something else, which is why the lab tests are important. To start, I recommend increasing your water intake slightly - not drastically, but make sure you’re staying hydrated. Also, try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. We’ll know more once the lab results come back. Does that sound reasonable?
