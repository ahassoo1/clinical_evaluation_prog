DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me a little. It feels… tight, like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. That definitely warrants a check-up. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It started maybe… three weeks ago? Hard to say exactly. It comes and goes. When I walk, sometimes it gets worse. And… sometimes when I'm just sitting, it feels like a heavy weight on my chest. It goes away if I rest, usually. Not a sharp pain, you understand? More… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. So, it sounds like it's related to activity, and relieved by rest. And you described it as a tightness or heavy weight, not a sharp pain. Is the pain radiating anywhere – like to your arm, jaw, neck, or back?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Sometimes, when it hurts in my chest, my left arm feels a little… numb. Not all the time, just sometimes. And… I think once, maybe, my jaw felt a little achy. But I wasn't sure if that was the chest pain. It's hard to say. It’s not a bad ache, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important information. Numbness in the left arm and achiness in the jaw, even if intermittent, are things we need to investigate. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, or dizziness along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: No dizziness, no. And I haven’t thrown up or felt sick to my stomach. But… yes. Sometimes, when I walk, I get a little… out of breath. Not like I can't breathe at all, but I have to stop and catch my breath faster than I used to. And… a couple times, I've felt a little sweaty, even when it's not hot. It's strange. It doesn't happen every time I walk, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. Shortness of breath and sweating with the pain and exertion are things we’ll want to take seriously. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me see… The doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high, so I take a pill for that. A small white pill, every morning. And… I think my cholesterol was a little high too, but I don’t remember exactly. I see my regular doctor, Dr. Ramirez, but I haven't been to him in… oh, maybe six months? He’s a good doctor. I don’t have diabetes, I know that much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're being treated for high blood pressure, and you’ve been told you have high cholesterol in the past. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication you're taking?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t. I just take the little white pill, every morning. It has a number on it… I think it’s… 50? Or maybe 5. It’s hard to see the number now, the bottle is old. I should probably get a refill soon anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can look it up later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. And I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medicine the doctor has given me. Never had a problem, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong stomach.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you ever had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! When I was younger, maybe 30 years ago, I had my gallbladder taken out. That’s the only surgery I ever had. And… I had the flu really bad once, when my daughter was little. But that was a long time ago. Nothing else serious, not that I remember. I'm pretty healthy, for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal many years ago, and a case of the flu. Now, let's talk about your family history. Does anyone in your family have a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Yes. My father… he had a heart attack when he was about 70. And my older brother, he has high blood pressure, like me. And my mother… she had a stroke a few years before she died. It's something we talk about in the family, you know? It makes you worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important information. A family history of heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure is significant. Now, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t like cigarettes. My husband used to smoke, a long time ago, but he quit when my daughter was born. He was a good man. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions.
DOCTOR: Okay. So no smoking, minimal alcohol. And just to finish up with your social history, what do you do for work or to keep busy?
PATIENT: I'm a transportation inspector. I check the buses, make sure they're safe. It’s not too hard work, mostly just walking around and looking things over. And I like to garden. I have a little garden in my backyard. Tomatoes, peppers, flowers… it keeps me busy. I like being outside.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. Now, Sherion, to get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and feel your chest. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds… regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not loud, but it’s present. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. And your chest feels… slightly tender to the touch, but no masses or obvious abnormalities. Okay, everything seems stable, but these findings warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Okay. A murmur… that doesn't sound good, does it? And the tenderness… I’ve been feeling a little tired lately, maybe that's why? What do you think is going on, Doctor? Is it my heart? I'm scared, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re sharing your concerns with me, Sherion. A murmur doesn’t automatically mean something is seriously wrong, but it does warrant further investigation to determine the cause. The tenderness could be related to the chest pain, or something else entirely. Given your symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, numbness in your left arm, family history of heart disease, elevated blood pressure, and the murmur I heard – I’m concerned about the possibility of angina, which is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. However, it’s important to rule out other causes as well. To do that, I’d like to order a few tests. First, an electrocardiogram, or EKG, which measures the electrical activity of your heart. Second, a blood test to check your cholesterol levels and rule out any inflammation. And finally, I’d like you to have a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and heart. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. Those tests… are they painful? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have to go back to work next week. It's just… I worry about my daughter. She lives far away, and she depends on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherion, I understand your concerns, and I'll do everything I can to get you answers quickly. The EKG is completely painless. It involves placing some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. The blood test will just involve a small needle prick in your arm. The chest X-ray involves standing in front of a machine, and it doesn’t hurt at all. The results usually take about 24-48 hours, depending on the lab. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. And if anything urgent comes up, I'll contact you immediately. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’m also going to give you a prescription for a low-dose aspirin, to help prevent blood clots. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. No strenuous activity, aspirin, and wait for the test results. And go to the emergency room if things get worse. Aspirin… I haven't taken aspirin in years. Is that safe? I have a little trouble with my stomach sometimes. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little better, knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. I understand your concern about the aspirin, and it’s a good question. Low-dose aspirin can sometimes cause stomach upset, but we’ll start with a low dose to minimize that risk. If you experience any stomach pain, heartburn, or nausea, stop taking the aspirin and let me know immediately. We can also discuss a medication to protect your stomach if needed. Now, do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You've been very helpful, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I'll try not to worry too much, and I'll call if anything changes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherion. It's my job to listen and help. Remember, if anything changes or you become concerned, don't hesitate to contact us. I'll be in touch as soon as the test results are available. Here's a summary of everything we discussed, along with the prescriptions and instructions for the aspirin. Please take care of yourself. Have a good day, and I’ll talk to you soon.
