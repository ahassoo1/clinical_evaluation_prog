DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowic. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning. Chest… feels funny. And heart… thump-thump-thump. Too fast. Blood pressure, you say? Always high. Old age. What do you want to know? Make it quick, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. "Funny" how?
PATIENT: Like… a squeezing. Not pain, exactly. More… uncomfortable. Like someone is sitting on my chest. It comes and goes. Happens when I… when I walk too much, maybe. Or when I get upset. My wife says I worry too much. She’s probably right. Just… get to the point, okay? I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. So, a squeezing sensation in your chest, brought on by activity or stress. And it’s not exactly pain, more… discomfort. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Years, maybe? Hard to say. I don’t keep track of such things. Always been a little like this, I guess. Gets worse sometimes. Last few weeks… a little more often. That’s why I’m here, if you must know. My daughter told me to come. She worries too much. Like her mother.
DOCTOR: Right. “A little more often” in the last few weeks. And it’s accompanied by the fast heartbeat you mentioned earlier?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. The thump-thump-thump. Faster. And… sometimes I get dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… lightheaded. Like I need to sit down. It’s annoying. Is this going to take long? I have a garden to tend to. Tomatoes won't pick themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally for me. Heart rate is indeed elevated, around 98 beats per minute. Rhythm is somewhat irregular. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 160/95… as you said, consistently high. Now, I'm going to feel around your chest. Let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Hmph. Irregular, you say? Everything is irregular when you get old. Don’t poke too hard. It’s sensitive, you know. And 160… always high. What does it mean? Just tell me if it’s serious or not. I don’t need a lecture about healthy living. I’ve lived 86 years, I think I know how to breathe. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowic. Your blood pressure is elevated, and your heart rhythm is irregular. Given your symptoms – the chest discomfort, palpitations, and dizziness – and your history of high blood pressure, we need to investigate this further. It could be something serious, and we need to rule out a few things. I want to order an EKG to look at your heart's electrical activity, and a blood test to check your cardiac enzymes. It's possible this is atrial fibrillation, which is a common irregular heartbeat, but we need the tests to confirm. I'm also going to recommend a consult with a cardiologist. They are the specialists in heart conditions, and I want them to take a look at these results and give you the best possible care. Do you understand?
