DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. It’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, my tummy… it feels very big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to, anyway. It’s just… not very good appetite. Is that… is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, a feeling of fullness and decreased appetite… alright. And how long has this been going on, Soila?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… how long? That’s a hard one. Seems like… a little while now. Maybe a few weeks? Or months? Time… it goes so fast, you know. I’m not so good at remembering things these days. It wasn't sudden, just… slowly getting bigger and less hungry. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Slowly progressing… a few weeks or months. And is it just the feeling of fullness, or do you have any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… I feel a little tired, sometimes. Not all the time, just… when I try to do too much. And… oh! My clothes are getting a bit tight, even the comfy ones! But… that’s probably just old age, yes? I don’t know if that’s a symptom… just getting bigger all over, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and noticing clothes fitting tighter… those can be related. Now, are you having any pain or discomfort anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain…? Not really pain, Doctor. More… heavy. Like a lot of water inside. Sometimes it feels a little… uncomfortable, yes. Especially when I lie down. But not sharp pain, if you understand. Just… a dull feeling. Is that bad? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: No, you're not a bother at all, Soila. That's helpful to know – dull discomfort, worse when lying down. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits…? Oh, dear… I… I don't really… I don't think so? I go to the… the bathroom, yes. But I haven’t… haven’t really noticed anything different. Is something supposed to be different? I’m sorry, Doctor, I’m not very good at talking about these things. It's embarrassing, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Soila. No need to apologize, and it’s not embarrassing at all. We just need to get a full picture. Okay, let’s move on. And have you experienced any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea…? Vomiting…? No, no vomiting. And… not really nausea either, no. Sometimes I feel a little… queasy, maybe, after I eat. But not like I’m going to… throw up, no. It's just… sometimes my stomach doesn't feel good. But not often. Is that…important? I don't want to worry you.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional queasiness after eating, but no vomiting. Alright. Now, Soila, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications…? Oh, dear. Let me see… I used to take something for my… my joints, yes. But the doctor said to stop. A long time ago, though. And… no, I don't think I take anything else now. Just a little tea sometimes, for sleeping. But that’s not medicine, is it? Just herbs. Does that count? I don’t really like taking pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Herbs for sleeping, that’s good to know. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Oh, goodness. I don't think so, no. Never had anything bad happen when I eat or touch things. Maybe a little sniffle when the flowers bloom in the spring, but that's just the… the pollen, yes? Nothing serious. I've always been a pretty healthy woman, really. Until… well, until my tummy started getting big. I don't want to be a bother, Doctor. Are you sure I'm not wasting your time?
DOCTOR: You're not wasting my time at all, Soila. We're getting a good picture here. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your tummy, and gently feel it, to see what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. Just… be gentle, yes? My tummy is very sensitive these days. And… please tell me what you find, okay? I like to know what's happening. Don’t want any surprises. Just… gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Soila. I’ll be very gentle. Let's start by listening to your abdomen. I'm hearing some… fairly normal bowel sounds. A little sluggish, perhaps, but nothing alarming at this point. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I notice some… mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. And… there appears to be some fullness. Not a hard mass, but definitely some distention. It doesn't feel acutely painful, but… it’s something we need to investigate further. Your skin feels warm and dry. And no obvious signs of hernias. Alright, Soila. That gives us a little bit more information. I’m going to order some blood tests to check your overall health and see if there are any clues there. And I’d like to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at what’s going on inside. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a little… uncomfortable, yes. Not painful, but… heavy. Like a lot of pressure. Ultrasound…? Blood tests…? Oh, dear… what are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something serious? I get so nervous with these things… I don’t like hospitals, you know. And what if it’s something… bad? Please tell me honestly, Doctor. I need to know. And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to worry my friends. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to be nervous, Soila. I understand. The blood tests and ultrasound are just to help us figure out what's causing the fullness and decreased appetite, that's all. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. We need to rule out a few things. The ultrasound will help us see your organs and check for anything unusual. As for the blood tests, they’ll give us a good overview of your health – things like your kidney and liver function, your blood count, and look for any signs of inflammation. We're going to check for things like fluid buildup, masses, or any other abnormalities. It could be something simple, like constipation or a little bit of bloating. But we need to be thorough. The results should be back in a few days – I'd say within three to five business days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as I have them, and we'll discuss everything then. I'll explain everything very clearly, I promise. You're not a bother at all, Soila. It’s my job to help you. And I’ll do everything I can to make sure you're comfortable and informed every step of the way. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. That… that sounds a little better. Knowing what you’re looking for helps. Three to five days… I can manage that. And you’ll explain everything clearly? Yes, please. I’m not good with medical talk, you know. Just… simple words, okay? And… thank you, Doctor. For being so kind. It’s… it’s comforting to know you're taking care of me. I guess I'll just have to wait and see, then. Do I need to do anything special before the tests? Fasting, or… anything? And… how do I get the tests done? Will someone help me? I don't drive anymore.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Soila. I’ll explain everything in simple terms. No medical jargon, I promise. Now, for the blood tests, yes, you will need to fast for eight to twelve hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks – water is okay. As for the ultrasound, you don’t need to do anything special. And don’t worry about getting to the lab and imaging center. Our receptionists will schedule all the appointments for you and arrange transportation through a local service. They will make sure someone helps you get there and back. They're very good at taking care of our patients. I'll also have a nurse call you tomorrow to go over everything one more time and answer any questions you might have. They'll be happy to help. For now, just try to relax and take it easy. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if anything changes. We'll get to the bottom of this, Soila. You’re in good hands. .
