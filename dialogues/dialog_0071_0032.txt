DOCTOR: Ah, good morning, Mr. Krok. I'm Dr. Galena. It's…nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Though I must say, these chairs aren’t terribly comfortable. As for why I’m here… well, it’s rather unpleasant to discuss, truthfully. A…a bit of a discharge, you see. A most unwelcome development. I haven’t experienced anything like this in…oh, decades, I should imagine. It’s quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, those chairs are rather old. We've been meaning to replace them. A discharge, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. And not a pleasant one, I assure you. It's...sticky, and there's a rather faint odour. My wife, bless her heart, noticed it first. She insisted I come in, said it couldn’t be ignored. Women are always so… vigilant about these things. Though I confess, I haven’t the faintest idea what could be causing it. I’ve always been a… a clean man.
DOCTOR: Right, sticky, with a faint odour… and your wife noticed it. Good of her to be so attentive. Now, is this discharge coming from… anywhere in particular?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, where else would it be coming from? It's… down there, naturally. A most delicate area, I assure you. It’s… well, it’s emanating from the… the penis. Is that sufficient detail for you? I’m not accustomed to speaking so frankly about such matters.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's… sufficient. Thank you. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… slips away, doesn't it? Let me think… It began… perhaps a week ago? No, perhaps a little longer. Ten days, maybe? It wasn’t terribly noticeable at first, just a slight dampness. Now… now it’s rather more insistent. I haven’t been keeping a precise calendar of my… emissions, if you understand my meaning.
DOCTOR: Alright, ten days or so. Any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… there is a slight discomfort. Not a sharp pain, you understand, but a sort of… stinging sensation. Particularly at the end. And it’s… well, it’s rather inconvenient. It interrupts my morning routine, if you follow. I prefer a swift, uncomplicated visit to the lavatory.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches along with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever that I'm aware of. My wife takes my temperature regularly, she’s very diligent about these things, and she would have certainly mentioned it. No chills, either. And my aches… well, I have the usual aches of an old man, Doctor. A bit of stiffness in the joints, a twinge in the back. But nothing beyond the ordinary. I attribute that to the weather, you see. Damp weather always aggravates my… condition.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you had any changes in your sexual activity recently?
PATIENT: Doctor! I assure you, my… activities have been quite consistent over the decades. Married life, you see. A certain… stability. Changes? No. Absolutely not. My wife and I maintain a… respectable routine. I find your question rather… indelicate, frankly.
DOCTOR: My apologies. Just… routine questioning, sir. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Just the usual things. A bit of a pill for my blood pressure, if I recall correctly. And something for my… digestion. Old age, you see. The body doesn't function as smoothly as it once did. Let me think… oh, and a vitamin supplement. My wife insists. She’s very keen on maintaining my… vitality. I believe she purchases them from a television advertisement. I can’t recall the specifics.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you happen to know the names of these medications, or perhaps the dosages?
PATIENT: Goodness… names? Dosages? Doctor, I leave those things to my wife. She manages the pillbox, meticulously labeled, of course. I simply… consume them as directed. I wouldn't know a milligram from a… a mandrake root. She'll be most displeased if I can't provide you with that information. Honestly, women and their details…
DOCTOR: Alright, no worries. Perhaps your wife could provide that information later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no. I've always been rather robust, constitutionally speaking. A bit of hay fever in the spring, perhaps, but nothing serious. I've never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I recall. My wife would certainly have remembered, she's very attentive to such things. She keeps a detailed record of my… ailments and sensitivities.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Krok, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’ll just involve a visual inspection and perhaps a gentle palpation. It's the best way to get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Honestly, Doctor. At my age? It's rather… undignified, isn't it? But… I suppose if it’s necessary. I trust you’ll be… discreet? And gentle, as you say. My wife would be most displeased if I returned home in a state of… discomfort. Very well. Proceed, but please be swift.
DOCTOR: Of course, sir. Discretion and gentleness are paramount. If you could just lie down on the table, that would be perfect. I’ll explain everything as I go along.
PATIENT: At my age… honestly. A bit cold, isn't it? And where are the stirrups?
DOCTOR: It is a little cool, I apologize. We’ll adjust the temperature. And no stirrups are necessary, sir. Now, if you could just relax as much as possible. I'm just going to take a quick look. Hmm… there is some mild redness and swelling. Is there any pain when I touch here?
PATIENT: A bit tender, yes. Not excruciating, but certainly… noticeable. Like a slight pinching sensation. Oh dear, that's… rather unpleasant. Honestly, Doctor, you’re not being particularly gentle. Are you certain you’re qualified for this?
DOCTOR: My apologies, sir. I’m being as careful as possible. I’m detecting some tenderness, as you mentioned, and some discharge as well. I'm also noting a slight odor. Based on this initial examination, it could be a number of things – an infection, inflammation, or something else entirely. I’d like to take a sample of the discharge to send to the lab for analysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A sample… Honestly, the indignities never cease. Very well. If it's necessary, I suppose. But please be quick about it. And discreet. My wife would be… most displeased to learn of the details. Are you certain you've washed your hands thoroughly?
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, I’ve washed my hands thoroughly and am using sterile equipment. This will only take a moment. Alright, I’ve collected the sample. We'll send it to the lab and should have results in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding sexual activity and keeping the area clean and dry. I'll also prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic as a precaution, while we await the lab results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A broad-spectrum antibiotic… Well, I suppose if you deem it necessary. Honestly, I distrust all these modern medications. My father always swore by a simple poultice of chamomile and marigold. But… very well. If you insist. And avoid sexual activity? That’s… a rather harsh restriction. My wife won’t be pleased. But… I understand. Very well. Proceed with your… precautions. But please, explain everything to my wife. She manages these things, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m prescribing a course of Ciprofloxacin, 500mg twice a day for seven days. I’ll also send detailed instructions to the pharmacy regarding hygiene. I’ll make a note to explain everything thoroughly to your wife as well. While we wait for the lab results, if you experience any fever, chills, or increased pain, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't suppose so. Just… please remember to explain everything to my wife. She’ll want to know the dosage, the side effects, the… the specifics. Honestly, she’s far more capable than I am when it comes to these medical matters. And please, Doctor, try to be… gentle with her. She worries easily. Very well. I believe that’s all. I’m rather cold, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, sir. I’ll ensure your wife receives all the necessary information. And I apologize for the cold. I’ll have someone adjust the temperature. Let me help you up. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: Thank you. Honestly, the indignities... Very well. Goodbye, Doctor. And do remember to be gentle with my wife. .
