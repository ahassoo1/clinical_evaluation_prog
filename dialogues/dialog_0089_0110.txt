DOCTOR: Good morning, Nicoletta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I’m hoping you can help me feel…brighter again. I’m getting on in years, you see, and things just aren’t working quite like they used to. I’m looking for a bit of a…reset, I suppose. A jumpstart. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Nicoletta. It’s very common to feel that way as we get older. "Reset" is a good way to put it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s not one particular thing, you understand. It’s just…everything feels a little dull. I used to have so much energy for my garden, and for visiting with my grandchildren. Now, I find myself…tired a lot. And not just physically tired, but…mentally, too. It’s hard to explain. Sometimes I forget things, not terribly important things, thankfully, but enough to be worrying. And I don’t have the same…spark, I suppose, for things I used to enjoy. Does that give you a better idea?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Nicoletta. It sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of things. Fatigue, some memory concerns, and a loss of interest in activities you once loved. Okay. Let’s try to get a bit more specific. When did you start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It didn’t happen all at once, you see. I’d say…maybe six months or so ago? It started gradually. At first, I just thought I was getting a little lazy, spending too much time resting. But it’s been getting…steadier, if that makes sense. Not worse, exactly, but it hasn’t gotten any better either. Six months…yes, I believe that’s about right. Around the time my youngest grandchild started school, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, coinciding with a change in your grandchild's life. That's good information. Now, regarding the fatigue – is it constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not constant, no. It’s worse in the afternoons, usually. Mornings are…better. I can still manage my chores, and a little bit of gardening, but by three or four o'clock, I’m ready to just sit. And sometimes, even getting up from a chair feels like a big effort. It’s not painful, just…heavy. Does that sound silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Nicoletta. That's a very clear description. Fatigue that's worse in the afternoon is something we need to pay attention to. And you mentioned some memory concerns. Can you give me an example of what you’ve been forgetting?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m forgetting who people are, thankfully. It’s more…names. Names on the tip of my tongue, you know? Or where I put things. My glasses, usually. Or I’ll go into a room and forget why I went there. Little things, really. But it’s enough to make me feel…unsettled. I used to have such a good memory! I could remember all the dates of important family events, and now…well, it’s not the same. It doesn’t happen every day, but often enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Names and misplaced items, occasional forgetfulness of purpose. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, let me think… I had the usual things, I suppose. High blood pressure, many years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for a long time now. And I had a hip replacement about ten years ago, but that healed up nicely. Other than that…nothing major. I’ve been very lucky, really. I see my primary doctor regularly for check-ups, but she hasn't mentioned anything alarming. I can give you her name and number if you like?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Nicoletta. Well-controlled hypertension and a hip replacement ten years ago. I appreciate you letting me know. I will likely reach out to your primary doctor to get her records, with your permission of course. Before we move on, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Let me see… I take a small dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure, like I said. And I take a calcium supplement, because the doctor said my bones were a little thin. And…oh, sometimes I take ibuprofen for my arthritis, when my joints are bothering me. That's about it, I think. I try not to take the ibuprofen too often, though. It doesn't sit well with my stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril, calcium supplement, and ibuprofen as needed. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been very lucky with allergies. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a problem with bee stings or anything like that. My mother always said I had a strong constitution! But I do try to be careful with shellfish, just in case. You hear stories, you know. But I haven’t had it in years, so I wouldn’t know if I am allergic.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tricky one. My mother lived to be 92, and she was remarkably healthy all her life. My father had heart trouble, but he didn’t take very good care of himself, if I’m being honest. He smoked, and he didn’t eat well. My sister has arthritis, like I do, but that might just be bad luck. And…oh, my aunt, on my mother’s side, had something with her memory, when she got older. But I don’t know what it was, exactly. Just that she…forgot things. It wasn’t very specific. I wish I knew more, but my family doesn’t talk much about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay. History of heart trouble on your father’s side, arthritis, and some memory issues in a family member. Thank you. Now, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What does that mean, exactly? Well, I live alone, since my husband passed away ten years ago. I keep busy, though. I have my garden, and I volunteer at the church a couple of times a week. I enjoy cooking, and I try to eat healthy. I don’t smoke, and I hardly ever drink alcohol. I used to walk a lot, but my arthritis has made that difficult lately. I mostly stay around the house now, to be honest. It gets lonely sometimes, but I have my grandchildren, and they visit often. That helps a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nicoletta, thank you for sharing all of that information. That gives me a very good picture of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your memory and reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m an old woman, you know, things creak a bit.
DOCTOR: I will, of course. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/85, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, let's do a simple memory test. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one first thing. Let me think… It's August…the second, isn't it? August 2nd, 2025. Yes, I believe it is. I try to keep track of the days, you see. It gets lonely otherwise.
DOCTOR: Good, very good, Nicoletta. And can you repeat back to me the three words I’m going to say?
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. I'll try my best. My memory isn't what it used to be, but I'll give it a go.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: table, penny, cloud. Please try to remember those. Now, let's move on to a basic reflex test. I'm going to lightly tap on your knees with this little hammer. This will check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon with age. Now, can you tell me those three words I asked you to remember?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… table… I remember table. And…something with money? Penny, yes, I think that was one. And…something fluffy? Oh, I’m terrible at this! It was…cloud, yes! Table, penny, cloud. Did I get them all right? I feel a little silly having to be tested like this. It's been a long time since I had a test!
DOCTOR: You did wonderfully, Nicoletta. You remembered all three words correctly! That's very reassuring. Okay. Now, let's check your range of motion in your joints. Can you bend your arms and legs for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Oh, these old joints aren't as flexible as they used to be. There we go. It's a bit stiff, but I can still move them. The arthritis makes it a little uncomfortable, you see. It’s not a sharp pain, just a…aching feeling. Is that alright? I don't want to push myself too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay. Range of motion is slightly limited due to arthritis, with some discomfort. Thank you for letting me know. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you're experiencing some fatigue, memory concerns, and arthritis. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, which is typical for your age, and your range of motion is limited due to arthritis. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue and memory concerns, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. If some blood work will help figure things out, then please do. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to feel…brighter again, you know? So yes, please order the blood work. And thank you for listening to me so patiently. It helps just to talk about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nicoletta. I've ordered a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 and vitamin D level. The lab results should be available in a few days. I'll call you as soon as they're in. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay active as much as possible, even if it’s just light exercise. And make sure you're getting enough rest and eating a healthy diet. Would you like me to write you a referral to a physical therapist for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. A physical therapist might be just what I need to help with my stiff joints. Yes, please, if you wouldn’t mind. I’m always hesitant to bother people, but…well, you seem to understand. Thank you again for everything. It’s such a relief to finally be talking about this with someone. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’ll write you a referral to a physical therapist. Here it is. They can teach you some exercises to help improve your range of motion and reduce your pain. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the lab results. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Two weeks is good. Thank you so much. I’ll be sure to call and schedule that appointment. You’ve been very helpful. I feel much better just knowing we’re getting to the bottom of things. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything at all? Perhaps a certain type of tea? My grandmother always said tea could cure anything.
DOCTOR: That's a lovely thought! While tea won't cure anything, staying hydrated is always a good idea. Just continue to drink plenty of water. And don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Otherwise, just focus on getting enough rest, eating a healthy diet, and staying active as much as possible. Do you have any other questions for me today, Nicoletta?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've answered all my questions, and you’ve put my mind at ease. I really appreciate your time and your kindness. It’s a comfort to know there are doctors like you still out there. Thank you again for everything. I’ll see you in two weeks. Have a wonderful day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nicoletta. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’m glad I could help. You have a wonderful day as well, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care.
