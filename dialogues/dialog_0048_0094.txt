DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. So, you're here today… for what exactly?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. The… the lady told me to come. Something about… learning things. About… stuff. I don't really remember. My husband, he made the appointment. He said it was important. I work with… metal. Big sheets of it. It’s… heavy.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, your husband thought it would be a good idea for you to be evaluated. Heavy metal work, you say?
PATIENT: Evaluated? Like… am I good at my job? I am good at my job! Been doing it… a long time. Longer than some people have been alive, probably. What does that have to do with… learning things? Is this about safety? Because we have rules. Lots of rules.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Fontanazza, not about your job performance. It’s… a medical evaluation. We’re checking to see if working with metal has affected your health. Now, let's try to focus. Have you been experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No, not really. Tired, sometimes. But everyone is tired, right? Metal is heavy! And my husband… he snores. Loudly. That keeps me up. Maybe that’s why I’m tired. I don't know. What kind of symptoms are you talking about? Like… fever? I don’t have a fever.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's be more specific. Any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Um… sometimes my back hurts. From… lifting the metal. It’s a strong job. I take pills. Yellow ones. My husband gives them to me. They help… sometimes. Is that what you mean by pain? Not like… a bad pain. Just… achy. Old lady achy.
DOCTOR: Right. And where exactly is this achiness located?
PATIENT: All over, I guess. Mostly… down my back. And sometimes in my shoulders. It's hard to say exactly. It comes and goes. Like… waves. Is that… bad? Should I not be lifting the metal? My husband says I’m strong. He says I need the money.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, let's try to get a clearer picture. Do you have any difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. I breathe. Everyone breathes, don’t they? Sometimes it’s hard when it’s really hot in the shop, but that’s… just hot. It’s metal. It gets hot. I fan myself with my hand. That helps. Why are you asking about breathing? Is something wrong with the air?
DOCTOR: Just routine questions, Ms. Fontanazza. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? Like… when they fall asleep? Yeah, sometimes. When I’m sleeping. But everyone gets that, right? When you lie on your arm wrong… or something. Not all the time. Just… sometimes when I wake up. It goes away pretty fast. Why are you asking so many questions? It’s making my head hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Stand up? Oh. Okay. But my knees… they crack a lot. And I’m not very good at standing for a long time. Is this going to take a while? I have to get back to work, you know. Metal doesn’t cut itself. .
DOCTOR: Just a quick look, Ms. Fontanazza. Please. Now, let's start with your back. I'm going to palpate along your spine. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Hmm. Tenderness noted at T12 and L4. Moderate muscle guarding. Range of motion… limited in flexion and extension. And you are slightly stooped. Do you experience any pain with this?
