DOCTOR: Hello, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… have been noticing some things with my memory. It is… troubling. I wish to discuss this with you quickly, if that is alright. I do not like to waste time.
DOCTOR: Quickly, alright. Though, memory issues are rarely quick to sort out. So, “troubling” how?
PATIENT: It is… difficult to explain. I remember everything else – dates, names, events from long ago. But recently… small things. Where I put my keys, for example. Or the name of a neighbor I have known for years. Just… gone. It is frustrating. I do not forget important things, like appointments, but these little details… they concern me. And my blood pressure has been… not good, the nurse said.
DOCTOR: Hmm. So, not a global amnesia, then. More… selective. And the blood pressure is definitely something we need to address. Alright. Let's try to get a clearer picture. How long have you been noticing these memory lapses?
PATIENT: Perhaps… three months? Maybe four. It started slowly. I thought it was just… being busy. I manage many properties, you see. Lots of people, lots of details. But it is becoming more frequent. I find myself repeating questions, even to people I just spoke with. It is… embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are these memory issues impacting your ability to manage those properties?
PATIENT: Not yet. But I worry they will. I had one incident last week… a payment was missed, and I completely forgot I had sent a reminder. Fortunately, the issue was resolved quickly, but it frightened me. I pride myself on being very organized. This… is not me. I keep double-checking everything now, which takes so much time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the missed payment, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… No, not really. I sleep… alright, I suppose. Perhaps not as deeply as before, but I am a woman of my age. I eat well, I believe. And I… I do not feel confused. Just… forgetful. Specifically with the smaller things. Like names, and where I left my spectacles. Though, they are on my head now. See? It is… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. Let’s do a quick cognitive assessment, just to get a baseline. It's a few simple tasks, shouldn't take long. And then we'll check your vitals again, and discuss some potential causes and what we can do. Sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. Quickly, if possible, please? I have many appointments scheduled for this afternoon. I do not wish to delay them further. And… if it is a simple matter, I would prefer not to have extensive testing. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We'll keep it brief. First, I’m going to ask you to recall three unrelated words. I’ll say them, and then you repeat them back to me. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I am ready. Please proceed. I believe my memory for facts is quite good. It is these… trivial things that are the problem. Do not worry, Doctor. I have a good mind. Just… occasionally misplaces things.
DOCTOR: Right. The words are: apple, table, and penny. Please repeat them back to me when you are ready. Don't rush.
PATIENT: Apple… table… and… penny. Yes. I recall them perfectly. Is this… necessary? I assure you, I can remember much more complicated things than that. Property details, contracts… everything is filed neatly in my mind.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I want you to count backwards from 100 by sevens. As quickly and accurately as possible. It tests a different part of your brain.
PATIENT: One hundred… ninety-three… eighty-six… seventy-nine… seventy-two… sixty-five… fifty-eight… fifty-one… forty-four… thirty-seven… thirty… twenty-three… sixteen… nine… two… negative five… Oh! Stop. I… apologize. It is more difficult than it appears. I am not accustomed to such… exercises. I manage people, Doctor, not numbers. Is this truly necessary? I feel rather… flustered.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Alvara. Alright, let’s skip that for now. I'm going to do a brief neurological exam. I'll just check your reflexes and some basic functions. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Though, I must say, all of this feels rather… excessive for a few forgotten names. I am a busy woman, Doctor. And I begin to feel a little anxious with all these… tests. Please, let us come to a conclusion quickly. Is it stress? Is that what you suspect?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are… a little brisk. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes. I have strong hands. I manage properties, you see. I must be firm. This is... rather a lot of hand-holding, Doctor. Is something… wrong? Is my blood pressure dangerously high? Perhaps I should simply take medication, if that is the issue. I wish to be proactive, but I do not have time for extensive investigation.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated, despite the nurse's initial reading, and given your family history – do you know if anyone in your family has had issues with hypertension?
PATIENT: Yes. My father… he suffered a stroke. He had very high blood pressure, the doctors said. He was… a stubborn man. Did not take his medication. This… concerns me. But I assure you, Doctor, I am not stubborn. I will take medication if you deem it necessary. But please, let us address this quickly. I have a meeting this afternoon. A very important meeting. And I must be alert. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It's concerning, Ms. Alvara. Your blood pressure is significantly elevated. The cognitive assessment suggests some mild impairment, but it could be due to stress, anxiety… or a number of other things. Given your father’s history, we need to be aggressive with treatment. I'm going to prescribe a low dose of lisinopril to start. We’ll monitor your blood pressure closely. And, I’m also going to recommend a brain MRI, just to rule out anything more serious. It’s a precaution, understand?
PATIENT: An MRI? Doctor, that seems… rather drastic. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy aside from this… blood pressure issue. An MRI will take so much time! And I do not understand… what are we looking for exactly? Are you suggesting something is… wrong with my brain? I do not appreciate this insinuation. Perhaps medication is sufficient. I can manage my stress. I always have. Please, Doctor, reconsider the MRI. It feels… unnecessary and alarming.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, I understand your concerns. But given your father's stroke, the elevated blood pressure, and the subtle changes I observed, an MRI is the responsible course of action. It’s not an accusation, it’s due diligence. We need a baseline. We can discuss the results and adjust the plan accordingly. If it’s clear, then fine. But ignoring potential issues is not an option. And frankly, your dismissive attitude towards this… it's not helping. I’m going to order the MRI, and I want you to schedule it as soon as possible. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and monitor your blood pressure. In the meantime, I'm giving you a handout on managing hypertension. Do you have any questions about the medication?
PATIENT: Two weeks? Very well. But I insist, Doctor, if the MRI shows nothing… we do not pursue any further tests. I have a life to manage. And… lisinopril? What are the side effects? Will it make me… tired? I have many commitments. I cannot afford to be incapacitated. And… will it interact with any other medications? I take a small dose of… something for my nerves. It is prescribed by another doctor. A very good doctor. Please, be thorough. I do not wish to waste any more time on this.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril can cause some fatigue, yes, especially when you first start it. It's usually mild and subsides within a few days. Common side effects include a dry cough, dizziness, and lightheadedness. We’ll monitor you for those. As for interactions, I need the exact name of the medication you take for your nerves. The dosage as well. I cannot provide accurate advice without that information. And frankly, coordinating care with your other doctor is essential. Give me the name, and I’ll check for potential interactions. I also strongly recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician to review all your medications. Write it down for me, please. And then we can finish this. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Very well. It is… diazepam. Two milligrams. As needed. I only take it… occasionally. For anxiety. And… please, do not be alarmed. It is a small dose. My previous doctor assured me it was perfectly safe. There. Now, can we conclude this? I have a very important meeting to prepare for. And I truly do not wish to dwell on this any further. Is there anything else? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Diazepam… alright. It can interact with lisinopril, potentially increasing dizziness and lightheadedness. It's not a major interaction, but it’s something we need to be aware of. I strongly advise against taking diazepam while you are on lisinopril, especially in the beginning. And if you must take it, only do so under strict medical supervision. We’ll need to monitor your blood pressure even more closely. Look, Ms. Alvara, I understand you are busy and you don’t want to waste time. But dismissing potential health risks isn't a good strategy. I've given you the prescription for lisinopril, the handout on hypertension, and the recommendation for the MRI. Follow these instructions, and schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks. That’s all I can do for you today. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I do not. I have heard everything I need to hear. And I assure you, Doctor, I will carefully consider everything you have said. But I remain skeptical. I trust my own judgment. And I will manage my health accordingly. Thank you for your time. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Good day, Ms. Alvara. .
