DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, look, I don't have a lot of time for chit-chat. I'm 51, and frankly, I want to get pregnant. Without... problems. Is that possible? I’ve read things, you know. I just want to know if it’s even worth pursuing, or if I’m wasting everyone’s time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to be straightforward, and I appreciate you being direct with me. It's good you're thinking ahead and wanting to assess the situation before proceeding. Getting pregnant at 51 is certainly something we can explore, though it does present some unique considerations. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me a little more about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history. Honestly? What specifically do you need to know? I’ve had the usual things. Colds, flu, a broken wrist when I was a teenager… nothing important. I’m divorced, if that matters. And I have Medicare, obviously. Is there a checklist somewhere? I really don't have time to list every sniffle I’ve had since birth.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. You're right, a complete list isn't necessary. I'm primarily interested in any significant medical conditions you've been diagnosed with, any surgeries you've had, and any medications you currently take, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements. Also, knowing your family medical history can be helpful. To start, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I eat reasonably well – mostly. And I exercise, when I can. My ex-husband, bless his soul, was the unhealthy one. Family history? My mother had… something. Heart trouble, I think. She didn’t live very long. And my grandmother had arthritis, but that's hardly relevant, is it? Look, I’m perfectly healthy. That’s why this whole thing is so baffling. Why wouldn’t I be able to get pregnant?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Knowing about your mother's heart trouble is helpful, as heart health is important. And it's good to hear that you generally maintain a healthy lifestyle. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about your menstrual history?
PATIENT: My… what now? Look, I haven't had a period in… well, a long time. Years. That’s kind of the problem, isn't it? I’m post-menopausal. Do I need to draw you a diagram? It’s not like I’m still tracking my cycle, doctor. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, Ms. Shteynberg, and I apologize for asking what may seem obvious. Knowing you're post-menopausal is very important information. It means we would need to consider hormone therapy to induce ovulation if we were to pursue pregnancy. To proceed further, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. This will help me assess your overall health. We’ll also need to order some blood tests to check your hormone levels and assess your general health. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I suppose. Blood tests and poking and prodding… wonderful. Just… be quick about it, please. I have things to do. And I expect a realistic assessment, doctor. I don’t want false hope. I've been disappointed enough in my life.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand your desire for a straightforward assessment, and I will be as thorough and honest as possible. I will explain everything as we go, and we will discuss the results openly. First, let's start with some basic vitals – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Just… get on with it. Quickly. I’m not fond of being touched by strangers, even if they are doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Overall, the physical exam is within normal limits for your age. Now, I’m going to need to draw some blood for the tests I mentioned. We’ll be checking your hormone levels – estrogen, FSH, and LH – as well as a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. This will give us a more complete picture of your health and help us determine the best course of action. Do you have any allergies to latex or any difficulty with blood draws?
PATIENT: No allergies. And no, I don't faint easily. Though frankly, this whole experience is making me feel rather faint. Just… hurry up and stick the needle in already. The sooner this is over, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. You may feel a brief pinch. There you go, all done. Just apply pressure to this site for a few minutes to stop any bleeding. Now, we’ll send these samples to the lab. The results usually take 2-3 business days. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. Just… send the results as quickly as possible. And if it's hopeless, just tell me straight. I don’t want a sugar-coated lecture. I'm a practical woman. Two to three days… fine. I suppose. Thank you, doctor. I'll… expect to hear from your office.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. We will contact you as soon as the results are available, and I assure you, I will be direct and honest with you. We will discuss all your options and formulate a plan together, if appropriate. Here is a pamphlet with information about fertility options, in case you want to read up on things in the meantime. Thank you for coming in today. If you have any questions before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day. .
