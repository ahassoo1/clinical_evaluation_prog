DOCTOR: Right. Odell Tayar, 22 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh… travel. I need… something for travel. My wife… she liked to go places. Before… you know. Now I want to go too. But I need… shots? Maybe? I don’t really remember what I need. It’s been a while since… anything.
DOCTOR: “Travel,” right. And it’s been… some time since your last medical checkup. Let's see… before we discuss “shots,” as you put it, could you tell me where you’re planning to travel?
PATIENT: Ugh. Lots of places. She… she always picked. Nepal, mostly. But also… Thailand, India… places with… bugs. And heat. Really hot. I don’t know which is which, honestly. I just want to go where she liked. Does it matter? I just need to be… safe. Like she was.
DOCTOR: It matters a great deal. Different regions require different precautions. Nepal, Thailand, India… all have very different disease profiles. And “safe” is… relative. We need specifics to determine what you require. Do you have any idea when you’re planning to leave?
PATIENT: Soon. I… I sold a lot of things. I have money now. Maybe next month? Two months? I don’t have… calendar. Wife did calendar. I just… want to go. Before… before it gets too cold. Is that important? Cold makes me… sick.
DOCTOR: “Soon” is not particularly helpful, Mr. Tayar. We're talking about potential exposures to serious illnesses. And yes, seasonality can be relevant. Before we proceed, do you have any record of previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: Vaccinations? Like… for children? I… I think so. But I don’t have paper. Wife kept paper. Everything was… with her. I just know she said I was… good. Healthy. She took care of everything. I don’t… I don’t know what shots I had. Maybe for… fever? I get fever sometimes. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Right. So, no documentation. And vague recollections of… something. Do you happen to know if you've ever had a tetanus booster?
PATIENT: Tetanus…? Like… rust? I… I work with metal. Planes. Lots of metal. Maybe? I cut myself sometimes. Small cuts. But I… clean them. With soap. Wife always said soap is good. I don’t think I went to… a doctor for cuts. Is that what you mean? A shot for rust cuts? I don’t remember.
DOCTOR: This is… less than ideal. Let's move on. Any allergies to medications, food, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. I eat… rice. And noodles. And sometimes… spicy things. Wife liked spicy things. She… she got sick once from too much spice. But that wasn't an allergy. I… I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I don’t get… rashes. Or… swelling. I just get… tired. Is that an allergy? Being tired?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Tayar, being tired is not an allergy. Let’s see… any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Significant…? I… I get… the chills sometimes. Especially when it rains. And my stomach… it makes noises. Loud noises. Wife said it was the noodles. Maybe? Other than that… I was… strong. She always said I was strong. I carried all the… things. For the trips. Does that count? Being strong?
DOCTOR: Right. So, chills and… gastrointestinal sounds. And a history of… physical strength. Now, have you been experiencing any fever, cough, or shortness of breath recently?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes. Like… warm. Not always. Cough… when the dust is bad. I work with planes, remember? Lots of dust. Shortness of… breath? No. I… I breathe. I always breathe. Unless I’m… lifting something heavy. Then I breathe… hard. Is that what you mean? Hard breathing? No, not usually. Just… when I work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand you’re grieving, but I need precise information. Forget about your wife for a moment, and focus on your current condition. Have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Recent…? I… I don’t know what “recent” means. A long time ago, maybe. I felt… sick. But I slept. And then I felt better. Wife gave me… tea. Strong tea. That always helped. I don’t… I don’t remember what was wrong. Just… sick. And then better. Everything is… blurry. Like a bad dream. Do you… do you want to know about the dream?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Tayar, I do not want to know about the dream. This is… unhelpful. Let me be blunt. Given your lack of vaccination records, vague medical history, and potential exposure to tropical diseases, I strongly recommend a comprehensive travel health consultation with a specialist. I can provide a referral. And frankly, I suggest postponing your trip until you’ve been properly evaluated and vaccinated. It's simply too risky otherwise. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Risky…? Like… dangerous? But I have money now. I sold everything. I need to go. She… she wanted me to go. Is the specialist… expensive? Will it cost a lot of money? Maybe… maybe I can just take extra tea? Strong tea? Is that… is that enough? I don't understand. Why is it so… difficult?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, "strong tea" is not a substitute for medical care. The specialist will assess the risks and recommend appropriate vaccinations and preventative medications. I cannot guarantee the cost, but I can provide you with a list of specialists who accept your insurance. I'm documenting your reluctance to postpone travel and your lack of vaccination history. Here is the referral. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And frankly, I suggest you reconsider your plans until you have been properly prepared. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Prepared…? Like… packing? I thought I packed enough. She always said I packed too much. But I have everything. Clothes, shoes… strong tea. What… what will the specialist do? Will they… tell me I can’t go? I just want to… honor her memory. Is that… is that okay? .
DOCTOR: The specialist will assess your risk factors and advise you accordingly. I've documented everything. Goodbye, Mr. Tayar. .
