DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Uh… well, I think it’s for… the tryouts. For the team. My… someone said I needed this paper. From you. A check-up, they called it. For the…sports. I forget what sports.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you need a physical exam to clear you for participation in a sports team. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll get that done for you. Let me just quickly review your information here. I see you're 51 years old, Puerto Rican, and your height and weight are listed as 160 centimeters and 124 pounds. And you're covered by Medicare, correct?
PATIENT: Medicare… yes, I think so. That’s the red card, right? My… ex-wife, she handled most of that. I just…show it when they need it. It’s all a blur, honestly. A long time ago, all of it. Do I need to do anything? Just… stand here?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Mr. Bartok. Don’t worry about the details. We’ll take it slow. And yes, you mostly just need to answer some questions, and then we’ll do a quick physical exam. It will be fairly standard – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, that sort of thing. First, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you been feeling generally well lately?
PATIENT: Well… as well as can be expected, I suppose. I get… aches. Old man aches, you know? Knees mostly. And… sometimes my breathing gets a little… short. Not all the time. When I… do stuff. I used to be more… active. A long, long time ago. Now… just walking to the store is enough. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. The aches and shortness of breath give me a good starting point. When you say “do stuff,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean, specific? I… I used to play baseball. A long time ago. And… I do some work. Helping out on construction sites. Small jobs. Lifting things. Carrying things. Nothing too heavy anymore. Like I said, I'm not exactly a spring chicken. Mostly it’s just…putting things together. And taking them apart. You know, handyman stuff. Does that make sense? It’s all a bit fuzzy, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: It does make perfect sense, Mr. Bartok. Thank you for clarifying. So, the shortness of breath seems to be related to physical exertion – lifting, carrying, and even walking. Does it happen immediately when you start an activity, or does it build up over time?
PATIENT: Hmm… usually… it starts after a little while. Not right away. I can walk a bit, lift a bit… then it gets harder. Like someone’s sitting on my chest. Not a lot of pain, just… tight. And I have to… slow down. Stop, even. A few times. It’s… unpleasant. That’s all. I don’t like it. But I can’t remember the last time it was really bad. Maybe a year ago? Or longer? I lose track.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything specific made it worse lately?
PATIENT: Worse… not really. It’s always been… like that. Maybe the heat? It’s been very hot lately. Makes everything harder. I try to avoid going out in the sun too much. I used to be able to handle it better. Before… everything. And the dust. All the dust on the construction sites. Makes it harder to breathe, naturally. But… no, nothing new that’s made it worse. Just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Uh… I don’t think so. The doctor… the one before… he just gave me pills. For my blood. Something with the pressure. And maybe something for my knees. I just took them. Didn't ask too many questions. I don’t like doctors very much, to be honest. They always want to know too many things. I just want a paper so I can play… whatever sport this is. I don't remember what it is. Was it baseball?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be overwhelming. We'll try to keep it simple. So, you’ve been taking medication for blood pressure and knee pain. Do you remember the names of those medications?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. Little white pills, mostly. And maybe some bigger ones. I just… take them when I remember. My ex-wife used to fill the bottles. I just…grab one when I need it. Honestly, I'm not sure what they're even for half the time. It’s all a blur. Do I need to know? Will it help me play… the sport?
DOCTOR: It would be helpful to know, Mr. Bartok, so we can make sure everything is safe for you. We can try to figure it out. Do you have any of the medication bottles with you today?
PATIENT: No, no bottles. I left them at home. Probably in the kitchen. Somewhere. My ex-wife… she cleaned everything out when we split up. Probably threw most of it away. She didn't like me taking pills. Said I was… careless. And she was probably right. Look, can’t you just… give me the paper? I need to try out for the team. It’s important to me. I don’t want to waste your time with all this… pill stuff. It won’t make any difference anyway.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s frustrating, Mr. Bartok. But it is important to know what medications you’re taking, even if you don’t remember the names. It could affect your health during physical activity. Okay. Let’s put that aside for a moment. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm… let me see. I broke my arm once. When I was a kid. Baseball. Naturally. They put a cast on it. That was… a long time ago. Other than that… I don’t think so. No hospitals. I avoid those places like the plague. They smell funny. And everyone’s always sick. No, no surgeries. Just the arm. A long, long time ago. Is that good enough? I really don’t like remembering things. It gives me a headache.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family who has had heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she had… something with her heart. I think. She was always tired. And she was always going to the doctor. I don't remember much about it. It was a long time ago. And my father… he smoked too much. Coughing all the time. I think he had something with his lungs. And my sister… she had… something bad. Cancer, maybe? I don’t like talking about this. It’s all very sad. I try to forget about it. Everyone's gone now. Is that enough? I really want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: It is enough, Mr. Bartok. I understand this is difficult. We'll move on. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, like I said, and it killed him. No, I don’t smoke. And drink… maybe a beer sometimes. On a hot day. To relax. Nothing fancy. And… drugs? What kind of question is that? No. I’m a respectable man. I don’t do drugs. I just want to play… the sport. Can we please just get this over with? This is making my head hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. We're almost finished with the questions. Last question: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. I think I got a rash once. From poison ivy. When I was a kid. Playing in the woods. And maybe… I sneezed a lot when I was around cats. But that’s it. Nothing serious. No medications, no food. Just… poison ivy and cats. Nothing to worry about. Can we please, please get to the paper now? I'm starting to feel dizzy. I just want to play… whatever this sport is. Is it baseball? I really hope it's baseball.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. No known medication or food allergies. That's good. Okay, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, feeling your pulse, and maybe looking in your ears. It won't take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. The sooner I have the paper, the sooner I can go play… whatever this sport is. Just don’t poke me too much. And please be gentle. My old bones aren’t what they used to be. Honestly, this whole thing is ridiculous. I just want to play some baseball. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Bartok. We'll be as gentle as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Can you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Fine. Hurry up. This cuff always feels so tight. It makes my arm go numb. And don't tell me it's a good thing, I hate when doctors say that. Just...get it over with, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. We'll need to monitor that. Now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath… and exhale. Again… deep breath… and exhale. I hear some mild crackling in your lungs. And your heart rate is a little fast, around 96 beats per minute. Do you feel like your heart is racing or skipping beats often?
PATIENT: Racing? Not really. It feels… normal, I guess. Old people hearts beat fast, don't they? Maybe it's just nerves. This whole thing is making me anxious. And those little things you put on my chest… they're cold! What did you find? Is something wrong? Just tell me straight, alright? Don't beat around the bush. I'm a simple man. Just tell me if I can play the sport or not. Is that too much to ask? I really need to know. It's important to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. Your blood pressure is a bit high, and I heard some crackling in your lungs. The crackling suggests there might be some fluid buildup, which could be due to a number of things, like a previous infection or early heart failure. The elevated blood pressure and crackles are why I'm concerned. Right now, I can’t clear you for strenuous physical activity, like playing baseball. It could be dangerous. We need to investigate this further. I want to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and an EKG to check your heart rhythm. And I recommend you see a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… what? An X-ray? A cardiologist? What are you talking about? I just want to play baseball! I don’t need any of that fancy stuff. This is ridiculous. I’m too old for all this. You're telling me…I can’t play baseball? Because of some… crackling? And high blood pressure? I feel fine! Mostly. Look, can't I just… try? Just a little bit? I promise I’ll be careful. I just want to see if I can still do it. It’s important to me. It’s been my dream forever. Just let me try, alright? Please? I’m too old to start over. It's all I have left. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand how much this means to you. And I truly wish I could just clear you to play. But I have a responsibility to protect your health. Playing baseball with elevated blood pressure and potential fluid in your lungs could lead to serious consequences, like a heart attack or stroke. It's not worth the risk. I know this isn't what you want to hear, and I'm truly sorry. But I believe the best course of action is to get these tests done and see the cardiologist. Once we have more information, we can discuss your options and see if it's safe for you to engage in physical activity. Here are the referrals for the cardiologist and the imaging center. Please schedule appointments as soon as possible. And I want you to take your blood pressure at home regularly. I’ll give you a list of instructions. We'll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Bartok. And hopefully, we can find a way for you to continue enjoying an active lifestyle, safely. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
