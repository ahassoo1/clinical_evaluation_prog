DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't have a lot of time for this. It's my stomach. Been…well, it's been awful. Just…diarrhea. Non-stop. I've tried everything the drugstore sells and it’s not helping, which is frankly ridiculous. I just need something that works.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for any delay. It sounds quite unpleasant to experience non-stop diarrhea despite trying over-the-counter remedies. We'll certainly try to get to the bottom of this and find a solution for you. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the diarrhea a bit more?
PATIENT: Ugh, describe it? What do you want to know? It's…watery. A lot of it. And it happens, like, all the time. Several times a day. It's not…not bloody, if that's what you're asking. Just…constant. And it makes me weak, obviously. I'm losing weight. Honestly, I don’t know why I even have to explain this. It’s pretty self-explanatory.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Woodring. It is helpful to have those details, even if it feels obvious. Knowing it's watery, frequent, and without blood is important. And yes, losing weight with this is concerning. To get a better understanding of the possible causes, could you tell me when this started?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't really remember exactly. A couple of weeks, maybe? It came on gradually, I think. It wasn't like one day I was fine and the next I wasn't. Just…slowly got worse and worse. I've been dealing with…other things, too, so I didn’t really pay much attention to it at first. It's just now it's not going away.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s easy to dismiss things when other priorities are demanding your attention. "Gradually worsening" is a helpful detail. To help me rule out potential causes, could you recall if anything specific happened around the time it began?
PATIENT: Specific? No. Not that I can think of. I haven’t been traveling, I haven’t eaten anything weird…well, nothing I thought was weird. I eat pretty normally. Look, I'm not one of these people who's always trying new restaurants or anything. I just…eat. I've been a little stressed, I guess. My husband passed away last year, so…there’s that. But I don’t see how that would cause this. It's just my stomach.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry to hear about the loss of your husband, Ms. Woodring. Grief can manifest in many ways, and it absolutely can impact physical health. It's important we consider all possibilities. To continue gathering information, could you describe any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well, I’m tired. Really tired. More than usual, and I was always a bit tired. And…my stomach cramps, obviously. That’s why I’m here. It’s not a sharp pain, just…a constant ache. And I've been a little nauseous, but I haven't actually thrown up. Does that make sense? It’s just…generally feeling awful, okay? I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Woodring, and I understand your frustration. "Generally feeling awful" is a valid description, and the fatigue, cramping, and nausea are all important details. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. I mean, besides the usual colds and flu, I haven’t really been sick. My doctor back home…well, he retired. He always said I had a strong constitution. I don’t even take regular medications. Just…sometimes ibuprofen for a headache. That’s it. This is so ridiculous. I shouldn't even be here wasting everyone's time.
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you've generally been healthy, Ms. Woodring, and that you haven't had any previous diagnoses. Knowing you only use ibuprofen occasionally is helpful as well. It's not a waste of time at all to seek medical attention when you're feeling unwell, and I assure you, we’re taking your concerns seriously. Now, are you allergic to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I eat everything. I mean, I don’t go out of my way to eat weird things, but I don't have any restrictions. I've never had a reaction to anything. Look, I’m a pretty simple person. Simple tastes, simple life. I just want this to be over with. What are you going to do about it?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Woodring. No known allergies simplifies things. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, or grandparents – have a history of digestive problems, like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't know. My family…we weren’t close. My parents are both gone, and I barely knew my grandparents. We didn't talk about…health things. It wasn't that kind of family. Just…we didn't. So, no. I don’t have any information about that. Can we just get to the point? What kind of tests are you going to do? Or are you just going to keep asking questions forever?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if I’m pressing you for information that you don’t have. It's not ideal, but we can proceed without a detailed family history. Given your symptoms and what you've told me, I would like to perform a physical examination, including listening to your abdomen and checking for any tenderness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do. Honestly, this is taking up my whole day. I really don’t have time for this. But…fine. Do whatever you need to do. Just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. Please lie back on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It will help me assess any bowel sounds and identify any areas of discomfort. I’ll also gently palpate your abdomen to check for tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Your bowel sounds are…hyperactive, which is consistent with diarrhea. I am noting some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, primarily on your left side, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes! That one. It's not sharp, but it's…uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. And…it feels a little swollen there, maybe? I don't know. It just doesn't feel right. Look, I told you my stomach hurts! This is why I came here. Can we just get a diagnosis already? I'm starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for any delay. It's good you pointed that out. The tenderness in your lower left abdomen is significant. Based on your symptoms – the watery diarrhea, fatigue, mild nausea, hyperactive bowel sounds, and tenderness in your lower left abdomen – several possibilities come to mind. It could be an infectious gastroenteritis – a stomach bug – but given the duration and lack of improvement with over-the-counter remedies, we need to consider other causes. Inflammatory bowel disease, like ulcerative colitis, is a possibility, although less likely without a history of blood in the stool. Diverticulitis, an inflammation of pouches in the colon, could also be a cause, especially with tenderness in the left lower abdomen. To help me narrow down the possibilities and arrive at an accurate diagnosis, I’d like to order a stool sample test to check for infections and inflammation. I also recommend a complete blood count to assess for signs of infection or anemia. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests. Of course. More tests. Fine. Whatever you think. Just…get it over with. A stool sample? Really? This is so…humiliating. But fine. Do what you need to do. And the blood test…okay. Just tell me where to go. I really don't have time for this. I just want to feel better. Can you at least give me something for the cramping now? Before I go do all these…things?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and discomfort, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I assure you, these tests are necessary to get an accurate diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. Yes, I can certainly prescribe something for the cramping in the meantime. I'm going to write you a prescription for hyoscyamine, an antispasmodic medication, which should help to relieve the abdominal cramps. Please take it as directed. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. The technician will provide you with the collection containers and instructions for the stool sample and will draw your blood. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No. Just…get it over with. I just want to feel normal again. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Woodring. We'll do our best to get you feeling better as quickly as possible. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or have any concerns. .
