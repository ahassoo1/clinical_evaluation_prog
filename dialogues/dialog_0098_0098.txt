DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, I just been kinda curious, you know? I ain't really sick sick. Just wanted to, like, check things out. See if everything's okay. I heard this was a good place.
DOCTOR: I understand. Preventative care is excellent, and you're right to be proactive. “Check things out” is a good reason to come in. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about what prompted you to schedule this appointment?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my ex-wife, she’s always on me about getting check-ups. And a buddy at work, he just found out he had high blood pressure, didn’t even know. Scared me a little, honestly. I work on the boats, you know? Lots of… heavy lifting and stuff. Just wanna make sure I’m good to go. Nothing feels wrong, but… better safe than sorry, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible, Demondre. It’s good you’re thinking about these things, especially with your line of work. Heavy lifting can put a strain on the body, so being thorough is important. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell outta a tree. And I had the chickenpox, like everyone else. But nothing… serious. Never been in the hospital for anything big. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat okay, try to get some sleep when I can, even with the boat schedule. I got Medicare, if that helps?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And yes, having your insurance information is very helpful. We'll get that sorted. Okay, and have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Not even tonsils outta or nothin’. Just… broken arm when I was little. That’s it. I kinda… avoid doctors if I can be honest. Not my favorite place, you know? But I figured a check-up wasn't so bad. Especially with what my friend found out.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. Many people feel that way. We'll try to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mom… she had… I think it was high blood pressure too, now that I think about it. And her mom, my grandma, she had… something with her heart, I think. But I don’t really know a lot of details. We weren't very close, and nobody really talked about health stuff, you know? My dad… he was healthy as a horse, worked construction his whole life. So, not much on that side, either. Sorry I can’t be more helpful. It's kinda fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Demondre. It’s common for family medical history to be a bit vague. Anything you do remember is helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't take nothin' regular. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back when it's really achin' from the work, but that's it. Like, once or twice a month maybe? Nothing every day or anything. Just when I really need it. I try to tough it out if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any allergies. I can eat anything, take anything... well, almost anything. I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but that's about it. Not a real allergy, just a little sniffly. Never had a bad reaction to anything a doctor gave me before, either.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Alright, Demondre, it sounds like we have a good starting point. Just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, like I said, I work on the boats. Mostly marine oilin' and stuff. It's hard work, lots of lifting, bendin', you know? Long hours, too. Not always the best sleep schedule. I don't drink much, maybe a beer once in a while with the guys. Don't smoke. Try to eat healthy when I can, but it's tough on the road. I guess that's about it. Divorced, live by myself. Pretty simple life, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Now, before we move on, and just to be thorough, do you have any current symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Nope. Honestly, that's why I'm here. Nothin's botherin' me. No aches, no pains, no coughs, no nothin'. Feelin' pretty good, all things considered. Just wanted to make sure everything was okay, you know? Like I said, kinda curious. My ex-wife would be happy to hear I actually went to the doctor!
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Demondre. It's always best to be proactive, and it sounds like you're in good spirits. Let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline, if that’s alright with you. It’ll just be a standard check-up – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, looking in your ears, things like that. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just gettin' it over with, you know? Hopefully everything's okay. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Great. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. If you don’t mind, please have a seat on the table here, and we'll get started. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not critically high. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Ears are clear. Throat is normal. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, bowel sounds are normal. I don't feel any masses or organomegaly. Everything seems within normal limits so far, Demondre. Just to be thorough, let's order some routine blood work. It will give us a more detailed picture of your overall health. We’ll check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and complete blood count. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust ya. Blood work sounds… thorough. I guess it's better to know, right? I’m just hopin' it's not too much of a hassle. Where do I go to get that done? And… will it take long to get the results?
DOCTOR: It's definitely better to know, Demondre. And it won't be a hassle at all. There’s a lab right across the street. I'll give you a requisition form. You can go over there whenever it's convenient for you, and they'll take a small blood sample. They usually have walk-in hours, so you shouldn't have to wait long. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, just continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Try to get regular exercise, eat a balanced diet, and get enough sleep. If you experience any new or concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I guess. You explained everything pretty good. Maybe… about the blood pressure bein' a little high? Should I be worried? I mean, I don’t feel bad or anything. And is there anything I can do about it now? Like, before the blood work comes back?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Demondre. A slightly elevated blood pressure reading isn't necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but it's something we want to monitor. It can fluctuate depending on various factors, like stress, caffeine intake, or even just the time of day. Since you're not experiencing any symptoms, let's not jump to conclusions. We'll get a clearer picture with the blood work, which will help us determine if it's a consistent issue. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help keep your blood pressure in check. Try to reduce your salt intake, increase your potassium intake , and make sure you're getting regular exercise. Managing stress is also important. Deep breathing exercises or meditation can be helpful. Ultimately, the blood work will give us the information we need to develop a plan tailored to your specific needs. Don't worry too much right now, but it's good that you're proactive and asking questions. Do you have any other concerns I can address?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that covers it. You answered everything. I appreciate ya takin' the time to explain things, Doctor. And for not makin' me feel like an idiot askin' all these questions. I guess I’ll head over to that lab then. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Demondre. It’s my job to answer your questions and make sure you feel comfortable. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and have a good day. We’ll see you in a few days to discuss the results. .
