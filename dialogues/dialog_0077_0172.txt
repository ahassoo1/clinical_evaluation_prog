DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Yes, well, I suppose it is a pleasure. Though I rarely enjoy these sorts of visits. Honestly, it's all rather… unnecessary. I just moved here, you see, and someone insisted I come for a “social healthcare visit.” Medicare, they call it. A dreadful lot of fuss, if you ask me. I’m perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: I understand. A new patient visit is standard procedure when establishing care, Ms. Engelhaupt, even with Medicare. It allows us to get a baseline of your health, just in case anything does arise. It’s good to be thorough. Even if you feel perfectly well, we want to make sure things stay that way. Now, to start, could you perhaps describe what “perfectly well” means to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. "Baseline." Honestly, all these new terms. Well, it means I can still manage my… affairs. I get up, I dress myself, I keep the house tidy. My husband, bless his heart, helps with the heavier lifting, naturally. And I haven’t fallen recently, which is a plus. It’s really quite simple. I don’t need a catalogue of my… inner workings.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Engelhaupt. That is a very good description of being well. Just making sure we cover everything. It sounds like you're very independent, which is wonderful. To clarify, you mentioned keeping the house tidy – do you experience any difficulty with tasks like climbing stairs, reaching for things, or bending over?
PATIENT: Oh, climbing stairs... well, there are a few. It's not a sprint, naturally. And reaching… sometimes things are just a little high, you know? I don’t require a ladder for everything, but the top shelves are my husband’s domain now. Bending… I prefer not to bend unnecessarily, if that makes sense. One doesn’t want to pull anything. Really, I’m not frail, Doctor. Just… sensible.
DOCTOR: Sensible is good, Ms. Engelhaupt. That gives me a clearer picture. Now, just to get a more complete understanding, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, appetite. Hmm. Well, I don't starve myself, if that's what you're asking. My husband does most of the cooking now, and he’s a good cook, thankfully. As for weight… honestly, I haven’t stepped on a scale in years. A dreadful invention, that scale. It only causes distress. I’m quite certain I haven’t ballooned, if that’s a concern.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance. That’s perfectly alright. Now, and forgive me for asking, but have you been experiencing any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, Doctor, at my age, one expects a little discomfort. My knees ache on damp days, naturally. And my back stiffens if I sit for too long. But I wouldn’t call it “pain.” It’s just… the wear and tear of a long life. I don’t require any… potions or bandages, if that’s what you’re suggesting.
DOCTOR: Wear and tear is a good way to put it, Ms. Engelhaupt. We all experience that eventually. Now, just to complete the picture, have you noticed any changes in your sleep pattern?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep. Now there is a topic. It comes and goes, you know? I doze off in the evenings, naturally. Though I wake up several times during the night. My husband snores, you see. It's… disruptive. And I tend to get up rather early. I wouldn’t say I’m restless, exactly. Just… not a sound sleeper.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… let me think. Just a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor insisted. And sometimes a pain reliever for my arthritis when it’s particularly damp. As for illnesses… well, I’ve had the usual things. A touch of pneumonia years ago, and the flu, naturally. I had my tonsils out when I was a girl, if that’s relevant. Honestly, Doctor, it was a very long time ago. I can barely recall the details.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Now, just one more quick area. Have there been any significant illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family illnesses. Now there's a complicated question. My mother… she had something with her heart, I believe. And my brother had a touch of diabetes. Honestly, it was so long ago, and my family… we weren't ones for discussing ailments. It was considered rather… indelicate. I doubt I remember the specifics, even if I tried.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. I think I have a reasonable initial understanding of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart, lungs, and blood pressure, and perhaps a brief neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An exam. Really, Doctor? I thought we were finished. Honestly, all this poking and prodding… It’s just dreadful. I suppose… I suppose it can’t be helped. But please be quick. And gentle. I haven’t been examined in years, and I’m not particularly fond of the experience.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Engelhaupt. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure, and then listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. If you could just extend your arm, please. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, if you could please take a deep breath for me... Heart sounds are regular, a slight murmur is present, likely benign. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but with diminished breath sounds in the bases. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, or a persistent cough lately?
PATIENT: Oh, shortness of breath… well, sometimes when I’m climbing the stairs, naturally. But I always attribute that to my age and the… effort. And a cough… sometimes, a little tickle in my throat. Nothing to speak of. It’s just… the usual things. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not made of iron. One expects a little… decline. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, with no tenderness to palpation. Reflexes are diminished, but symmetrical. Ms. Engelhaupt, your reflexes are a little slower than expected, and the diminished breath sounds could indicate some fluid buildup in your lungs. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any underlying infection. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. X-rays… and blood tests! Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite alarming. I came for a simple "social visit", not a full-scale investigation! Are you saying something is… wrong? I just want to be left alone, frankly. I don't understand all this… technical language, and I don't see the point of poking and prodding any further.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Engelhaupt. I’m not saying anything is definitely wrong, but these tests will help us get a clearer picture of your overall health and rule out any potential issues. The diminished breath sounds and slower reflexes warrant further investigation, purely as a precaution. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially given your age. If you’re hesitant about the tests, we can certainly discuss alternatives. However, I strongly recommend them to ensure we’re not missing anything important. Perhaps we could start with just the chest X-ray, and then discuss the blood tests afterward?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Just an X-ray, you say? Well… I suppose that’s marginally less intrusive. But honestly, Doctor, all this talk is making me quite anxious. I just want to go home and have a cup of tea. Very well. One X-ray. But please be quick about it. And don’t tell me everything you see, if it’s unpleasant. I'm a very sensitive woman, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Engelhaupt. Just one X-ray, and I will only share the necessary information with you. The technician will explain the procedure, and it shouldn’t take very long. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a low-dose aspirin to help with your blood pressure, and I recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Aspirin… Very well. Honestly, Doctor, all these medications. It’s a dreadful habit. And a follow-up appointment… Two weeks sounds… acceptable. I suppose. But please, no more surprises. I’ve had quite enough excitement for one day. Can I go now? I really must get home.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Engelhaupt. Here's the prescription for the aspirin, and a printed summary of our visit. The technician will be with you shortly to take the X-ray. If you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath before your follow-up appointment, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Thank you for coming in today. I understand your concerns, and I assure you we'll do everything we can to ensure your health and well-being. Please take care, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
PATIENT: .
