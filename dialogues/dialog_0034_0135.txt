DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Pleasure is mine. I have… problem with my ear. Discharge, you see. It has been… troubling me for some days now. Not much pain, but… wetness.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You've been experiencing discharge from your ear for a few days now, without significant pain, but noticing a feeling of wetness. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the discharge?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes… a little yellow. Not much smell. I try to clean it, but… it keeps coming back. It is from the left ear, Doctor. Left ear only. I remember very clearly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Mr. Radillo. Clear to slightly yellow discharge, no significant odor, and it’s only from your left ear. And you've been trying to clean it, but it returns. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No fever, I am sure of it. No headache. Sometimes… a little hard of hearing in that ear. Not all the time, you understand. Mostly when it is… very quiet. And… maybe a little dizziness, but I am old man, so… sometimes I am dizzy. Hard to say if it is the ear.
DOCTOR: I understand. No fever or headache, some intermittent hearing difficulty in the left ear, particularly in quiet environments, and a bit of dizziness that may or may not be related. Do you recall anything that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: Triggered? You mean… what made it start? I do not remember anything specific. I was… gardening, perhaps, a week ago. But I did not put anything in my ear. I remember that very clearly. I do not swim, either. Not anymore. It has been… many years since I swim.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no recent injury, swimming, or anything being put in your ear that you recall. You were gardening about a week ago. Now, have you ever had any problems with your ears before – infections, pain, ringing in the ears, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes. When I was young man, in Somalia, I had ear infection. Very bad pain. Doctor… gave me drops. It went away. Many, many years ago. Since then, no trouble. Until now, of course. I remember the drops were… yellow colour. And smelled… strong. Not nice smell.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Radillo. A history of an ear infection in your youth, treated with ear drops. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am healthy man. Well… old, but healthy. No diabetes. No high blood pressure, the doctor told me that last time. I take… one pill for cholesterol. Very small pill. And… sometimes, for my back. When it hurts too much. But that is all. I remember everything the doctors tell me. I have good memory.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Radillo. Just one pill for cholesterol and something occasionally for your back. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I eat everything. I have been… all over the world, and I eat everything. Never had reaction to anything. I remember clearly. Not even… shellfish. Even shellfish. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed with an examination, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmm. My father… he had heart problems, I think. Died when I was young. My mother… she lived long life. No problems, as far as I know. My sisters… healthy, I believe. They live in… Mogadishu. Not much contact, you understand. Difficult… to get information. I remember my father had… chest pain, before he died. But that is all. Not much family history to tell.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Radillo. That’s helpful. Okay, let’s take a look at your ear. I'm going to use an otoscope to look inside your ear canal. It doesn’t go in very far, but let me know if you feel any discomfort, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. I will tell you if I feel… anything. Please, be gentle. I do not like… things in my ear. But I trust you. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm seeing some cerumen, or earwax, present. The ear canal appears slightly inflamed, and there is indeed some clear, yellowish discharge noted. The tympanic membrane, or eardrum, appears… slightly cloudy, but intact. No visible perforations at this time. I'm also going to briefly check your temperature and listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a complete picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… alright. Cloudy… is that bad? The ear drum? I do not understand all the words you use. But yes, please check everything. I trust you. Everything you say, I listen carefully. Cloudy… please explain later.
DOCTOR: Your temperature is normal, and your heart and lungs sound good. “Cloudy” means there’s some fluid behind the eardrum, which is consistent with an infection. It doesn't necessarily mean it’s a severe infection, but it does indicate some inflammation. Based on what I'm seeing and hearing, it sounds like you likely have an outer ear infection, also known as otitis externa, or swimmer’s ear, even though you haven’t been swimming recently. Sometimes it can happen with skin irritation or changes in the ear canal. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? Is that serious, Doctor? Will I lose my hearing? I need my hearing. I live alone, you see. And I… like to listen to the radio. Is this… something I need to worry about? And… what do we do? Will it need… surgery? Please, explain very slowly. I am old man.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Radillo, otitis externa is generally not serious. It can be quite uncomfortable, but it’s usually treatable. It’s very unlikely you will lose your hearing from this, especially with prompt treatment. We'll start with ear drops – antibiotic and steroid drops to reduce the inflammation and fight the infection. These will need to be used for about a week. I’ll also recommend keeping your ear dry – avoid getting water in it during showers or bathing. We might also use a wick to help the drops reach the infected area. No, you will not need surgery. Surgery is very rarely needed for otitis externa. We'll manage this with medication. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Ear drops… for one week. Keep dry. No surgery. That is… good. I like that. Antibiotic and… steroid? What do those do? Will they… hurt? And… how do I put the drops in? I am afraid I will… do it wrong. Please show me again. Slowly.
DOCTOR: The antibiotic helps to kill the bacteria causing the infection. The steroid reduces the swelling and inflammation, which helps to relieve the pain and discomfort. The drops shouldn’t hurt, but they might feel a little cold at first. It’s important to warm them up by holding the bottle in your hand for a few minutes before using them. Here, let me show you how to put them in properly. First, gently pull your ear up and back to straighten the ear canal. Then, hold the bottle of drops close to your ear and squeeze the prescribed number of drops into the canal. After you put the drops in, gently wiggle your ear and stay on your side for about five minutes to allow the medication to soak in. It’s important to do this each time you use the drops. Do you feel comfortable trying it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I see. Up and back… warm them up… wiggle my ear. Five minutes on my side. I think… I can do that. Let me try. Is… is that right? I think I did it… but I cannot be sure. It feels… strange. Is the up and back… correct? I am worried I will not get enough in.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Mr. Radillo! You’re doing it exactly right. The up and back is a little tricky, but you’ve got it. And it’s alright if you don’t get a lot in at first. As long as you hold it in place for a few minutes, it will soak in. Don’t worry about getting too much in, just enough to coat the ear canal. I’m going to write you a prescription for the drops and give you instructions on how to use them. I also want you to follow up with me in one week to make sure the infection is clearing up. If your pain gets worse or you develop a fever, please call my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. You explain everything very clearly. I will follow your instructions. Up and back… warm them up… one week. Thank you very much, Doctor. You are… very kind. I hope… I hope this will help. I like listening to the radio. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. I hope you feel better soon, and you'll be enjoying the radio again in no time! Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
