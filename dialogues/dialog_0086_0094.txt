DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um... hello. Just... the paper said something about... learning? I don't really remember. My husband made the appointment. He says I need to... know things. About... stuff. I work with metal, you know. Big sheets. It's... hard work.
DOCTOR: Right. "Learning things." Okay. Well, let's try to figure out what "things" we're talking about. You said you work with metal… is this new work, or have you been doing it for a while?
PATIENT: A while. Long while. Maybe... ten years? Something like that. My hands… they get tired. And sometimes… they hurt. Not all the time, but... enough. It's heavy metal, you know. Not like... jewelry metal. Big, flat metal. We make... things for buildings. I think. My husband explains it. I just… cut it. And bend it. It's… tiring. Do you... understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Heavy manual labor. And you’re experiencing hand fatigue and pain. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Pain... hmm. It's... achey. Like... when you use your hands too much. Like after... washing a lot of dishes, but... worse. And sometimes… it feels like little shocks. Not big shocks, little ones. In my fingers. And my wrists. It goes away when I rest, mostly. But then it comes back when I'm… cutting. And bending. Is that... normal? I don't know much about... bodies.
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a tricky word. It’s good you’re paying attention to these symptoms. Little shocks, you say?
PATIENT: Shocks... yes. Like... tiny little zaps. Not like electricity, but… similar. Hard to explain. My husband says I worry too much. He says it's just… work. But it's been happening… longer now. And it's… annoying. It makes it hard to hold the scissors sometimes. Big scissors, for the metal. Not… paper scissors. He thinks I should just… stop thinking about it. Men.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s not dismiss it. Even if it is from work, we need to figure out what’s going on. I want to do a quick physical exam of your hands and wrists, if that’s alright. Just to see what’s happening with the muscles, tendons, and nerves. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Exam? You mean... touch my hands? I don't... I don't really like people touching my hands. They get dirty, you know. From the metal. And… I just washed them. But… if you have to. Just… be quick. And don't make a mess. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: It won't hurt, Ms. Fontanazza. It's just a gentle assessment. I’ll be wearing gloves, of course. We’ll check your range of motion, feel for any tenderness, and do a few simple tests. It will take just a few minutes. We need to see what might be causing the pain and the… shocks, as you call them. Do you have any cuts or blisters on your hands that I should be aware of before I touch them?
PATIENT: Blisters... sometimes. Little ones. From the metal edges. I wear gloves, but… sometimes they tear. And then… yeah, little blisters. They don't usually bother me much. I just… put a bandage on them. And try not to think about it. But they’re small. You don't need to worry about them. Just… be careful, okay? And don’t make a face. I don't like people making faces. It's rude.
DOCTOR: Alright, no faces, I promise. Let’s take a look. Can you just hold your hand flat for me, palm up?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels… funny. I don't usually… just hold my hand like this. It wants to... do things. Cut things. Bend things. It's a working hand. Not a… display hand. Just… hurry, okay? It’s making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relaxing… I'm just feeling for any areas of swelling or tenderness. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes. There. On the… bumpy part. Not bad, but… yeah. It feels… pinched. Like someone is squeezing it. My husband says I have strong hands. He says it's good for the work. But sometimes… they just ache. Is that normal? Everybody’s hands ache when they’re old, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the thenar eminence. And you mentioned the shocks and fatigue. Now, can you try to make a fist for me?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels… stiff. Not very smooth. My hands aren’t as good as they used to be. I can still cut the metal, but… it takes more effort. And it hurts a little. Does that make sense? I don't know the words for... body things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. There's a little bit of limited range of motion. Now, I'm going to check the sensation in your fingers. Close your eyes, if you’re comfortable. I'm going to lightly touch your fingertips with this… it's like a little brush. Just tell me when you feel it.
PATIENT: Okay. But don't poke me. I don't like being poked. Just… brush. Gently. My husband says I have sensitive skin. He says it's a curse. But I need to feel the metal, you know? If I can’t feel the metal, I can’t cut it properly. Just… hurry, please. This is… weird.
DOCTOR: Alright. It seems there's a little bit of diminished sensation in your thumb and index finger. Not significant, but something to note. Now, can you bend your wrists like this?
PATIENT: Like… this? Ooh. That one hurts a little bit more. It’s on the inside. This wrist… it feels… creaky. Like an old door. My husband says I need to oil my joints. He’s joking, I think. But it doesn’t feel very good. Can I… stop now? This is making me anxious. I need to go back to work. I have things to cut.
DOCTOR: Alright, we can stop here. It sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome and some tenosynovitis, which is inflammation of the tendons. The diminished sensation and pain in your wrist and fingers are consistent with that. I’m going to order some nerve conduction studies and electromyography—NCS/EMG—to confirm the diagnosis. It's a painless test, but it will require a referral to a neurologist. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Carpal… what? And teno… something? And… neurology? You want me to see a… brain doctor? I just cut metal! I don’t need a brain doctor. What does that even mean? And… a test? I don't like tests. Is it going to cost a lot of money? My husband will be angry. I just wanted to learn something, not… get poked and prodded and sent to a brain doctor!
