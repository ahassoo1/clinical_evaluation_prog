DOCTOR: Right. Reneisha Selbitschka, 41 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Murtić. It’s… well, it’s the weight. I’ve put on a considerable amount, rather suddenly, and I haven't changed anything in my diet or exercise routine. It’s… concerning, to say the least. I would like to understand what could be happening, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: “Concerning,” yes. Well, weight gain can be concerning. “Sudden” is the key word, though. How long exactly has this been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think precisely. It began… around late March, I believe. So, approximately four months now. It was very gradual at first, almost unnoticeable. But in the last month, it’s been… more pronounced. I stepped on the scale this morning, and it was… quite a shock, frankly. I hadn’t realised it was this much.
DOCTOR: Alright, four months. And how much weight, approximately, would you say you’ve gained during that time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I weighed myself regularly before this started, and I was… consistently around 160 pounds. This morning, it was 183. Perhaps a little more. I haven't been entirely diligent with daily weigh-ins lately, I must admit. It was rather disheartening to see, so I didn’t… repeat the experience immediately.
DOCTOR: So, approximately 23 pounds in four months. That is significant. And you haven't made any changes to your diet or exercise?
PATIENT: Absolutely none, Doctor. I eat the same things, same portions. I walk every day, as I always have - about a mile, usually. My husband and I have been… rather stressed lately with family matters, but that’s the only change. It hasn’t affected my appetite, I assure you. I haven’t been… indulging more, if that’s what you’re thinking.
DOCTOR: “Stress” can affect things, of course, but 23 pounds…it’s unusual without corresponding changes in lifestyle. Let’s move onto some other questions, then. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… now that you mention it… yes. A little. I… I haven't been as regular, shall we say? It's… difficult to explain precisely. Not severely, but noticeable. And… a little more discomfort than usual, occasionally. I thought it was simply… something I ate, honestly. I hadn’t thought to mention it, as it wasn’t constant. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be important, yes. We need to rule things out. Any fatigue?
PATIENT: Fatigue… yes. I have been feeling rather tired lately. More so than usual, certainly. I put it down to… well, everything. The stress, the family situation, just… getting older, I suppose. But it's a persistent tiredness. Not debilitating, but… I don't have the energy I used to. It takes longer to get going in the mornings, and I feel… drained by the afternoon. It's not a sharp tiredness, just… a general lack of pep. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Have you noticed any changes in your skin or hair?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. My skin… no, not particularly. Perhaps a little drier, now that you mention it, but I’ve always had somewhat dry skin. As for my hair… possibly a little more shedding than usual, when I brush it. But again, nothing dramatic. I often find a few strands in the brush, it’s nothing new. It's difficult to say if it's more than usual. I don’t pay particularly close attention, if I'm honest. I do use a new shampoo, perhaps that's it.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any heat or cold intolerance?
PATIENT: Heat or cold intolerance... now that is a good question. I haven't actively noticed anything… specifically. I'm always a little chilly, to be honest; I have poor circulation. But nothing worse than usual, I believe. Perhaps I feel the cold a little more readily now, but that could simply be… the natural progression of aging. I haven’t been unusually hot, or sweating excessively. Just… normal. Perhaps a little more sensitive to the cold, but I wouldn't call it intolerance. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's information, yes. Last question for now. Any changes in your menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, um… that’s… I haven’t had a menstrual cycle in quite a while, Doctor. I am… postmenopausal. It’s been about eight years now, I believe. Perhaps nine. So, no changes to report on that front. Is there something specific you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your thyroid, and check your abdomen. Just need you to lie down on the table. It will just be a brief assessment.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. As you wish. . Do let me know if there's anything specific I should do, or if it’s uncomfortable. I do hope you don't mind my weight; I apologise for that. I’m rather… substantial, these days.
DOCTOR: Don’t apologise. It's part of my job. Just lie flat and relax. Breathe deeply, please. Heart sounds are… normal rate, but slightly distant. Lungs are clear. Thyroid… feels slightly enlarged, but no obvious nodules. Abdomen is… soft, but there’s some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No masses felt. Alright. That confirms some of my suspicions. I want to order some blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a TSH to check your thyroid function, and a lipid panel. Also, given the abdominal tenderness, I want to order a stool test, just to rule out any gastrointestinal issues.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. The stool test… is it anything unpleasant? I must confess, I'm not particularly fond of… those types of procedures. But if it's necessary, I understand. As for the blood work, that's perfectly acceptable. Will you be able to tell me the results relatively quickly? And, if you don’t mind me asking… what are you suspecting, exactly? It’s quite alright if you’re not ready to say, of course. I simply prefer to be… informed, if possible.
DOCTOR: The stool test is… not pleasant, no. But it’s a simple collection at home, and we’ll give you detailed instructions. As for the blood work, the results usually take about three to five business days. And to answer your question…given your symptoms - the sudden weight gain, fatigue, abdominal tenderness, and the slightly enlarged thyroid – I want to rule out hypothyroidism, even though you’re postmenopausal. It can present atypically, and sometimes the symptoms overlap. We also need to exclude any gastrointestinal causes for the tenderness, and check your cholesterol levels as weight gain can often impact those. It's important to remember I'm not making a diagnosis at this point. We simply need more information. I'll also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist, just in case the stool test comes back abnormal. It's best to be cautious.
PATIENT: That… makes sense, Doctor. Hypothyroidism… I haven’t considered that, honestly. It runs in my family, actually, on my mother’s side, but she didn’t experience this particular set of symptoms. I’m perfectly willing to undergo the tests, of course. And a referral to a gastroenterologist… alright. The more information, the better, as you say. Will I need to fast before the blood work? And will you be contacting me with the results, or should I schedule a follow-up appointment? I understand you're very busy, of course. Perhaps I should simply call after five business days?
DOCTOR: Yes, you do need to fast for the blood work. No food or drink – except water – for at least eight hours before the test. I’ll contact you with the results, but it may be through a nurse. And it’s best to schedule a follow-up appointment, regardless of the results. That way, we can discuss them in detail and formulate a proper plan. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Next week would be excellent, Doctor. Perhaps… Tuesday afternoon? I have a prior engagement on Monday, and Wednesday mornings are occupied with household duties. Tuesday afternoon would suit me perfectly. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience. I know I’m not the most… straightforward patient, and I apologize for any inconvenience I’ve caused.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize. It’s my job. I'll schedule you for Tuesday afternoon. The nurse will call you with the exact time. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – particularly severe abdominal pain, or significant fatigue – contact the office immediately. Here’s the lab requisition and the referral form. Alright. That’s all for today. Get the blood work done as soon as possible.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will do that immediately. Thank you again for your time and your assistance. . Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: .
