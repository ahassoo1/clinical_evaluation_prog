DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. So, tell me… what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, right. Well, Dr… Burlingham, is it? Yeah. Look, honestly, I don’t really do details, you understand? But my… well, my wife, bless her, she was always on about… fitness and sleep and all that. And I suppose it's been… a bit off since… you know. She'd want me to get it checked, I guess. Something about optimizing things. Honestly, I just want to feel… less tired, I suppose. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: "Optimizing," is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s what she called it. Always had a word for everything, didn't she? Look, I fix pianos, alright? Not… bodies. I just want to be able to get through the day without feeling like I’ve run a marathon after tuning a Steinway. Is that… a reasonable request?
DOCTOR: Well, it should be. But “feeling tired” could mean a lot of things, Mr. Redfern. Are you able to describe how you’re feeling tired?
PATIENT: Ugh. See, this is what I mean. How? I just… am. Like… heavy. And slow. And I wake up feeling like I haven’t slept at all, even if I’ve been in bed for eight hours. Sometimes more. It's not… physical, exactly. More… mental. Like my brain’s still trying to catch up. Does that… make any sense? I doubt it.
DOCTOR: Alright, “mental fatigue,” we’ll call it for now. And this has been going on for…?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. A while. Since… well, since she passed, I suppose. It's all a bit… blurry, honestly. Months? Maybe longer. I really don’t keep track of these things. It just… sort of is, you know? I keep expecting it to get better, but it doesn't.
DOCTOR: Months, alright. And aside from this… fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I… I don't know. I eat, I sleep , I fix pianos. I’m not one for… ailments. Let me think… No, not really. I get a bit… irritable, maybe. But that's just… me, isn't it? I wouldn't say I’m happy happy, but that’s not new. Is there something specific I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try a quick review of systems, just to cover all bases. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat when I feel like it. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Weight… probably lost a bit. The clothes are a little looser, I suppose. But I haven’t actually weighed myself in ages. Honestly, Dr. Burlingham, I'm a piano tuner, not a… a science experiment. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: It’s necessary to rule things out, Mr. Redfern. Now, any problems with your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Good heavens, are you serious? We're really doing this now? Look, I fix pianos, alright? I don’t discuss… that… with doctors. Is there any way we can get back to the tiredness? This is all rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I am trying to get a complete picture of your health. If you are unwilling to provide basic information, it makes my job… difficult. And frankly, rather unproductive. Now, are you experiencing any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? Look, I get stressed when a customer brings in a piano that’s been left in a shed for twenty years! That might cause my heart to race a bit! But no, nothing… clinical. I breathe fine, my chest doesn't hurt… I’m a perfectly functional human being, despite what you seem to think. I just want to feel less tired! Is that too much to ask? Honestly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's move on. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns, aside from feeling tired?
PATIENT: Well… I wake up a lot. Not necessarily fully awake, just… aware. And I toss and turn. A lot. My wife used to say I was a restless sleeper. Now it's just… worse, I suppose. And sometimes I have… strange dreams. Not nightmares, exactly. Just… odd. Things don't make sense.
DOCTOR: “Odd dreams.” And how long have you been experiencing these… odd dreams?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Since… she passed, I think. Or maybe a bit before. It's hard to say. They come and go. They're not… a constant thing. Just… unsettling. Sometimes I wake up feeling… sad, after them. Or just… confused. Honestly, they’re probably nothing. Just my brain being silly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any recent changes in your mood?
PATIENT: Look, I’m a widower, alright? Of course my mood isn’t fantastic. I’m… okay. I get by. I work. I fix pianos. I eat. It's not a party, but it's… a life. Is there a point to all this, Dr. Burlingham? Because honestly, I feel like I’m being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I am attempting to ascertain if your fatigue could be related to something more than simply grief. Now, have you experienced any loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Well… yes. I used to… we used to go to concerts. And the theatre. And… things. But now… what's the point? It's not the same, is it? Without her. I still fix pianos, of course. That’s… work. That’s different. It doesn't require… happiness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven't exactly spent my life in and out of doctor’s offices. I get a cold now and then, like anyone else. I had the usual childhood things, I suppose. Measles, mumps, the lot. But nothing… serious. I'm a reasonably healthy man, despite my current… tiredness.
DOCTOR: And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Umm… no. No surgeries. I broke my arm once, when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But they just put it in a cast. Nothing… major. I’ve always been… careful, I suppose. Mostly.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Look, Dr. Burlingham, honestly… I don’t really do family. My parents… they’re gone. Long gone. And I didn’t really keep in touch with anyone else. It’s just me, mostly. So, no. I don’t really have a family history to tell you. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don't take anything. Never have. I prefer to… manage things myself, if possible. I don’t trust those things, frankly. All those side effects… No, thank you. I'm a piano tuner, not a… a guinea pig.
DOCTOR: And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. I eat pretty much anything. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. Dust, maybe. All that sawdust from the pianos… But that's just… annoying. Not an allergy. Honestly, Dr. Burlingham, I’m a fairly simple man. I don't have… complications.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Redfern, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well… I suppose so. Though, honestly, I'm not really one for… poking and prodding. Is it absolutely necessary? Can't we just… discuss things?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Redfern. It's part of a standard medical assessment. Now, please. Just lie down. We'll be quick.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. But please, be gentle. And try not to… listen to my heartbeat too closely. It probably sounds very… tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are… regular. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Reflexes are… normal. 2+ bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72. Temperature is 98.6. Everything appears… within normal limits. I’m not detecting any obvious physical abnormalities.
PATIENT: Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. Though, frankly, I could have told you that. I feel fine, mostly. Just… tired. Does that mean… it’s all in my head, then? Is that what you’re going to tell me? Because honestly, I’m not sure that’s particularly helpful.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, it’s not necessarily “all in your head.” Fatigue can have many causes. And ruling out physical causes is the first step. Given your history – the recent loss, changes in sleep and mood, and lack of any significant physical findings – it’s possible you’re experiencing symptoms related to grief and adjustment disorder. I'd like to order some bloodwork, just to be certain. A complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. And I’m going to recommend a referral to a therapist specializing in grief counseling. It’s important to address the emotional component of this. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Therapy? Really? Look, I appreciate you… poking around, I suppose. But I’m not one for… talking about my feelings. It never did me any good, frankly. As for bloodwork, fine. If it’ll get me out of here faster, I suppose. But I’m telling you, it’s all just… sadness. It'll pass, eventually. It always does. I don't need a… counselor. I just need to… fix pianos. That’s what I do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I understand your reluctance. But dismissing this as simply "sadness" isn't helpful. Grief can manifest in many ways, and it’s important to get appropriate support. I'm going to order the bloodwork regardless. And I strongly recommend you reconsider the referral. I’ll write you a prescription for a multivitamin in the meantime. It won’t solve everything, but it’s a good starting point. Here. Take one tablet daily with food. And I’ll have the lab results sent to you as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… when will the results be back? And can I get a copy sent to my… to my friend? He sometimes helps me with paperwork. He’s… more organized than I am. Honestly, this whole thing is rather… disruptive. I have pianos to tune, you know.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within 5-7 business days. And yes, you can have a copy sent to your friend. Just let the receptionist know his name and contact information. I've also printed out some information on grief counseling resources. Please, consider reviewing them. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Redfern?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. I think… I think that’s all. I appreciate your… time, I suppose. Though, frankly, I'm not sure it's been particularly productive. I'll see myself out, then. .
DOCTOR: Some people… .
