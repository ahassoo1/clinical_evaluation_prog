DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. I’m Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though I must say, this office is…adequate. I am here because my husband, bless his heart, thinks I need to have one of these…directives. An advance directive, he called it. Something about making sure my wishes are known should…well, should something happen. Honestly, I find the whole thing rather morbid, but he insisted.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It can feel a bit unsettling to think about these things, but it’s very responsible of both of you to be proactive. It’s about peace of mind, really. An advance directive – or a living will, as it’s sometimes called – simply outlines your healthcare preferences if you’re unable to speak for yourself. We’ll just talk through some scenarios and document what’s important to you. Before we get into that, though, are you currently experiencing any health issues or symptoms that brought you in today, aside from your husband's suggestion?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no current illnesses, thank you very much. I am quite healthy, for my age. I walk every morning, you know. Keep active. It's…important. My husband worries far too much, as I said. He reads things online, dreadful things, and then suddenly I need to fill out forms about…everything. Honestly, it's a bit much. I just want to get this over with so he stops fretting. Do we have to go through every possible…eventuality?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. We certainly don’t need to cover every possible scenario if you’re not comfortable. We'll focus on the things that are most important to you. It sounds like you're very active and generally in good health, which is wonderful. To start, and just for the record, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Years ago, when I was pregnant with my son, I had…gestational diabetes. But that was ages ago, and it went away after the birth. Perfectly fine ever since. And I suppose my doctor in Morocco mentioned something about my cholesterol being a little high once, but it was nothing serious. I adjusted my diet, and it was fine. Really, I’ve been quite healthy. I don’t go to doctors unless absolutely necessary, you know. All those…tests. And the waiting rooms… dreadful.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Gestational diabetes is common and often resolves on its own, as you said. And it’s positive that you addressed the cholesterol through diet. So, no other diagnoses that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. I really pride myself on staying fit. My mother, bless her soul, always said fresh air and movement were the best medicine. And she lived to be ninety-five, so I suppose she knew something. Are we getting closer to finishing this…document? I have a luncheon with my friends later this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Yes, we're making good progress. Just a few more questions, and then we can discuss the actual advance directive form. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything besides the pregnancy and delivery?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No, not really. Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a child, of course. But that was… a very long time ago. And I was briefly hospitalized once in Morocco after a rather bad bout of food poisoning. But that was just overnight. Nothing serious, truly. I’ve always been very careful about what I eat, except for that one incident. It was a new restaurant, you see…and the fish didn’t smell quite right. But I learned my lesson.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy and a bout of food poisoning, noted. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just a multivitamin, really. A woman at my yoga class recommended it. Something about boosting the immune system. And occasionally, if my joints are a little achy, I take ibuprofen. But very rarely. It’s just… sometimes after a particularly strenuous yoga session, or if the weather is bad. Nothing regular, I assure you. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. A warm bath, a cup of chamomile tea… that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen for joint aches, noted. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no allergies. I've been fortunate that way. I eat everything, thankfully. My husband is terribly allergic to shellfish, so we rarely eat it, but I have no such problems. I consider it a blessing. Honestly, it would be dreadful to have to restrict one’s diet. Now, are we finally getting to the actual form? I do hope it’s not too lengthy.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are! We're almost there. No known allergies – that’s excellent. The form itself isn’t terribly lengthy, and we can take breaks at any point. Before we begin, just a few final questions about your family history and social habits, if you don’t mind. Has anyone in your immediate family – parents, siblings – had any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother, as I mentioned, lived a long and healthy life, but her sister, my aunt, had… breast cancer. Years ago, thankfully she recovered. And my father, he had high blood pressure. But again, nothing too serious. He managed it with diet and exercise, just like me. As for my siblings, my brother is perfectly healthy, and my sister… well, she doesn't believe in doctors, so I have no idea what ails her. She’s very…alternative. Is that enough family history? It’s all rather mundane, truthfully.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. It’s good to know about your aunt and father. Now, one last thing before we start on the directive itself. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I find those habits utterly… distasteful. My husband enjoys a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I myself do not partake. And drugs? The very idea! I am a respectable woman. I pride myself on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, as you know. Now, let us finally get to this form, shall we? I do have that luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I apologize for the extensive questions – it’s simply my responsibility to gather a complete picture of your health. And I admire your commitment to a healthy lifestyle. This form, as I mentioned, outlines your wishes for medical care should you become unable to communicate them yourself. It covers things like whether you want life-sustaining treatment, such as a ventilator, and who you would like to make decisions on your behalf. We can go through it section by section, and you can ask any questions you have along the way. We will start with naming your healthcare proxy… is there someone you trust implicitly to make decisions for you if you are unable to?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. My husband, Hassan. Without question, it would be Hassan. He worries too much, as I said, but he is a good man. And he knows my wishes. He’s very… pragmatic. Although, I suppose he’ll want to consult with the children. I do wish they wouldn’t interfere so much. They think they know best. But Hassan is the one I trust. He’ll advocate for what I want. Now, let’s get this over with, shall we? I have a feeling this luncheon will be quite…eventful.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll document Hassan as your healthcare proxy. It's good that you have someone you trust so implicitly. And we can certainly add a note about your preferences regarding family involvement – it's important to have those wishes known. Now, the next section asks about the type of medical care you would want in different situations. Specifically, it asks about life-sustaining treatment, such as a ventilator or feeding tube, if you were in a coma or had a severe illness with no reasonable chance of recovery. Do you have any initial thoughts about whether you would want those types of treatments in such a situation?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, the very thought is… distressing. I have seen what those machines do to people. It's not a life, it’s merely…existence. If I were to be in such a state, with no hope of recovery, I would not want to be kept alive artificially. It would be a kindness to let nature take its course. I want to be comfortable, and I want to be allowed to pass peacefully. I do not want to be a burden on anyone. Hassan understands this, of course. He’s a very sensible man. Is that clear enough? I trust that will be noted appropriately.
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear. We'll document your wishes to forgo life-sustaining treatment in the event of a coma or severe illness with no reasonable chance of recovery. It's very important that your wishes are honored, and we'll make sure that's clearly stated in the form. The next section asks about pain management. Would you want to receive aggressive pain medication even if it might hasten your death?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, if I am in pain, of course I want medication! What kind of question is that? To suffer needlessly? I have a rather low tolerance for discomfort, I must admit. If I am at the end, I want to be comfortable. I do not want to be writhing in agony. Aggressive pain management, yes. Absolutely. Let me be at peace. Hassan understands, of course. He knows I am…sensitive. Is that sufficient? I hope we are nearing the end of this ordeal.
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear. We’ll document your desire for aggressive pain management to ensure your comfort, even if it means hastening your death. It’s important to us to respect your wishes and ensure you’re not suffering. Now, the final section is for your signature and the signatures of two witnesses. Do you have anyone with you today who can serve as a witness?
PATIENT: No, unfortunately not. I came directly from yoga, and my friends are waiting for me at the restaurant. It’s terribly inconvenient, this whole process. Do you have someone here who can witness it? I really do need to leave soon. Hassan can sign it later, I suppose. As long as my basic wishes are documented, that’s what matters most. Is that acceptable? I trust it is.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We have staff members here who can serve as witnesses. Let me get Maria, our medical assistant, to come in and witness your signature. <stage>I gesture to the door and call out “Maria, could you come in for a moment?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be perfectly acceptable. Let us get this over with, shall we? I do apologize for the inconvenience. It is just… I have a very busy afternoon. And frankly, this whole process is rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: "Good morning, Marija. Dr. Annesley, I’m ready when you are." "Please sign here, Marija, when you are ready. Maria will witness your signature and document the date and time." "Take your time."
PATIENT: “There. Is that sufficient? I trust everything is in order.”
DOCTOR: “Yes, Marija, everything looks perfect. Thank you for completing this. I’ll make a copy for your records and one for your chart.” “Excellent. We have successfully documented your advance directive. This will ensure your wishes are honored should you become unable to communicate them yourself. I understand this was unsettling, and I appreciate your willingness to go through with it. Now, before you leave, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: “No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have documented my wishes, and frankly, I am relieved it is over. I trust Hassan will ensure everything is handled appropriately. And I do hope I will not need to revisit this matter. It is…distressing to contemplate. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a luncheon to attend. Thank you for your time.” “And thank you, Maria.”
DOCTOR: “Certainly, Marija. I understand. We’ll keep this form in your chart, and Hassan can access it whenever needed. I wish you a pleasant luncheon, and I hope you won’t need to revisit this matter, but remember we are here if you ever have any questions or concerns. Please don’t hesitate to reach out.” “It was a pleasure meeting you, Marija.”
