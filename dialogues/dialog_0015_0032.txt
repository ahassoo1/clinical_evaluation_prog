DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… a rather delicate matter, you see. Something of an… issue down there. It’s been… discharging. Yes, discharging. It’s quite bothersome, really. Not at all what one expects at my age.
DOCTOR: Discharging… alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? Let me think. It’s been… a while. Perhaps a fortnight? Or longer. Honestly, my wife noticed it before I did, and she has a much sharper eye for these things. She insisted I come in. Women, you know… always fussing. But yes, longer than two weeks, I believe. Quite a bit longer.
DOCTOR: A fortnight… so, over two weeks. And would you describe the discharge as… watery, thick, colored?
PATIENT: Colored? Good heavens, Doctor, must we be so… explicit? It’s… not pleasant. It’s… yellowish, I suppose. And not entirely watery, but not exactly… viscous either. Somewhere in between. A rather unfortunate consistency, truthfully. It stains my undergarments, you see. A most unwelcome development.
DOCTOR: Yellowish discharge… alright. Has there been any pain, burning, or itching associated with this?
PATIENT: Pain… not precisely pain. More… discomfort. A slight ache, occasionally. And yes, a bit of itching, now that you mention it. Not constant, but… irritating. Like a persistent fly buzzing around. Mostly when I… well, when I’m active, if you catch my meaning. It’s quite undignified, really.
DOCTOR: Discomfort and itching, exacerbated with activity. Any fever, chills, or change in your urinary habits – difficulty urinating, increased frequency, or urgency?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven't felt feverish. Chills… not that I recall. And my… urinary habits? Doctor, are you suggesting something is… wrong with my bladder? I assure you, that organ has functioned perfectly well for eighty-three years! I haven't needed to get up more than usual, nor have I had any difficulty… emptying myself, if you must know. It’s all quite normal, really. I simply don’t appreciate these… probing questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok. I simply need to rule out other possibilities. Now, have you had any recent changes in your sexual activity, or any new sexual partners?
PATIENT: Doctor! Good heavens, at my age? Are you implying…? I have been married to my wife, Helen, for fifty-seven years! Fifty-seven years! To suggest such a thing is… frankly, impertinent. I haven't had a “change in sexual activity” since… well, since we retired! The question is entirely unnecessary, and rather… vulgar, I must say.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's move on to your past medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Now that is a sensible question. Let me think… I believe I had a slight reaction to penicillin many years ago. A rash, I think. Not severe, but enough for my doctor at the time to advise against it. Beyond that… no, nothing significant. I’ve always been a rather robust fellow, you see. Good constitution, good genes, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Medications… Well, my doctor prescribed something for my blood pressure a few years back, but I stopped taking it. It made me feel rather… sluggish. And I take a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. When it flares up, you see. Mostly just over-the-counter, though. Ibuprofen, I think it is. Nothing serious. Helen handles most of that, to be honest. She's very organized.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else significant?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a tricky one. My father… he lived to be a good age, I believe. But he wasn’t one for doctors, so we didn't know much about his health. My mother… she had some sort of… stomach trouble, I think. Nothing specific. And my sister… well, she died young, unfortunately. A fever, if I recall correctly. But beyond that… no, not that I'm aware of. My family wasn’t one for discussing such… unpleasant matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to conduct a quick physical exam. It will involve checking your vital signs, and a brief examination of the affected area. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: An… examination? Doctor, must we? I confess, the thought is rather… distressing. I mean, I’ve already explained the situation. Surely, you have enough information to… prescribe something? I assure you, it’s nothing serious. But if you insist… well, I suppose I have no choice. But please, be quick and discreet. And gentle, if you please.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok, but a physical exam is necessary to properly assess your condition and rule out other possibilities. It will be as quick and discreet as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. I'm noting some yellowish discharge, as you described. No palpable masses or significant tenderness. Vital signs are blood pressure 140/90, pulse 72, temperature 98.6. Based on my examination, and your reported symptoms, it is possible you have a mild case of urethritis or balanitis. However, to confirm this diagnosis, and rule out other potential causes, I would like to order a urinalysis and a swab for microscopic examination. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Urethritis? Balanitis? Good heavens, those are… unpleasant sounding words. A swab? Doctor, must you? It all sounds… rather invasive. But… if it’s necessary for a proper diagnosis… very well. But please, be as gentle as possible. And tell me… is it serious? Am I going to… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krok. The swab is necessary to identify the cause of the discharge – whether it’s bacterial, fungal, or something else. It’s a quick procedure and should not be overly uncomfortable. As for seriousness… mild urethritis or balanitis is typically not a serious condition, and is usually treatable with antibiotics or antifungal medication. However, it’s important to get a proper diagnosis to ensure appropriate treatment and prevent any potential complications. I'll collect the sample now. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort during the process. After we receive the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment for you.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Proceed, I suppose. But please, do be quick about it. And gentle. As I said, gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krok, that’s all done. I've sent the sample to the lab, and we should have the results back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend practicing good hygiene in the area – gentle washing with mild soap and water. Avoid any harsh chemicals or scented products. I'll also prescribe a mild topical antifungal cream in the meantime, while we await the results. It won’t hurt to use it, and it may provide some relief. Do you have any allergies to creams or ointments?
PATIENT: Allergies to creams… Hmm. I don’t believe so. But my skin is rather sensitive, you see. I’ve had a bit of a rash with certain products in the past. Nothing severe, but enough to make me cautious. Perhaps something… fragrance-free? And not too greasy, if you please. I dislike feeling… sticky.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll prescribe a fragrance-free zinc oxide cream. It's gentle, soothing, and shouldn't cause any irritation. Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice daily. Here is the prescription for the cream. You can pick it up at the pharmacy of your choice. Once we have the lab results, we will discuss the appropriate course of treatment. If you experience any worsening symptoms – increased pain, fever, or difficulty urinating – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Just… thank you. For your… discretion. And for not making me feel too… foolish. It's not every day a man my age has to discuss such matters. I believe that is all. Good day.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Krok. Get well soon. .
