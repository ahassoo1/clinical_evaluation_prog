DOCTOR: Hello, Liza. Welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s very nice to meet you too, Dr. Kamahele. Well, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about… how to be more present, I guess. I keep hearing about mindfulness and meditation, and it sounded like something that might help. I work with the tracks, out in the field a lot, and sometimes my mind just… wanders. It’s hard to focus, you know? I was hoping you might have some ideas.
DOCTOR: Hmm, that’s… interesting. It sounds like you’re feeling a bit disconnected, maybe overwhelmed with thoughts when you’re working. It’s good you’re recognizing that and wanting to find ways to cope. So, when you say your mind wanders… can you tell me a little more about when that happens?
PATIENT: Well, it's not always happening, thankfully! But definitely when things are… quieter. Like, when I’m checking a switch, making sure everything’s aligned properly, and there isn’t a lot of noise around. Or even driving to the different sites – long stretches of road, you know? It’s not dangerous, I’m always very careful, but… my thoughts just drift. I start thinking about things at home, or things that happened last week, or things I need to do later. And then I realize I haven’t been fully paying attention to the road, or to the switch, for a little while. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Liza. It sounds like you're very aware of what's happening, which is good. It’s common for our minds to wander, especially when we’re not actively engaged or when things are repetitive. You mentioned it’s unsettling… is it causing you any anxiety, or are you more just… frustrated by it?
PATIENT: Hmm, not anxiety, exactly. It’s more… a feeling of not being fully there. Like I’m missing something, or I’m not as efficient as I could be. And I worry about making a mistake, even though I haven’t yet! It just feels… unprofessional, maybe? I take a lot of pride in my work, and I want to be completely focused when I’m doing it. It’s a bit hard to explain, it’s just… a nagging feeling. I'm not stressed about it, but it’s definitely a source of… mild irritation, I suppose. Does that sound silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Liza. It sounds like you have a very strong work ethic and a desire to do your best, and that’s admirable. And it makes perfect sense that feeling disconnected would be unsettling when you take so much pride in your work. You said it happens when things are quieter… Do you notice if it’s worse at certain times of day, or after you’ve been working for a long period?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I think… maybe it is worse later in the day. When I’m tired, definitely. And if I haven’t had enough water, to be honest. But it’s hard to say for sure. I usually work pretty consistent hours, so it’s not like I’m drastically changing things up. I try to stay hydrated, and I do get enough sleep most nights. It’s just… more noticeable when I’m already a little worn out, I think. Less mental energy to… keep things focused, maybe? Does that make any sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: No rambling at all, Liza. You’re explaining it perfectly. It sounds like fatigue and dehydration could definitely be contributing factors. Now, you mentioned mindfulness and meditation… Have you tried any specific techniques, or were you hoping I could suggest some?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I haven’t tried anything yet! I’ve just been reading articles online, mostly. Things about focusing on your breath, and paying attention to your senses. It all sounded… a bit abstract, to be honest. I’m a very practical person, and I work with… well, with metal. It’s hard for me to imagine sitting still and… emptying my mind. I was hoping you might have some suggestions for someone who… isn’t very good at “woo-woo” things, I guess.
DOCTOR: “Woo-woo” is a good way to put it! I understand. Mindfulness doesn’t have to be about emptying your mind, it’s more about observing your thoughts without getting carried away by them. It sounds like you're very grounded and practical, so perhaps a more… active approach would be better. Before we jump into techniques, though, I'd like to ask a few more questions, just to get a broader picture. Has anything changed in your life recently—any new stresses or routines?
PATIENT: Not really, no. My life is pretty… consistent, thankfully. I live alone, so there aren’t any family pressures. My work is steady. I see my friends occasionally, but it’s not a huge social life. I lost my brother a few years ago, that was… difficult, but I’ve mostly adjusted to that. Nothing new has happened, to be honest. I think that’s why I’m a bit puzzled by all of this. It’s not like I’m dealing with a major life event or anything. It’s just… this nagging feeling of being a bit disconnected.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Liza. It sounds like you’ve been through some grief, and even though you’ve adjusted, those things can have lasting effects. I’m wondering about your physical health overall. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of—things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let's see. I have Medicare, so I get regular check-ups. My blood pressure is usually a little high, but the doctor said it’s nothing to worry about yet, just to watch my salt intake. I don’t have diabetes, thankfully. And no, no thyroid problems. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I walk a lot at work, which is good exercise, and I try to eat a balanced diet. I had a bit of trouble with my back a few years ago, but that’s mostly under control now with some stretching.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And it's excellent you're staying active and mindful of your health. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam – just to make sure everything’s functioning as expected. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. I don’t mind at all. I’m used to check-ups, so it’s no problem. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just have a seat here, we'll get started. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Okay, everything sounds pretty good so far. Your heart and lungs are clear, and your reflexes are normal. Your blood pressure is a little high, but we already knew that. I noticed a slight hesitation with some of the coordination exercises, but that's not necessarily a cause for concern at this point. Do you experience any dizziness or frequent headaches?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness or headaches. Not really. Sometimes I get a bit of a stiff neck after a long day at work, but that's probably just from being bent over the tracks. Nothing serious, I assure you. I’m a bit clumsy, always have been, to be honest. My friends used to tease me about it.
DOCTOR: It's good to know. Clumsiness isn't usually a medical concern, and it sounds like your stiff neck is likely related to your work. Now, just to be thorough, I'd like to ask a few questions about your daily habits. How much water do you typically drink each day?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Probably not enough, to be honest. I usually have a couple of bottles of water at work, and a glass or two with dinner. But I don't actively try to drink a lot of water, if that makes sense. I just drink when I'm thirsty. Maybe four or five glasses a day? It varies. I know I should be drinking more, but I just… forget.
DOCTOR: It's very common to not drink enough water, so don't feel bad. Four or five glasses is probably less than ideal. Dehydration can definitely affect concentration and energy levels. And what about your diet overall?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. I like to cook, so I mostly eat home-cooked meals. Lots of vegetables, some lean protein, and whole grains. I do have a sweet tooth, so I indulge in a little chocolate sometimes. And I have to admit, I’m not a big fan of breakfast. I usually just have a cup of coffee in the morning. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a pretty balanced diet overall. The occasional chocolate is perfectly fine! So, putting everything together, you’re a practical, active person with a generally healthy lifestyle, but you tend to get a bit disconnected when things are quiet, especially later in the day. You've experienced some grief in the past, you don't drink a lot of water, and you tend to skip breakfast. It’s possible that a combination of factors is contributing to how you’re feeling. Dehydration, skipping breakfast, and potentially some lingering effects from your loss could all play a role. It’s also important to rule out any underlying medical conditions, just to be safe. I'd like to recommend a few simple changes to see if they make a difference. First, let’s try increasing your water intake to at least eight glasses a day. Second, let’s try eating a healthy breakfast, even if it’s just a piece of fruit and some yogurt. And third, let's look into some gentle mindfulness exercises that don’t require a lot of sitting still. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very reasonable. Eight glasses of water… I can definitely try that. And breakfast… well, I suppose I can manage that too. Maybe some fruit with my coffee. Gentle mindfulness… that sounds better than emptying my mind, definitely. I’m willing to try anything, as long as it doesn’t involve too much… woo-woo.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No woo-woo, I promise. I’m going to give you a handout with some simple mindfulness techniques that you can try. It includes things like paying attention to your breath while you’re walking, and focusing on your senses during everyday activities. I also want you to keep a daily log of your water intake and breakfast habits, just so we can track your progress. And, I'd like to see you back in four weeks to see how you're doing. If you don't notice any improvement after a few weeks, or if your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Four weeks sounds good. I appreciate you listening to me, Dr. Kamahele. It’s helpful to just talk it through, and you’ve given me some practical things to try. I’ll definitely keep the log, and I'll read the handout.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Liza. I'm glad I could help. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I'll see you in four weeks.
