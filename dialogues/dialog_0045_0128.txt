DOCTOR: Alright, Lilliana, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Billman, is it? Yes, yes. It's my joints, mostly. They get...stuck, in the mornings. Like an old door, you know? Hard to move. It’s been going on…well, a long time, I think. Not terrible, just…annoying.
DOCTOR: Annoying is a good way to put it. A long time… can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. That’s… hard. Years, definitely. Maybe five? Or longer? It’s hard to remember exactly when it started. It just… slowly got worse. Not all at once, you understand. My husband… he always helped me in the mornings. Now… well. It’s just me.
DOCTOR: Right. So, five years or longer… and it's a gradual onset. And your husband isn’t able to help as much anymore. Okay. Now, when you say “stuck”, where exactly are you feeling this?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, almost. My hands, mostly. Makes it hard to… button things, you know? And my knees… getting up from the chair is… a process. Sometimes my back too, but that could just be from bending over with the little ones. It’s not… sharp pain, never that. Just… stiff. And slow. Really slow.
DOCTOR: Alright, hands, knees, sometimes your back. No sharp pain, just stiffness and slowness. And you mentioned little ones... are you currently caring for children?
PATIENT: Oh yes! I watch the neighbor’s children. Two of them. A boy and a girl. Sweethearts, they are. Keeps me busy, which is good. Though, picking them up is… harder now. I used to be able to just… scoop them up. Now, I have to sort of… bend and lift, carefully. It's not a problem yet, but I worry it will be.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you're lifting children, which is contributing to the strain. And you’re anticipating it becoming more difficult. Before we move on, let's talk about other things going on with your body. Have you noticed any swelling in your joints, alongside the stiffness?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t really looked for swelling, to be honest. I just feel the stiffness. Sometimes my hands feel a bit… thicker, maybe? But I always thought that was just… normal. I’m not very good at noticing those things. I just know when things are hard to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, sometimes it’s hard to notice things yourself. Okay. Have you experienced any fever, fatigue, or any skin rashes lately?
PATIENT: Fever… no. Not that I know of. I haven't felt hot, if that's what you mean. Fatigue… well, I am getting older, Doctor! I get tired, of course. But that's just…life, isn't it? Skin rashes… no, nothing like that. I lotion up every day, so my skin is usually pretty smooth.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like arthritis or lupus?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a lot of big words. Arthritis… lupus… I don't think so. I’ve been to doctors before, of course, but they never told me anything like that. Mostly just for colds, you know? Or the flu. My husband, he took care of all the…paperwork. He was very good at that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… oh! I broke my wrist once, when I was young. Fell off a bicycle. But that was a long, long time ago. They fixed it up, and it healed fine. Nothing else that I can remember, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history. Are there any relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had arthritis, or any other joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family… hmm. My mother, she had trouble with her hands, I think. She used to complain about them aching. But she also did a lot of knitting, so I always thought it was just from that. And my grandmother… she was very old. Everything hurt when you get old, right? I don't really remember specifically about any… joint problems. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking anything, even over-the-counter, like pain relievers or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just… a little something for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me a few years ago. A small white pill. And sometimes, if my hands are really bothering me, I take some ibuprofen. But not very often. Just when I need it. And sometimes a multivitamin, you know, to keep healthy. That's it, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No, I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Not that I remember, anyway. I’m pretty lucky, I think. I eat anything, wear anything… never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s take a look at your joints. If you don’t mind. I’m going to gently examine your hands, knees, and back to get a better feel for what's going on. Please let me know if anything is painful.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. Gently, though, please. My hands are a bit sensitive, you know. And my knees… well, they’ve seen better days. But I’ll tell you if anything hurts. Don't worry.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just relax your hand for me. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a bit… tender there. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. It’s been like that for a while. Especially when I button things, or open jars. It's a bit… stiff. And that part there… It feels… bumpy. Not big, but… not smooth.
DOCTOR: Alright. I feel some tenderness at the base of your thumb, consistent with possible basal joint arthritis. And there is some mild prominence on the radial side of your wrist. Now, let’s move onto your knees. Could you please sit on the examination table and extend your legs?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. There we go. A little creaky getting up, you know. My knees aren’t what they used to be. Be careful, Doctor. They’re a bit… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax your legs for me. Any pain with this movement?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, a little there. Not awful, but… uncomfortable. It feels… tight. And it pops a bit when I bend it. It’s been worse lately. I think. It’s hard to remember exactly. But bending down… it’s getting harder.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s quickly check your back. Could you please bend forward and touch your toes if you can?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Oh, that’s… not very good. My back… it’s stiff. It doesn't bend very easily. And it aches a little when I do that. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. It's always been a bit… creaky.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your history and this exam, it seems you're experiencing osteoarthritis in multiple joints – your hands, knees, and likely some involvement in your lower back. The stiffness, the limited range of motion, and the tenderness are all consistent with this diagnosis. The popping sensation in your knees is also typical. However, to rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood work and X-rays of your hands and knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood work and X-rays… that sounds…serious. Is it… bad? I just thought it was…old age, you know? I don’t want a lot of poking and prodding if I can help it. And… I don’t have a lot of money. Will that be expensive?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad,” Lilliana. It’s a common condition, especially as we get older. It’s good we’re looking into it to understand exactly what’s going on, and to manage your symptoms effectively. The blood work is mostly to rule out other causes, like rheumatoid arthritis, which is a different condition. And the X-rays will help us see the extent of the wear and tear in your joints. As for the cost… I understand your concerns. Let me see what the lab and imaging center charges are. We can also discuss potential options for financial assistance if needed. It’s important to get this checked out, and we'll do what we can to make it affordable. Would you like me to go ahead and order those tests, and then we can talk about the costs and payment options?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Yes, I suppose so. If it will help me understand what’s going on. And if you think it’s important. But please, no surprises. And I really don’t want a lot of poking and prodding. Go ahead, Doctor. Order the tests. And tell me about the cost afterwards, please. Before you do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m ordering a complete blood count, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a rheumatoid factor test to rule out other conditions. And I'm ordering X-rays of both hands and both knees, standard views. Let me just pull up the estimated costs for you… Okay, so the blood work is approximately $150. The X-rays will be around $300, potentially more depending on the imaging center. So, a total of approximately $450. I know that’s not ideal. We can explore options like a payment plan with the lab and imaging center, or see if there are any local programs that can assist with the costs. I will also have my staff research any potential financial assistance options for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. $450… that’s… a lot of money. I don’t know if I can afford that. My husband… he always took care of the finances. I never really knew how much things cost. A payment plan… maybe. I don’t know. I would have to think about it. And your staff researching assistance… that would be wonderful, Doctor. Truly wonderful. Is there… anything else I need to do? Before you order everything?
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilliana. Don't worry too much right now. We'll figure something out. And I understand it's overwhelming. Let’s hold off on ordering the tests for just a moment. Before we proceed, I want to make sure you're aware that without these tests, we can only manage your symptoms based on what we've discussed. That means recommending things like over-the-counter pain relievers, gentle exercise, and possibly physical therapy. However, the tests will give us a more definitive diagnosis and allow us to explore other treatment options if necessary. Do you feel comfortable proceeding with the tests, even with the potential cost, knowing that we'll explore every possible financial assistance option?
PATIENT: Oh… I… I don’t want to be a bother. And I don’t want to spend a lot of money if I don’t have to. But… I want to know what’s wrong. And I want to feel better. Yes, Doctor. Go ahead and order the tests. But please, please do everything you can to help me with the cost. I really appreciate it. And… tell me exactly what I need to do. Where do I go? And when? I don’t want to get confused.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve sent the orders to City General Lab and Imaging Center. They’re located at 123 Main Street, just a few blocks from here. My staff will print out a referral slip for you with all the details, including the address and phone number. They’ll also schedule the appointments for you, if you'd like. The lab work doesn’t require a fasting state, so you can eat and drink normally before your appointment. The X-rays shouldn’t take long, maybe 30 minutes. After the tests are completed, the results will be sent to my office. I’ll then schedule a follow-up appointment with you to discuss them and create a treatment plan. My staff will also research financial assistance options and payment plans for you. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a lot of information. 123 Main Street… yes. I think I know where that is. And they'll schedule the appointments for me? That’s good. I don't want to have to worry about that. Um… yes. One question. Will the X-rays… will they hurt? I don’t like being poked and prodded. And… is there anything I need to wear? Special clothes or anything?
DOCTOR: No, the X-rays won’t hurt at all. It’s a very quick and painless procedure. You’ll simply stand or lie on a table while a machine takes images of your joints. It’s similar to getting a regular photograph. As for what to wear… comfortable clothing is best. You don’t need to change into anything special. Avoid wearing any jewelry or metal objects that could interfere with the images, but otherwise, just wear whatever you feel comfortable in. The technician will ask you to remove any metal items before the procedure. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Comfortable clothes… no jewelry… yes. That’s good to know. And my staff will help me with the appointments and the financial assistance. Thank you, Doctor Billman. You’ve been very helpful. And patient. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: Alright. My staff will be in touch shortly to schedule your appointments and discuss the financial assistance options. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that aggravate your joint pain and consider taking over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. We’ll figure this out together, Lilliana. If you have any questions before your appointment, don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. Goodbye.
