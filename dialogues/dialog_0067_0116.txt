DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Pfennig, was it? Yes, lovely to meet you as well. Hmm... what brings me in... well, it’s my legs, dear. They just… ache. Mostly at night, you see. It wakes me up sometimes. A right nuisance, it is. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s been a while now, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Yes, Pfennig is correct. And I understand – leg aches that wake you up at night can be very disruptive. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Could you describe the ache a little more for me?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not a sharp pain, you understand. More… a tightening. Like a band squeezing, perhaps? It’s mostly in my calves, I think. Both legs, usually. And it just… holds for a bit. Then eases off. It’s hard to explain, really. I just know it’s uncomfortable enough to pull me from my sleep. It doesn’t happen every night, mind you. Just… often enough to bother me. Do you… understand what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. A tightening, like a band squeezing, mostly in your calves, and it wakes you up sometimes. That gives me a good starting point. Now, do you notice anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Worse? Not really that I’ve noticed. Maybe if I’ve been on my feet a lot during the day. But I do a lot of sitting, mostly. I used to be a proofreader, you see. Lots of reading and marking papers. Now… well, I don’t do much of anything these days, truth be told. Better? Hmm… stretching, maybe? I try to wiggle my toes and point my feet before I get out of bed, but I can't say for certain if that does anything. It just feels… sensible. Does that make sense? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. So, it doesn't seem to be triggered by anything specific, and stretching might help a little. And it's perfectly normal for memory to change over time. Now, I’m going to ask some more general questions, if that’s alright. Have you had any injuries to your legs recently – any falls, bumps, or twists?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no injuries, dear. Not recently, and not for a long, long time. I haven't fallen, thankfully. I used to be very careful, even as a girl. My mother always said, “Slow and steady wins the race,” you see. I’ve always been a bit… cautious, I suppose. I mostly stay inside these days, so there’s not much opportunity for bumping into things, either. Though, I did trip over the rug last month… but that didn’t hurt my legs, just my pride, ha! Nothing serious, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No recent injuries, just a little stumble. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me see… Sometimes, I think my ankles look a little… puffy? But I wear slippers most of the time, so it’s hard to tell, really. And I don’t pay much attention to my feet, to be honest. I suppose I could look, but I don’t want to bother you, dear. I’m sure you have more important things to attend to. Is it… important to check for swelling?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to check, Ms. Bilstein, so don’t worry about bothering me at all. It can give us some clues. If you wouldn’t mind, could you take off your slippers for a moment so I can take a look?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. No trouble at all. There you are. Don't mind the socks, they're very old. I make a lot of warm things when I'm bored. I suppose my ankles do look a little… rounder than they used to. But I always did have a bit of an ankle, you see. My husband used to say so.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Bilstein. I do see a little bit of swelling, what we call edema, in both ankles. It’s mild, but it’s good to note. Now, I’m going to ask about some other things, just to get a complete picture. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a lot to remember, dear. My husband always handled all the doctor's things. I… I think I had my blood pressure checked once, a long time ago. The doctor said it was a little high, maybe? But I don't recall taking any medicine for it. And… no, no diabetes, as far as I know. I always liked a sweet treat, but I wasn't ever told I had anything wrong. As for heart problems… well, I get a little breathless sometimes when I climb the stairs, but I’m 84, dear! I suppose that’s to be expected. I mostly just… try to take things easy. Is that helpful? I'm afraid I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Bilstein. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember everything. A little breathlessness with stairs at your age is common. Do you take any medications at all, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just this. Calcium. The doctor recommended them a while back, for my bones, you see. I try to take one every day, but sometimes I forget. And… that’s it, I think. Nothing else. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can help it. Too many side effects, I always thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, just calcium tablets, sometimes. And no allergies to any medications that you know of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I'm aware of. I used to love gardening, you see, and I never had any trouble with bee stings or poison ivy, so I assume I'm alright with most things. Though, my skin is a little sensitive, so I have to be careful with the sun. But that's not an allergy, is it? Just… carefulness. I’m afraid I’m not very good at medical terms, dear. I just want to get to the bottom of these aching legs, if we can.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not an allergy. You’re doing very well, Ms. Bilstein. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or children – who have had problems with blood clots, varicose veins, or swelling in their legs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. My family… it was a long time ago. My mother… she had weak ankles, I think. Always complained about them. And my grandmother… she had some kind of swelling, I remember that much. But I don’t recall what it was, or if it was in her legs. My brother… he was very healthy, always running around. As for my children… they live far away, and we don’t talk much anymore. I’m afraid I don’t know much about their medical history, if I’m honest. It's been a long time, and we don’t share much these days. Is that helpful, dear? I’m trying my best, but my memory… well, you know.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Bilstein. Knowing about your mother’s weak ankles and your grandmother’s swelling is good information. Finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked, a little, but I always made him go outside. I couldn't abide the smell, and I always thought it was a dreadful habit. I always preferred a good cup of tea, myself. And a nice biscuit, of course. It's a much healthier pastime, wouldn't you agree? Though, perhaps too many biscuits aren't good for you either...
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right – a good cup of tea is much healthier! Now, do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not really. A little sip of sherry on Christmas, maybe, but that's it. My husband liked a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I never cared for it. Made me feel a little dizzy, you see. I prefer a nice glass of water, or that cup of tea. Much better for you, I always thought. I'm not a woman for strong drinks, dear. Never have been.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein. Thank you for answering all of my questions. I appreciate you taking the time. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your legs a little more closely. It won’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that's perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I suppose you need to listen to my heart and lungs, do you? That’s sensible. Do what you need to do, dear. I trust your judgment. I hope I’m not too much trouble. I’m just glad someone is finally taking a look at these aching legs. Go ahead, dear.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein. Everything sounds and feels reasonably okay. Your heart and lungs are clear, and your pulses are present, although a little weak. Your ankles are a little stiff, and your calves are tender to the touch. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of peripheral artery disease, or PAD, combined with some venous insufficiency, meaning the valves in your veins aren’t working as well as they should. The tenderness and mild swelling suggest some inflammation as well. The weakness in your pulses could be due to the PAD, reducing blood flow to your legs. The aching is likely a combination of all three. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. PAD and… venous insufficiency? Those are… big words, dear. I don't think I've ever heard of those before. Reducing blood flow… that sounds frightening. Does that mean… something is wrong with my legs? And inflammation? Is that serious? I’m afraid I’m not a very medical person, dear. Could you… explain that a little more simply? And what does that mean for me? What can we do about it? I hope it’s not something dreadful. I just want to be able to sleep through the night again.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask for a simpler explanation, Ms. Bilstein, and you are right to be concerned. It’s perfectly normal to feel frightened when you hear medical terms you don’t understand. Think of your legs as having two main types of pipes. Arteries are the pipes that carry blood from your heart to your legs, bringing oxygen and nutrients. Veins are the pipes that carry blood back to your heart. Peripheral artery disease, or PAD, means that the arteries in your legs are becoming narrowed, like a pipe getting clogged. This reduces the amount of blood flow to your legs, causing pain, especially when you’re active. Venous insufficiency means that the valves inside your veins aren’t working properly, making it harder for blood to flow back to your heart. This can cause swelling and aching. The good news is that, in your case, it doesn't sound like it's very severe. It’s likely contributing to your aching and swelling, but it doesn't seem to be immediately dangerous. We can manage these conditions with a few different things. The most important thing is to improve your circulation. I recommend daily walking, if you’re able, even if it’s just for a short distance. This helps to open up those arteries and improve blood flow. I also recommend elevating your legs when you’re resting, which helps to reduce the swelling. And compression socks can help to support your veins and improve circulation as well. We can also talk about pain management if the aching is bothersome. And I want to monitor your circulation to make sure it doesn't worsen. Would you be open to me ordering some blood tests to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels?
PATIENT: Oh, that… makes a little more sense, dear. Pipes getting clogged… I can understand that. Walking, elevating my legs… those sound sensible. I used to enjoy a good walk when I was younger. And compression socks… those don’t sound too dreadful. Blood tests… Well, if you think it’s necessary. I don’t particularly like needles, but I trust your judgment. If it helps to understand what’s going on, then yes, alright. Go ahead and order those blood tests, dear. And… tell me, is there anything else I should be doing? Anything I should avoid? I just want to feel better, and be able to sleep through the night again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Bilstein, that is not too much to ask at all. Getting a good night’s sleep is very important. Besides walking, elevating your legs, and compression socks, there are a few other things you can do. Avoid sitting for long periods of time – get up and move around every hour or so. Avoid smoking, if you haven't already. Manage your weight – even losing a few pounds can help. And keep your feet warm – cold feet can worsen circulation. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever that you can take as needed. And I want to schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to check your progress and review your blood test results. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds very sensible, dear. No smoking, moving around, keeping warm… I can manage all of that. And a mild pain reliever… that sounds good. Three months… alright, that gives me time to try everything. Let me see… You said something about cholesterol? Is that… bad? And blood sugar… is that for diabetes? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. And… are there any exercises I should be doing? For my legs, you understand. Something gentle, of course. I don’t want to overdo it. I just want to get these legs working again.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask those questions, Ms. Bilstein. It's important to understand what we're looking for. Cholesterol is a type of fat in your blood. High cholesterol can contribute to the narrowing of your arteries, worsening PAD. That's why we want to check your levels. Blood sugar is the amount of sugar in your blood. High blood sugar can be a sign of diabetes, which can also damage your arteries and nerves. As for exercises, yes, gentle exercises can be very helpful. Ankle pumps – pointing your toes up and down – can help to improve circulation. Calf raises – standing up on your toes – can strengthen your calf muscles. And walking is always a good choice. Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration as you feel comfortable. I'm going to give you a handout with some information about PAD and some gentle exercises you can try. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, dear. A handout with exercises… that sounds perfect. I always appreciate something I can refer back to. Hmm… I don’t think so, right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you, Doctor Pfennig. I feel much better knowing what’s going on, and what I can do about it. Hopefully, these legs will be feeling better in a few months. And… thank you again, for taking the time to listen to an old woman like me. It means a lot. Is there anything you need from me before I go? Perhaps a co-pay or something?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. It was my pleasure to meet you and help in any way I could. And please, don’t ever feel like you’re just “an old woman.” Your health and well-being are very important to me. Yes, the co-pay for today’s visit is $30. And I’ll have the nurse draw your blood before you leave. She’ll give you instructions on when and where to get those results. Here's that handout with information about PAD and exercises. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care of yourself, Ms. Bilstein. And I look forward to seeing you in three months.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, $30 it is. Thank you, dear. And thank you again, for everything. I will call if I have any questions. And… I will try my best to do those exercises. You have a good day now, Doctor Pfennig. And thank you again, from the bottom of my heart.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. You have a good day as well. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
