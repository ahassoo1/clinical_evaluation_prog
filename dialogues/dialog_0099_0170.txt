DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney, good to see you. Forty-nine years old, eh?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Forty-nine. Look, doc, if we could just get this done… I got things I need to be getting back to.
DOCTOR: “Getting it done,” as you put it, requires a bit of information from you, I'm afraid. It’s not exactly a drive-through, you know. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, right. Sorry. It’s… life insurance. They need me to do a medical exam for the paperwork, that’s all. Just trying to get everything sorted out. It’s a bit of a hassle, honestly.
DOCTOR: Life insurance physicals. Yes, they always are. Still, it’s important to be thorough. So, let’s start with the basics. Have you been feeling generally healthy lately?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t, right? Work keeps me pretty busy. Nothing really wrong, if that makes sense. No aches, no pains, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: “Mostly” is… not a diagnosis, Mr. Putney. But I appreciate you saying you haven’t had any significant aches or pains. Let's try to be a bit more specific. When you say “tired,” can you describe that?
PATIENT: Just… run down, I guess. Like I don't have the energy I used to. Especially in the afternoons. I work at the hotel, you know? Long days on my feet. It just gets to me sometimes. I usually just try to push through it.
DOCTOR: Hotel work. Demanding. And "pushing through it" is admirable, but not necessarily healthy. Now, has this fatigue been a recent development, or has it been ongoing for some time?
PATIENT: Hmm… probably the last six months or so, maybe a little longer. It’s hard to say exactly. Things have been… hectic, with the divorce and everything. It could just be stress, honestly. I don't know.
DOCTOR: Divorce is certainly stressful. We’ll factor that in. Six months of fatigue… alright. And has this fatigue been interfering with your daily life – your work, your hobbies, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, yeah, a little. Like I said, work is tough when you're dragging. And I used to do a bit of fishing, but I haven't really felt up to it lately. Just… haven’t had the motivation. Not a big deal, really.
DOCTOR: “Not a big deal” is relative, Mr. Putney. Loss of interest in hobbies can be significant. Now, let’s move on. Any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight… maybe a couple pounds, but nothing drastic. I haven’t been eating much different, to be honest. Sometimes I skip meals when things get busy at the hotel. Nothing intentional, just… happens. Appetite’s been okay, I guess.
DOCTOR: Skipping meals isn’t ideal. Now, have you noticed any problems with your sleep?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. I have trouble falling asleep sometimes. Just… my mind races. And then I wake up a few times during the night. It’s not every night, but it happens often enough to be annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. Insomnia. We'll need to explore that further. Do you snore loudly, or has anyone ever told you that you stop breathing during sleep?
PATIENT: My ex-wife complained about my snoring. A lot. But I don’t know about stopping breathing. I don't think so. I mean, I wake up feeling tired, but… I just figured that was from not sleeping well. Never really paid attention to the breathing part.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll make a note of the snoring. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I get a little winded sometimes when I’m running around at work, but that's just from being out of shape, I think. Nothing serious. Never had any chest pain or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, have you had any recent changes in bowel habits or bladder function?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Everything’s pretty normal down there, if you don’t mind me saying. Look, doc, is this all necessary for a life insurance exam? It feels like a full check-up. I just need a signature, that's it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, a thorough examination is always necessary, regardless of the reason. Life insurance companies want to assess risk. And I need to have a complete picture of your health before signing off on anything. It's a matter of professional responsibility. Now, any history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Okay, okay, you're right. Sorry. I just… I got a lot on my plate. No, no diabetes. My blood pressure was a little high at the dentist last year, but they said it was probably just nerves. And I don't know about cholesterol, never had it checked. I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Elevated blood pressure, even if situational, is worth noting. We'll order a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel to get a baseline. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I don't really take much medication. Maybe some ibuprofen for headaches sometimes. That's about it. Never had a reaction to anything, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen only. Now, let's talk about past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than minor injuries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, I guess. And I broke my arm once playing football. But nothing serious as an adult. Never been in the hospital for anything long-term or anything like that. Just the usual bumps and bruises.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy and a broken arm. Noted. Any significant past surgeries besides the appendectomy?
PATIENT: No, sir. That's it. Look, can we wrap this up soon? I really need to get back to work. The hotel’s short-staffed, and… well, it’s a mess. I appreciate you taking the time, but… this is a lot.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I understand your frustration, but I assure you, this is important. We’re almost finished with the history portion. Now, family history. Do either of your parents have any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: My dad… he had heart problems. He had a heart attack when he was in his sixties. And my mom, she had… I think it was cancer. Lung cancer. But she smoked for like fifty years, so… it’s not surprising, I guess. Both of ‘em are gone now. That was a while ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of heart disease and lung cancer in your family. Noted. Now, social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never been much of a smoker or drinker. And definitely no drugs. I don’t need any of that. I get enough stress at work as it is. I just want to get this exam done and get back to my life, honestly. This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Putney. It seems we've covered the essential history. Now, let’s proceed with a physical examination. We’ll start with your vital signs, then listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. It'll only take a few minutes. Please have a seat and relax.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, okay? I got people waiting.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated: 142 over 90. I'll need to monitor that. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Nothing alarming, but it warrants further investigation. Now, lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another one… Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles. Alright. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal and symmetric. Now, I'm going to need to examine your throat… open wide and say "ah."
PATIENT: There. Happy? Can we get this over with? My throat’s fine. Nothing wrong with it.
DOCTOR: Throat appears normal, no obvious signs of infection. Now, one last thing. I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Relax your stomach muscles for me. Abdomen is soft, but there's some tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Nothing acute, but it's something to keep an eye on. Alright, Mr. Putney. That completes the physical examination. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a liver function test. I also want to repeat your blood pressure measurement in a week. Based on the results, we may need to consider further investigation. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A liver function test? What for? I haven’t been drinking or anything. And what about the tenderness in my stomach? Is something wrong? Look, doc, I just need this life insurance, okay? I don’t want a whole bunch of tests and appointments. What’s the earliest I can expect to get this signed off on?
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I understand your concerns, but I assure you, these tests are necessary to assess your overall health and determine your risk. The tenderness in your abdomen could be due to a variety of factors, and the liver function test will help rule out any underlying liver problems. Regarding the timeline, I can’t give you a definitive answer until the blood work results are back. It typically takes a few days to receive the results. Once I have them, I will review them and let you know if any further investigation is needed. I will be frank with you. Your blood pressure is elevated, and the murmur I detected is concerning. We need to rule out any underlying heart condition before I can sign off on this life insurance application. It is a matter of professional responsibility, and frankly, your well-being. I understand you are impatient, but I will not compromise my integrity simply to expedite the process. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Okay, fine. Do what you gotta do. But look, if it turns out to be nothing serious, I expect you to move quickly, okay? I don't want to be jumping through hoops for months over a little bit of stress. And can you at least tell me what I can do in the meantime? Should I be resting? Changing my diet? What?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. I understand your frustration. In the meantime, I recommend the following: First, reduce your stress levels. I know it's easier said than done, but try to find healthy coping mechanisms, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones. Second, adopt a heart-healthy diet. Limit your intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium. Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Third, engage in regular physical activity. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Finally, monitor your blood pressure at home. I will provide you with instructions on how to do so. I'm also going to prescribe a low-dose medication to help manage your blood pressure. It's not a long-term solution, but it will help stabilize it while we await the blood work results. I will call you as soon as the results are back. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Medication already? Seriously? Look, I appreciate you trying to help, but I really don't like the idea of being on pills. I'll try the diet and exercise thing, okay? I'll monitor my blood pressure like you said. But I’m not so sure about the medication. And... what about the tenderness in my stomach? Is that something I should worry about right now? Should I see another doctor?
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I understand your reluctance to start medication, and I respect your decision. However, given your elevated blood pressure and the murmur I detected, it's prudent to take a proactive approach. The medication is a temporary measure to stabilize your condition while we investigate the underlying cause. You can always discontinue it once we have the blood work results and determine the appropriate course of treatment. Regarding the tenderness in your abdomen, it's unlikely to be anything serious at this time. However, if it worsens or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, or fever, seek immediate medical attention. I will provide you with a referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation of the murmur. It's best to get a professional opinion from a specialist. I will also provide you with written instructions on how to monitor your blood pressure and what symptoms to watch out for. Mr. Putney, I understand you are frustrated and impatient. However, your health is my top priority. I will do everything I can to provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… great. More doctors, more appointments. Look, I guess I don’t have much choice. I’ll do what you said. I'll monitor my blood pressure, I'll try the diet and exercise, and I’ll consider the cardiologist. But please, doc… just keep me updated. I don't want to be waiting around for weeks to hear back. The sooner this is sorted, the better. I think that’s all. Thank you… I guess.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Putney. I will keep you updated on the blood work results as soon as they are available. I have also scheduled a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the results and determine the next course of action. My staff will contact you to confirm the appointment time. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any concerning symptoms or have any questions in the meantime. I wish you the best of health. Have a good day, Mr. Putney.
