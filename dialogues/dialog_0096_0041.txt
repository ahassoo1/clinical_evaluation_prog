DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor. Well, it's this... weakness. It's been getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but little by little. It makes things… difficult. Mostly with my legs, I think.
DOCTOR: Hmm, weakness, you say. And it's mainly in your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's right. Legs mostly, but sometimes feels like my arms too, a little. Not as bad, though. It's hard to explain… like they just don't want to go when I tell them to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. I suppose… maybe five years now? It started very slowly, so I didn't pay it much mind at first. Just thought I was getting old, you know? But it hasn’t stopped, so I figured I should come see someone.
DOCTOR: Five years... that is a while. And it's gradually worsened, not come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Yes, that's exactly right, Doctor. Very, very slowly. Like a tide coming in. You don't notice it at first, then one day you look and… well, the water is much higher than it was. That’s how this feels.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gradual onset. And is this weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… it comes and goes, I think. Some days are better than others. But the bad days are happening more often now. And even on the good days, it's always there, you know? Just… quieter. Hard to describe. It’s never truly gone.
DOCTOR: So, it fluctuates, but with an overall worsening trend. And when you say "quieter," does that mean it's less intense, or do you still experience some weakness even on your better days?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s a good way to put it. Less intense, definitely. Like… a dull ache, or a heaviness. I can still walk, still do things, but I have to think about it more. I don't just do it, if that makes sense. And sometimes, I worry I'll just… stumble.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this weakness been affecting any specific activities?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. Walking is harder, like I said. And getting up from a chair takes effort. I used to enjoy gardening, but I can’t bend and kneel like I used to. I try to help my wife with things around the house, but I have to be careful. I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: I see. So gardening, household chores… activities requiring bending, kneeling, getting up and down. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Sometimes my vision gets blurry. Not all the time, but it happens. And I get tired easier, much easier. I used to be able to work all day, but now I need a nap in the afternoon. And… I get numb sometimes. Mostly in my feet.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, fatigue, numbness in the feet… Alright. And is the numbness constant, or does it come and go like the weakness?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Like little pins and needles. Sometimes it's just my toes, sometimes it's all the way up to my ankles. It doesn't hurt, exactly, just… unpleasant. It’s usually worse when I've been on my feet for a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent falls, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A couple of times. Nothing serious, thankfully. I caught myself each time. But it scared my wife. Once I was just walking in the house, and my legs just… gave way a little. And another time it was in the garden, trying to reach a bush. Just a little stumble, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Astore. We’ve covered a lot. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on some medicine, and it's been alright since then. Other than that… not much. I've always been a fairly healthy man, even if I am getting old now. My wife handles most of the doctor visits, to be honest. I don't like to bother them if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so managed hypertension. Do you know what medication you're taking for that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s a good question, Doctor. I’ll have to ask my wife. She keeps track of all that. I just take the little pills every morning. I think it’s… a small white one? She brings it to me. I really don’t pay much attention to the names, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get that sorted. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And I was in the hospital for a few days once with a bad bout of pneumonia, maybe twenty years ago? That's about it, I think. Nothing major in recent years.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy, pneumonia… And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm...my mother, she had arthritis, bad in her hands. My father, he was a strong man, lived a long life, but he had some trouble with his heart towards the end. And my brother, he… well, he had some problems with his nerves, I think. He had trouble walking sometimes, and his hands would shake. I don't know much about it, though. We didn’t see each other much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Arthritis in your mother, heart problems in your father, and some neurological issues in your brother. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink much alcohol. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. And no, nothing else, I promise you. I like to keep things simple.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. My wife gives me all sorts of things, and I’ve never had a reaction. I think I would remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical examination. I’ll check your reflexes, your strength, and your sensation. Then we can discuss some possible causes and what we can do about it. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything is going to be… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. 148 over 85. A little elevated, but not surprising given what you’ve told me. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Please relax your leg. Reflexes are diminished, bilaterally. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, I can, Doctor. Is that alright? I try to squeeze as hard as I can, but it’s not as strong as it used to be. It takes more effort, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine. I can feel that it's weaker on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your muscle strength. I want you to push against my hand, and resist me as I try to push your arm down. Please try your best. Alright, and now your legs. I want you to try and lift your legs, and resist me as I push them down. Now, I'm going to check your sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can feel that. But my feet… it’s not as strong. Like… pins and needles, maybe? I can feel it, but it’s not as clear as it should be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, I’m going to check your balance. Please stand up slowly, and try to stand still for a few moments. Okay, you can sit down now. Alright, Mr. Astore. That’s all for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, it seems like you have some weakness and numbness in your legs and feet, with diminished reflexes and sensation. Your balance is also a little off. There are a number of possible causes for this, including neuropathy, which is damage to the nerves. It could also be due to problems with your circulation, or even something affecting your brain.
PATIENT: Oh dear… That sounds… serious, Doctor. What do you think is the most likely cause? And what can we do about it? I don’t want to end up in a wheelchair, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively what the cause is, Mr. Astore. We need to do some further testing. I'd like to order some blood work to check for things like diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and inflammation. I also want to get an MRI of your brain and spine to rule out any structural problems. And I'd like a nerve conduction study to assess the function of your nerves. As for avoiding a wheelchair...that’s a valid concern. The goal of these tests is to figure out the cause so we can start treatment as soon as possible. Depending on the cause, treatment options could include medication, physical therapy, or other interventions. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. That’s a lot of tests, Doctor. MRI… is that one of those machines that’s very loud? And what does a nerve conduction study involve? I don't like needles much, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, the MRI machine is quite loud, but we can provide you with earplugs or headphones to help with that. It's also a closed space, so if you’re at all claustrophobic, we can discuss options to make you more comfortable, perhaps even a mild sedative. As for the nerve conduction study, it does involve small electrodes being placed on your skin. There is a very brief, mild electrical stimulation, but it shouldn't be painful—more like a tingling sensation. It helps us measure how well the nerves are conducting signals. It's a quick procedure, and a very valuable diagnostic tool. I'll have my nurse explain the procedures in more detail and answer any further questions you have. For now, are you comfortable with me ordering these tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary, then please go ahead. I trust your judgment. I just… hope it’s not anything too serious. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better now, knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astore. I understand your concerns, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. My nurse, Leilani, will come in shortly to schedule those tests and go over the preparation instructions. In the meantime, I'm going to write up a referral to a neurologist – a specialist in nerve disorders – for their opinion once we have the test results. We’ll take it one step at a time. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you again for your time and patience. I appreciate you listening to me. I’ll wait for Leilani, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. I'm glad I could help. Leilani will be with you shortly. Please don't hesitate to ask her if you have any further questions. Take care, and we’ll see you soon.
