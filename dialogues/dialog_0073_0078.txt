DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, to put it simply, I feel…stuck. Like I need a reset, a jumpstart, you know? I’m not sick, exactly, but I just don’t have the energy I used to. I’m hoping you can help me figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: "Stuck," alright. And this lack of energy…how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say precisely. Maybe six months? It came on gradually, I think. I used to be able to do so much – gardening, keeping up with the house, even a little dancing with my husband. Now, everything feels like a chore. I find myself… resting a lot more. It’s just not me, you know?
DOCTOR: Six months…gradual onset. And aside from the fatigue and feeling like things are more difficult, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My sleep isn’t as good as it used to be. I wake up several times a night, even if I don’t feel particularly tired when I go to bed. And… my appetite has been a bit off. Not that I’ve lost a lot of weight, but I just don’t feel hungry as often. I used to enjoy cooking, but now it feels like… another task. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Interrupted sleep and a decreased appetite… alright. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And as I said, I haven't really lost weight, maybe a couple of pounds, but nothing significant. It's more that I just don't want to eat. I haven’t been feeling unwell, just… low energy and not very motivated. Is it possible it’s just…age? I’m 45 now, after all. Perhaps things just slow down.
DOCTOR: Age can contribute, of course. But at 45, this warrants investigation. Let’s go through a bit more detail. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I have Medicare, and they’ve never flagged anything in my yearly check-ups. My husband, Ricardo, keeps telling me I worry too much, but he doesn’t feel this way, you see? He has endless energy! I do take a multivitamin, just a standard one, and sometimes I’ll take something for my joints, just when they’re acting up. But that’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Not a one. I've been very lucky, I suppose. A few broken bones when I was a child – a wrist and an arm, I think – but nothing serious that required an operation. Just casts and time to heal. Everything was fine after that. Is this normal, to ask so many questions? I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal, Ms. Pitzel. It's important to get a complete picture. Now, regarding your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had high blood pressure when she got older, and my father had… diabetes, I think? Yes, diabetes, type 2. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had problems with her heart, but she lived to be very old, almost ninety! It’s hard to say what’s inherited and what isn’t, you know? We weren't a family that talked much about health, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and a history of heart problems… that is helpful. And finally, what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I’m married to Ricardo, as I mentioned. He’s retired, so we spend a lot of time at home. We enjoy gardening, when I have the energy, and we like to watch movies. I used to volunteer at the local library, but I haven’t been able to lately, just haven’t felt up to it. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I used to walk more, but… well, everything feels harder now. I don’t have any major stress in my life, not really. I suppose that's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Pitzel, given your symptoms and medical history, there are several possibilities. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency or a mild thyroid issue, but it's important to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and basic metabolic panel. I also think it would be wise to get an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on and hopefully get my energy back. I'm happy to have the tests done. Where do I go to have the blood work and EKG done? And… is there anything I should do in the meantime? Should I be resting more, or trying to push myself? I'm a little confused about what I should be doing.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to write you a lab order and a requisition for the EKG. You can have these tests done at the lab just across the street, at the Suburban Medical Center. They take most insurances, including Medicare. As for what you should do in the meantime… I wouldn’t push yourself too hard. Listen to your body. Gentle activity is fine – a short walk if you feel up to it – but avoid strenuous exercise. Ensure you’re getting enough sleep, and maintain a balanced diet. Don’t make any drastic changes to your diet without discussing it with me first. We'll review the results once they come back, and then we can discuss a more tailored plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much for listening and taking the time to explain everything. I appreciate your thoroughness. I will go to the lab across the street as soon as possible. And I will listen to my body and rest as needed. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any symptoms I should watch out for? Just in case?
DOCTOR: Good question. While we are running these tests, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or significant changes in your heart rate, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Also, if you develop a fever, severe fatigue, or unexplained weight loss, contact my office right away. Otherwise, just focus on getting some rest and try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Here are the lab orders and EKG requisition, and a number to reach my office if you have any questions. Do you have any other concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've covered everything wonderfully, Doctor Korrell. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel much better already, just knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. Have a lovely day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I'm glad I could help. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day as well. .
