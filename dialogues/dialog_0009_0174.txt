DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Honestly, I don’t really like talking about these things, but my daughter insisted. She said I haven’t been myself lately. I think… I think I’m just feeling very sad. A lot of the time, actually. And tired. Very, very tired. I just want to get this over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. It’s perfectly alright to feel uncomfortable talking about these things, and I appreciate you coming in despite that. We'll take things at your pace. It sounds like you've been experiencing both sadness and fatigue. That’s a good place to start. Could you tell me a little more about this sadness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where to begin? It’s not… a specific sadness, you understand? Not like when my husband passed, God rest his soul. It’s just… everything feels… grey. Like looking at the world through a dirty window. I don’t enjoy my hobbies anymore. I used to love gardening, but I haven’t touched my roses in months. Even seeing my grandchildren doesn’t bring me the same joy. It’s been going on for… oh, I don’t know… maybe six months now? Longer, perhaps. It’s difficult to keep track.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is a pervasive feeling, not tied to any one event, and it’s been affecting your daily life for quite some time. That's important information. Six months is a significant duration. And it’s completely normal to lose track of time when you're feeling this way. You mentioned not enjoying your hobbies and a diminished sense of joy even with your grandchildren. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite during this time?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. My sleep is… terrible. I go to bed early, but I wake up several times during the night. Then I can’t get back to sleep. I lie there for hours, just… thinking. And my appetite? It’s practically gone. My daughter keeps trying to get me to eat, bless her heart, but everything tastes like… nothing. I’ve lost weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser. I haven’t bothered to check the scale, though. What difference would it make?
DOCTOR: It makes a difference because changes in sleep and appetite, along with weight loss, can be important indicators of what's going on. It sounds like you're experiencing a number of symptoms that are often associated with each other. Now, let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I had high blood pressure for a time, years ago. The doctor put me on medication, and it seemed to do the trick. I stopped taking it a few years back, after my husband passed. I just… couldn’t be bothered with it, to be honest. Everything felt… overwhelming then. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly since. I had a bad fall skiing a few years ago – broke my wrist – but that’s about it. Nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart problems, as far as I know. My mother lived to be ninety, so I suppose I have good genes. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Nani. It's good to know about the history of high blood pressure, even though you’re currently off medication. It’s also good to know that you haven’t had any major medical issues diagnosed. And yes, family history can be relevant, so thank you for sharing that about your mother. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just the wrist, after the skiing accident. It was a simple procedure, thankfully. They set the bone and put a cast on it. I had physical therapy for a while afterwards. It healed up alright, but it never felt quite the same. I couldn’t ski as confidently after that. Not that I’ve been skiing much lately, anyway. Everything feels like too much effort. I just… I wish I could remember everything clearly. It was a few years ago now. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Nani. It’s common to have some difficulty recalling details from the past. The wrist fracture is good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… My father had… something with his heart, I think. He died quite young, actually. Unexpectedly. My sister, she had a touch of arthritis, I believe. Nothing serious, just aches and pains. And my mother… she was very healthy, as I said. Lived to be ninety. She always said it was the gardening. Fresh air and sunshine, she used to say. I don't know… I'm not sure what else. My family wasn't one for talking about illnesses. It was considered… impolite, perhaps. Honestly, I can't recall. It was a long time ago. Is this important? I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Nani. You've shared what you remember, and that's what's important. It sounds like there might be a history of heart issues in your family, which is good to be aware of. Now, let's talk a little about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked a day in my life. My husband tried it once, years ago, but I wouldn't allow it in the house. As for alcohol… I used to have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I haven't touched it since my husband passed. It just doesn't seem appealing anymore. I find it… sad, somehow. I spend most of my time at home now. Gardening used to be my main hobby, but as I said, I haven’t been doing much of that lately. I mostly just… sit. It’s a quiet life. Very quiet.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nani. That's helpful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. As I said, I stopped taking my blood pressure medication years ago. I don't really believe in taking pills if I can avoid it. My daughter keeps trying to get me to take vitamins, but I always refuse. I just… I don't want to be dependent on anything. It's probably silly, but that's how I feel. I just want to feel like myself again. If I can, that is. Is this taking long? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: No, this isn't taking long at all, Nani, and I appreciate your patience. It's perfectly alright to feel hesitant about taking medications, and I respect your wishes. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me if you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had any allergic reactions. My daughter always asks me the same question, and I always say no. I eat pretty much anything. I've never had any problems with foods or anything like that. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit tired now. All this talking… It’s exhausting. Can we be finished soon? I really need to rest.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. We’re almost finished with the questions. I understand you’re feeling tired. Okay, last question, and it’s an important one. Have you been experiencing any thoughts of harming yourself or feeling like life isn’t worth living?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's… a difficult question. I wouldn’t say I want to harm myself. But sometimes… sometimes I just wish I could go to sleep and not wake up. It’s not a deliberate thought, you understand? It’s just… a feeling. Like a heavy weight. Everything feels so… pointless. I don’t enjoy anything anymore. I just… exist. My daughter worries about me, of course. She says I need help. Maybe she’s right. But… it’s hard to explain. I just feel… empty. Is that alright? I'm probably making a mess of things.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Nani. It takes a great deal of courage to talk about those feelings, and you're not making a mess of things at all. It's perfectly alright to feel that way, and it's very important that you told me. Based on what you've told me – the prolonged sadness, fatigue, loss of appetite and enjoyment, changes in sleep, and the feelings of emptiness – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. It's important to remember that depression is a medical condition, just like any other, and it's very treatable. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… I want to feel better. I want to be myself again. Do whatever you need to do. Quickly, if you wouldn’t mind. I really do need to rest. Thank you for listening. It… it means a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. We’ll take things as quickly as we can. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/85, which isn't surprising given your history. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6. Your heart sounds regular, but there's a slight murmur, which we'll need to investigate further. Your lungs are clear. Your throat is clear, and your ears look normal. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, and your muscle strength is a little weak, but nothing too concerning at this point. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the lower quadrants. Based on the physical exam, there aren't any immediate red flags, but the elevated blood pressure and slightly diminished reflexes and muscle strength warrant further investigation. I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level. I also want to rule out any underlying heart condition, so I'm going to order an electrocardiogram, or ECG. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: More tests? Oh dear. I suppose it’s necessary, if you think so. I just… I’m so tired of tests. But alright, do whatever you need to do. Just… please, can we get it over with quickly? And can I lie down for a little while afterwards? I feel so faint. I appreciate your help, Doctor. Truly. I just want to feel like myself again. Is there anything I need to do? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: I understand your fatigue, Nani, and we'll try to make things as quick and comfortable as possible. The tests will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on, and we can discuss the results as soon as they're available. Yes, after the tests, you can absolutely lie down and rest for as long as you need. My nurse will bring you a blanket and a glass of water. As for what you need to do, I'm going to prescribe a low dose of an antidepressant medication, called sertraline, to start. It can take several weeks to feel the full benefits, but it can help to improve your mood and energy levels. It’s important to take it as prescribed, even if you don't feel an immediate difference. And I also want you to schedule an appointment with a therapist. Talking to someone can be incredibly helpful in processing your feelings and developing coping strategies. Are you comfortable starting sertraline?
PATIENT: Pills… again? I don’t know, Doctor. I really don’t like the idea of taking medication. It feels… artificial. Like I’m not fixing the problem myself. But… I suppose if you think it’s necessary. I trust your judgement. But… what are the side effects? And will it interact with anything? I don’t take anything else, but… I just want to be sure. And… will it make me feel… different? I don’t want to feel worse. I just want to feel like myself again, Doctor. Please, tell me it won’t make things worse.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Nani. It's perfectly natural to be concerned about starting medication, and you're right to ask about the potential side effects. Sertraline is generally well-tolerated, but like all medications, it can have some side effects. The most common ones are nausea, diarrhea, and sleep disturbances, but these usually subside within a few weeks as your body adjusts to the medication. Some people also experience a decrease in libido or weight changes, but these are less common. Regarding interactions, sertraline doesn’t typically interact with many medications, which is good since you aren’t taking anything else currently. And as for making you feel worse, that’s not our intention. Sertraline works by increasing the levels of serotonin in your brain, which can help to improve your mood and energy levels. It's important to remember that it takes time for the medication to work, and you may not feel an immediate difference. But if you do experience any bothersome side effects, please let me know right away, and we can adjust the dosage or explore other options. I want to assure you that we'll work together every step of the way to find the best treatment plan for you. And the therapy will be very important. It will give you tools to cope with these feelings and regain control of your life. Do you think you’re willing to give it a try?
PATIENT: Alright. Alright, I’ll try it. But… just a low dose, please. And if I start feeling… unwell, I want to know I can stop it immediately. And… could you recommend a good therapist? Someone… understanding? I don’t want to feel like I’m burdening them with my problems. Thank you, Doctor. Truly. I appreciate your patience. I just… I want to feel like myself again. I want to enjoy life again. Is there anything else I need to know? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Nani. I’m so glad you’re willing to give it a try. Yes, we’ll start with a low dose, 25 milligrams once daily, and we can adjust it as needed. And absolutely, you can stop the medication at any time if you experience any bothersome side effects. I have a list of recommended therapists in the area. I'll give you the names and contact information of a few who specialize in depression and anxiety. Dr. Anya Sharma is very highly regarded and known for her compassionate approach. And I'll also provide you with a local support group number. As for anything else, it's important to be patient with yourself. It takes time for the medication to work and for therapy to be effective. Try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet, as much as possible. Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs. And most importantly, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to check on your progress. Here is a prescription for the sertraline, and this pamphlet has information about the medication. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. Truly. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate your patience and understanding. It means a lot. I just… I hope it works. I really, really hope it works. Well, I suppose I should be going. I have an appointment later this afternoon. Thank you again, Doctor. And… thank you for listening. That’s all I really needed. .
DOCTOR: Please make sure Nani gets a blanket and a glass of water as she is leaving. And schedule a follow-up appointment for her in two weeks. Let’s make sure she gets the support she needs. .
