DOCTOR: Good morning, Janie. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it's this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on for a while now, honestly. I can’t really say how long. A long while. I just feel… drained, all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, “tiredness… for a while.” That’s a good place to start. When you say “tired,” can you describe what that feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s hard to explain. Not just… sleepy, you know? It’s like… everything is heavy. Moving is hard. Even thinking feels hard sometimes. Like my brain is… slow. It's just… a weight. A big weight. And it doesn't really get better with sleep, which is… frustrating. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. It sounds quite debilitating. So, it's not simply a matter of needing more rest. It's more of a… pervasive feeling of heaviness and difficulty with both physical and mental tasks. And you said this hasn’t improved with increased sleep. Has anything specifically made it worse, or better, that you've noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… worse… not really. It’s pretty consistent, I think. Better… no, not really. I try to keep busy, you know? I used to… I did a lot of gardening, but even that’s hard now. It doesn’t make it worse, but it doesn’t help, if that makes sense. My husband… he used to help, but… well.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's consistently present, regardless of activity. And activity doesn’t exacerbate it, but it also doesn’t alleviate it. I understand. Let's try to get a bit more of a complete picture. Besides the tiredness and heaviness, have you noticed any other changes in how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Changes… oh dear. Let me think. Sometimes I feel a little… shaky. Not all the time, but… occasionally. And my memory’s not what it used to be. I forget things… easily. Small things, mostly. Like… where I put my keys. Or what I was going to say. It’s annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, shakiness and some memory difficulties. When do you notice the shakiness?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… hard to say. Not with anything specific, really. Sometimes just… randomly. Like when I’m sitting and watching TV. Or… I think once when I was at the grocery store. It’s not a big shake, you know? Just… a little tremble. I don’t usually tell anyone, it’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. No need to be embarrassed, Janie. We're just trying to gather information. And that's helpful to know. Now, regarding the memory issues, has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It’s been… creeping up on me. It's not like I suddenly forgot how to do everything. Just… little things. Like names, mostly. Or… appointments. I have to write everything down now, which I never used to do. My husband… he was good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset of memory difficulties, requiring you to rely on notes. We're getting a clearer picture. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat, you know? I don't have a big appetite, never have, but I eat. Weight… maybe a little less? But I haven't been weighing myself regularly. I just… clothes feel a little looser, maybe. It's hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant change in appetite, but potentially some unintentional weight loss. And have you been experiencing any headaches, dizziness, or vision changes?
PATIENT: Headaches… sometimes. Not bad ones, just… dull aches. Mostly in the forehead. Dizziness… not really. Vision… no, I don’t think so. Everything looks… normal. I had my eyes checked last year, everything was fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional dull headaches, no dizziness or vision changes, and a normal eye exam last year. Now, before we move on to your medical history, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I take something for my blood pressure… a little white pill. And… that’s about it, I think. Maybe a pain reliever sometimes, for my back. But not regularly. Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me to.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure, occasional pain reliever, and a vitamin D supplement. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Um… I have it at home, in the bottle. It’s… a small white pill, like I said. I don't really pay attention to the names. My husband always took care of that.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. We can look that up later. And, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, such as food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My husband always said I was lucky.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… The doctor said my blood pressure was high, that’s why I take the pill. And… I had a problem with my gallbladder a few years ago, but they took it out. Other than that… not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension and a past history of gallbladder removal. And, have you ever had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… I had a hysterectomy, a long time ago. When I was younger. And… I think I had my appendix out when I was a child, but I don't really remember it.
DOCTOR: Okay, hysterectomy and appendectomy. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. That’s a hard one. My mother… she had a heart problem, I think. And my father… he had cancer, a long time ago. But it was… different kind of cancer, I think. And my sister… she had diabetes, but she didn’t take care of herself.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh. Well, I used to be very active, like I said. Gardening mostly. But now… I don’t do much. I try to walk a little, but I get tired easily. I live alone, now, since my husband…
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you've experienced a significant change in your routine recently. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. My husband didn’t like smoking, and I always listened to him. And I don’t drink, never have. And definitely not… those other things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, let me just quickly review everything we've discussed. You've been experiencing persistent tiredness and heaviness for an undefined period of time, accompanied by shakiness and memory difficulties. You have a history of hypertension, a past gallbladder removal, a hysterectomy, and an appendectomy. Your family history includes heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. You live alone and do not smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds right. It’s just… everything feels so… vague. I can’t really put my finger on anything specific. It's just… not feeling right.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when things aren't clear. Alright, Janie, I’d like to perform a physical exam now. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a basic neurological assessment. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but that’s not entirely unexpected given your history. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and some basic coordination. Please follow my finger with your eyes. Reflexes are slightly diminished, but symmetrical. Coordination appears intact. Thyroid gland feels normal in size and consistency. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… hard to squeeze very tight. I don't have much strength, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed that. Your grip strength is a bit weaker than expected. Now, I'm going to check your feet for any signs of swelling or numbness. No swelling or numbness noted. Overall, the examination reveals some diminished reflexes and a weaker grip strength. Based on your symptoms and the findings of the physical exam, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. This will include a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a vitamin D level, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… blood tests are fine. Whatever you think is best. I just… I just want to know what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. The lab results should be available in a few days. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results and create a plan of action. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, or severe weakness, please seek immediate medical attention. Would you like me to provide you with a list of local urgent care facilities and emergency rooms?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I… I don’t want to have to worry about finding one if something happens. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. I've also included some general information about managing fatigue, such as staying hydrated and getting regular, gentle exercise. Remember, we're just gathering information at this point. We'll have a better understanding once the lab results come back. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you for listening. It's just… nice to talk to someone. I hope the tests don’t take too long.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janie. I understand it can be unsettling not knowing what’s going on. We'll do our best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. I'll have my nurse schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
