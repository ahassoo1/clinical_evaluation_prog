DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Billman, it’s nice to meet you. My regular doctor… passed on a few months back, bless his soul. And the new folks at the clinic sent me over here for this cholesterol thing. Seems it was a bit high on the tests. I don’t really understand all that medical stuff, to be honest. I just figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Right. “Cholesterol thing.” Yes. Well, it is good you’re getting it checked. A lot of people don't bother until something goes wrong. It's…a buildup, essentially. Like grease in a pipe. And we want to keep those pipes clear, don’t we?
PATIENT: That’s a good way to put it, Doctor. Grease in the pipe. I can understand that. I used to do a bit of plumbing myself, back in the day. Not much these days, though. My hands aren’t what they used to be. So, is it…bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: “Bad” is relative, Mr. Bohnett. Your numbers… weren’t ideal. Not immediately life-threatening, but definitely something we need to address. It's not something that just goes away on its own, you know. We’ll need to look at your history, see what’s going on with your lifestyle. You eat a lot of red meat, do you?
PATIENT: Well, I do enjoy a good steak now and then. Grew up on it, really. My mother made a wonderful roast. But I try not to overdo it. Mostly chicken and fish these days, to be honest. And plenty of vegetables from the garden. I always liked to keep a good garden. Though, my daughter helps with that now…she’s got a green thumb, that one. Is the steak really the problem? I always thought it was the butter. I do like a bit of butter with my potatoes.
DOCTOR: It's not just the steak, Mr. Bohnett. It's the whole picture. But yes, red meat contributes. And butter… well, let's just say it's not doing you any favors. Do you exercise at all?
PATIENT: Exercise… not as much as I used to. Used to be a pretty active fella, always working around the house, in the garden, that sort of thing. But like I said, I’m getting on in years. Knees aren't what they used to be, and I tire easier these days. Mostly just a little walk around the block if the weather’s nice. I used to enjoy a good game of bowling, but… haven’t done that in a while either. It’s just harder to get around, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. So, limited activity. And a fondness for… less-than-ideal foods. Alright. Let's take a look at your vitals, just to get a baseline. And then we'll do a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Just a standard check. Have a seat up there, please.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. I'm happy to get checked out. I always figured staying on top of these things was important, even if I don't always understand what you're talking about. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. Old bones aren't as cooperative as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, lie back. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. I'm just listening to your heart and lungs. Nothing to worry about. Heart sounds… regular. A few crackles in the lower lobes, but that's not uncommon for someone your age. Blood pressure is a little elevated, too. 140 over 90. Not alarming, but something we need to monitor.
PATIENT: Crackles, you say? Is that bad? My wife, bless her soul, she used to get a bit of a cough in the winter. Always said it was just the cold air. 140 over 90… is that high? I don't really know what those numbers mean, to be honest. My wife always handled all the medical stuff. She was a sensible woman. I just try to keep up with things the best I can, but it’s hard when you don't understand the details. So, what does all this mean, Doctor? What do we need to do?
DOCTOR: It means, Mr. Bohnett, that you're not exactly in prime condition. The crackles are… minor. Likely just fluid buildup. But the blood pressure and cholesterol… those are things we need to address. We'll start with a lifestyle change. More exercise – even just a daily walk is good. And a stricter diet. Less red meat, less butter, more fruits and vegetables. And we'll start you on a low-dose statin to help lower your cholesterol. It has some side effects, but most people tolerate it fine. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A statin… that’s a pill, right? Will it make me tired? I already tire easily, like I said. And a stricter diet… less steak, less butter… that sounds a bit…sad, to be honest. My wife used to make a wonderful roast beef with Yorkshire pudding. I suppose I can try, but it sounds like a lot of changes. What kind of side effects are we talking about with this pill? And will it interfere with my… well, with my afternoon nap? I do enjoy my afternoon nap. It's the only thing that keeps me going sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a pill. And yes, it can cause fatigue in some people. But it’s usually mild. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. As for the afternoon nap… it shouldn’t interfere directly, but it's important to stay active during the day. A nap is fine, but don’t just sit around all day. As for the roast beef... well, a small portion occasionally won’t kill you. But you need to make significant changes to your diet, Mr. Bohnett. This isn't about depriving you of enjoyment; it's about prolonging your life. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to recheck your cholesterol levels and see how you're doing. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. My wife always kept track of those things. She was very organized, that one. Three months… that seems like a long time. Will I feel any different after three months? Will this pill actually work? And what if I forget to take it? I'm getting on in years, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be. Is there anything I can do to help me remember? Maybe a little chart? Or a reminder on my calendar? My daughter is pretty good with those newfangled computers… she could probably set something up.
DOCTOR: Yes, a pill reminder would be a good idea. Your daughter can help with that. And yes, the pill should work, if you take it as prescribed. It lowers cholesterol levels. It’s science, Mr. Bohnett. As for feeling different… you probably won't notice a dramatic change. But over time, it will reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke. That's the goal here. Prevention. We'll order the statin for you. I'll send the prescription to your pharmacy. And I’ll have the nurse give you a handout with information about lifestyle changes and medication side effects. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just the handout would be good. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if it is a bit…overwhelming. And thank you for not yelling at me about the steak. I suppose I can try to eat a bit less of it. My wife would be proud of me. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, that’s all for today. The nurse will be in shortly with the handout and to schedule your follow-up appointment. Just… try to follow the instructions. And if you experience any unusual side effects, call the office immediately. Have a good day, Mr. Bohnett. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You have a good day too. .
