DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Avril. I am here for... the talk with the computer, yes? My son, he made the appointment for me. It is about checking how I am doing. I feel… alright, I think. Just the usual aches for an old woman.
DOCTOR: Yes, a general wellness check-up, as your son scheduled. “Usual aches,” you say. Alright. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about those aches?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where to begin? It is mostly in my back, lower back. And my knees, they make noise when I stand up. Not every time, but often. It is not a sharp pain, more like... a reminder that I used to lift many cars. I worked as a mechanic for a long time, you see. Before my husband… well, a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: A mechanic, that’s… quite physically demanding work. I understand. So, the back and knees are the primary concern. And you describe it as more of a reminder than a sharp pain. Is the discomfort constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Some days are better than others. When it is cold, it is worse. And if I try to do too much in the garden, then I really feel it. I like to grow tomatoes, you see. But bending down… that is not so easy anymore.
DOCTOR: Tomatoes, excellent. Gardening can certainly aggravate things. And the cold weather makes it worse, you say. Alright. Do you notice any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet alongside the back and knee discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. Just… stiffness. Especially in the mornings. It takes a while to get moving, you know? Like an old machine that needs oil. I do some stretching, but it only helps a little bit.
DOCTOR: Stiffness in the mornings, that’s helpful to know. And stretching offers limited relief. Now, aside from your back and knees, have you noticed any changes in your overall health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I get tired more easily, I suppose. Not all the time, but it takes longer to recover after I do things. Even small things, like walking to the store. And my appetite is… not as good as it used to be. I used to love to cook, but now it feels like a chore sometimes.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and a lessened appetite… alright. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently, Ms. Benites?
PATIENT: I think so, yes. My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven’t really… weighed myself. My son, he worries about me, and he would want me to, but I don’t like scales. They always make me feel sad.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We can certainly skip the weigh-in for today if you prefer. However, knowing if there's been a noticeable weight change can be helpful. Now, thinking about your medical history, do you have any existing health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor gave me some pills, and it is mostly under control now. I also had a problem with my gallbladder many years ago, but they took it out. And…oh, I had a bad fall last year, broke my wrist. That took a long time to heal.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, gallbladder removal, and a wrist fracture… alright. Are you currently taking any medications for your high blood pressure, Ms. Benites?
PATIENT: Yes, I take a small white pill every morning. My son, he fills the little box for me each week. I don’t remember the name, sorry. It is… a water pill, I think? Something to do with the swelling in my feet.
DOCTOR: A water pill… we can certainly look into that more precisely. And you mentioned you have a son who helps manage your medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. I eat everything. My husband, he was allergic to shellfish, but I am fine. I never had a problem with any pills or food.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. Are you a smoker?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband smoked for a long time, but I always told him it was bad for his health. He quit eventually, thankfully. I don't like the smell of cigarettes.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Very small. It helps me relax. It is not every night, maybe two or three times a week. My husband liked a beer, but I prefer wine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Finally, Ms. Benites, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had arthritis, very bad in her hands. And my father… he had a heart problem, I think. He passed away when I was young. My husband’s side… his brother had diabetes, but that’s all I really remember. It was a long time ago now, and we didn’t talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s helpful to know. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just a quick look at your back and knees, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. I'll start by taking a look at your back. Could you point to where you're experiencing the most discomfort?
PATIENT: Here. Mostly here and here. It aches all over, but it’s worse in these spots. And it feels stiff, like a rusty gate.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m feeling some tenderness here on both sides, as you pointed out. And you’re right, there’s some stiffness. Now, I'm going to ask you to bend forward slightly, if that's comfortable, and tell me if you feel any pain. Just as far as you can without causing yourself significant discomfort.
PATIENT: Ooh, that is… not so good. It feels tight, and it hurts in my lower back. Not sharp, but… a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see. Limited range of motion with some discomfort on flexion. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you please point to where you’re experiencing the most noise or discomfort in your knees?
PATIENT: Here. It’s mostly inside the knees. And when I stand up after sitting for a long time, it makes a clicking sound. Not every time, but often. And sometimes it feels a little swollen, but I don’t know if that’s just because of the weather.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m noting some mild tenderness on the inside of both knees. Is there any swelling present right now?
PATIENT: Not much, no. Maybe a little bit. It’s hard to tell. It comes and goes with the weather, like I said. But right now, it’s not very swollen. And the pain… I would say maybe a 3, on a good day. Sometimes it goes up to a 6 when I’ve been walking a lot.
DOCTOR: Now, I’m going to ask you to stand up slowly, if you’re able. I want to see how you walk and assess your range of motion. And tell me if you notice any pain or clicking as you move.
PATIENT: Ooh, that is… not so easy. It clicks a little bit, yes, and it feels stiff. It’s worse at the beginning, and then it gets a little better after I walk for a while. But it still feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m noting some mild limping and decreased range of motion in both knees. It appears there’s some crepitus – that’s the clicking sound you’re experiencing – in both knees as well. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a complete picture. If you could lie back down for me, please.
PATIENT: Alright. Doctor. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range, and your pulse is regular. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it appears you’re experiencing some age-related wear and tear in your back and knees, likely osteoarthritis. This is very common, Ms. Benites, and there are things we can do to help manage your symptoms.
PATIENT: Osteo… what did you say? Is that… bad? I just want to be able to grow my tomatoes without too much pain. And to walk to the store without feeling like an old woman.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis simply means there's some breakdown of the cartilage in your joints – that’s the cushioning between your bones. It's very common as we age. It’s not necessarily bad, and it doesn’t mean you have to stop doing the things you enjoy. We can manage it. And that's what we'll focus on – getting you back to growing your tomatoes and walking to the store with less discomfort. I recommend starting with some gentle exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knees and back. Physical therapy can be very helpful with this. We can also discuss some over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help with the pain and inflammation. Does that sound like a reasonable plan to start?
PATIENT: Exercises… I haven’t done exercises in years. And I don’t like taking pills if I don’t have to. But… I want to feel better. So, yes, let’s try the exercises, I suppose. Are they hard? And who will show me how to do them correctly?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. We’ll start slowly, and they won’t be anything too strenuous. We can start with some simple range-of-motion exercises, like bending and straightening your knees, and some gentle stretching. I’m going to write you a referral to a physical therapist. They are experts in this area and can create a personalized exercise program for you, tailored to your needs and abilities. They’ll show you how to do each exercise correctly and safely, and they’ll monitor your progress. Do you have any preferences regarding the location of the physical therapy clinic?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really. As long as it is not too far from my house, that would be good. My son, he drives me everywhere, but I don’t want to bother him too much. Perhaps one near the grocery store? He takes me there every week.
DOCTOR: Alright. There’s a very good clinic just a few blocks from the grocery store, called “Active Life Physical Therapy”. I’ll write the referral to them. They accept Medicare, and they have excellent reviews. Here’s the referral. You can schedule an appointment with them at your convenience. They'll call you to confirm. Now, regarding pain relief, we can start with applying heat or ice to your knees and back when they're feeling sore. For the mild pain, sometimes that’s enough. If that doesn’t provide sufficient relief, we can discuss a mild over-the-counter pain reliever, but let’s try the exercises and heat/ice first, and see how you respond. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Heat and ice. I remember my mother using those. And the exercises. I hope they don’t hurt too much. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. It was my pleasure. Remember, the goal is to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in about six weeks to see how you’re progressing with the physical therapy. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Six weeks… yes, that is fine. I will try my best to do the exercises, and I will see the physical therapist. And I will grow my tomatoes. Thank you again, Doctor. I think that is all for today.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. That’s the spirit! Growing those tomatoes is a very good goal. Alright, I’ll have the nurse take your blood pressure one last time. And please, if anything changes or you experience any new symptoms, don’t hesitate to call the office. It was lovely meeting you, Ms. Benites. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in six weeks.
PATIENT:
