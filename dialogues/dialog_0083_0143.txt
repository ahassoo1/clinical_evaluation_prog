DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Smith. Um… well, it’s a bit… complicated. I think… I think my daughter, she wants… a baby. And she thought I should come talk to someone first. About… you know… making sure everything is okay. It’s been a long time since I… well, never mind. I don't really know what they want me to do, exactly. Just… checking things?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Smith. It’s very thoughtful of your daughter to include you in this process, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to ensure everything is as healthy as possible before starting a family. It sounds like you’re interested in a preconception check-up to assess your overall health and potential risks. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Oh dear. That's… a long time ago. I think I had the usual childhood things. Measles, maybe? I remember being sick in bed. And… I broke my arm once, falling from a tree. Nothing serious, I don't think. As an adult… I’ve mostly just been… okay. I’ve had a bit of trouble with my back lately, getting old, you know? But nothing a good rest doesn’t fix. I don’t really… go to the doctor much. I’m not sure what you need to know, exactly. Do you have a list? It’s hard to remember everything after all these years.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Smith. It is hard to remember details from a long time ago, and we can take things at your pace. I'll ask some questions to jog your memory, and we'll focus on anything that might be relevant to helping your daughter have a healthy pregnancy. Let’s start with some of the bigger things. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? Hmm. I don't think so. The doctor, years ago, he said my blood pressure was a little high once, but he just told me to watch my salt. And… no, I don't have… sugar problems, I don’t think. I like sweets, but… my daughter always tells me off for that. My heart… feels okay. It beats, doesn’t it? I’ve never been told I have anything serious. I’m pretty sure. Is that… helpful? I’m really not good at this, sorry.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Smith. It’s good to hear you haven’t been diagnosed with any major conditions. We'll still want to check your blood pressure today to be sure. And it’s good you're mindful of your salt intake. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the broken arm you mentioned?
PATIENT: Surgery… Let me see… No, I don’t think so. Not really. Oh! Wait. When I was a boy, I had my tonsils out. A long, long time ago. That’s all I can remember. Just the tonsils. And… I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my arm, but that was just to get it set. Nothing else, I don’t think. It was all… a very long time ago. Everything is a bit blurry now. I hope that's okay.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Smith. Tonsil removal is good to know, and the hospital stay for your arm too. We are just trying to get a full picture. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or children – has any medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, that's a tricky one. My family… we didn’t really talk about those things much. My father, he… he died when I was young. I think it was something with his heart, but I don't remember the details. My mother… she lived a long life, but she was always… frail. She had aches and pains, but she never went to the doctor much either. My sister… she’s still alive, but we don't see each other often. I think she has high blood pressure, but I’m not sure. And my daughter… she’s very healthy, thankfully. She always tells me to eat better and exercise more! It’s hard to say, really. Nobody really talked about illnesses much when I was growing up. Is it important? Should I try to remember more?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Smith, even if it’s just a general idea. Knowing about family history can sometimes help us understand potential risks. It's okay if you can't recall specific details. We can make a note that there is limited information available. Now, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, no. Never smoked in my life. Never liked it. Smells terrible. My wife… she used to smoke a little, years ago, but she stopped when my daughter was born. I always told her it was bad for her health, and for the baby. But me? Never. I prefer fresh air. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Smith. That’s very good to know. And it’s wonderful that your wife was able to quit for your daughter’s health. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… Um… sometimes. A little bit. I might have a glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing more than that, I promise. Just to relax. I don’t drink much, really. It doesn’t agree with me if I have too much. My daughter doesn't like it when I drink, she says it’s bad for my liver. She worries about everything! Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Smith. Occasional, moderate alcohol consumption is generally not a concern. It's good that you're mindful of your intake. Your daughter sounds like she cares a lot about your well-being. Finally, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… not that I know of. I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I might get a little itchy sometimes, but that’s just the weather, I think. My skin gets sensitive in the summer. But no, no serious allergies. I can eat anything, thankfully. I like food! Is that… okay? I hope I’m not forgetting something important… it’s hard to remember everything after so many years.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Smith. No known allergies is good to know. You're doing great, and it’s perfectly normal to not remember everything. We’ve covered a lot of important information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your abdomen. It will help us get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… I haven’t had one of those in… a very long time. But… yes. Yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please. My back isn’t what it used to be. And… try not to take too long? I get a little… anxious when things take too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Smith. I'll be as gentle as possible, and we won't take long. We’ll just start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: There you go. It feels… strange, having someone look at me like this after so long. But… do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… try not to poke me too much?
DOCTOR: Alright, Smith. Just relax your arm, and try to breathe normally. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. We’ll want to monitor that over time. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Do you mind if I have you take a few deep breaths?
PATIENT: Oh… a little tight, isn’t it? But… yes, okay. Elevated? Is that… bad? I don’t remember the doctor ever saying anything about my blood pressure before. Maybe it’s just because I’m nervous. Go ahead, Doctor. Listen away. Just… try to be quick, please. My back is starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are regular, but I can hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily a cause for concern, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear, but you do have some decreased air entry in the lower lobes on both sides. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness or masses. It’s a little bit tender when I press on your lower back. Okay, Smith. That completes the physical exam. Your back tenderness and decreased air entry in your lungs could be related to your age or previous inactivity. The elevated blood pressure is something we need to address. We can start by making some lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise. Do you have any questions about what I’ve found?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… That’s what my daughter always says. Diet and exercise. Easier said than done when you’re… well, my age. A murmur? Decreased… what did you say? It all sounds so… complicated. And my back always aches, but I just thought it was getting old. So… what does all this mean? Is it serious? Will I be able to… help my daughter?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed, Smith. Let's break it down. The murmur is something we'll monitor. Many people have innocent heart murmurs that don't cause any problems. The decreased air entry could be from being less active, or a bit of stiffness in your chest. And the back tenderness is likely related to age and strain. As for your ability to help your daughter, that’s a very important question. The elevated blood pressure is the biggest concern right now. It could pose a risk during pregnancy, so we need to get it under control. But that doesn’t mean you can’t help. It just means we need to be proactive. We’ll start with some blood tests to get a better understanding of your overall health, including your kidney function and cholesterol levels. We’ll also want to do a urine test. I’d also recommend an ECG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. Based on those results, we can discuss treatment options, which may include medication and lifestyle changes. I want to assure you that we can work together to make sure you’re healthy and able to support your daughter. We'll take things one step at a time. Do you have any questions about the tests I’ve recommended?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. It’s all a bit much, Doctor. I haven’t had a test in… I don’t even remember. I just wanted to… make sure everything was okay. To help my daughter. Urine test? Is that… difficult? I have a bit of trouble… going to the bathroom sometimes. And medication? I don’t like taking pills. I always feel… strange when I take pills. Is it… is it possible that everything is just fine? That I’m worrying over nothing?
DOCTOR: It is a lot, I understand, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take everything at your pace. The urine test is very straightforward, Smith. You’ll simply be asked to provide a sample in a private bathroom. It’s not difficult at all. If you have any trouble, the nurses will be happy to assist you. As for medication, we don’t have to jump to that right away. Let’s see what the test results show first. We can explore lifestyle changes – diet, exercise, stress reduction – and see if those make a difference. If those aren’t enough, we can discuss medication options, but it’s not our first step. And yes, it’s absolutely possible that everything is just fine. These tests are simply to get a baseline and rule out any potential problems. The elevated blood pressure is the only thing that’s currently concerning, and we can manage that. To summarize, I’m ordering blood tests, a urine test, and an ECG. Once we have those results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… yes. That sounds… okay. Blood tests, urine test, ECG. A plan. What about my daughter? Should she come to the follow-up appointment? Maybe she can help me understand everything. She’s very… organized. And… how long will the tests take? I have a bit of a doctor’s appointment next week. I don't want to reschedule.
DOCTOR: That’s a great idea, Smith. Your daughter is very welcome to join the follow-up appointment. It’s often helpful to have a second person there to listen and ask questions. As for the tests, the blood tests and urine test should take about 15-20 minutes. The ECG is very quick, only about 5-10 minutes. The lab technician will schedule you for a convenient time. I’ll also give you a lab requisition form to take with you. They should be able to fit you in within the next week, but if they can’t, please let me know, and I’ll contact them directly. I’ll also give you a handout with information about high blood pressure and lifestyle changes to get you started. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… No, I think that's all for now. Handout, lab requisition form… okay. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very… patient with me. I appreciate it. I just… I want to be a good father. And a grandfather. I want to be healthy enough to… help. I think that's all. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Smith. It’s perfectly natural to want to be healthy for your family. And you’re already taking the first step by coming in to get checked out. I’m confident that we can work together to achieve your goals. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Smith. And please give my best to your daughter.
