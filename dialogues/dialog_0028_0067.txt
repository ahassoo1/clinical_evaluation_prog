DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Ruocco, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Murry Ruocco. Though… everyone just calls me Murry. Look, is this gonna take long? I got things to do today.
DOCTOR: Well, someone has to ask the questions, Murry. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. The pain. It’s… when I breathe deep. Hurts right here, in my chest. It’s not… constant, you know? Comes and goes. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when it started. Lately, maybe? It's just… uncomfortable. I don’t know what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: "Lately" isn't particularly helpful, Murry. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Maybe… a couple weeks? Before that… I was working on that new house over on Elm Street. Lots of lifting, a lot of… being on my feet. Maybe it started then? It’s hard to say. My memory ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: So, pain with deep breaths, onset roughly two weeks ago, potentially related to physical labor. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think… No, not really. I’ve been… a little tired, I guess. Old age, probably. And maybe a little short of breath when I climb the stairs. But I’ve always been a little winded going upstairs. Is that… important? I don’t know. I just wanted to get this chest pain checked out. It worries me, you know?
DOCTOR: Tiredness and shortness of breath are… pertinent. Do you have any cough?
PATIENT: Cough? Not really. A little tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothing serious. Not a proper cough, you know? Just… a clearing of the throat. No phlegm, nothing like that. I haven’t been sick, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any history of… cardiac issues?
PATIENT: Cardiac… issues? Heart problems? Not that I know of. My… my wife, bless her soul, she always took care of the medical stuff. I just… worked. I built things. She’d take me to the doctor when I needed to go. After… well, after she passed, I haven’t really been to a doctor much. I don’t think I’ve ever had any heart trouble. But… honestly, I couldn’t say for sure. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a listen to your chest, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you need. Just… try to be quick, alright? I got a fence to finish building.
DOCTOR: Okay. Deep breath in… and out… again… Alright. There’s some… diminished breath sounds on the lower left lobe. Any history of smoking?
PATIENT: Smoking? Oh, heavens no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she hated them. Said they were a waste of money and bad for your health. I listened to her. Never had any use for 'em. No, never smoked a day in my life. Never.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t… I don’t really take much. Penicillin, maybe? I think I had a bad reaction to penicillin when I was a kid. But honestly, it was so long ago, I barely remember. And I haven’t taken it since. No, I don’t think I have any current allergies. I just try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. Is this going to be much longer?
DOCTOR: No significant allergies. Okay. What about past surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a young man, working on a construction site. They set it, put it in a cast. That was… a long time ago. And… oh! I had my appendix out when I was in my twenties. That was… quick. I was in and out of the hospital pretty fast. Other than that… I don't think so. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. Mostly just bumps and bruises from the job. Is this getting somewhere?
DOCTOR: Alright. And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a tough one. My… my parents are both gone now. They died a long time ago. And I didn't really keep up with… well, with their family history. They came over from… Laos, I think. Hmong people, that’s what we are. They didn't talk much about medical stuff, you know? Just… worked hard, lived simple lives. I have some cousins, but I haven’t seen them in years. I really don’t know anything about their health, to be honest. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s just say… no significant family history known. Given your age, your symptoms, and the diminished breath sounds, I suspect it could be a mild pneumonia or perhaps exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. However, without a chest X-ray, it's difficult to say definitively.
PATIENT: X-ray? You want to take a picture of my chest? Is it… serious? I just thought it was a little pain. Look, I’m not a fan of all those machines and… radiation, and all that. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe… rest? I can take it easy for a few days, see if it gets better on its own. I really don’t want to go getting poked and prodded and… X-rayed. Can we just try something else?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Ruocco, I understand your concerns, but without proper imaging, we’re operating in the dark. However… Given your lack of insurance, I suppose we can try a course of antibiotics, assuming it’s a bacterial infection. But if your symptoms worsen – fever, increased shortness of breath, worsening chest pain – you must go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… alright. That sounds… better than an X-ray. Yes, I understand. No fever, no worse breathing… go to the hospital. Okay. What kind of antibiotics? And… how long do I have to take them? Look, I got work to do. I can’t be laid up for weeks. Just… tell me what I need to do, and I’ll do it. And… is this gonna cost a lot? I really don’t have a lot of money.
DOCTOR: Amoxicillin, 500mg three times a day for seven days. The cost should be minimal, but I can't guarantee anything. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Follow these instructions carefully, and if things don't improve, don't hesitate to seek further medical attention. Next!
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Thank you. I appreciate it. I’ll… be careful. And… thank you again. .
