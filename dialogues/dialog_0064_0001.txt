DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure. Well, I suppose it’s about the smoking, really. I’ve been… at it a long time, and I think it’s finally time I tried to do something about it. It’s just… not getting any easier, you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Knoch. It’s a very brave step to come in and address this. Many years of smoking can certainly make it difficult to stop. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Hmm… where to begin? I started when I was quite young, maybe fifteen or sixteen. It was… common, back then. Everyone seemed to be doing it. I was working on the farm with my father, and… well, it became a habit. A bad habit, now that I think on it. I’ve smoked, on average, a pack a day for… oh, goodness, probably fifty years now. Maybe a little more. Though there were times, especially during the colder months, I’d go through a pack and a half. I mostly smoke unfiltered cigarettes, if that matters. Do you need to know the brand?
DOCTOR: That’s quite a long time, Mr. Knoch. And yes, knowing the brand can be helpful, but it’s not the most important thing right now. A pack a day for fifty years… that gives me a good starting point. Have you tried to quit before?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, many times. Oh, goodness, I've lost count. Patches, gum, even those… inhalers. My sister, she swore by the gum. Didn’t work for me, though. I’d chew and chew, and still crave a cigarette. And the patches… made me feel quite unwell, to be honest. I tried going “cold turkey” a few times too. Lasted maybe a day, two at the most. My nerves… they get the better of me. I just… feel lost without it, if that makes any sense. It’s a comfort, silly as that sounds.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Mr. Knoch. Nicotine is a very addictive substance, and it’s completely understandable that you’ve found it difficult. It sounds like you’ve been very persistent in your attempts, which is admirable. And it's helpful to know what hasn’t worked in the past. Besides the cravings and nerves, have you noticed any other symptoms since you started smoking?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, yes. My breathing, it’s not what it used to be, of course. Gets worse with the cold weather. And I cough, quite a bit, especially in the mornings. A deep, rattling cough. The doctor back home – Dr. Valaitis, good man – he said it was likely just a “smoker’s cough,” but… I worry. I tire easily, too. Walking up the hill to the store, it leaves me breathless. And I haven't had much appetite lately. Everything tastes… muted, somehow. Is that from the smoking too, do you think? I used to love my potato pancakes, but… they don't have the same flavour anymore.
DOCTOR: Those are all symptoms that can be associated with long-term smoking, Mr. Knoch. The cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and changes in appetite… they’re all concerning. Dr. Valaitis’ assessment is reasonable, but it’s good you’re seeking further evaluation. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, certainly. That sounds… sensible. I suppose I should expect that. A physical exam is fine. I haven’t had one in… oh, goodness, must be five years now. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I always feel a bit silly undressing in front of strangers, but… I understand it’s necessary. Where would you like me to begin?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Knoch. It’s been a while, so it’s a good time to get things checked. Don’t worry about feeling silly; we do this every day. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. If you could just loosen your shirt and take a few deep breaths, that would be great. And then I’ll listen to your back as well. Just relax and try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here you are. I hope you don’t mind, it’s been a while since I’ve been properly examined. I used to be quite strong, working on the farm, but… things change, don’t they?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Knoch. It’s perfectly understandable. I’m hearing some wheezing in your lungs, especially when you exhale. Your heart sounds a bit rapid, but that could be related to the difficulty you're experiencing breathing. I’d also like to check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation. It’s a quick and painless test. Just sit still for a moment while I take your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I always get a bit nervous when they check my blood pressure. My father… he had high blood pressure. It wasn’t good. Hopefully mine isn’t too bad. Just let me know if it is. Is it… is it very high?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, Mr. Knoch, 145/90. It’s not critically high, but it’s something we need to monitor. And your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little on the lower end of normal. It suggests your lungs aren’t getting as much oxygen as they should. Now, just to complete the exam, I’d like to briefly look in your ears and throat, and feel your neck. Just open your mouth and say “ah” when I ask.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Is everything alright? It feels a little… strange. I always hated having doctors look in my ears. Reminds me of when I was a child, and I’d get terrible ear infections. Hopefully, I haven’t got one of those again. It's been many years, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Everything looks relatively normal, Mr. Knoch. Your ears are clear, and your throat is slightly red, but that could be due to the dry air. There’s no sign of an infection. Your lymph nodes feel slightly enlarged, but that can be a reaction to the inflammation in your lungs. Alright, Mr. Knoch, thank you for your patience. That completes the physical exam. Based on your history and the exam findings, I’m concerned about the effects of your long-term smoking on your lungs and heart. Your wheezing, low oxygen saturation, and fatigue are all concerning signs. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. Whatever you think is best. A chest X-ray and blood tests… sounds sensible. I trust your judgement. I’ve smoked for so long, I suppose it’s not surprising something isn’t quite right. It’s just… I always hoped I could beat it, you know? Stop before it got to this. But… alright, let’s do the tests. When can I expect the results? And… what happens next? Will I need to see a specialist? This is all a bit overwhelming, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s overwhelming, Mr. Knoch. It’s good you’re taking this step now. The tests will give us a better understanding of the extent of the damage, if any. We can usually get the X-ray results back within 24-48 hours, and the blood tests should take a few days. Based on those results, we can decide on the best course of action. You may need to see a pulmonologist – a lung specialist – for further evaluation and management. It’s also very important to start a smoking cessation program. There are many resources available, including medication, counseling, and support groups. We can discuss those options in more detail once we have the test results. In the meantime, I want to emphasize that it's never too late to quit smoking, even after many years. It can significantly improve your health and quality of life. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: That all sounds… a bit daunting, to be honest. A pulmonologist… I’ve never seen a specialist before. But alright, I’ll do whatever you recommend. As for questions… hmm. Well, what kind of medication is available? I’ve tried patches and gum, as I said, but they didn’t work for me. Are there any other options? Something that might… calm my nerves, perhaps? I get so anxious without a cigarette. It’s a terrible habit, I know, but… it's difficult to explain. And… will the X-ray show if there’s anything serious wrong? I’m worried about… well, you know. Cancer. Is that what you’re looking for? I suppose I should just be honest. It’s been weighing on my mind.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Mr. Knoch, and it’s good you’re being so honest. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious and worried in this situation. There are several other medication options available for smoking cessation besides patches and gum. We have medications like bupropion and varenicline, which can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms by affecting the chemicals in your brain. These are usually taken as pills, and they often have fewer side effects than the patches. We can discuss which option might be best for you, taking into account your medical history and any other medications you’re taking. As for the X-ray, it’s a screening tool that can help us identify any abnormalities in your lungs, such as tumors, inflammation, or other damage. It doesn't necessarily mean you have cancer, but it can help us determine if further investigation is needed. If we do find something suspicious, we can order a CT scan or biopsy to get a more detailed look. It’s important to remember that many lung conditions are treatable, even cancer. Early detection is key, and we will do everything we can to provide you with the best possible care. Do you feel comfortable with me ordering the X-ray and blood tests now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, alright. Order the tests. Let’s just… get it over with, I suppose. Knowing is better than wondering, even if it’s bad news. And… yes, let’s talk about those medications. The ones you mentioned. Bupropion and… varenicline. What are the side effects? I don’t want to trade one problem for another, you understand? I’m already anxious enough. And… what about support groups? I’ve never been one for group therapy, but… if it might help, I’m willing to try. It’s just… difficult for me to talk about my feelings, to be honest. Always been a private person. But… alright. Let’s talk about it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Knoch. It takes courage to even consider these options, and I respect your privacy. Both bupropion and varenicline can have some side effects, but they’re usually mild. Bupropion can cause some insomnia or dry mouth, and it’s not recommended for people with a history of seizures. Varenicline can cause nausea or vivid dreams in some people, and there’s a rare risk of mood changes, which is why we need to monitor you closely. We’ll discuss the potential risks and benefits of each medication in detail, and we can start with a low dose to minimize any side effects. As for support groups, they can be very helpful for some people. It’s a safe and supportive environment where you can share your experiences and learn from others who are going through the same thing. There are many different types of groups available, and you can choose one that feels comfortable for you. There are also online groups if you prefer. We don't need to decide anything right now. We'll get the test results first, and then we can discuss the best course of action together. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Now, I'll have my nurse draw the blood and schedule the chest X-ray for you. Do you have any questions before I call her in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all for now. Just… thank you. For listening, and for being so… understanding. It’s a relief to finally talk about it, to be honest. I’ve been carrying this around for so long. Alright, let’s get the blood drawn. And the X-ray. Let’s just… get it done.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knoch. It takes courage to face these things, and I’m glad you’ve taken this step. I’ll call the nurse now, and she'll be right in. Just relax, and we’ll take things one step at a time. Please don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you're feeling anxious or uncomfortable at any point.
