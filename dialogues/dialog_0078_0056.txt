DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s about my…position. At the university. Honestly, the whole situation is rather…beneath me. I’m a teacher, a library science teacher, and frankly, the…students these days. It’s quite stressful, you see. Though I doubt you’d understand.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some stress related to your work at the university. It’s certainly not uncommon for life changes or pressures at work to cause stress, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Just to clarify, when you say "position," are you referring to feeling unwell because of the stress, or is there a physical discomfort you're experiencing that's concerning you?
PATIENT: Physical discomfort? Good heavens, no. It's…a matter of principle, really. The disrespect. The sheer lack of…intellectual curiosity. It weighs on one's mind, you understand? I’m not some delicate flower, doctor. It’s simply…exhausting. Though, I suppose a headache accompanies it sometimes. A dull ache, mostly at the temples. But that’s hardly worth mentioning.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it sounds like the primary issue is stress stemming from workplace frustrations, and you've also been experiencing some headaches, mostly a dull ache at the temples. To help me understand the headaches better, could you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, really, must we delve into headaches? They come and go. After a particularly…trying lecture, perhaps. Or grading papers filled with…well, never mind. They aren't debilitating. A simple cup of tea usually does the trick. Honestly, I’m a busy man, doctor. I have a life. Are we getting anywhere with this? This feels rather…fruitless.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer, and I appreciate your patience. Even headaches that aren’t “debilitating” can impact your quality of life, and it’s important to explore all potential causes, even if they seem minor. To help me determine if further investigation is needed, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Really! I am not riddled with ailments, young man. I assure you. I sleep…adequately. I eat…when I can be bothered. My appetite is not what it once was, I suppose. Though that could simply be due to the…state of the world. And I am, frankly, rather tired these days. But who isn’t tired? This is all terribly obvious, isn’t it? I'm stressed. I’m a bit weary. Is that sufficient? Perhaps we can move on to discussing…solutions. Though I doubt there are any.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you've been experiencing some fatigue and a decreased appetite in addition to the stress and headaches. Thank you for sharing that. Just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh, goodness. Really, doctor, you are asking me to recall…trivialities. I haven’t stepped on a scale in…well, quite some time. I suppose I’ve lost a little weight. My clothes are a bit looser, perhaps. But I’m not obsessing over such things! A gentleman doesn’t concern himself with such petty details. Honestly, this is…rather undignified. Are we nearly finished? I have a faculty meeting this afternoon. A very important one.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you've experienced some unintentional weight loss, and that, combined with the decreased appetite and fatigue, warrants a little further investigation. Would you mind if I asked a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Good heavens. I haven’t needed a doctor in decades. This is preposterous. I suppose…very well. But make it quick. I haven't got all day, you know. And don’t ask me about childhood illnesses, I haven’t the faintest recollection. I was a perfectly healthy boy! It’s likely the same now, truthfully. Just…stressed. Ask your questions, but I assure you, it will be a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. We’ll keep it brief. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Diabetes? Are you implying something, doctor? I assure you, I lead a perfectly respectable life. I have never had any such ailments. A perfectly sound constitution, as my mother used to say. No. Absolutely not. I've never even considered such things. This line of questioning is quite…insulting, frankly. Now, are we done? I'd like to be on my way. I have preparations to make for that meeting. It's about the… curriculum. A disaster, I tell you. A complete disaster.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions caused any offense, Mr. Schlatterer. I assure you, I am simply gathering information to ensure I provide you with the best possible care. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Absolutely not. I am not one for…invasiveness. I take pride in my natural state, thank you very much. A gentleman avoids such…unnecessary procedures. No. None. Never. This is all rather ridiculous. I suspect you are simply trying to find something wrong with me. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. A little stressed, perhaps, but perfectly healthy. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I really must be going. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. Before you leave, I would like to conduct a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment. It will only take a few moments. Would that be acceptable?
