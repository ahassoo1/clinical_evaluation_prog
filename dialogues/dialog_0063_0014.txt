DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Try to be concise; my schedule is quite full.
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Limtiaco is fine, please. Um… well, it’s about some papers I need. My wife… she handles most things, you see. Something about needing to take some time… for health reasons? I think it has to do with… work? It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. She said something about forms… for leave, maybe? Or… help with things if I can’t work? I just… need the paperwork, I suppose. Do you know what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. It sounds like you require documentation for a leave of absence, potentially under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Though, frankly, it’s difficult to ascertain anything concrete with such… vague information. Your wife brought you in for this?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. My wife, Leilani. She’s very organized. I… I don’t really remember why exactly I need it, just that she was quite insistent. Something about… a change in my health? I feel… alright, mostly. A little tired, perhaps. Old age, you know? But nothing serious, I don’t think. She just said these papers were important to have, just in case. Is it a big deal? I hope it’s not a big deal.
DOCTOR: "Just in case" is rarely a sufficient medical justification, Mr. Limtiaco. Fatigue, as you mentioned, could indicate a variety of underlying issues. We will need to establish a clearer understanding of your current health status before completing any forms. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, my appetite hasn’t been great lately. Not much different than usual, really. And… I’ve been a little more forgetful, if that counts. Though, at my age… I always forget things! Leilani says so. Nothing alarming, I assure you. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suspect. She worries too much, that wife of mine. Is that helpful? I really wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: Right. Decreased appetite and increased forgetfulness. We’ll document that. Do you have any history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant medical conditions… Oh dear. That’s a tough one. I… I had something with my heart, years ago. A long time ago. I think it was… palpitations? They fixed it, though. A procedure, I believe. And… I had a bad bout of the flu a few years back, but everyone gets the flu, don’t they? Nothing major, truly. I’ve always been fairly healthy, for a Tahitian man of my age. Leilani keeps all the records, you see. I’m afraid I’m not very good with these things. Do you need dates or something? I really wouldn't know.
DOCTOR: Yes, dates would be helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. Fortunately, it appears your wife has been diligent in maintaining your medical history. Ah, here we are. Supraventricular tachycardia, treated with catheter ablation in 2010. Influenza A, 2018. Any other surgeries or hospitalizations I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Supra… what-now? And Influenza… oh, the flu. Yes, that sounds right. Surgeries… hmm. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, I think. A very long time ago. And… maybe a wisdom tooth pulled? It's all so hazy. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t recall much detail. I was younger then, and… well, things fade, you know? Leilani always says I should write things down. Perhaps I should have listened to her. Is it important to know about my appendix? It didn't bother me for decades!
DOCTOR: Appendectomy, age 12. Noted. We’re establishing a baseline, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, regarding your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, that’s… Leilani knows all that, too. My mother… she lived a long life, but I think she had something with her joints? Arthritis, perhaps? And my father… he was a strong man, a fisherman. I don’t recall him being particularly ill, though he did spend a lot of time in the sun. Lots of skin problems, I think. Nothing… serious. Most of my family lived long lives on the islands. Healthy lives, mostly. We ate a lot of fish and fruit. It’s all a bit… vague, I’m afraid. Does that help at all? I wish I was more useful.
DOCTOR: Right. Maternal history of possible arthritis. Paternal history unremarkable. Now, do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. No, not really. Just a little something for my blood pressure, sometimes. Leilani reminds me to take it. A small white pill, I think. And… sometimes I take a multivitamin, but I forget half the time. Nothing regular, honestly. Mostly just when Leilani tells me to. She’s very good at keeping track of these things. I rely on her a lot, you see. It's hard to remember everything at my age. Is that important? Should I ask her what the name of the blood pressure pill is?
DOCTOR: Yes, the name of the blood pressure medication would be helpful. We need to ensure there are no potential interactions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No, I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I get stung by a mosquito, but that’s just a normal reaction, isn’t it? I've eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, and never had any problems. Leilani would have told me if I had allergies, I’m sure of it. She’s very careful about what I eat. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. But I suppose… I should ask her just to be sure? She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm going to perform a brief physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. We need to assess your current condition, despite the… limited information.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. A physical exam? Is that… necessary? I feel alright, mostly. Just a little tired, like I said. But… if you think it’s best. Just… please be gentle, Doctor. These old bones aren’t what they used to be. And… I hope I’m not a bother.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142/88. Pulse is regular, 72 beats per minute. Auscultation reveals a mild murmur, consistent with age-related changes. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no palpable masses. Reflexes are diminished, but within normal limits for a patient of your age. Motor function is intact. Overall, physical exam is unremarkable, but further investigation is warranted.
PATIENT: Further investigation? What sort of investigation? Is something wrong? I told you, I just feel a little tired. And forgetful, sometimes. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? I don’t want to cause any trouble, Doctor. I just need the paperwork for work, if that’s possible. My wife… she’s very worried, you see. But I don't think it's anything serious. Is there anything I should be concerned about? Perhaps a blood test? Would that help?
DOCTOR: A blood test would be prudent, Mr. Limtiaco. It will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue and forgetfulness. We’ll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, thyroid levels, and vitamin D. I also recommend a basic metabolic panel. While the physical exam was unremarkable, your symptoms are not insignificant. We need to establish a definitive cause before completing any documentation for leave. I will order the blood tests now. Please return in one week with the results.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. A lot of tests. Is it really necessary? I just want to get back to work, if possible. My wife… she’ll be relieved to know we're doing something, but I worry about the cost. And the waiting… a whole week? Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Taking vitamins? Getting more rest? I don’t want to be a bother, Doctor. Just… what are we looking for, exactly? What if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, I understand your concerns. However, it is my professional responsibility to conduct a thorough evaluation. The blood tests will help us identify any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. We are looking for a variety of things – anemia, electrolyte imbalances, thyroid dysfunction, vitamin deficiencies, kidney problems, liver issues – all of which can cause fatigue and cognitive impairment. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet, staying hydrated, and getting adequate rest. Avoid strenuous activity. And, frankly, I strongly suggest you discuss your concerns with your wife. Return with the results in one week. If you experience any worsening symptoms—such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, or confusion—seek immediate medical attention. Now, if there are no further questions, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. I’ll… I’ll talk to Leilani. She’ll be glad to hear we’re getting it checked out. And I'll try to rest. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. I hope everything is alright.
