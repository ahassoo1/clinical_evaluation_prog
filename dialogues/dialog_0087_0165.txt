DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. Been gettin’ this fever on and off, see? Not a high one, usually, but enough to feel pretty crumby. Happens every few weeks, feels like. Tiredness mostly, with it. It’s been goin’ on for…oh, I dunno, maybe three months now? It’s a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide. Thank you for that information. So, a fever and tiredness, occurring on and off for approximately three months. And you said it's not usually a high fever?
PATIENT: No, not like the flu or nothin’. More like…warm. You know? I don’t bother takin’ my temperature unless I feel really bad, and it ain't been that bad. Mostly just feel weak and kinda achy. Like I got a little cold comin’ on, but it never is a cold. That’s the weird part.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s a subtle fever, accompanied by weakness and aches, but without the typical cold symptoms. When you say "every few weeks," can you give me a rough estimate of how often this occurs?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… maybe every two, three weeks? Sometimes a little longer, sometimes a little shorter. It's hard to say exactly. It don’t follow a pattern, Doc. Just…comes and goes. Lasted about three, four days each time, usually. Then I feel okay for a bit, then it hits again. It's a real nuisance, I tell ya. Especially with the gardenin’ and all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Approximately every two to three weeks, lasting three to four days each time. And this is interfering with your gardening, is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. I like keepin' busy out there, you know? Tomatoes, peppers, cilantro… takes a lot of work. But when this fever hits, I gotta take it easy. Can’t be bendin' and stoopin' when I feel like garbage. My wife, Elena, she helps out, but she's got her own things to do. It just…slows everything down.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds quite disruptive. Let's try to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Aside from the fever and tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms during these episodes?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really. No cough, no sniffles. Sometimes my muscles feel a little sore, like I pulled somethin'. But I do that all the time with the gardenin’, so I don’t pay much attention to it. No headaches, no… rashes, nothin’ like that. Just tired and warm, mostly. And kinda achy. It's a pretty mild thing, really. Just annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no cough, sniffles, headaches, or rashes. Just the fever, tiredness, and occasional muscle aches. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight during these times?
PATIENT: Nah, my appetite's been the same. Elena always says I eat too much, no matter how I’m feelin’. chuckles Weight's probably the same, too. I ain’t been weighin’ myself, but my pants still fit. I don’t think it’s somethin’ serious, Doc. But it keeps happenin’, and I figured I oughta get it checked out. Just in case.
DOCTOR: That's a good idea to get it checked out, even if you suspect it's not serious. Let’s go over a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Had the usual childhood stuff – measles, chickenpox, all that. But nothin’ major. Had a bad back once, years ago, that's why I seen a chiropractor for a while. But other than that, I’m pretty healthy. Elena keeps tellin’ me I’m too stubborn to get sick. chuckles again I don’t take any regular medications, either. Just an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major medical conditions and you don’t take any regular medications. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife. Too scared of hospitals, to be honest. Elena had her gallbladder out a few years back, and that was enough for me. Never needed anythin’ myself, thankfully. Just the back issues, and that was just adjustments, not surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had high blood pressure when she got older. And my father… he had some kind of trouble with his heart, I think. But he didn't take care of himself, always smokin’ cigars and eatin’ rich food. I try to eat healthier than him, and I never touched a cigarette. Elena’s family is healthy as horses, mostly. She's got good genes, that one. smiles faintly She’s the one who keeps me in line.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure and heart trouble on your side, but otherwise, a generally healthy family. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Elena always jokes I have a cast iron stomach. I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medicines I’ve taken, either. Just the usual bit of drowsiness with some of the cold stuff, but nothin’ serious. I don’t really have any trouble with allergies at all. You know, I think that’s about it, Doc. I’m a pretty simple fella. Hopefully, this ain’t somethin’ too serious. I got tomatoes to pick!
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known allergies. Thank you for providing that information, Clide. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and feel your abdomen. It will just take a few minutes. Does that sound alright?
