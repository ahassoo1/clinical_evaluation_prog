DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. I see here you’re a new patient with our clinic. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, good morning. I’m here for a life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out before they’ll give me a policy. Just a medical exam, I think. I’m Waleed Putney, by the way. Want to get this over with, if that's okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Putney. A pre-insurance physical. I understand wanting to be efficient with your time. We’ll do our best to keep this straightforward. To begin, can you tell me about any current health concerns you have – anything that's been bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn't? Old age catching up, I guess. I had a bad knee for a while, but it's okay now. Mostly just… normal stuff. I don’t go to the doctor much, if that matters.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Normal stuff” is good to hear. And it’s alright that you don’t visit the doctor frequently. Just trying to get a full picture. When you say your knee is “okay now,” can you tell me more about what happened with it?
PATIENT: It just… hurt. A lot. Years ago, I think I twisted it playing basketball with my nephew. Went to physical therapy for a bit. It still aches sometimes when it's cold, but it doesn't stop me from doing things. It's… manageable. I don't want to bother you with old stuff if it’s not important.
DOCTOR: No, it’s helpful to know. Past injuries can be relevant. And we appreciate you sharing. Now, let’s move on to some general questions. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. I don’t think so anyway. The doctors never told me I had any of that stuff. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, like I said. My ex-wife used to handle all that. So I really don’t know. Sorry if that's not helpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Putney. We’re just gathering information. We can work with what you know. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was a kid, maybe? I had my tonsils taken out, I think. A long time ago. And… no, I don’t think so. Nothing as an adult, definitely. Just the tonsils when I was little. Does that count? It was years and years ago.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child, noted. And no hospitalizations as an adult. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Uh… that's a tough one. My mom, she had… something with her heart, I think. But she passed away a long time ago, so I don't really remember the details. My dad… he was pretty healthy, actually. Lived a long life. I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ health. We didn’t talk about that stuff much. Sorry. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It can be helpful, but it’s perfectly alright if you don’t have that information, Mr. Putney. We won’t press it. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. Don’t smoke. Never have. I used to drink a little, maybe a beer or two on the weekends, but I stopped a few years ago. Trying to be healthier, you know? Does that help?
DOCTOR: That is very good to hear. No smoking and limited past alcohol use. And now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Just… basic stuff, you know? Vitamins sometimes, but that’s it. I don’t like feeling all… medicated. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. No current medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Never had a reaction to anything. My ex-wife used to worry about stuff like that, but I’ve always been fine. Hopefully I didn't forget anything important. Can we get this over with now?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Putney. That’s a good start. Thank you for providing that information. Now, to complete the pre-insurance exam, I’d like to do a brief physical assessment. It will include checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and listening to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. Just let’s get it done. I've got things I need to be doing. Hope this doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you’d please have a seat on the examination table. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and keep it still. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Slightly elevated, but we can monitor that. Now I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Do you experience any dizziness or lightheadedness with changes in position?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes I feel a little off if I stand up too fast, but who doesn’t? I guess that’s just getting old. Nothing major, though. It doesn't happen often enough to worry about. Is that good enough? Is everything okay?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Occasional mild positional dizziness can be common. We’ll note that. Now, I’m going to quickly check your reflexes and a brief neurological exam. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Sensation is intact. No focal neurological deficits noted. Finally, I’m going to briefly examine your abdomen. Please lie back and relax. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds are normal. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Okay, Mr. Putney. That completes the physical examination. Everything appears within normal limits. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but we can monitor that over time. I'll order some routine blood work as part of the insurance requirements, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and lipid panel. This will give us a more complete picture of your overall health.
PATIENT: Okay, good. So, I’m done here, right? When will I get the results? I just need to give these people what they want so I can get this insurance policy. Hopefully it doesn’t take too long. I’ve got a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: Yes, that completes the examination. The lab work will be processed within the next 3-5 business days. I will have the results sent to your primary care physician and directly to the insurance company as required. You can also access the results through the patient portal online, if you would like. I will give you instructions on how to set that up before you leave. While the examination appears normal, I would recommend following up with a primary care physician for ongoing health management, especially given the slightly elevated blood pressure. Establishing a regular check-up schedule can help catch any potential health issues early. Do you have a primary care physician currently?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Like I said, my ex-wife used to handle all that stuff. I haven’t really needed a doctor in years. I just want to get this insurance, though. I'll just get the results sent wherever they need to go. I don't need a lecture about doctors, okay? Can we just finish up the paperwork? I've got to go.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. We can absolutely focus on getting the paperwork completed. I’ll prepare a summary of the exam findings and lab orders for you to take with you. Here is the summary of today's visit, as well as instructions on how to access the patient portal online. Please let me know if you have any questions about that. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that's everything. Thanks. I appreciate it… I guess. Just want to get this over with and go home. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Putney. I wish you a good day, and please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns.
