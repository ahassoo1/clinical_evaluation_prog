DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, well. It’s about my medication. The… blood thinner. I’ve been noticing a lot more bruising lately. Seems… excessive, even for being on this stuff. It's quite bothersome, really. I haven’t done anything to cause it, just… appearing.
DOCTOR: I understand. Bruising can certainly be concerning, especially when it’s unexpected. It’s good you brought this to my attention. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me which blood thinner you’re currently taking, and how long you’ve been on it?
PATIENT: It’s… Warfarin, I believe. Yes, Warfarin. And let me see… it’s been… oh, goodness. About seven years now, maybe a little longer. Since… well, since my wife passed. The doctor at the time put me on it. It was after the… incident. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to the details. It’s just a pill I take every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin for approximately seven years, following an incident. Thank you. I see here in your records it was prescribed after a deep vein thrombosis. And you said you haven't noticed any changes in your activity level or any new injuries that might explain the increased bruising?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I’m a fairly… sedentary man, if I’m honest. I used to enjoy gardening, but my knees… well, they aren’t what they used to be. Mostly, I read. And watch television. No falls, no bumps, nothing like that. It just appears. Like a bad watercolor painting, spreading across my arms and legs. It’s quite unsightly, frankly. And it worries me, naturally. Is it… dangerous?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson. Increased bruising can be worrying, and it's good you're paying attention to it. It can be a sign of something needing attention, though it’s not always serious. To help me determine what’s going on, let’s do a quick review of your other medications and any other medical conditions you have. Do you take any other prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hm. Let me think. Besides the Warfarin… I take something for my cholesterol. Atorvastatin, I believe. A small dose. And I take a multivitamin, just a standard one. Old habit, really. My daughter keeps telling me it’s pointless, but… well, I’ve been taking it for years. Nothing else, not that I recall. I try to avoid pills whenever possible. Too many already, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Atorvastatin for cholesterol and a daily multivitamin. Thank you. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu, or any bleeding anywhere else – nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had a bit of a cough last winter, a common cold, but nothing serious. And no, no bleeding anywhere else. My gums are perfectly fine, thankfully. I take very good care of my teeth. Always have. No, everything else is… normal, as normal as it gets for a man my age. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know if this bruising is something I need to worry about. Is the Warfarin… doing something it shouldn’t?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Farson. Increased bruising can be a sign that your Warfarin dose is a little too high, or that there’s some interaction happening with another medication, although it’s not always the case. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and then order a blood test to check your INR – that's the International Normalized Ratio – which measures how quickly your blood is clotting. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: The… INR? Goodness. All these numbers. Fine, yes, alright. A blood test. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I suppose I trust your judgment. I’ve always been a bit… skeptical of doctors, if I’m honest. Too much fuss over things that’ll sort themselves out. But, yes. A blood test. And an exam. Just… please be quick about it. I have a rather good book waiting for me. A first edition, you understand. Rather delicate.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I understand. We’ll be as efficient as possible. First, let’s just take a look at the bruising. Could you please roll up your sleeves and pant legs a bit so I can examine your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Very well. There. You can see for yourself. It's rather… unsightly, isn't it? Not what one expects at my age. More like an old plum than a respectable gentleman. And do be careful, please. My skin is rather sensitive.
DOCTOR: I see. There's bruising in various stages of healing, mostly on your forearms and lower legs. There doesn't appear to be any significant swelling or tenderness, which is good. The distribution does seem a bit more extensive than one might expect with just a routine Warfarin dose. I’m noting the location and size in your chart. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then we’ll head over to the lab for that INR test. It's a simple blood draw, shouldn’t take more than a few minutes.
PATIENT: Hmph. Very well. Though I still maintain this is likely nothing to worry about. My wife always said I bruise easily. A delicate constitution, she called it. Though I was perfectly capable of hard work, mind you. Just… prone to a bit of discoloration. Still, if you insist on all this… poking and prodding… I suppose I’ll cooperate. Just… be quick about it. And try not to make a mess. I dislike the smell of antiseptic. It’s quite… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Everything sounds clear, and your heart rate and rhythm are normal. Now, let’s head to the lab for that blood draw. It will be quick, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. I’ll make a note on the requisition form to use a small needle, and we’ll ensure they’re gentle. While we’re waiting for the results, do you have any other concerns you’d like to discuss today?
PATIENT: No, no. Just this. The bruising. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve wasted a perfectly good morning on this nonsense. A first edition Agatha Christie awaits. And I had a rather promising cup of coffee cooling. Let's just get this over with, shall we? The sooner I can return to my book, the better. And please, tell them to be careful. I really dislike needles. It's a… childhood aversion, you understand. A rather unpleasant experience involving a particularly clumsy nurse.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I understand. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'll personally speak with the phlebotomist to ensure a smooth experience. Let’s go ahead and head to the lab. It’s just down the hall. And perhaps, once we have the results, we can discuss a plan to get you back to enjoying your book and your coffee.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I highly doubt a simple blood test will reveal anything of significance. It’s probably just… old age. And a delicate constitution. Honestly, the fuss people make these days… it’s quite extraordinary. Now, let’s get this over with. The sooner I’m back home, the better. .
