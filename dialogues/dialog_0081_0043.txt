DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head, feelin’ like a tight band. It’s been botherin’ me for… oh, maybe a week now? Not constant, comes and goes. It’s not the worst pain, but it’s… persistent, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. A week, you say. And you describe it as a tight band at the back of the head, intermittent. I see. Can you tell me a little more about when it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Well, it doesn't seem to have a real pattern. Sometimes it’s there when I wake up, sometimes in the afternoon, sometimes when I’m… just sittin’ and readin’. I haven’t noticed anything specific that causes it, if that makes sense. I used to think maybe it was the sun, 'cause I like gardenin', but it happens even on cloudy days. I haven’t hit my head or anything, not recently anyway. Old man things happen all the time, though!
DOCTOR: Old man things, yes. Well, we need to rule out anything serious. When you say "not the worst pain," can you give me a number, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale, huh? Hmm… let me think. It’s definitely not a ten, not even close. Probably… a four? Maybe a five on a bad day. It’s more… annoying than debilitating, if you get my drift. I can still do things, still garden, still visit with my grandkids. It just makes me feel… a little off, a little tired. I used to be able to work all day without a problem, but these days… well, things change.
DOCTOR: A four to five, intermittent, no clear triggers… Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me see… Not really. No dizziness, no blurry vision. I haven’t been feelin’ nauseous or anything. Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, but I think that’s just from sleepin’ in a funny position. Oh! And I've been a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just my age catchin' up to me. Does that make sense? I try to remember everything, but sometimes… things slip.
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Gibbel. It’s good you're trying to recall details. Now, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… but nothing serious. I used to have high blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor put me on somethin’ for it and it went away. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, I don’t even remember. Probably five, maybe ten years? I try to stay healthy, eat my vegetables, get some exercise. I don’t really like goin’ to doctors unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, past history of hypertension, now resolved. Long interval since last checkup… Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter things like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothin’ regular. I used to take somethin' for my knees, but that was years ago, when I was still workin’. Now I just try to take it easy. I might take an aspirin now and then if I got a bad ache, but that's about it. No vitamins, no nothin’ like that. I try to get everything from my food, you know? My wife used to always say I needed to take somethin', but… well, she’s gone now.
DOCTOR: I see. My condolences for your loss, Mr. Gibbel. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It's been a while, but… I get by. Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything over the years without a problem. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I get stung by a bee in the garden, but that's about it. Nothing serious enough to worry about. My wife always said I had a cast-iron stomach!
DOCTOR: Cast-iron stomach… Very well. Now, just to complete the picture, let's do a brief physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a quick neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I haven't had one of those in ages, so… I'm sure I'm a mess! But go ahead, do what you gotta do. I'll just sit here and try not to fidget.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Cranial nerves are intact. No obvious focal neurological deficits. Neck is slightly stiff to palpation, with mild tenderness in the posterior cervical muscles. Your neurological exam is largely normal, but the neck stiffness is notable.
PATIENT: Hmm. Neck stiffness… that doesn’t surprise me. Probably just from sleepin’ wrong. I always toss and turn, never stay in one position for long. But good to know it’s not somethin’ serious. So, what do you think is causin’ this headache, Doctor? Is it somethin’ I should be worryin’ about?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Gibbel, given your history and the examination findings, the most likely cause is tension headache, possibly exacerbated by some mild muscle strain in your neck. However, given your age and the recent onset of symptoms, and without a recent medical checkup, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to get a baseline. We should also consider a CT scan of the head to rule out any structural issues, though I don’t believe that’s likely. This is a precautionary measure, understand?
PATIENT: A CT scan… Oh dear. That sounds… serious. I haven’t had one of those before. Is it… is it expensive? And will it take long? I don't like bein' poked and prodded, and I'm on a fixed income, you know? I just want to know if it’s somethin’ I should be really worried about. A simple headache, that’s all it started as.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gibbel. A CT scan is a standard imaging procedure, and while it's not without risks, it's generally very safe. It's the most effective way to rule out more serious causes of your headache. As for the cost… I’m aware you are uninsured. Our billing department will work with you to explore options for financial assistance. We can also look into community resources that may help cover the cost. It will take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete the scan itself. It's painless, though you will need to lie still inside the scanner. I want to be clear: I do not believe this is anything life-threatening, but we need to be thorough. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially given your age and lack of recent medical care. We’ll get the results back quickly, usually within a few hours. For now, I recommend taking over-the-counter ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the pain, and I’ll write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help with the neck stiffness. I will also provide you with a referral to a neurologist for a follow-up appointment once we have the results from the CT scan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… a little better, knowing you don't think it's serious. Financial assistance would be a huge help, thank you. And muscle relaxants… maybe that'll help me sleep better. I haven't been sleepin' well lately. A neurologist, huh? I haven’t seen a specialist in… goodness, decades. Okay, yes. Let's do it. The scan, the muscle relaxants, the neurologist… Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again. When can I schedule the scan? And could you please explain again how the billing will work? I just get so confused with all that paperwork.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, schedule the CT scan for you this afternoon. She will also provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the scan. She's very good at explaining things. Regarding billing, Sarah will connect you with our financial counselor, Ms. Ramirez, who will review your options and assist you with any necessary paperwork. She can explore potential discounts, payment plans, or assistance programs available to uninsured patients. She’ll need some basic financial information from you, but she is very discreet and will explain everything clearly. We will also need a copy of your insurance information, even if you are currently uninsured, to determine eligibility for any potential programs. It’s important to note that we will not proceed with the scan until we have a clear understanding of the cost and your ability to pay. I’m writing you a prescription for cyclobenzaprine 10mg, take one tablet at bedtime for the muscle stiffness. Avoid alcohol while taking this medication, and be aware it may cause drowsiness. Finally, I'll give you a referral to Dr. Chen, a neurologist in the city. He's excellent. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Paulino. You’ve been very patient with me, and you explained everything so well. I appreciate it. I'm still a little worried, but I feel better knowing we're taking care of it. Please tell Sarah I'm ready when she's ready. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gibbel. I’ll inform Sarah you're ready. And you’re welcome. It’s my job. We’ll get this sorted out. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any further questions or concerns. .
