DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Vantine, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s me. Randolph Vantine. Though, everyone just calls me Van. It’s… nice to meet you, Doctor… uh?
DOCTOR: Murtic. Dr. Milan Murtic. And please, just stick with Mr. Vantine. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, right, Doctor Murtic. Sorry, my mind… it goes sometimes. Well, it’s this… sighing. I do a lot of it lately. Deep breaths, too. Not painful, just… heavy. My daughter, she worries, you see. She said I should come get it checked. I don't really feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… tired, maybe?
DOCTOR: Sighing and… tiredness. Right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. A while, I think. Maybe… a few months? It comes and goes. Some days I barely notice it, other days… well, like today. I mostly just sit and… do it, I suppose. It’s hard to say exactly when it started. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. Everything feels a bit… blurry.
DOCTOR: Blurry. And is this sighing… constant when you're feeling this "blurriness," or does it happen at other times as well?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think it's… worse when I feel a bit lost in my thoughts, you know? When I'm just… sitting and remembering things. Old things. Not always happy things, sometimes sad. The sighing comes with that, I think. But it happens other times too, like when I’m walking up the stairs, or even just watching television. It’s not always tied to the remembering, but… a lot of the time, it is. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s… vague. And you said tiredness. Is this a new level of tiredness, or have you always been prone to fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. New, I think. I’ve always been… not a bundle of energy, you see. But this is… different. It’s more than just needing a nap. It’s like… a weight. A heaviness that doesn’t go away, even after I rest. It’s hard to explain. Like the air is thicker, if that makes sense. And it makes the sighing worse, I think. I just feel… drained. A lot of the time. It’s not painful, just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. My appetite… isn’t what it used to be. I don’t really feel hungry much anymore. But I eat a little, just enough. And sometimes… my hands tremble a bit. Not all the time, just… occasionally. When I'm trying to do something small, like button my shirt. Nothing major, really. Just… little things. Oh! And sometimes I feel a little… dizzy when I stand up too quickly. Is that a symptom? I don’t know anymore… everything feels so… muddled.
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite, tremors, dizziness… Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, my… well, Doctor, that’s… a personal question, isn’t it? I… I suppose they’ve been a little… irregular. Not a big problem, just… not as regular as they used to be. A little… looser, sometimes. And… well, less often. Is that… is that bad? I really don’t know what’s normal anymore. I’m sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I? I just… forget things. Everything feels so distant now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No… not really. Well, sometimes I take something for my knees, when they bother me. But that's just an over-the-counter pain reliever. Nothing regularly, no. My daughter… she offered me something for my blood pressure a while back, but I didn’t like how it made me feel, so I stopped taking it. I don't really like taking pills, if I can help it. I prefer to just… rest. Although, as I said, that doesn’t seem to be helping much lately.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of, no. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. I used to eat all sorts of things when I was younger, traveling through Cambodia… all sorts of fruits and spices. Never had a problem. My daughter always asks me about allergies, but I always tell her, no, nothing. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Although… sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I’m out in the sun, but that’s just a little rash, really. Nothing serious. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment. Just… try not to startle me, alright? My nerves aren’t what they used to be. And please, don’t mind if I… sigh a little. It just happens sometimes, you see. I'll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Good. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Heart sounds are… regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear, but there’s some decreased breath sound in the bases bilaterally. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little low – 110/70. Pulse is regular but somewhat weak. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Bowel sounds are… diminished. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are… slightly diminished, but within normal limits. Finally, let’s just take a quick look at your hands and feet. Skin is dry and slightly cool. Some mild tremor in the hands.
PATIENT: Oh. Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem… serious. I told you, I’m not very good at explaining things. I just feel… tired and heavy. And I sigh a lot. Is that… bad? Please tell me it's nothing serious. My daughter… she worries so much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Your symptoms are… vague, but concerning. The diminished heart sounds, low blood pressure, diminished bowel sounds, and slightly diminished reflexes… along with the fatigue, tremors, and weight loss… suggest several possibilities. It’s too early to say definitively, but we need to rule out a few things. Given your age and symptoms, we need to consider the possibility of something cardiac-related, possibly mild heart failure. The weight loss and decreased appetite are also concerning. We also need to rule out any underlying neurological condition. I’m going to order some blood work to check your electrolytes, kidney function, thyroid levels, and a complete blood count. I also want you to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm and an echocardiogram to assess your heart function. Finally, I think it would be wise to get a CT scan of your head to rule out any neurological issues.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. And expensive, doesn’t it? I… I don’t have much money, Doctor. I’m a retired police officer, you see. My pension doesn’t stretch very far. And I’m… not insured. Is there… anything else we can do? Maybe just some rest? Or some vitamins? I don't want to be a burden. And I really don’t want to worry my daughter. She already does too much.
DOCTOR: Rest and vitamins aren’t going to address these underlying issues, Mr. Vantine. And while I understand your financial concerns, these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. I can write a letter to the hospital explaining your situation, and they may be able to offer some financial assistance. However, I cannot provide medical care without proper diagnostic testing. Given your lack of insurance, I would recommend contacting the county hospital. They often have programs for low-income patients. I can provide you with their contact information. Until we have the results of these tests, I recommend you avoid strenuous activity and eat a light, easily digestible diet. I’m also going to prescribe you a low-dose multivitamin and a stool softener to address the constipation. Here's the referral information for the county hospital, and the prescriptions. I’ll also have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for when the test results are available.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate your help. It’s just… a lot to take in. And I worry about the hospital. They can be… overwhelming. My daughter… she’s good with things like this. She can help me navigate it all. I’ll call her as soon as I get home. Is there… anything else I should be doing? Anything at all? Or anything I should be watching out for? Something that would mean I need to come back sooner?
DOCTOR: If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, severe dizziness, weakness on one side of your body, or any changes in your mental status, go to the emergency room immediately. Do not wait for a follow-up appointment. Otherwise, just follow the instructions I’ve given you and keep your follow-up appointments. I have other patients waiting, Mr. Vantine. If you have any questions, you can call the office. Good day.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Good day to you too, Doctor. Thank you… for everything. I… I hope it's nothing serious. .
