DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you're 87 years young. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 87 this year, if you believe it! Well, to be frank, I feel...a little bit worn out. Not sick, you understand. Just…not as lively as I used to be. I’m hoping you can help me get a bit of a “reset”, a jumpstart, to feeling better. Like a tune-up for the body, perhaps?
DOCTOR: A “tune-up,” alright. I understand. Feeling generally fatigued, less energy than usual… that’s a common complaint, certainly. To get a better understanding, could you describe what you mean by “worn out”?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s hard to explain precisely. It’s not a pain, not a specific ache. More like…everything takes a little more effort. Getting up from a chair, walking to the mailbox, even just concentrating on the television. I used to be quite the gardener, you know. Beautiful hibiscus. But lately… I don’t have the oomph to do it anymore. And my memory… well, it isn’t what it used to be, though I wouldn’t say it’s terrible. Just…slippery sometimes. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It does, actually. A general decline in energy and stamina, coupled with some cognitive difficulties… We'll need to explore this a little further. Now, has this been a sudden change, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely gradually. It wasn’t like I woke up one morning feeling this way. It’s been…well, a year, maybe more. Hard to say precisely. It crept up on me, little by little. I just kept thinking it was the heat, or getting older, or…well, life, you know? But it’s starting to bother me now. I want to enjoy my years, not just…exist.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good you’re addressing it now. Now, Ms. McNabb, let’s delve into your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes, Doctor. A long time ago. The doctor put me on medication for it, and I’ve been taking it regularly ever since, as prescribed. And…arthritis, yes. In my hands, mostly. It flares up sometimes, especially when it’s damp. Other than that… nothing major that I recall. I’ve been quite lucky, really. A few colds, a touch of the flu, but nothing serious. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… Just this, Doctor. The blood pressure pill, of course. And…oh, yes. A Vitamin D supplement. The nurse at the senior center recommended it. Said a lot of us don’t get enough sunshine. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis when it’s really bothering me. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. But not every day, just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, actually. A long time ago, when I was younger. I had my gallbladder removed. And… I had a hysterectomy, too. A very long time ago. That's all, I believe. Nothing else that I can recall. It was a while back, you see. A different lifetime almost.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. McNabb, a sensitive question, if you don't mind. Can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history…that’s a tricky one. My mother…she lived a long life, thankfully. But she had…well, she had some heart trouble toward the end. And my father…he had diabetes, I believe. And his mother… she suffered from memory problems when she got older. Not Alzheimer’s, I don’t think, but…just forgetful. It runs in the family, I suppose. It’s not a very cheerful topic, is it? But I understand it’s important.
DOCTOR: It is important, and you’re right, it’s not always cheerful. Thank you for sharing that. Now, one last set of questions, before we move onto a quick physical exam. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, you say? Well, at my age, it’s not terribly exciting! I live alone, in my own home. I have a lovely garden, as I mentioned. I enjoy reading, mostly. And watching the news. I try to stay active, but it’s harder these days. I go for short walks, when the weather is nice. And I attend the senior center a couple of times a week, for lunch and activities. I don't smoke, never have. And I don’t drink alcohol, either. Just tea, mostly. A quiet life, really. But a happy one.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Ms. McNabb, that gives me a good overview. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so, given your history. Now, let's listen to your heart… Heart sounds are regular, with a slight murmur. Not concerning at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear… Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. And finally, just a quick balance test… Balance is a little unsteady, but within normal limits for your age. No immediate concerns there. Alright, Ms. McNabb. Everything seems relatively normal, given your age and medical history. However, the fatigue and memory concerns are worth investigating further. I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a vitamin B12 level, and a comprehensive metabolic panel – to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Blood work… very well. Anything that might help. Yes, please do. I want to get to the bottom of this, and figure out what’s going on. And if you think there’s anything else, please don’t hesitate. I trust your judgment entirely.
DOCTOR: Very good. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood samples now. They'll explain the process. While we wait for the results, it would also be beneficial to schedule a cognitive assessment with our neurologist, Dr. Ramirez. She can perform a more thorough evaluation of your memory and cognitive function. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds wise. A cognitive assessment… yes, I would like that very much. It's good to be thorough, as you say. Dr. Ramirez… when would that be possible? I’m fairly flexible, though I do have my senior center activities on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
DOCTOR: Let me see… Dr. Ramirez has an opening next Wednesday at 10:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Wednesday at 10:00 AM would be perfect. That gives me time to prepare myself, I suppose. Although, I'm not quite sure how one prepares for a memory test! But yes, Wednesday at 10:00 AM is good. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve scheduled you for an appointment with Dr. Ramirez next Wednesday at 10:00 AM. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss a plan of action. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I feel much better knowing that we're getting to the bottom of this. Thank you again. I suppose I'll let you get back to your other patients.
DOCTOR: Of course. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. McNabb. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And remember, we'll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day.
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you for everything. I’m sure everything will be alright. Have a good day to you, too. .
