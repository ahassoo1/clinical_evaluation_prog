DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, my wife, she said I need to get some papers… for work, I think? Something about time off? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I'm Ronnald, by the way. Nice to meet you. I work with… religious things. And education. At the church.
DOCTOR: Right. Religious things and education… at the church. And paperwork for time off. Okay. Well, to get things sorted, let’s focus on why you might need time off. Are you experiencing any health issues at all?
PATIENT: Health issues… hmm. Not that I’ve really noticed. I get tired, I guess. But everyone gets tired, right? My knees ache a bit sometimes, when it’s cold, but that’s just old age, I suppose. I don't really… feel sick, if that makes sense. It’s more… just being worn out, I think. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: "Worn out." Right. And how long has this… wearing out been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that's a good question. A while, now. Maybe… six months? A year? It comes and goes, you know? Some days I feel alright, and some days… well, like I could just sleep for a week. It’s hard to pinpoint, honestly. My wife keeps track of things better than I do. She's the organized one.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. And are there any specific things that make this tiredness worse?
PATIENT: Specific things… Let me think. Well, after church services, definitely. Those can be… long. And if I’ve been doing a lot of… yard work, that always knocks me out. But even just regular days, sometimes I wake up feeling tired, and I don’t know why. It’s just… there. Does that make any sense? I don't mean to be vague.
DOCTOR: Alright, exertion exacerbates it. And it's somewhat unpredictable. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I get a bit… forgetful sometimes, if that counts. My wife says I ask the same questions twice. But that's just me getting older, isn’t it? I haven't been coughing or anything, or feeling feverish. Just… tired. And a little bit… out of it, maybe. Like I’m not quite as sharp as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Forgetfulness… and generally feeling “out of it.” Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. I think I’m eating a little less, maybe. Not much, though. My wife does most of the cooking, so I don’t really keep track. And weight… I haven’t stepped on the scale in ages. I’m pretty thin, always have been. Don’t think I’ve lost any weight, but I couldn’t say for sure. She would know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… That's a tough one. Let me see. I had… something with my knee, years ago. When I was younger, playing sports. Needed some… physical therapy. And I think I had the flu a couple of times. Nothing serious, though. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I can’t really remember anything major. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Alright. Knee injury and occasional flu. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I don’t think so. No, definitely not. I’ve always been lucky enough to avoid needing surgery. My wife would remember if I’d had surgery, wouldn't she? She keeps track of all that. I'm pretty sure. No, no surgeries.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's… complicated. My mother… she had some kind of heart trouble, I think. When she was older. And my father, he… well, he worked really hard all his life. I don’t really know much about their medical history, to be honest. We didn’t really talk about those things much. Lots of siblings, too. Hard to keep track of everyone’s ailments. It’s all a bit fuzzy. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Alright. Minimal information regarding family history. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never have been a fan of taking pills. Just a little bit of something for my knees when they really bother me. Over-the-counter stuff. Nothing prescribed. I believe in… natural remedies, mostly. And a good night’s sleep, when I can get it. My wife keeps telling me I need to see a doctor more often, but I always put it off.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. Just to get a baseline. Could you please step up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. If you think so, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. My knees aren’t what they used to be, as you can probably tell. Be careful, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Reflexes are… diminished, but present. Strength is… adequate. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Not terrible. Alright. Everything seems… within normal limits, considering your age.
PATIENT: Within normal limits, huh? That's good to hear, I suppose. But I still feel tired all the time. And forgetful. What do you think is going on, Doctor? And about those papers… will I be able to get them? For work? My wife is really counting on me getting this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Limtiaco, based on the limited information and preliminary exam, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific cause for your fatigue and cognitive changes. It could be related to age-related decline, mild stress, or even a nutritional deficiency. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not concerning enough to warrant immediate treatment. However, to rule out any underlying medical conditions, I recommend a few basic blood tests: a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. Also, I think it would be prudent to get an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. As for the papers for work… I can fill out a basic form stating you were seen today for evaluation of fatigue. However, I can’t guarantee it will be sufficient. It depends on your employer’s requirements. The lab results will give us a clearer picture, and then we can discuss further options. Do you agree to the blood tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an EKG? That sounds… complicated. And expensive, I imagine. I don’t know, Doctor. It all sounds a bit much. I just want to feel better, and get back to work. Is it really necessary? And will these tests tell us why I’m so tired? My wife is going to want all this done, I just know it. Can't you just write something on a paper and say I'm tired and need to take some time off? I don't want to put my wife through all this trouble and expense. I just… need a break, I think. And those papers.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, while I understand your reluctance, it’s my professional responsibility to thoroughly investigate your symptoms. Simply stating you are “tired” on a form is not adequate medical documentation, and frankly, it doesn't address the underlying cause of your fatigue. We need to rule out serious conditions such as anemia, thyroid problems, or even early signs of heart disease. I can write a note stating you were evaluated for fatigue and are currently undergoing testing. However, without the results, your employer may require further documentation. If you absolutely refuse the tests, I will document your refusal in your chart. However, I strongly advise against it. The tests are relatively inexpensive and can provide valuable information. Frankly, it sounds like you might benefit from a referral to a specialist – a geriatrician, perhaps. They are better equipped to manage the complexities of age-related health concerns. But that, of course, would require even more expense and time. So, do you consent to the blood tests and EKG, or would you prefer a referral to a specialist?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is all a bit much. A geriatrician? More expense? My wife… she'll be very upset. I... I suppose if you really think it’s necessary, Doctor. Just... please don't make it too complicated. And can you keep the cost down as much as possible? I don't want to burden my wife with a huge bill. Okay, fine. Do the tests. And then, maybe, we can just write a simple paper saying I'm tired and need to take some time off? Please? Just get me the papers. That's all I really want. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Very well. I will order the blood tests and EKG. The lab is located just down the hall. They will take your insurance information and bill accordingly. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today to discuss the results. I can write a basic note stating you were evaluated for fatigue and are currently undergoing further testing. It will not be a guarantee of time off, but it may be sufficient for your employer. Here are the requisitions for the lab tests. And this is the form for your employer. I'll need you to sign this release so I can share the results with them, if requested. The lab technician will explain the process. You'll need to fast for eight hours before the blood draw. And please, try to get some rest. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Fast for eight hours… eight hours! Oh dear. That’s going to be difficult. No, I don’t think so. I just… I hope these tests aren't too expensive. And I hope they find something out. My wife is going to want to know all the details. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I think… I think I’ll just go and see the lab technician now.
DOCTOR: Very well.
