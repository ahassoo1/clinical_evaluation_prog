DOCTOR: Right, okay. Jaxston, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Jaxston Lawther. It's… a bit of a mouthful, I guess. Sorry, I don't really… keep track of things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Don't you worry about it, son. Happens to the best of us. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s these headaches, see? They come on pretty strong, and I get really sweaty when they do. And my heart… it kinda feels like it’s racing. It’s happened a few times now, and it’s starting to worry me. Honestly, I can't really remember when it started, exactly. Just… recently, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, sweating, racing heart… recently. Right. Can you tell me a little more about the headaches?
PATIENT: Um… they're not like, a dull ache. It's more… a pounding, right behind my eyes. And it feels like it goes all the way to the back of my neck, sometimes. It’s hard to explain. And it’s usually on both sides, I think? Or maybe just one? I honestly get confused about that part. They last… a while. Hours, maybe? I’ve taken some paracetamol, but it doesn't really do much.
DOCTOR: Pounding, behind the eyes, radiating to the neck… both sides, lasting hours. Paracetamol doesn’t help much. Alright. And when these headaches come on… is there anything that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: That's a good question… I really haven't noticed anything, to be honest. It just… happens. I've been working pretty steady lately, down at the… uh, the factory. But nothing different than usual, really. Stressful job, I suppose, but it always is. I don't know if that's it? I can't really pinpoint anything. It feels kinda random.
DOCTOR: Okay. Random onset, associated with a stressful job… Alright. And, uh, any other symptoms with these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit… dizzy, yeah. And a little nauseous, like I might be sick, but I never actually am. And… sometimes everything looks kinda blurry for a bit. Not all the time, just when the headache's really bad. Does that make sense? I feel a bit all over the place, honestly. It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Dizziness, nausea, blurry vision… associated with severe headache. Okay. Now, let’s go through some general health questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. I mean, I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football. But that was ages ago. I haven't really been to the doctor much, to be honest. I usually just try to tough things out. I don’t really… remember being seriously ill or anything. I got divorced a couple of years ago, but that wasn’t a health thing, obviously. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Broken arm as a child, otherwise generally healthy… divorce a couple of years ago. Right. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Nothing like that. Just the broken arm, and they just put it in a cast. Nothing fancy. I… really haven't had much luck with hospitals or doctors, if that makes sense. I just try to avoid them if I can. It’s not that I’m scared, exactly, just… not a fan, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Um… my dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mum… she had some trouble with her heart when she got older. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. They’re both… well, they're both gone now. It was a while ago. I don’t really know much about their medical history, to be honest. We weren't very close, and I never really asked. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure in your father, some heart trouble in your mother. I’m sorry to hear that. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Like I said, I don't really take anything. Just the paracetamol for the headaches, when they happen, and that doesn't even help much. I haven't got insurance, so I try to avoid going to the doctor unless it's really bad. It's expensive, you know?
DOCTOR: No current medications, no insurance. Right. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. I hope it doesn't take too long, though. I've got to get back to work later, you know? But yeah, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table for me, that’d be great. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly elevated rate. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Blood pressure is 150/90. A little high. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious neurological deficits. Neck is supple, no masses palpated. Alright. Everything seems… normal, but your heart rate and blood pressure are elevated. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. Tried it once or twice when I was younger, didn’t like it. Not really my thing. I do drink, sometimes. A few beers on the weekend, mostly. Nothing too heavy. I try not to overdo it, you know? Work keeps me pretty tired, so I don’t usually bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, doesn’t smoke, occasional alcohol use. And what about your work?
PATIENT: It’s… it’s in the factory, down the road. I do general labour, mostly. Lifting, moving things, that sort of stuff. It’s pretty physical work. Long hours, though. And it can be quite stressful, sometimes. The boss… isn’t the nicest guy. It’s a job, you know? Pays the bills. But it’s not exactly enjoyable. I've been doing it for a few years now. Honestly, I'm kinda burnt out.
DOCTOR: Physical job, long hours, stressful environment…Alright. Now, considering your symptoms and what you’ve told me, it's difficult to say definitively what's going on. The headaches, sweating, racing heart… and elevated blood pressure… it could be related to stress, or possibly even anxiety. But we need to rule out other things. I'd like to order some blood work, just to check your general health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. And, given your blood pressure, I’d also like to monitor it over the next few days. Would you be able to come back in a week for a follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Blood work… yeah, I guess so. Is it going to be expensive? I don’t really have much money, like I said. And a follow-up… I can try, but it depends on work. I might have to take a day off, and I can’t really afford to lose the pay. Is there anything else I need to do? I’m kinda worried now, if I’m honest. What are we looking for, exactly? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. The blood work will check things like your kidney function, liver function, and thyroid levels. It’ll also rule out things like anemia. As for your blood pressure, we're looking for signs of hypertension, which can lead to more serious problems if left untreated. I can give you a prescription for a blood pressure monitor to use at home. It'll give us a better idea of what your readings are throughout the day. And I can write you a note for work, explaining that you need to come in for follow-up appointments. As for the cost of the blood work, let me see if we can find a more affordable lab option. There's a clinic a few towns over that offers reduced rates for uninsured patients. I'll write down the information for you. If your symptoms worsen—if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Chest pain, shortness of breath… I understand. And the reduced rates… that’s good. Thank you. I appreciate that. It’s just… I hate going to doctors. It always feels like something’s wrong, and I get all worked up about it. I just want to feel normal again, you know? But I’ll try to get the blood work done, and I’ll use the monitor. When should I start taking my blood pressure? And what numbers am I looking for? I don’t really understand all this medical stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Start taking your blood pressure twice a day – once in the morning and once in the evening. Sit quietly for five minutes before taking each reading. You're looking for numbers below 140/90. If your readings are consistently above that, it’s important to let me know. I’ll give you a sheet with instructions on how to properly use the monitor. The important thing is to monitor your symptoms and keep me informed. We'll work through this together. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you for being patient with me. And for explaining things so clearly. I really appreciate it. I’ll try to get the blood work done as soon as possible, and I'll start monitoring my blood pressure. I guess… I’ll see you in a week, then? Hopefully, everything will be alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. You take care of yourself, Jaxston. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your next appointment. We’ll see what the blood work says, and go from there. Bye now.
