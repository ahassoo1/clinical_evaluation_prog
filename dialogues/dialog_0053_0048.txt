DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I’m Dr. Pitmon. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my head. Been a bit off lately. Not remembering things, getting… mixed up. My wife, she’s the one who really noticed, kept saying I was repeating myself. She finally insisted I come see someone. Not that I thought it was a problem, you understand. Just… a little forgetful, that’s all.
DOCTOR: <stage>I raise an eyebrow slightly, making a note on my tablet. “A little forgetful,” he says. Women always notice these things first, don't they?
PATIENT: Can you be more specific? What kind of things are you forgetting? And how long has this been going on? I mean, I tile houses, Doctor. I remember every single cut, every grout line. It's not like I'm losing track of work. It’s just… other things. Small things, mostly. Names, where I put my glasses… things like that. Maybe a month or so, but honestly, it’s hard to say exactly. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Right. “Small things.” And has this been interfering with your daily life at all?
PATIENT: Interfering? Well, no, not exactly interfering. Annoying, yes. My wife gets upset when I ask the same question twice in five minutes. She says it's rude. I tell her she worries too much. But I suppose… I did get lost on the way to the hardware store last week. Only for a bit, though. Found my way back eventually. It’s not like I was wandering around for days, Doctor. I still know my way around town. It’s just… a blip. A momentary lapse, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the memory issues?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a little… tired, I suppose. Not sick tired, just… weary. And my wife says I’ve been more irritable. Which is ridiculous, she’s the one making a mountain out of a molehill! Honestly, Doctor, I think she just likes to have something to complain about. But… now that you mention it, I have been tripping over things a bit more lately. Nothing major, just clumsy. Old age, probably. Though I still walk a good, straight line. I just… I don’t know. It's hard to explain. Everything feels… off, just a little. Like something's not quite right, but I can’t put my finger on it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Well, I haven’t been sick much, thankfully. Good genes, I reckon. Had my share of aches and pains from all the tiling, naturally. Back trouble, mostly. Had it looked at a few times, nothing serious. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago, but I take a pill for that. Keeps it under control. Nothing else, really. I don’t go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. Waste of time, most of it. My wife drags me in here whenever she gets worried about something. I've been perfectly healthy my whole life. Still am, for that matter. Just a little forgetful, that's all. Sheesh. You'd think I was on my deathbed, the way she carries on.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think. Yes, actually. Years ago, I had my appendix out. When I was a young man, living in Cambodia. That was a long time ago, before we came to this country. And… oh, yes. I had a knee replacement about ten years ago. The left one. Tiling is hard on the knees, you know. Other than that… no. Nothing else. I try to avoid doctors and hospitals whenever possible. They just poke and prod and tell you things you don't want to hear. And then they charge you a fortune. It's a racket, if you ask me. Though, my wife, she insists on all sorts of check-ups. Drives me crazy, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a tough one, Doctor. Most of my family is still back in Cambodia. Haven't seen them in years, not since we left. My father, he lived to be a good age, I think. Maybe in his eighties. He was a farmer. My mother… she passed away when I was young, I don’t remember much about her. As for illnesses… I don't really know. We didn't talk about that much, back then. They didn't have good doctors or hospitals, you understand. Not like here. My wife’s family, they've had some heart trouble, I think. And her aunt had something… dementia, maybe? I don't know the details. She just… forgot things. Like my wife says I do now. See? Everything always comes back to that. Honestly, Doctor, I just don't know much about family history. It’s not something we talked about.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? I live here, in town. With my wife. I work. I tile houses. What else is there to know? I don’t go out much. Not my kind of thing. I used to fish, years ago, but my knees don't allow for it anymore. I don’t drink much, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. Never smoked. I don't gamble. I go to the temple when I can. Mostly, I just keep to myself. I'm not much for socializing, if that's what you mean. A quiet life is a good life, Doctor. That’s what I always say. And honestly, I've got no time for frivolous things. Too much work to be done. You know? A good tile job doesn’t install itself.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I know of. I eat everything. Never had a reaction to anything. Tried all sorts of things over the years. Spicy food, exotic fruits… nothing bothers me. And medications… I just take the pill for my blood pressure. Never had any problems with it. My wife always asks me that question, too. “Are you allergic to anything, Colt?” She worries about everything, that woman. Honestly, Doctor, I think she just likes to hear herself talk. No allergies. Never had them. A perfectly healthy man, that’s what I am. Just a little forgetful, that’s all. It’s getting rather tiresome, repeating myself over and over. Can we move on to something else now? I’ve got work to get back to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better understanding of your overall health. We'll check your reflexes, balance, and do a brief cognitive assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Cognitive assessment? What's that? You mean like a test? Is this going to take long? I’ve got a job to finish, Doctor. People are waiting. And what does my balance have to do with forgetting things? I still walk perfectly straight, as I told you. Honestly, I don't see the point. But… alright. If you insist. Just get it over with quickly, please. I haven’t got all day. And no poking and prodding, understand? I don’t like that. A quick look, that’s all. Just a quick look. And tell me what you find, right away. Don't leave me waiting for results. I need to get back to work. This is a waste of time, frankly, but my wife… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just follow my instructions. First, I'll check your vital signs. Blood pressure, pulse… things like that. Then we’ll do a quick neurological exam. Just some simple tests to assess your reflexes and coordination. Finally, I’ll ask you a few questions. Just to get a sense of your memory and cognitive function. It shouldn’t take long. Now, if you could sit here for me… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not surprising. Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and follow my finger. Don’t move your head. Slight tremor in the left hand. And some difficulty with smooth pursuit.
PATIENT: This is ridiculous, Doctor. I told you I’m perfectly fine. My hands are just… tired. From all the tiling, you understand. It’s hard work. And my eyes aren’t what they used to be. I need new glasses, that’s all. My wife keeps telling me. But I don’t want new glasses. I like my old ones. They’re comfortable. Honestly, Doctor, I’m wasting my time here. I could be installing a beautiful backsplash right now. Are you done yet? This is making me anxious. I don't like being poked and prodded. Just tell me what you find, right away. Don't make me wait. And please, stop moving your finger so quickly. It’s making me dizzy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. Just to assess your memory. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? Hmm. Let me think… It's… August, isn't it? August… the second? Yes, the second of August. 2025. I think. Yes, definitely August the second, 2025. I remember. I always keep track of the date. Important for work, you know. Scheduling, deliveries… things like that. Though, my wife, she's the one who usually reminds me. But I remember. Yes, definitely August the second, 2025. See? I told you I'm perfectly fine. A little forgetful, maybe, but perfectly fine. Is that what you wanted to hear? Can we be done now? This is getting very tiresome.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me the names of three objects I’m going to name?
PATIENT: Three objects? What objects? You haven't named any objects yet, Doctor. This is… confusing. Are you trying to trick me? I don't like tricks. Just tell me the objects, and I'll tell you their names. I'm a perfectly rational man. I can remember anything, as long as you tell me what it is. Honestly, this is ridiculous. My wife always says I have a good memory. A photographic memory, she says. But you have to tell me the objects first. Otherwise, how can I possibly know their names? This is a waste of time, frankly. A complete waste of time. Just name the objects, Doctor. Please. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I apologize for the confusion. Let's try this. I’m going to name three objects, and then I’ll ask you to repeat them back to me. After a short delay, I’ll ask you to recall them again. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Name the objects, and I'll repeat them. But I'm telling you now, if they're complicated objects, I won't remember them. I’m a tile setter, not a scholar. And don't expect me to spell them or anything. Just simple objects, please. And make it quick. I haven't got all day. Honestly, this is… humiliating. But my wife would kill me if I didn’t cooperate. So, go ahead. Name the objects. And get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Can you repeat those three objects back to me?
PATIENT: Pen… hmm… Apple… yes, Apple… and… and… the other one… Oh dear. It was… something you sit at… a… a… desk? No, that’s not right. It was… a… a flat thing… with legs… Oh, I can’t remember! It’s on the tip of my tongue! It’s something you put things on… A… a… shelf? No, no. This is ridiculous! I had it just a moment ago! A… something you eat on? No… . I… I can’t remember. It’s gone! It’s just… gone! See? I told you I was forgetting things. This proves it! This is awful! This is… this is… humiliating! . I can’t remember the third object. I just… can’t.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Based on what we've discussed, and the results of the brief examination, I'm concerned about possible cognitive impairment. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but your memory issues warrant further investigation. I recommend a more comprehensive neurological evaluation and some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes. We will also need to complete a cognitive assessment. Would you be willing to schedule those tests?
PATIENT: Cognitive impairment? Are you saying… are you saying I’m losing my mind? I told you, I’m just a little forgetful! It’s nothing serious! I tile houses, Doctor! I remember every single measurement, every angle, every grout line! I’m perfectly capable! A little forgetful, that’s all. And blood work? What’s that got to do with anything? It’s just old age, I tell you! A little weary, maybe, from all the hard work. But I’m perfectly fine! My wife, she worries too much. She’s the one who brought me here. Always making a mountain out of a molehill. I don’t need any tests. I don’t need any blood work. I just need a good night’s sleep and maybe a new pair of glasses. Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous! . I think I’ll just go home. I’ve wasted enough time here already. I need to get back to work. This is… this is insulting! . I don’t want any tests. Understand? No tests. Just let me go home. And tell my wife I said so. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I understand your concerns, and I respect your wishes. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. Even if it turns out to be nothing serious, it's always better to be safe and rule out any potential underlying causes. But ultimately, the decision is yours. If you change your mind, please don’t hesitate to contact my office to schedule those tests. I can provide you with a referral to a neurologist, and we can arrange the blood work. Here's my card, and some information on recognizing the early signs of memory loss. I wish you all the best, Mr. Lason. And please, take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. I'll think about it. But I'm not making any promises. My wife will probably insist. She always does. A waste of time, a complete waste of time… .
