DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Brendan. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Nathaneil Renzi, but please, call me Nathaneil. Now, I see you're 53… and it says here you’re from around here?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Nathaneil. Yes, around here is right. Lived most of my life within a stone's throw of this clinic, actually. It's good to finally get around to seeing a doctor, been putting it off for a bit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Brendan, a lot of folks do. No judgement here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s just… this itching. All over, really. Started a few weeks ago, and it’s just getting worse. Not like a rash, exactly. Just… persistently itchy. It’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: Itching, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Everywhere. Arms, legs, back… even my scalp. It doesn’t look like anything is wrong, which is what’s so frustrating. No bumps, no redness, just… the itch. And it seems to come and go, but it's always there, you know? Like a background noise. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Right, so no visible rash, just the sensation of itching… and it comes and goes, but it’s persistent. Hmm. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse or better?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… I haven’t really noticed anything specific making it worse, no. Hot showers seem to make it a bit more intense for a little while, but then it’s the same again. Nothing really makes it better, unfortunately. I’ve tried some lotions, just regular moisturizers, but they don’t do much. Maybe they help a tiny bit, but it's probably just wishful thinking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hot showers seem to temporarily aggravate it, and lotions haven’t provided significant relief. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Not that I've noticed, really. No fever, no fatigue, no weight loss… appetite’s been normal. I suppose I’ve been a little… restless at night, because of the itching, but that’s about it. Nothing else comes to mind. I haven’t been feeling sick, if that makes sense. Just… itchy. And a bit annoyed.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Brendan. We're just trying to get a full picture here. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… not really. I used to get hay fever as a kid, but I haven't had any problems with that in years. No known drug allergies, no food allergies… I can eat pretty much anything. I remember my wife used to joke that I had a cast-iron stomach. She passed away a few years back, so it's just me now, but she always kept track of things like that. I’ve never had to worry about allergies, thankfully.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Brendan. That must be difficult. And that's good to know about the allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Haven’t really needed anything, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but that’s it. I used to take something for my blood pressure a while back, but the doctor took me off it years ago. Said I was fine. So, no regular medications at all. Just trying to keep myself healthy, you know? Mostly. This itching is throwing a wrench in things, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications, no known allergies… and you had blood pressure medication in the past, but it was discontinued. Good to know. Now, do you have any significant past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, when I was in the army. That was pretty bad, but I recovered fully. Other than that… nothing major, really. Just the usual colds and flu. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. My wife always said I was too stubborn to get sick. She was probably right. I've never had any surgeries or anything like that either. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Brendan. Pneumonia in the past, but otherwise generally healthy… no surgeries. Now, just a couple more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick exam. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me see... my mother had arthritis, I think. Badly, towards the end. And my father… he had heart trouble, I believe. Not sure exactly what kind, it was a long time ago. And… my sister had diabetes, but she lived in Russia, so I didn't see her much. That’s about all I can think of, really. Nothing else major that I know of. We weren't really a family that talked about health much. Mostly focused on getting through the day, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and diabetes in your sister. And you mentioned your sister lived in Russia... That's good to know. Now, before we move onto an exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone now, as I mentioned. I keep pretty busy, though. I used to work as a dispatcher, but I retired a few years back. Now I spend a lot of time in the garden, keeps me active. I walk the dog every day, a little terrier named Rascal. He’s a handful, but I love him. I don’t smoke, haven’t for years. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not too much. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and fish. Nothing too exciting, but it keeps me going. I'm not a big traveler, either. Prefer to stay close to home. Does that give you a picture?
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a very good picture, Brendan. Retired, active lifestyle, gardening, walking the dog… a glass of wine with dinner. That all sounds very sensible. Alright, well, I think we have a good starting point. Would you mind if I just take a quick look at your skin?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go right ahead. I’m used to being poked and prodded, Rascal makes sure of that! Hopefully you won’t find anything. It's just… this itch is driving me crazy, and I'm glad to be getting it checked out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, and I’ll take a look. I'm going to examine your arms, legs, back, and scalp, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I'll be as quick as possible. Okay, Brendan, I'm just looking at your skin now… I’m not seeing any obvious rashes, redness, or bumps. The skin appears generally healthy in terms of color and texture. There are a few age spots, which are perfectly normal. Legs look similar… no visible abnormalities. Back is clear as well… Scalp looks normal, no flaking or lesions. I don’t feel any unusual lumps or bumps. Overall, your skin appears remarkably healthy visually. It is making the itch more puzzling.
PATIENT: That's… good to hear, I guess. But if there's nothing wrong, then what is causing this itch? It's been going on for weeks now, and it's really starting to get to me. It’s almost… infuriating, not being able to see anything. I keep thinking I'm imagining it, but I know I'm not. It's a constant nagging sensation, especially at night. So, what do we do next?
DOCTOR: You’re right to be frustrated, Brendan. It’s very helpful that there aren’t any visible signs, because it rules out a lot of common causes. However, it doesn't mean there isn't something going on. Sometimes, itching can be caused by things we can't see right away. It could be related to your nerves, internal conditions, or even medications, although we've already ruled those out. One thing we can do is a blood test. It won’t show everything, but it can help us rule out some common internal causes of itching, such as liver or kidney problems, and check your thyroid function. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. If it will help figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. I’m ready to get this sorted out, honestly. It’s just… nice to finally be taking it seriously, you know? My wife always told me to go to the doctor, but I always put it off. Now… well, now I wish I hadn’t. So, yes, please, let’s do the blood test. How does that work? Do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good idea, Brendan, and I'm glad you're here now. We'll get that blood test scheduled right away. And yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can still drink water. We'll give you a slip with specific instructions when you go to the lab. It’s just down the hall, and they are very efficient. Here’s the order. The lab is open from 8 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we have those, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I can also recommend a soothing lotion to help relieve some of the itching. It won’t cure it, but it might provide some temporary relief. And if the itching becomes unbearable, you can try an over-the-counter antihistamine. We'll check in with each other in about a week to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you, Nathaneil. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not just dismiss it as… nothing. Fasting isn’t a problem, and I’ll try the lotion and antihistamine. Anything to get some relief. A week sounds good. I’ll be in touch if anything changes. And please, don’t hesitate to call if the itching gets significantly worse. I suppose I should get going and get that blood test done. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. It was my pleasure. And you’re right, get that blood test done when you have a chance. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care now.
