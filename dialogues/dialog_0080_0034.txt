DOCTOR: Hi Emileigh, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's nice to meet you too. I... well, I just moved here. I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor? It’s kinda what my husband said to do. I have Medicare, I think. Is that right? I don’t really… remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright! Getting established with a primary care doctor when you move is a really smart idea. And Medicare is a good place to start. We can definitely sort everything out. I see your husband is listed as your emergency contact, and your insurance is showing as Medicare. Before we dive into that though, is there anything specific going on health-wise right now that brought you in, or are we just doing a general check-up to get things started?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s good to hear. Um… not really anything right now. I mean, I feel okay. Maybe a little tired, but… I always feel a little tired. Nothing bad, you know? Just… getting settled is a lot. I guess I thought I should just get checked out, since I’m new. Is that… enough?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that’s a very good reason to come in! Preventative care is fantastic. And feeling tired is common, especially with a big life change like moving. Since you're new to the area, and we're starting from scratch, I like to get a pretty thorough picture of your overall health. We’ll do a physical exam, and I'll ask you some questions about your medical history, family history, and lifestyle. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. I guess. Physical exam… is that like… a check-up? I’m not really good with… medical stuff. And I don’t remember much about my family… they lived far away. But I’ll try my best to answer your questions. I just… sometimes things don’t stick in my head, you know?
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Emileigh. A physical exam is essentially a check-up – we'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, things like that. And it’s perfectly fine if things don’t stick in your head! I'll ask follow-up questions to help jog your memory, and we can take things at your own pace. Let’s start with you. You said you feel a little tired. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Um… well, it’s just… always there, kinda. Not like, really bad, just… heavy. I wake up tired, and I stay tired. Even when I sleep, I don’t feel… rested. Does that make sense? I work with… machines, a lot. So, I’m on my feet sometimes, but I also sit a lot. I don't know if that makes it worse. It's just… how I feel, most days.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. "Heavy" is a good way to describe it. And being on your feet and then sitting for long periods can definitely contribute to fatigue. When did you first start noticing this tiredness?
PATIENT: Ugh... that's a hard one. It feels like... a long time? Maybe... after we moved? No, I felt it a little before, too. It’s hard to say exactly when it started. It kinda… just always has been there, like I said. But maybe it got a little worse with all the packing and everything. I really don't know. Sorry. It’s so frustrating not to remember things clearly.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize at all, Emileigh. It's completely understandable. We'll figure it out. It sounds like it's been a gradual thing, which makes it harder to pinpoint. Okay, let's try a different approach. Besides the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Not really… I guess I get headaches sometimes, but everyone gets headaches, right? And… maybe a little bit of trouble sleeping? But not every night. And… no. I don’t think so. I mean, nothing major. Just… normal stuff, I guess. I feel okay, mostly. Just tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches and occasional trouble sleeping. And you feel generally okay, just tired. That's helpful. When you say "trouble sleeping," what does that look like?
PATIENT: Um… like, I can fall asleep okay, usually. But I wake up a lot during the night? And sometimes I can't get back to sleep. I just… lay there, thinking. Or… nothing. I don’t really remember what I'm thinking about. It's just… frustrating. And then I'm even more tired in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, you fall asleep easily, but experience some wakefulness during the night and have trouble getting back to sleep. And it leaves you feeling even more tired. Do you notice anything that makes the sleep issues worse – maybe stress, caffeine, or certain foods?
PATIENT: Hmm… I drink coffee, sometimes, when I’m working. But not a lot. And… stress, maybe? Packing and moving was stressful, definitely. And… I don’t know. I don’t really pay attention to what I eat, to be honest. My husband usually does the cooking. I just… eat whatever he makes. I don’t think food has anything to do with it. It’s probably just the stress, or the coffee, maybe? Or… I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information. Stress and coffee are possible contributors. Alright, let's switch gears a bit. We've talked about how you're feeling right now. Now I’d like to ask about your medical history – any past illnesses, surgeries, or medications you've taken?
PATIENT: Ugh... this is the hard part. I don’t… really remember. I was a kid a long time ago. I think I had chickenpox, like everyone else. And maybe the flu a couple of times. But nothing… serious. No surgeries, I don't think. And I don’t really take any medications, except for… sometimes I take something for headaches. But it's just… over-the-counter stuff, like ibuprofen. I don't even remember the name. I just grab whatever my husband buys. It’s all a blur. Sorry, I really wish I could remember more.
DOCTOR: Don't worry at all, Emileigh. It's perfectly okay that you don't remember everything. Many people have trouble recalling details from their childhood. So, no major illnesses, surgeries, or regular medications other than occasional ibuprofen for headaches. That’s helpful to know. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Ugh… this is even worse. They… lived far away. Really far away. I didn't see them much. My mom… she had some problems with her heart, I think. But I don't remember the details. And my dad… he was… healthy, I think. But I wasn't very close to them. It’s all… a long time ago. I’m sorry. I feel like I'm not being very helpful. I really wish I could tell you more. It's just… I don’t remember.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Emileigh. You’re telling me what you do remember, and that’s important. It’s perfectly understandable that you don't have a lot of details about your family's medical history, especially if you weren't close or lived far away. Okay, let's try something different. To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Um… what do you mean by “lifestyle”? Like… what I do every day? I work, mostly. I work with machines, at a factory. It’s… okay. I stand a lot, and sit a lot. And… I watch TV sometimes, with my husband. We don’t really… go out much. And I don’t… really exercise. I should, I know. But I'm always so tired. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly! That's exactly what I mean. Working with machines, alternating between standing and sitting, limited social activities, and limited exercise. That helps me understand things a little better. Now, one last question about your lifestyle – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink. And definitely not… that. My husband doesn't either. We're both pretty healthy, I think, besides the tiredness. We just want to get this tiredness figured out.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Alright, Emileigh, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and reflexes. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. I guess. It’s okay if it doesn’t take too long? I don’t really like… being poked and prodded. But I want to get this tiredness figured out, so… yeah. That’s okay.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, it won’t take long at all. And I’ll explain everything as I go. Okay, if you could just sit here on the exam table, and we’ll get started. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally, in and out. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is a bit weak, but regular. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Alright, that's all. Everything seems physically normal, which is good. But given your fatigue, trouble sleeping, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I think it’s a good idea to run some blood tests. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… good, I guess. Blood tests? What are you looking for? I don't really like needles. But if you think it's important… yeah. Okay, do what you need to do. Just… please be quick?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, and I'll do my best to make it as quick and painless as possible. We'll be running a complete blood count to check for anemia and infection, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid panel to rule out any thyroid issues. Also, I’m going to order a Vitamin D level – deficiency can often cause fatigue. These tests will give us a better idea of what might be going on. It's possible we'll discover a simple explanation for your tiredness. I'll just need to draw a small amount of blood from your arm. Do you have a preference for which arm?
PATIENT: Ugh... I guess... the left one? It feels a little… stronger? I don't know. It doesn’t really matter, I guess. Just… try to be quick, okay? I get a little lightheaded sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, the left arm it is. And I will definitely be as quick as possible. You might feel a brief pinch as the needle goes in. Just breathe deeply, Emileigh. You’re doing great. Alright, all done. Just keep pressure on that spot for a few minutes to prevent any bruising. We should have the results back in a few days. I'll call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Okay... that wasn't too bad. No, I think that's everything. Thank you... for not making me feel stupid for not remembering things. And for being… gentle. I just want to feel normal again. Do you think... do you think you'll find out what's wrong?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. It's absolutely no problem at all. It's perfectly normal to forget things, and it's my job to listen and help you feel comfortable. And yes, I'm optimistic that we’ll be able to figure out what’s going on. The blood tests will give us a lot of information to work with. It's possible there's a simple explanation, like a vitamin deficiency, that's easily treatable. Or, if we find something else, we can develop a plan to address it. In the meantime, I recommend trying to get as much rest as possible, and staying hydrated. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, especially before bedtime. Here's my card with the clinic's phone number. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have them. Do you have any questions for me right now, before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you… really, thank you. I just… want to feel better. I guess I'll go home and try to rest. Thank you again, Dr. Rosanova.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I understand, and I’m hopeful we can get you feeling better soon. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. Have a good day, and I’ll talk to you soon.
