DOCTOR: Hi Soila, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… It’s my tummy. It feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. Everything just feels… off. I don’t really remember when it started, just… slowly.
DOCTOR: Okay, "big" and not feeling hungry, and it's been happening gradually. That gives me a little to start with. Can you tell me a bit more about that "big" feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, it's hard to say. Like… full of water, maybe? Not painful, just… stretched. Like a balloon, a little bit. I used to have a small tummy, you know? Now… not so small. And it feels… heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, "watery," stretched, and heavy – that's helpful. And you said it wasn't painful, which is good. Has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Oh dear… I eat what my neighbor brings over mostly. She’s a good woman, always cooking. I don’t really choose much anymore, if that makes sense. Soups, sometimes… and bread. Oh, and tea! Lots of tea. I don’t think I've changed what I eat, just… how much. Maybe less now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your diet hasn't really changed what you eat, just the amount. And mostly soups, bread, and tea. Do you notice any bloating or gas along with that "big" feeling?
PATIENT: Bloating… is that like… feeling puffy? Yes, a little bit. Especially after I eat. And sometimes… little noises. In my tummy. Not loud, but… there. My neighbor says old ladies get that.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating after eating and some noises – that’s good to know. And your neighbor is right, those things can happen more as we get older. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… movements? Oh, goodness. Um… less often, I think. And… harder. It's not something I talk about much, Doctor. Sorry. I just… don't go as easily as I used to. It’s a little bit uncomfortable, but not terrible.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Soila, it's perfectly normal to be uncomfortable talking about that. "Less often" and "harder" is good information. Any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes things are… a little dark, but I thought that was just from the bread. I haven't really looked closely, if you know what I mean. It's not something I pay attention to.
DOCTOR: Okay, "dark" sometimes, but no bright red blood that you've noticed. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk about other things. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea? Oh, no, not really. I don’t get sick to my stomach. And no, I haven’t thrown up. I just… don’t feel like eating much, that’s all. Everything feels… heavy, even before I eat.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea or vomiting, just a lack of appetite and that feeling of heaviness. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t really weigh myself anymore. My scale broke a long time ago. I feel a little bit thinner, maybe? But I don’t know for sure. My clothes feel a little loose, but… I’m an old woman, Doctor. Things are always a little loose!
DOCTOR: Okay, clothes feel a little loose, but no actual weight measurement. Let's move on to other things. Any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… oh, no. I haven't felt hot. And no chills, not really. Sometimes I get a little cold at night, but that’s just the house. It gets drafty. And no, I don't sweat much in my sleep. I sleep pretty soundly, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or night sweats. That's good. Now, just to get a full picture, have you had any changes in your urine – color, frequency, or any burning sensation when you go?
PATIENT: Oh, my. You ask a lot of questions! Um… the color is… yellow, I think. Like it should be. I go… when I need to, you know? Nothing different there. And no, no burning. Just… old lady things.
DOCTOR: I do ask a lot, I know, Soila. It's just important to rule things out. Okay, yellow urine, normal frequency, no burning. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your tummy and feel around gently. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. Gently, though, please. My tummy is a little sensitive. I’m an old woman, you know! It's okay to poke around, but… be careful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle. Okay, I'm listening to your tummy now. Your bowel sounds are a little quiet, but present. And I don’t feel any obvious masses or pain when I press around. There's a little bit of softness, but nothing too concerning. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/85, and your pulse is 72. A little bit of swelling in your ankles, which is not uncommon at your age. Now, I’d like to order a couple of blood tests to get a better look at things. Just a basic CBC and a metabolic panel. Also, a stool test to check for any hidden blood. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… complicated. Blood tests and stool tests… alright, if you think it’s necessary. My neighbor always says I need more iron, maybe that’s what the blood test is for? And the stool test… well, I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. You said everything was alright, though, right? Just a little quiet tummy?
DOCTOR: You're right, it does sound complicated, but it’s just to get a more complete picture. And you’re right to ask – I did say everything seemed alright. Your tummy doesn't feel acutely painful, and I didn't find any major concerns, but the quiet bowel sounds and the swelling in your ankles, along with your lack of appetite and that feeling of fullness, warrant a little more investigation. The blood tests will check for anemia , kidney function, and other things. The stool test will look for any signs of bleeding, which could explain some of your symptoms. It’s better to rule things out and get a clearer idea of what’s going on. We'll get the results back in a few days, and I’ll call you to discuss them. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids – water is best. And if you experience any significant abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, or vomiting, please call the office immediately. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. You explain things so nicely. Fluids, and call if something is wrong. I will try to remember. It's just… a lot to keep track of, you know? But I will try. Thank you, Doctor. You’re a good man.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Soila. And don't worry about remembering everything – we're here to help. I'll make sure to give you a printed summary of everything we discussed, including the tests we're ordering and the things to watch out for. We'll figure this out together. Now, do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Hmm… questions? Let me think… No, I don’t think so. You explained everything so well, I don’t think I have any. Just… thank you again, Doctor. It’s nice to have someone listen.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Soila. It was my pleasure. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if anything changes. We’ll be in touch soon.
