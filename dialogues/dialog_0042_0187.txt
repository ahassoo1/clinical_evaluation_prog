DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. VODZAK, you say? Hmm. Look, I don't have all day. My wife, she make me come. Chest… feels funny. And my heart, it goes thump-thump. Blood pressure, always high, doctor says. Just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. No worries, we'll take things at a comfortable pace. "Chest feels funny" and a fast heartbeat, along with a history of high blood pressure… that gives us a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about this “funny” feeling in your chest?
PATIENT: Funny… like, tight. Squeeze. Not pain, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Happens when I… when I do things. Walk up stairs, maybe. Or if wife yell at me. It goes away, then comes back. Old age, I think. What do you think? You young doctor. Should know these things.
DOCTOR: It's good you're able to describe it so clearly, Mr. Sobkowicz. “Tightness” and a squeezing sensation that comes and goes with activity or stress… that’s very helpful information. And you’re right to get it checked out, regardless of age. It's important to rule out anything serious. Just to be thorough, does this tightness radiate – meaning, does it spread anywhere else, like to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Radiate? You use big words. My arm… sometimes feel a little heavy. Left arm. Not always. And my jaw… sometimes ache. When I'm very tired, maybe. But I have bad teeth, so who knows. Look, this whole thing is a waste of time, probably. I just need a pill. Give me a pill and I go home. My wife make good soup. I want soup.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. We want to make sure we're addressing everything properly, even if it is something minor. The heaviness in your left arm and jaw ache are things we need to consider. Before we talk about medications, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But quick. I have things to do. And don't poke too much. I don't like being poked. Just listen and get it over with. This is taking too long. My wife will be angry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowicz. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I just need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your pulse and blood pressure. Please lie back on the examination table. Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. Heart rate is a little fast – 92 beats per minute, and the rhythm is regular. I’m hearing some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. Pulse is a bit weak, but present. And your blood pressure is elevated – 160 over 90. I'll need to document these findings.
PATIENT: Crackles? What kind of crackles? Like… like rice in my ears? I have old ears. 160… that high? Always high, doctor says. Tell me, is this serious? Don't tell me it's something I eat. My wife make very good food. But sometimes spicy. Is spicy food bad?
DOCTOR: The crackles I’m hearing are subtle, Mr. Sobkowicz – they sound like small popping sounds. They can sometimes indicate fluid in the lungs, which is something we'll want to investigate further. As for the spicy food, it's unlikely to be the direct cause of your symptoms, but it could contribute to increased blood pressure in some individuals. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, and a basic blood work panel to assess your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Just what I need. Look, I'm an old man. I don't want tests. I want a pill. Give me a water pill. My brother take water pill. He live long life. Just give me what he take. Why so many tests? Waste of money, waste of time. My wife… she always worry about money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the tests, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I respect your wishes. However, giving you medication without a proper diagnosis wouldn't be responsible medical care. Your brother’s experience is helpful information, but everyone is different, and what works for him may not be the best course of action for you. To address your concerns about cost, we can discuss options to minimize expenses and explore potential assistance programs. Before we proceed, would you be open to discussing the potential benefits of these tests, even if it's just to rule out anything serious?
PATIENT: Fine. Tell me. But make it quick. I have a lot of things to do. And don’t use big words. My brain… not so good anymore. Just tell me what these… these tests do. And how long they take. I don’t want to be here all day. My wife… she will kill me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. No big words, I promise. The EKG – that's a quick, painless test where we put some stickers on your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. It takes about five minutes. The chest X-ray is a picture of your lungs, and it takes just a few seconds – you'll need to stand still for a moment. And the blood work involves taking a small sample of your blood – that usually takes about ten minutes. These tests will help us understand what's causing your chest tightness, the fast heartbeat, and the high blood pressure. It’s important to rule out things like heart problems or fluid in your lungs, so we can get you the right treatment. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Five minutes… ten minutes… okay. But if it takes longer, I'm leaving. And don't poke too much when you take the blood. My veins… they're old. Hard to find. Just get it over with. Where do I go? And who’s going to tell me what happens after? I don't want to wait around all day for results. My wife… she’ll be furious. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand. Here’s a slip for the lab and radiology department – they’re just down the hall. The lab technician will take the blood sample, and the radiology technician will perform the chest X-ray. I will personally review the results as soon as they are available, and I'll call you with the findings within 24 hours. If anything urgent arises, we’ll contact you immediately. I'll make a note to call you first thing tomorrow. Do you have any questions before you go?
