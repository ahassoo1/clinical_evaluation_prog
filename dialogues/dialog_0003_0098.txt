DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I am Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… curiosity, really. I ain’t really sick sick. Just thought I should get a check-up, you know? Haven’t been to a doctor in a while. Thought I'd see what's up.
DOCTOR: A preventative check-up, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, something like that. I work on the boats, see? Lots of… everything out there. Never know what you're gonna get. Thought it was a good idea to make sure things are okay. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Very well. While I commend your… proactive approach, these appointments are best utilized when there’s a specific concern. Nevertheless. Let’s begin with a brief history. Have you experienced any recent changes in your health?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. Not really. I mean, I get tired, you know? Work is hard. But that's always been the case. Maybe a little more aches in my back lately, but I think that's from lifting stuff all day. Nothing I can't work through. Is that what you mean by changes? Like, something new?
DOCTOR: Precisely, Mr. Heindel. New symptoms. Anything that deviates from your typical baseline. Fatigue is… subjective. Can you elaborate on the aches?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. The aches… they're mostly in my lower back. Starts kinda dull in the morning, gets worse if I’m bending a lot. Like when I’m cleaning the engine room, or loading stuff. It doesn't really shoot down my leg or anything, just… feels stiff and sore. And it’s been happening for maybe a month or so. Not every day, but often enough to notice. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A month, you say. And localized to the lower back. Any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing like that. Legs are fine. Feet are fine. I can walk and stand normal. I can even climb the ladders on the boat, which is… a lot, you know? It just hurts to bend over sometimes. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any recent changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Uh… changes in… what now? You mean, like… going to the bathroom? I ain't really thought about it. Everything seems… normal, I guess? Look, I work on a boat, Doctor. Things are kinda unpredictable out there, if you know what I mean. Sometimes you gotta go when you gotta go. Is that what you’re asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Heindel, precisely. I am attempting to ascertain if there have been any alterations in your typical bowel function. Constipation, diarrhea, blood in the stool... any such occurrences?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. No blood. No… diarrhea, not really. Maybe a little… harder to go sometimes? Like, I gotta push a bit more? But that happens sometimes, right? I eat a lot of… well, whatever’s available on the boat. It ain’t always the healthiest, I guess. Is that what you wanted to know? Sorry if I’m not explaining this right.
DOCTOR: Sufficient. Let’s move on to past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But it healed up fine. Nothing the doctors ever said was… long-term. I get a little seasick sometimes, but that don’t count, right? Mostly just try to avoid getting sick. Don't have much time for that.
DOCTOR: No chronic conditions. Very good. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgery. Like I said, just the broken arm when I was little. They just put it in a cast. That's it. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Don't go to the doctor much, so I haven't had much need for… stuff like that.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… My mom, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandpa… he had something with his heart, but I don’t really know what. Nobody really talked about it much. It was a long time ago. We don't really keep track of that kinda thing. It’s not something we talk about. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Sufficient. Now, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Boats are dangerous enough without adding that to the mix, you know? Bad idea. And I don't really drink much either. Maybe a beer with the guys sometimes, but nothing regular. Mostly just water, gotta stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to allergies. Any known allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I haven't had any trouble with pollen or… anything like that. I’ve never really had a reaction to anything. I mean, sometimes I get a little itchy after being in the sun too long, but that’s just a sunburn, right? Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. Just… water, mostly. And maybe some vitamins when I remember. But nothing regular. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. Feels like something's wrong if you need to take a bunch of medicine, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with auscultation of your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Never been to the doctor much, so I ain't really sure what all that means, but I’ll do whatever you need. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat, on your back, with your arms at your sides. I will listen to your heart and lungs. Take slow, deep breaths… in and out. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
PATIENT: Okay… deep breaths, right? In and out. Feels kinda weird, but I’m doing it. Everything feels okay… just laying here, you know? Is that good? Everything clear?
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all four quadrants. Any pain with palpation?
PATIENT: Ooh… kinda. Not bad bad, but… yeah, a little. Right there, kinda low down on my left side. That's where I been feeling kinda sore sometimes. Not all the time, just… when you push on it. It's probably nothing, though.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. Now, let’s assess your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a little rough. I can get this far. My back kinda aches when I bend over like that. It's the same ache I been feeling. Not great, but… I can do it. Feels a bit stiff now, you know?
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion with forward flexion, associated with lower back pain. Based on this limited examination, it appears you may be experiencing some musculoskeletal strain, possibly exacerbated by your occupation. However, given the tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant, we should rule out other possibilities. I recommend a complete blood count and a urinalysis to assess for inflammation or infection.
PATIENT: Musculoskeletal… that's a fancy word, huh? Strain… like, from lifting stuff? That makes sense, I guess. Boats are hard work. But the blood tests… is that serious? I didn’t think I was sick sick. Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It is a precautionary measure, Mr. Heindel. A complete blood count will assess for signs of infection or inflammation. The urinalysis will help rule out any urinary tract issues. It’s standard procedure when there is abdominal tenderness. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we must be thorough. The lab results should be available within 24-48 hours. I will contact you with the results and discuss further steps. I will send the orders to the lab now. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief – ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed on the packaging. Avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity for the next few days. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay… ibuprofen, right? I think I got some of that at home. And no heavy lifting… that’s gonna be tough on the boat, but I’ll try. 24-48 hours… alright. Will the results… will they tell me if it’s something bad? Like, something I need to worry about? And… will I need to come back to see you again?
DOCTOR: The lab results will provide additional information. It is premature to speculate on the outcome. If the results are abnormal, we will discuss the appropriate course of action, which may include further testing or a referral to a specialist. You will likely need to return for a follow-up appointment, regardless of the results, to assess your progress. I will contact you to schedule that appointment once the lab results are available. Any further questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you checking me out. Hopefully it’s just… a strain, like you said. I gotta get back to work, but I’ll take it easy. And I’ll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let the reception desk know you are leaving. .
