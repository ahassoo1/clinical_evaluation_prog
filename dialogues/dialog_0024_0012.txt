DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s Velda Squiers, if you please. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month, and the cruise line requires a bit of information from my doctor. Just a general check, really, to make sure I’m fit to travel. It’s to the Mediterranean, a lovely trip I’ve been planning for quite some time.
DOCTOR: A cruise, you say. Yes, well, preventative measures are always… prudent. Though frankly, a bit of paperwork could often suffice. Still. Very well. To be thorough, let's begin with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, well, chronic conditions… let me think. Not as such, no. I had a bit of trouble with my back a few years back, but physiotherapy sorted that right out. And I was told I had slightly high cholesterol, maybe ten years ago, but it came down with diet. Nothing serious, truly. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. My late husband, bless his soul, always said I was as strong as an ox.
DOCTOR: "As strong as an ox," is not a clinical diagnosis, Ms. Squiers. Diet can be… unreliable. Were you ever prescribed medication for this cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. No medication at all. Just… less butter, you see. And a bit more walking. Doctor said it was ‘lifestyle changes’, that’s what he called it. It did the trick, didn't it? I haven’t had it checked since, to be honest. It was years ago now, and I felt perfectly fine. Is it important that I have it checked again for the cruise?
DOCTOR: "Felt perfectly fine" is, regrettably, insufficient for medical documentation. A cruise involves… potential disruptions to routine. One does not want unforeseen complications thousands of miles from proper care. Yes, Ms. Squiers, it is important. We will need to draw some blood. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or… anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh dear, blood… well, I don’t particularly like needles, but if it must be done, it must be done. Right. Allergies… let me see. Not to medications, no. I’m quite careful what I take. I did have a rather nasty reaction to a bee sting when I was a girl, but that was a long time ago. And I’m not overly fond of shellfish, but that’s a taste thing, not an allergy, is it? I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes with lilies, but that’s hardly a serious allergy, either.
DOCTOR: A bee sting… noted. Though a childhood reaction doesn't necessarily preclude current sensitivities. We will document it nonetheless. And lilies... frankly, Ms. Squiers, we are cataloging potential medical issues, not floral preferences. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens, no! Not a single one. I believe in keeping my system as natural as possible, you see. I might take a paracetamol now and then for a headache, but that's it. Nothing regularly. Just good food, fresh air, and a sensible amount of sleep. That's always been my motto. I don't trust all those pills they advertise on the television, always seem to have dreadful side effects. Are you concerned about something, Doctor? You seem a little…focused.
DOCTOR: "Focused," Ms. Squiers, is a polite way of saying I am attempting to acquire a comprehensive medical history. The lack of regular medical attention is… concerning. Very well. Let us proceed with a physical examination, then. Please, lie back on the examination table. We will begin with your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Oh, right. A physical examination. Very well. It’s a bit of a climb, isn’t it? Not as young as I used to be, you know. Blood pressure and pulse, you say? I hope it’s not too high, all this talking has made me a bit flustered. Do let me know if it’s anything to worry about.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 148 over 92. Pulse is regular, but a bit fast at 88. I will need to document this. Now, I will listen to your heart and lungs. Please, take a deep breath for me… and again… Breathing is a little…wheezy. Not alarming, but worth noting. Any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Elevated, you say? That doesn’t sound good, does it? I do get a bit breathless sometimes when I’m climbing stairs, but I put that down to my age and a bit of…stoutness, I suppose. And I’ve had a bit of indigestion lately, with all the rich food at the garden party last week. Just a little discomfort there, on the left side. Nothing too serious, I assure you. It usually passes after a bit of peppermint tea. Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem very…thorough.
DOCTOR: “Thorough” is a requirement of my profession, Ms. Squiers. The discomfort is more pronounced than you indicate. And "a bit of indigestion" rarely presents with this level of tenderness. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please, tell me if anything feels…uncomfortable. Breathing sounds are diminished in the lower lobes. Ms. Squiers, have you experienced any recent weight loss, changes in appetite, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Oh my. That does sound rather serious, doesn’t it? Well, I have lost a little weight recently, now that you mention it. Perhaps a pound or two. I’ve not been eating as much lately, truth be told. I’ve just not felt terribly hungry. And I do wake up a bit warm sometimes, but that’s just the central heating, isn’t it? It gets terribly stuffy in the bedroom. Is it something dreadful, Doctor? You’re making me rather nervous.
DOCTOR: “Making you nervous” is a consequence of responsible medical assessment, Ms. Squiers. The combination of weight loss, diminished appetite, night sweats, and your current physical presentation… is concerning. We need to rule out several possibilities. I am going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. Also, given the tenderness in your abdomen, I recommend an abdominal ultrasound. I will need to schedule these immediately. Do you have a primary care physician I can send the results to?
PATIENT: Oh my heavens. That sounds…extensive. An X-ray, an ultrasound… it all sounds very alarming. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly for years, I’m afraid. My late husband, bless his soul, always took care of everything. He said I worried too much about these things. No, I don't have a primary care physician. I usually just visit the chemist when I need something. Is it…is it serious, Doctor? You’re not telling me something, are you? Is it…cancer?
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, I will be frank. Your symptoms could indicate a number of issues, and it is premature to draw any conclusions. However, given your age and medical history, we must rule out serious possibilities, including, yes, the potential for malignancy. I will schedule these tests immediately. The results will take a few days. Until then, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and contacting the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or shortness of breath. I am also referring you to a gastroenterologist for a further evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Malignancy… A gastroenterologist… it all sounds so… frightening. I… I don't understand. What does a gastroenterologist do? And what if… what if it is something serious? I’m all alone, Doctor. My husband… he always handled everything. I don’t know what to do. Will… will someone explain everything to me? I’m so confused and scared.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, I understand your anxiety. A gastroenterologist specializes in the digestive system; they will perform further tests to determine the cause of your abdominal pain. And while I cannot provide definitive answers at this stage, I assure you, we will investigate thoroughly. The nurse will explain the scheduling process and provide contact information. I must attend to other patients now. Do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience a change in your condition. I recommend you inform a family member or close friend of your situation; support is crucial during times like these. .
