DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get right to it. It's this… stuff. Comes up, you know? After I eat. Not pleasant. Mostly happens when I lie down. It's been going on for a bit, and my wife, bless her heart, finally told me to come in. She worries too much, but… here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Altine. It’s perfectly alright to want to get straight to the point, and I assure you, we will. You mentioned “this stuff” coming up after you eat, and mostly when you lie down. Could you describe what this "stuff" is like, as precisely as possible?
PATIENT: Well, it's… food. Partially digested, I suppose. Not solid, mind you. More like… liquidy. And sour. Really sour. Like… old milk, almost. It burns a bit going up. Honestly, it’s just… disgusting. I try not to eat too late, you know? But sometimes… a good steak… what can you do?
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s partially digested food, liquidy in consistency, with a sour taste – you compared it to old milk, and it causes a burning sensation as it comes up. It seems to be worse after eating, and you've noticed it's more problematic when you lie down. To help me understand the situation better, how often would you say this happens?
PATIENT: Oh, at least a couple times a week. Sometimes more if I've had a… richer meal. Like I said, steak. Or anything with tomatoes. Those are bad. Really bad. My wife makes a lovely pasta sauce, but… I try to avoid it. It's just not worth the discomfort. And the smell… ugh. I don’t want to get into the smell.
DOCTOR: I understand. A couple of times a week, exacerbated by richer meals, particularly those containing tomatoes. And it's understandably unpleasant. Now, Mr. Altine, has this been happening for a long time, or is this a relatively new development?
PATIENT: Oh, it's been going on for… well, years. Not this bad, always. It used to be just occasional. Like, after a big holiday dinner. But the last year or so… it’s gotten steadily worse. And more frequent. That’s why I finally caved and came here. My wife was starting to sound… serious.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Altine. It sounds like this has been a gradual process, worsening over the past year. Has anything else changed recently that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Relevant how? Look, I’m a pretty simple guy. I eat, I sleep, I work. Emergency Management Directors don’t exactly live a stressful lifestyle, you know? We cause stress, we don't have it. I haven’t changed my diet drastically, haven’t started any new medications… I had a little extra weight on, lost some of it recently, maybe that’s something? Not a lot, mind you. Just enough to notice my belt’s a little looser.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Mr. Altine. Emergency Management Directors certainly have a unique perspective on stress, and weight loss can sometimes be a factor. Now, just to be thorough, have you experienced any other symptoms along with this – perhaps any chest pain, difficulty swallowing, unintentional weight loss beyond what you mentioned, or a cough?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Difficulty swallowing… not really. Food goes down fine. Just comes back up. Unintentional weight loss… well, I lost some, but I was trying to. Like I said, a few pounds. Not like I’m wasting away. And cough? No. I smoke a pipe sometimes, but no cough. Perfectly healthy, aside from… this. It’s just… annoying. And frankly, embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, no chest pain, difficulty swallowing, unintentional weight loss, or cough. You do smoke a pipe occasionally, and you've experienced some weight loss, which you were actively trying to achieve. Now, Mr. Altine, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – for example, ulcers, gallbladder issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ulcers? No. Gallbladder… I had my gallbladder taken out… oh, must be twenty years ago now. Routine thing, they said. Everything went fine. Otherwise… nothing. I've been pretty lucky, to be honest. I eat sensible, I get enough sleep, and I don't go looking for trouble. This… this is a new one. And honestly, I’d rather not spend the rest of my day here trying to figure it out.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine, and I'll do my best to be efficient. Twenty years ago, you had your gallbladder removed. No other significant medical history. Now, have you ever had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Broken a bone or two as a kid, nothing major. That's it. Look, I'm a simple man, okay? I don't go to doctors unless absolutely necessary. And frankly, I was hoping this was something I could just… ignore. But my wife…
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly. It sounds like you’ve been fortunate with your health overall. No other surgeries. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – who has had similar digestive issues, or any history of esophageal problems, stomach cancer, or acid reflux?
PATIENT: Acid reflux… my mother had that. Complained about heartburn all the time. Took a lot of those little pink tablets. That’s about it. My father was a strong, silent type. Didn’t complain about much of anything. And my sister… she’s perfectly healthy. Always has been. That’s it. No stomach cancer, no esophageal problems… just my mother and her heartburn.
DOCTOR: I see. A family history of heartburn in your mother. Now, before we move on, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. Every morning. That’s it. I don't believe in loading up on pills. My wife tries to get me to take fish oil, but I refuse. I eat enough fish, thank you very much. That’s it. No antacids, no heartburn medication… nothing.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just a multivitamin. Now, Mr. Altine, would you mind if I performed a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t have time for a full examination. Can’t we just… prescribe something? I'm sure it's just acid reflux. My mother had it, I eat a steak every now and then… it's common sense. But if you absolutely have to… fine. Get it over with. But make it quick.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick resolution, Mr. Altine. While it very well could be acid reflux, a brief examination will help me rule out other possibilities and ensure we’re on the right track with treatment. It won’t take long, I assure you. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and briefly examine your throat. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect me to sing for you. And no poking around. I'm a reasonably dignified man, you know. Just… get it done. And tell me what you think, quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, if you’ll please lie back on the examination table, I’d like to palpate your abdomen. A little tenderness here in the upper part of your abdomen, but nothing alarming. Your throat looks normal as well. Alright, Mr. Altine. Based on the examination, everything appears generally normal. The mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, combined with your history of heartburn-like symptoms and your mother's history, does point towards possible acid reflux or gastritis. However, given the persistence of your symptoms, and the fact that they've been worsening, I would like to order a few simple tests to rule out other possibilities, just to be safe. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Ugh. Look, I was hoping to just get a pill and be done with it. What kind of tests? And how long are these going to take? I have things to do, you know. Emergency Management Directors don’t just sit around all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. I assure you, these are relatively simple tests. I'd like to order a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection, and a stool test to check for Helicobacter pylori, a bacteria that can cause stomach inflammation. We can also check for fecal occult blood. These tests will help us determine the cause of your discomfort. They're both simple, non-invasive, and can be completed at the lab down the hall. The results typically take 2-3 business days. In the meantime, I can prescribe a proton pump inhibitor—a medication that reduces stomach acid production—to help alleviate your symptoms. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Just get me the prescription. And tell me where to go for these… tests. As quickly as possible. I really don’t want to spend my August dealing with this. A steak, a little heartburn… it's not exactly a national emergency.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Altine. I’m writing a prescription for Omeprazole 20mg once daily for two weeks. You should start to feel some relief within a few days. Here's the prescription, and this is the form for the lab. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. They should be able to take care of you right away. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. Do you have any questions about the medication or the tests?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. And thank you for not wasting my entire day. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I understand your time is valuable. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get well soon, and have a good day.
