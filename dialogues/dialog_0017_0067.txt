DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I am Dr. Blim. I see you’re eighty years young. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Dr. Blim. Eighty, that’s right. Seems like yesterday I was… well, never mind. It’s this pain. When I take a deep breath, it hurts. It’s… in my chest, I think. Not a sharp pain, more like a… ache. It's been happening for a little while now, but it felt worse this morning.
DOCTOR: “A little while now”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. A few weeks, maybe? A month? It all blends together, you know? I haven't been keeping track. It comes and goes… mostly when I’m doing something. Like… moving things around. I used to do a lot of construction work, you see. Maybe it’s from that?
DOCTOR: Construction work… of course. And can you be more specific about where exactly this ache is located?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It’s… right here. . Not on one side or the other, just… in the middle. And it sometimes goes around to my back a little. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a muscle pull, you know? It’s… deeper.
DOCTOR: Deeper. Right. And does anything relieve the pain, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Relieve it? Not really, not much. Sitting still helps a little, I suppose. But I gotta keep moving, you know? Can't just sit around all day. Sometimes… sometimes laying down flat makes it a bit better, but then I can't sleep that well. It's a bother, really.
DOCTOR: “Not sleeping well” is rather vague, Mr. Ruocco. Are you having any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Well… sometimes. Not all the time. When I walk up the stairs, maybe. Or if I try to do too much at once. It’s not like I can’t breathe at all, just… winded easier, I guess. Old age, maybe? I don't know.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe a little. I haven't really paid attention, to be honest. My feet sometimes feel… heavy, I guess. But I figured it was just from being on them all day. I don't know if that’s swelling or not. I'm not good at noticing things like that anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. Let’s have you lie down on the examination table. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a quick look at your extremities. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds good, Doctor. I’ll try. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… a bit muffled. Lungs are clear, though you do have a slightly diminished breath sound at the bases. And yes, there is some mild pitting edema in your ankles. I’m noting 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. Now, tell me about any other medical problems you’ve had. Any serious illnesses, surgeries, or hospital stays?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a long list, Doctor. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago. And… I broke my arm once when I was younger, working on a house. Had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was maybe sixty? Something like that. I've had the usual aches and pains, you know, getting old. I don't remember everything clearly. I've never really been one for going to the doctor unless I have to.
DOCTOR: “Unless you have to,” is rather concerning, Mr. Ruocco. Any family history of heart problems, lung disease, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Oh, family… hmm. My father… he had some trouble breathing towards the end, but I don't know what it was. Something with his chest. And my sister… she had a blood clot in her leg, I think. Years ago. But other than that… I don’t really know. We weren't a family that talked much about health problems.
DOCTOR: Are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a one. Never been much of a pill-taker. I used to take something for my blood pressure a long time ago, but the doctor took me off it. Said it wasn’t necessary anymore. I don’t even remember what it was called.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms, your limited medical history, and the examination findings, I suspect you may be dealing with some degree of congestive heart failure, potentially exacerbated by fluid retention. However, we need to confirm this with some further testing. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to start. And I’d also like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm around flowers, but that's about it. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright, I’ve put in the orders for the tests. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and get you over to radiology for the X-ray and EKG. I’d also like you to follow up with a cardiologist as soon as possible. I’ll have the nurse give you a referral. Until we have the results back, try to limit your salt intake and monitor your weight daily. If you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant swelling in your legs, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a lot to take in, Doctor. Salt… and weight… and a… cardiologist. I think so. Limiting salt, watching my weight, and see a heart doctor. And go to the emergency room if things get worse. Yes… I understand. It’s just… a lot. Can you maybe write that down for me? My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: “Limit salt intake, monitor weight daily, cardiology referral, seek immediate medical attention for worsening symptoms.” Here you go. The nurse will explain everything in more detail. I believe that will be all for today, Mr. Ruocco. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers it. Thank you for your time. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me. It’s just… getting old is hard, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. That will be all. The nurse will escort you out. Have a… satisfactory day, Mr. Ruocco.
