DOCTOR: Hello Jailenne, it's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Kamahele, nice to meet you too! Well, I've just been getting the chills lately, and it's a bit annoying, honestly. It started a few days ago, I think? It's not constant, but it happens enough that I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills… that’s good you’re getting it checked out. It’s always best to be sure. A few days ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, probably around Wednesday? Maybe Tuesday. Time gets away from me, you know? It’s not a fever or anything, just…cold. Like, shivering cold even when it's warm. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Jailenne. It's quite common to lose track of days. So, shivering cold… and no fever that you've noticed?
PATIENT: No fever, definitely not. And it's not like a full-body shake all the time. It's more…waves of cold. Like, my arms will get cold, or my back, then it passes. It hasn't been interfering with anything major, but it's just…weird. I also feel a bit tired, but I always feel a bit tired, if I'm being honest!
DOCTOR: Waves of cold… okay. And the tiredness is… just your usual level, or has that gotten worse recently with these chills?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a good question. I think it's a little worse, maybe? It’s hard to say, because, like I said, I'm often tired. But yeah, I'd say I've been needing a bit more sleep than usual this week. And I feel a little more… achy, overall. Not like a bad pain, just…general stiffness. Especially in my shoulders.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increased tiredness and a bit of stiffness, particularly in your shoulders… that's helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… No cough, no sore throat. I haven't been sick to my stomach or anything like that. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I have been a little more thirsty than normal, but I just figured I wasn't drinking enough water.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst… okay. And no cough, no sore throat, no stomach issues. Alright. Have you been around anyone who’s been sick recently?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. My ex-husband's daughter was a bit sniffly last week, but I only saw her briefly. It didn’t seem like anything major. I work with people all the time, so it's always possible someone has something, but no one's mentioned feeling really ill.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little about your past medical history. Do you have any ongoing health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had really bad asthma as a kid, but I grew out of it. I don't have any allergies that I know of, and I'm not on any medication regularly. Just… the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if needed. Oh, and I had my appendix out when I was 16. But that was ages ago!
DOCTOR: Okay, asthma as a child, appendix removed, no known allergies, and no regular medications. Good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm…my mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had diabetes. Nothing else major that I can think of, honestly. My grandparents lived to be pretty old, so, generally, a healthy bunch, I think?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a health education specialist, so I'm on my feet a lot. I try to eat healthy, but it's hard sometimes with a busy schedule. I don’t smoke and I hardly ever drink alcohol. I try to walk when I can, but I don’t really have a regular exercise routine. Stressful job, though, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, busy job, stressful, healthy diet when possible… Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your lungs, take your temperature, and check your lymph nodes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do! I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Great. Let's start by listening to your lungs and heart. Just breathe normally, nice and easy. Your lungs sound clear, good and open. Heart rate is normal. Now, let me just feel your lymph nodes… Okay, no swelling here. Temperature is 98.8, which is normal. I’m not finding anything concerning with this quick exam, but just to be thorough, I’d like to order a basic blood test. It will check for any signs of infection and rule out some common issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. A blood test seems like a good idea. Just to make sure it's nothing serious. I'm happy to do whatever you recommend.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write up the order for the lab now. It should just be a routine CBC – that's a complete blood count – and a metabolic panel to check your electrolytes and kidney function. The lab technician will draw a little bit of blood from your arm. They’ll be able to give you instructions on fasting requirements, if any. I'm going to go ahead and document all of this in your chart - your symptoms, the exam findings, and the blood test order. While we're waiting for the results, if your chills get worse, or you develop a fever, cough, or any other new symptoms, please call the clinic right away. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything really well, actually. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure things out. So, just wait for the blood test results, and keep an eye on things…
DOCTOR: Exactly. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they come in, usually within a couple of business days. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all, even if it seems small. Here’s the lab order. The technician is right down the hall. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Jailenne?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Kamahele. I feel much better knowing we’re getting it checked out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. It was my pleasure. Take care of yourself, and we’ll be in touch soon. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, Dr. Kamahele. Thank you again.
