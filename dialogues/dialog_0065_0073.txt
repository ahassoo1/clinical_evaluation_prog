DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's this…problem. It’s been going on for weeks now, and nothing seems to help. I’ve tried everything the drugstore had, and even what my sister, a nurse, told me to do. Still just…running to the bathroom constantly. It’s embarrassing, frankly.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks. At least three. Maybe longer, I honestly lost track after the first week. It’s just…disruptive. And uncomfortable. Look, I don’t have time for this. I paint houses, you know? Can’t exactly be scaling ladders when you’re worried about…well, you know.
DOCTOR: Painting houses. A physically demanding job. And it’s causing you to frequently need to use the restroom?
PATIENT: Exactly! It's a job. People are paying me. I can't just...stop and run. And it's not just a little tummy trouble. It's… explosive. And frequent. I’m not going into details, but it's bad. I just want it fixed. Are you going to ask a million questions, or are we actually going to do something?
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Woodring, asking questions is doing something. It’s how I determine the best course of action. “Explosive” and “frequent” are…helpful descriptors, but I need more specifics. Let’s start with this: can you describe the stool itself?
PATIENT: Really? You need to know that? Look, it’s… watery. Okay? Very watery. And… a lot of it. I don't need to draw you a picture. Is that good enough? I’ve already told you it’s been weeks! What more do you need to know? Are you even a real doctor?
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration, but a proper medical evaluation requires a detailed history. "Watery" is a start, but color, consistency, and presence of any blood or mucus are important. And yes, I am a real doctor. Now, have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. No blood. Not that I've seen, anyway. Sometimes…sometimes it's a little… lighter colored, I guess? And yes, there’s… stuff in it. Like… slime. Is that what you mean by mucus? I don't enjoy talking about this, you know. It's disgusting. Look, can't you just give me something to stop it? Something strong?
DOCTOR: "Slime," or mucus, is a reasonable observation. Lighter colored stool is also noteworthy. I’m noting all of this. Now, have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No fever. No vomiting. I get a little queasy sometimes, especially before I have to… go. And my stomach cramps a bit, but that's not surprising. I'm running around all day, climbing ladders, lifting buckets. It's a physical job! Honestly, I just thought it was… the job. You’re making a big deal out of nothing.
DOCTOR: And what about your diet?
PATIENT: My diet? What does my diet have to do with this? I eat… normal food. Sandwiches, soup, sometimes I grab something quick from the diner. I’m not a fussy eater. I don't have time for fancy meals, okay? This is getting ridiculous. You ask a lot of questions for someone who isn't fixing anything.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Travel? No! Where would I have time to travel? I'm working. Constantly. Like I said, painting houses. I haven’t left this county in…well, I don't even remember. Are you implying I picked something up somewhere? Really? That’s insulting. I’m careful!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any. Look, can we just skip all this and get to the point? I'm wasting a whole day here. And I'm losing money. I really don't have time for this interrogation. Just tell me what I need to take to make this stop. Please.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration, but I need to be thorough. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I’m perfectly healthy, except for this ridiculous…problem. My sister always said I was as strong as an ox. Until now, that is. This whole thing is just… embarrassing. And inconvenient. Seriously, is there anything you can do, or are we just going to keep talking? I'm starting to feel lightheaded just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about family history. Any history of inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis in your family?
PATIENT: My family? Honestly, no. My mom died young, heart attack. Dad was a fisherman, healthy as a horse until he… well, you know. My brother’s got high blood pressure, that's about it. No fancy diseases. Look, I’m Tlingit, okay? We don’t sit around worrying about… that stuff. We're practical people. We work. This is getting me nowhere. Are you sure you can't just give me something? Anything? I've got houses to paint.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I am noting all of this. Now, do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No! I told you, I don't take anything! I eat food, I work, and I occasionally take a painkiller if I pull a muscle. But that's it. I'm not one of those people who needs a pill for everything. Honestly, this is infuriating. Are you even listening to me? I feel like you're deliberately trying to waste my time. I need a solution, not a quiz.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, given your history of three weeks of frequent, explosive, watery stools with associated mucus, absence of fever or vomiting, and lack of response to over-the-counter remedies, I need to perform a physical examination. It's important to assess your abdomen, check for dehydration, and evaluate your overall condition. Would you be willing to allow me to proceed with an exam?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And if you find something awful, I’m holding you responsible for lost wages. I have deadlines, you know. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: “I’m listening to your bowel sounds now. They are… hyperactive. Increased activity.” "There is some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. No rebound tenderness or guarding at this time." “Your abdomen is tympanic, suggesting some gas present.” “Lungs are clear. Heart rate and rhythm are regular.” “Blood pressure is 120/80. Pulse is 92 and regular. Temperature is normal.” "Your blood pressure and pulse are within normal limits. Your temperature is normal. However, the hyperactive bowel sounds and tenderness warrant further investigation. I recommend a stool sample to rule out infection, and a blood test to check for inflammation and rule out other potential causes."
PATIENT: Infection? What kind of infection? Look, I haven't been sick. I just have a bad stomach. And blood tests? Seriously? This is getting ridiculous. Can't you just give me something to stop the…problem and be done with it? I don’t have time for tests. I’ve got work to do. You're making me more anxious than I already am. I’m starting to feel sick now from all this worrying. Just… give me something. Please.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration, but I cannot simply prescribe medication without a proper diagnosis. We need to rule out serious causes, such as bacterial or parasitic infection, or inflammatory bowel disease. Ignoring the problem could lead to complications. A stool sample and blood test will provide valuable information. I can order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool culture and ova and parasites exam. In the meantime, to manage your symptoms, I can prescribe loperamide, an anti-diarrheal medication. However, this is only a temporary solution. We need to find out what’s causing this. Do you agree to the tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do the stupid tests. But if they come back normal, I want a written apology, and you're paying for my lost wages. And this better work, because I am not happy about this. Loperamide… okay, whatever. Just get it over with. And make it quick. I have a schedule to keep, you know. This is costing me money. And don't expect me to be nice about it if this doesn't resolve things. I’m warning you.
DOCTOR: Very well. I am ordering the complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and stool culture and ova and parasites exam. I will also write a prescription for loperamide 2mg. Take two capsules initially, then one capsule after each loose stool, up to a maximum of eight capsules per day. I will also provide you with written instructions on proper hydration and dietary modifications. Avoid dairy products, fatty foods, and sugary drinks. Stick to bland foods like rice, toast, and bananas. Here are your lab orders and the prescription for loperamide. The lab is located down the hall to your left. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one week to discuss the results. If your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stools, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. Just…get me out of here. And don't expect me to sing your praises if this doesn't work. I have houses to paint. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let the nursing staff know if you need any assistance. Have a good day. .
