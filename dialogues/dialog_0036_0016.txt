DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I'm Dr. Bacy. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s about my bruising, really. Seems to be getting worse, and it's… concerning. I'm on that blood thinner, you know, Warfarin. Been on it for years since the… well, never mind that. It just worries me, seeing all these spots pop up.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that's getting worse while on Warfarin is definitely something we need to look into. Can you tell me a little more about the bruising?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I'm walking into walls, Doctor. It’s just… appearing. A little bump here, a little discoloration there. Nothing major, usually. But they seem to be… bigger now, and more frequent. I noticed a couple on my legs yesterday, and I don’t recall hitting them on anything. It's probably nothing, but my wife... well, she would have wanted me to get it checked out. She was always careful about these things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked out, and it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned, especially with being on Warfarin. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife. So, these bruises…are they painful at all?
PATIENT: Not terribly. A little tender to the touch, maybe, but nothing I'd take a painkiller for. It’s more the sight of them, if I’m honest. And the fact they just…appear. I used to be able to knock my shins against the coffee table and barely get a mark. Now? It's like I’m made of glass. It's just… unusual. And unsettling. I hope it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so not particularly painful, but more frequent and appearing with minimal trauma. That's helpful. Let's go through some other things to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any bleeding anywhere else?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Not that I've seen. Gums are fine, nose hasn’t bothered me. No blood in my stool, thankfully. I check, you know, just to be sure. It’s one of those things… you worry about with the Warfarin. I haven't had any unusual headaches or anything like that either. I try to be… mindful of these things, but honestly, Doctor, sometimes I forget what I ate for breakfast, let alone every little ache and pain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re being mindful, and it's normal to not remember everything. Okay, so no bleeding from gums, nose, or stool, no unusual headaches. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now that you mention it, I did have a bit of a sniffle last week. Nothing major, just a little congestion, a scratchy throat. It passed quickly, a couple of days, mostly just felt tired. I didn't bother going to the doctor for it, honestly. Just figured it was a summer cold. Probably doesn’t mean anything, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild cold last week. That could be relevant. Now, let’s talk about your medications. You're on Warfarin, and are you taking anything else regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, well, just the usual things for an old man, Doctor. I take a small dose of Lisinopril for my blood pressure, and a statin to keep the cholesterol in check. Nothing fancy. And a baby aspirin every day, the cardiologist insisted on that after… well, never mind. I try to take everything as prescribed, but sometimes I get mixed up with the timing, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, a statin, and a daily baby aspirin. And you mentioned sometimes having trouble with the timing. Now, let’s talk a little about your history. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. Been lucky in that regard, thankfully. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing. I’ve had all the usual vaccinations, I suppose. Flu shot every year, tetanus booster when needed. Nothing out of the ordinary. I’m generally a pretty healthy man, despite my age, if you don't mind me saying so myself. It’s just this bruising… it’s worrying.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, regular vaccinations. Alright. Okay, Mr. Farson, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to take your blood pressure and pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a closer look at the bruising on your legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Go right ahead. I suppose the more you look, the better. Just… try not to poke too hard, alright? This old skin bruises easily enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Farson. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your heart and lungs sound clear. As for the bruising… I see several areas on both legs. They vary in size and age. They are fairly widespread, as you mentioned. I'm also noting some small petechiae, tiny pinpoint red spots, on your lower legs. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, it's possible this bruising is related to your Warfarin. However, the petechiae and the recent increase in bruising are concerning enough that we need to do some further investigation. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a prothrombin time test. The CBC will tell us if your platelet count is normal – platelets are what help your blood clot. The PT test will check how long it's taking your blood to clot. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. I appreciate you taking it seriously. Platelets, you say? I don't even know what those are, honestly, but if you think it’s necessary, then go ahead. I trust your judgment. A test is better than just… worrying about it. When can I expect the results? And… will they involve needles?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Platelets are tiny cells in your blood that help it clot. We need to make sure yours are at a normal level. The tests will involve a blood draw, so yes, there will be a needle involved, unfortunately. But it's a quick procedure. The lab usually gets the results back within 24 to 48 hours. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call with the findings. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could cause you to bruise easily, such as contact sports or strenuous exercise. Also, try to be extra careful to avoid bumping into things. I'm going to note in your chart that we’ve discussed this, ordered the CBC and PT, and advised you to be cautious. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything rather well. Just… try not to scare me with the results, alright? And thank you for taking the time. It’s… reassuring to know someone is looking into it. I suppose I’ll just try to be careful and wait for the phone call.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I won't scare you. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll call you as soon as the results are in. Here's a copy of the lab order for you. If you have any concerns before then, don't hesitate to call the clinic. Thank you for coming in today, and please be careful.
