DOCTOR: Hi Clarke, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, it’s these… bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, mostly. And they hurt. Not all the time, but when I bump ‘em, or even just press on ‘em. They’re kinda red too. Been botherin’ me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumps on your shins that are red and painful, especially with pressure. “A little while now” – can you give me a better idea of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… two, three months now? It started with just one, I think. I didn't pay much attention to it at first, figured I just knocked my leg on somethin’. But then more started showin’ up. It wasn’t somethin’ I rushed to see a doctor about, you know? Just kinda got worse slowly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Slow onset is common with some things. And it’s good you’re getting it checked out now. Alright, let’s talk a bit more about these bumps. Are they itchy at all?
PATIENT: No, not really itchy. That's not the problem. It's mostly just the pain. And they're... hard, kinda. Not like a soft bump, if that makes sense. More like… a knot under the skin. My wife, Elena, she noticed them too, and she said they look a little raised.
DOCTOR: Okay, hard, raised knots that are painful, not itchy. That helps. Have you noticed any changes in your skin around the bumps?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… what kind of changes? I haven't really looked that closely, to be honest. Just at the bumps themselves 'cause they hurt. Is the skin supposed to look different? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explainin’ things like this.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. You're doing just fine. By changes, I just meant things like redness spreading around the bumps, any scaling or dryness, or any warmth to the touch. But don’t worry if you haven’t noticed anything specific. Have you had any injuries to your legs recently?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. Not that I can recall. I do a little work around the house, movin’ stuff, you know? But nothin’ major. I haven't fallen or anything. Elena sometimes asks if I hit my legs on somethin' when I'm grumbling about the pain, but I usually tell her no. Maybe I did bump ‘em and just forgot? I'm gettin’ older, memory ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Alright, Clarke, I’m going to take a look at your legs now, if that’s okay with you. Could you please sit on the examination table and I’ll have a look at these bumps?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. Just let me know if you need me to move or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clarke. I'm seeing several firm nodules, primarily on your anterior shins – that’s the front part of your lower legs. They range in size from about half a centimeter to a little over a centimeter. They’re definitely palpable, and tender to the touch, as you mentioned. The skin around them doesn’t appear significantly red or warm, and I don’t see any obvious signs of infection. They feel consistent with one another. Do you have any pain when I press on these specifically?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, that one there, on the right leg… that’s a little sensitive. And that one too, on the left. Not a sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a bruise, kinda. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness is consistent with what I'm suspecting. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, it’s possible these are shin nodules, sometimes called fibroma nodules. They’re benign – not cancerous – growths that can develop after minor trauma or overuse. They're relatively common, especially in older adults. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a simple X-ray of your lower legs. That will help us confirm the diagnosis and make sure there’s nothing else going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… okay. That sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes. I trust your judgment. Is it gonna hurt? And how long will it take? I have to get back home to help Elena with dinner.
DOCTOR: No, an X-ray doesn't hurt at all. You'll just be asked to stand or sit while a technician takes a few images of your legs. It should only take about 10-15 minutes, start to finish. While we’re waiting, let's quickly review your medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I haven’t had much trouble with medications in the past. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but nothin’ serious. I take a little somethin’ for that, but Elena handles all the details. She knows what I'm takin’. And she always tells the doctors. I don’t remember the name of it right now, sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Clarke. We can always double-check with Elena if needed. Any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have a little high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years ago. But it's under control, I think. I take a pill for that too, Elena makes sure of it. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of gettin' old, you know? Arthritis in my knees sometimes bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some arthritis in your knees. Do you have any family history of medical problems – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My father, he had heart trouble when he got older. Had to have a pacemaker, I think. And my mother, she had diabetes. But that was a long time ago, and I don't really know much about the details. On Elena’s side, I think her grandmother had some kind of cancer, but I’m not sure what kind. We didn’t talk about it much. We just try to stay positive, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Staying positive is important. Alright, Clarke, I’m going to step out and request the X-ray. The technician will come in shortly to get you positioned. It shouldn’t take long. Just to clarify before I go, are you currently experiencing any pain in your chest, shortness of breath, or any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain, no trouble breathing. And my legs aren’t swollen. Just the bumps, that’s all. I appreciate you askin' though, Doctor. You're very thorough.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Okay, I'll be right back after the X-rays are done. Please just relax, and let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Clarke, I've reviewed the X-rays, and they confirm my initial suspicion. There are no signs of any fractures, tumors, or other significant abnormalities. The images show some soft tissue density around the nodules, consistent with fibroma nodules. This means they're likely benign growths, and aren't caused by anything serious. However, because they're causing you pain, we should address that. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… good. Benign, that's a good word. Not dangerous. That's a relief. So, what do we do about the pain? Can you fix ‘em? Will it hurt to fix ‘em?
DOCTOR: That's right, not dangerous. The pain is the main concern. We have a few options. The nodules don't require treatment, but we can certainly try to alleviate your discomfort. We could try conservative management first – that means things like rest, ice packs, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen. Sometimes, that's enough to manage the symptoms. If that doesn’t provide enough relief, we could consider a simple in-office procedure to remove the nodules. It’s a minor procedure, involves a local anesthetic to numb the area, and we can usually remove them with a small incision. There’s minimal downtime, but there is a small risk of infection or scarring. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm… rest and ice, I can do that. I don't really like the idea of cuttin' 'em out, if I'm honest. Sounds… scary. Maybe we should try the rest and ice first, see if that helps. Elena's good at makin’ ice packs.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable approach. Rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers are a good first step. I’ll write you a prescription for a stronger anti-inflammatory medication, just in case ibuprofen or naproxen aren’t enough. It's okay to start with the lower dosage. I also want you to monitor the nodules for any changes – things like increased redness, warmth, swelling, or pus. If you notice any of those, please contact me immediately. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to see how you’re doing. If the pain isn’t improving, or if the nodules get worse, we can reconsider the removal option. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. A month sounds right. And I'll definitely keep an eye on ‘em. Elena will help me with that, she’s very observant. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. I feel much better now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clarke. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse print out a care sheet with instructions on managing the pain and monitoring the nodules. She’ll also schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. You’ve answered everything I was worried about. Thank you again, Doctor Rosanova. You’re a very kind doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very kind as well, Clarke. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and give Elena my regards.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I’m sure Elena will be glad to hear you say so.
