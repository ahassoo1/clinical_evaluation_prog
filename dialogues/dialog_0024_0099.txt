DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I received some results from a test… a test of my insides, I believe it was called an Endo test, and it seems there was something… abnormal detected. I must confess, I don’t entirely understand the details, but my regular physician suggested I come in for further discussion.
DOCTOR: An “Endo test,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that is what the paper called it. It involved… well, a camera, I suppose? It wasn’t a pleasant experience, but the staff were very kind. And the results… they used a word I didn’t recognize. Something about… polyps, perhaps? I really am not sure. It’s causing me a bit of worry, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. An endoscopy, I presume. Yes, well, these things aren’t exactly enjoyable, are they?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, they certainly are not. Though I understand they are necessary. So, polyps… is that a serious matter? I’ve never had one of these tests before, and I’m afraid I don’t have a good understanding of what it means for my health. Would you mind explaining it to me in simpler terms, if that’s possible?
DOCTOR: “Simpler terms,” you say. Very well. Polyps are… growths. Not necessarily dangerous growths, mind you, but growths nonetheless. They can occur anywhere in the digestive tract. Think of them as… blemishes. Usually harmless, but sometimes they can become problematic. Now, let’s see what kind of polyps were found. Do you happen to have the report with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here it is. It’s rather… detailed. I mostly skimmed it, as I mentioned. I’m not very good with medical language, you see. I believe it mentions “adenomatous polyps” in the colon… is that bad?
DOCTOR: “Adenomatous polyps.” Yes. Not ideal. These have the potential to become cancerous, you understand. We need to determine the size, number, and location. And whether they were removed completely during the endoscopy. Did they remove any polyps during the procedure, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: Yes, they did. I recall the nurse mentioning something about sending some… specimens to a laboratory for analysis. She said it would take about a week or two to get the full results. They removed three, as I understand it. All in the colon, the report says. I hope that helps. I must admit, the thought of “potential cancer” is rather frightening.
DOCTOR: Three polyps. Adequate removal is… crucial. We'll need to review the pathology report when it arrives to ascertain the grade and stage. For a patient of your… age and constitution, it’s not entirely unexpected, frankly. However, we need to monitor this closely. Now, do you have any family history of colorectal cancer or polyps?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My mother… she passed away when I was quite young, from something… entirely different, I believe. Pneumonia, I think it was. And my father… he was a very private man. I don’t recall ever hearing anything about illnesses on his side of the family. We didn’t discuss such things much. I’m afraid I don’t have much information on that front. I do have two sisters, though, living in Oaxaca. Perhaps they would know more?
DOCTOR: Unreliable family history. Not uncommon. Alright. Now, let’s discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have. I find it a rather unpleasant habit. And I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s about it. I try to maintain a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, though it’s difficult sometimes, living out here in the countryside. Fresh produce isn’t always easy to come by.
DOCTOR: “Countryside.” Right. And your weight?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I've always been… slender. I weigh approximately 58 kilograms, and I am 183 centimeters tall. It’s always been rather difficult for me to gain weight, even when I try. I’ve never been one for… hearty portions, shall we say? It’s just my build, I suppose.
DOCTOR: 58 kilograms at 183 centimeters… That is… below optimal weight for a woman of your age. Do you experience any… fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, actually. I do find myself rather tired these days. More so than usual. I attributed it to getting older, honestly. And the work, of course. I work with metals and plastics – it can be quite strenuous, shaping and molding things. But it’s becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with it. I often feel weak and… lacking energy. It’s not debilitating, but it’s noticeable. And I sometimes have trouble sleeping, too. It’s been getting progressively worse over the past few months.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, low weight, history of polyps… We’ll need to rule out other causes, though I suspect the polyps and your… constitution are significant factors. Now, Ms. Minatra, I am recommending a colonoscopy follow-up in six months to monitor polyp recurrence. I will also order a comprehensive blood panel to assess your overall health and rule out any deficiencies. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Thank you. A colonoscopy again so soon? It wasn’t a pleasant experience, as I mentioned. But if it’s necessary… then I suppose I must. And a blood panel, yes. That’s perfectly fine. As for allergies… I do not believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, to my knowledge. Though, I rarely take anything. A simple headache remedy, perhaps, or something for a cold, but that’s about it. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Perhaps something I should be doing differently in the meantime?
DOCTOR: “Natural remedies.” Very well. In the interim, I suggest you increase your caloric intake – focus on protein and complex carbohydrates. And, frankly, consider a less physically demanding line of work. I'm also prescribing a daily multivitamin. As for the colonoscopy, it is a necessary precaution. I will refer you to Dr. Ramirez; he is… adequate. This is all quite straightforward, Ms. Minatra. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Increase my calorie intake… that sounds difficult, honestly. I’ve never been a big eater. And changing professions is… not really an option, Doctor. It’s what I’ve always done, and it’s how I support myself. Dr. Ramirez, you say? Adequate? That doesn’t sound terribly reassuring. Doctor, if I may ask… what are the chances that these polyps are… serious? What am I really facing here? I understand you said they have potential to become cancerous, but… what does that actually mean? It’s all rather frightening, and I’m not sure I fully understand everything.
DOCTOR: Ms. Minatra, I understand your anxiety, but frankly, you are dwelling on the negative. The “potential” I mentioned is precisely that - a possibility, not a certainty. The likelihood of malignancy is… dependent on numerous factors, most of which we are yet to ascertain. The pathology report will tell us more. Now, I have other patients waiting. I’ve provided you with a referral and a prescription. Focus on adhering to my recommendations. And please, try not to catastrophize. This is a routine matter. Are there any other questions I can answer, or shall we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I don’t think so. Thank you for your time. I suppose I will see Dr. Ramirez then. I appreciate your… frankness. .
