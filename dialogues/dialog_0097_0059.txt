DOCTOR: Hi Adyn, welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s my speech, I think. It’s been… a little off. Hard to explain, really. Like I’m not saying everything clearly. I noticed it a few days ago, maybe? It’s difficult to remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: Okay, "a little off" with your speech, noticed a few days ago. I understand it can be hard to pinpoint when these things start. Can you describe what you mean by "not saying everything clearly"?
PATIENT: It’s… like my tongue feels heavy, sometimes. And the words just don't come out how I mean them to. It’s not all the time, but enough to worry me. My husband noticed it too, he said I was slurring a bit when I was talking to him last night. It's just… strange. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Adyn. Tongue feeling heavy and some slurring – those are important things to tell me. And it’s good your husband noticed as well. Has this been happening gradually, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… honestly, I’m not sure. It feels like it came on slowly, maybe over the last week? But my memory hasn't been the best lately, so it’s hard to say for certain. It wasn’t a sudden thing, I don’t think. More like… a slow realization that something was different. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. A slow onset is good to know. And it's okay that your memory isn’t perfect; we can work through things. Aside from the slurring and heavy tongue, have you noticed any other changes with your speech?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not really. Just the way things sound, I guess. Sometimes I stumble over my words a bit, but that happens to everyone, doesn’t it? I haven't had any trouble finding the words, just… saying them properly. I don’t think so, no. Not that I can recall, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no trouble finding the words, just with the pronunciation. And the stumbling isn’t new. Good to know. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with this—like headaches, dizziness, weakness, or changes in vision?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. I get the occasional one, but nothing unusual. Dizziness, maybe a little bit, but I’m always a bit clumsy, so I just put that down to me. Weakness… no, I don't think so. And no changes in my vision that I'm aware of. Honestly, Doctor, it's mostly just the speech. It’s just… worrying, you know? I don't usually have problems talking.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Adyn. It’s good you’re coming in to get it checked out when something feels off, especially when it's a change from your normal. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… Well, I don't think so. I've been generally healthy, thankfully. I have Medicare, so I've seen doctors for check-ups, but nothing major has ever come up. I think I had the flu once, a few years back, but that's about it. I am married, if that's relevant. I work as a Construction Manager, so I’m pretty active. Does that help? I really don’t remember any diagnoses, sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy. Being active as a Construction Manager is great. And no, it’s perfectly alright not to recall specific diagnoses. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don’t take anything regularly. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, like ibuprofen, but nothing frequent. I try to stay away from medication if I can. I don’t use any herbal supplements either. I really don't like taking pills if I don’t have to. Sorry, I wish I had more useful information.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine. It's helpful to know you’re not on any regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I eat pretty much everything. I haven’t noticed any allergies, no. I’m not allergic to anything that I'm aware of, Doctor. But, you know, my memory… I could be forgetting something. It's just… difficult to be certain.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be uncertain. We’ll take things slowly. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like stroke, neurological disorders, or speech problems?
PATIENT: That’s… a tough one. My family… well, we don’t really talk about medical stuff much. I know my grandfather had some sort of heart trouble, but I don’t know the details. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. I’m not sure if anyone had speech problems or neurological disorders. We haven’t really discussed it. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It's just not something my family talks about.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's common for families not to discuss medical history openly. We can work with what you do know. One last thing about your background. Have you had any recent head injuries or illnesses, like a cold, flu, or infection?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, not that I recall. I had a bit of a cold a few months ago, maybe, but nothing serious. It was just a regular cold – stuffy nose, sore throat, that sort of thing. No head injuries at all. I’m usually pretty careful. And no serious illnesses, no. Just the occasional sniffle. I really can’t think of anything else, Doctor. I'm sorry if I’m not being very informative. It's just... my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You’re being very informative, Adyn. It’s good you’ve thought through all of this. Okay, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just… hope it’s nothing serious. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay. Can you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can, Doctor. Is this… okay? I'm trying to keep my head very still. It’s a little difficult, but I’m doing my best. I hope I’m not doing it wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Yes, like this? Is that alright? I hope my face isn't crooked or anything. I'm a little worried, Doctor. I’m trying my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect. Okay, good. Now, I’m going to listen to your speech more closely. Can you please say "one, two, three" for me?
PATIENT: One… two… three. Does that… sound alright, Doctor? It feels a little strange, focusing on how I’m saying it. I hope I didn’t slur anything. It’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, now can you say "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" for me, please?
PATIENT: The… quick… brown… fox… jumps… over… the… lazy… dog. Was that… alright, Doctor? It felt a little difficult, to be honest. I’m trying my best, but it feels like my tongue is… heavy. I hope I didn’t mess it up too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn. Everything appears normal on the physical exam, but I do notice some mild hesitancy and slight slurring of your "s" sounds when you speak. I’m not overly concerned at this point, but I’d like to be thorough. Given your age and the description of your symptoms, I’d like to order a few tests just to rule out anything serious. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it helps to be thorough, then I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. What kind of tests are you thinking about? I just… hope they’re not too invasive. I’m a little nervous, to be honest. But, if it rules things out, then I’m happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness. The tests aren’t invasive at all. I’d like to order a basic blood work panel to check for any underlying infections or vitamin deficiencies. I also want to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural problems. It’s just a precaution, Adyn. The MRI will give us a detailed look at your brain and help us determine the cause of your speech changes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… alright. If it gives you a clearer picture, then I suppose I have no objections. An MRI… is it a long procedure? And will it… hurt? I'm just a little apprehensive, to be honest. But if it rules things out, then I'm happy to do it. What do I need to do to prepare for the tests?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be apprehensive, Adyn. The MRI typically takes about 30-45 minutes. It’s a painless procedure, but you’ll need to lie very still inside a large, magnetic tube. It can be a little claustrophobic for some people, but we can give you a mild sedative if you’re anxious. As for preparation, just let the technician know if you have any metal implants, like pacemakers or surgical clips. You'll also need to remove any jewelry or metal objects before the scan. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work and the MRI, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, please monitor your symptoms and let me know if they worsen or if you develop any new ones. We’ll review the results together once they’re available. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reassuring, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I'll definitely let the technician know about any metal objects. And I’ll keep a close eye on my symptoms and let you know if anything changes. 30-45 minutes… I can manage that, I think. Thank you again, Doctor Georgiou. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience. I feel a little better knowing we're taking this seriously. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could reassure you. The most important thing is to not stress too much. It's often something minor. There's one last thing. As a precaution, I'd like you to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until we have the results of the MRI, just in case your symptoms worsen unexpectedly. Also, if you experience any sudden weakness, vision changes, or severe headache, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'll have the nurse print out the referral forms and some information about the MRI procedure. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No driving… that’s sensible. And I’ll definitely keep an eye out for those symptoms and go to the emergency room if anything changes. Thank you for reminding me, Doctor. No, I think that’s everything for now. I really appreciate your help, and I’ll let you know if I have any questions after I review the forms. Thank you again for everything. I think I'm ready to leave now, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Of course. The nurse will come in shortly to go over the discharge instructions and schedule a follow-up appointment. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before then. Take care, Adyn, and try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I feel much better knowing I'm in good hands.
