DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jaxston. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Right… well, it’s my head. It’s been… bad, on and off. Really bad headaches, and I get all sweaty when they happen, and my heart races. I think that's it, mostly. Honestly, it's kinda fuzzy remembering everything exactly when it started, but it’s been going on for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, “bad headaches, on and off, with sweating and a racing heart.” That sounds concerning. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about these headaches?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Um… they usually start kinda slow, like a pressure building up in my head. Then it just… gets worse. It’s not like, one specific spot, it’s more… all over, I guess? And it’s a really pounding pain, like someone’s hammering inside my skull. I usually get pretty nauseous too, but I haven’t actually been sick, if that makes sense. How long they last… that’s a tough one. Sometimes a few hours, sometimes most of the day. I really don’t remember specifics. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, it’s common to have trouble remembering details when you’re not feeling well. “Pressure building up, all over, pounding pain, nausea…” That gives me a better picture. Do you notice anything that triggers these headaches?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. I honestly don’t think so. I’ve tried to think about it, but nothing really jumps out. It doesn’t seem to be tied to stress, or food, or… anything, really. It just happens. Which is… frustrating, I guess. I did have one really bad one after I helped a friend move a bunch of stuff, but that could've just been from the effort, right? I don’t know. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, no obvious triggers, and one possible association with physical exertion. Let’s talk about some other things. Have you noticed any changes in your vision when these headaches happen?
PATIENT: Vision… huh. That’s a good question. I… think maybe things get a little blurry sometimes during a headache? It's not like a double vision thing, just… not as sharp, I guess. It usually goes away when the headache starts to ease up. I haven’t really said anything about it before, honestly, 'cause it doesn't last long. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It's definitely good you mentioned it. Blurriness during a headache is something we want to note. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the headaches – anything like fever, neck stiffness, weakness, numbness, or trouble speaking?
PATIENT: Trouble speaking… no, thankfully. No fever that I've noticed, and my neck doesn't feel stiff. Weakness… sometimes I just feel really drained after a headache, like I’ve had a really rough workout, but not like, can't move my arm or anything. And no numbness. Just… tired, afterwards. Sorry if that’s not very helpful. It’s all kinda a blur, like I said.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Jaxston. It is helpful, even if it feels vague. It helps me rule things out. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. I think I had strep throat when I was a kid, but that’s about it. Nothing major. I haven’t really been to the doctor much, honestly. I generally just… try to tough things out. My ex-wife, she was always the one going to the doctor for everything. I've never been told I have anything seriously wrong with me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. No prior medical diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, and no hospital stays. Nothing like that. I broke my wrist when I was a teenager skateboarding, but it wasn’t bad enough to need a hospital, just a cast. Apart from that… nope. Pretty boring medical history, I guess. I’m starting to feel a little silly even being here, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You’re not silly at all. It’s good you came in to get this checked out. Okay, let’s talk about your family. Do you have a family history of headaches or migraines?
PATIENT: Uh… hmm. My mom got headaches sometimes, but she just always said it was stress. She worked a really demanding job. I don't think they were like these headaches, though. More just… regular tension headaches, I guess? My dad… I honestly don't really know. We weren’t very close, and we never really talked about health stuff. I don’t think he ever mentioned headaches. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's alright, we work with what we have. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Never been much of a smoker. I'll have a beer sometimes with friends, like on a weekend, but I don't drink regularly. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. I don’t really like feeling out of control, and that sort of thing… just isn't me. I work pretty hard, mostly just try to keep things simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not really. I’ve taken ibuprofen a few times for the headaches when they get really bad, but that’s about it. It doesn’t always help much, though. Sometimes it takes the edge off, but mostly… I just try to lie down in a dark room and wait it out. Nothing prescribed or anything, just over-the-counter stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. Last few questions about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. And I haven't ever had a bad reaction to a bug bite or anything like that. I've always been pretty lucky in that department, I guess. Is that everything? I feel like my brain is getting a little foggy just trying to remember all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaxston, that's very helpful. Thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination. Just a quick look to get a better sense of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… fine. I guess. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m not really sure what a neurological exam is, but if it'll help figure things out… go for it. I'm kinda trusting you to know what you're doing. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your reflexes and eye movements. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, but not dramatically. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your pupils and eye movements. Please follow my finger with your eyes, but don’t move your head. Okay, eye movements look good. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. This will just check how quickly your nerves are responding. Okay, reflexes are normal. And finally, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands and wiggle your toes. Alright, everything seems neurologically intact at this point. Your strength, reflexes, and coordination are all normal. Based on everything you've told me and the quick exam, I’m thinking we are dealing with tension headaches, possibly with some migraine features. The sweating and racing heart are concerning and we need to rule out other causes.
PATIENT: Okay. That... doesn't sound too bad, I guess? Tension headaches... I've heard of those. But the sweating and heart racing... should that be happening with just those? And what does “migraine features” even mean? I'm starting to feel a little anxious again. Should we do some tests or something to rule out… I don’t know… something more serious?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask about the sweating and racing heart, and it’s good you’re bringing up your anxiety. Those symptoms aren’t typical for a simple tension headache and warrant further investigation. "Migraine features" means your headaches have some characteristics that overlap with migraines – like the nausea, and potential blurry vision. However, we haven't met the full criteria for a migraine diagnosis yet. To rule out other causes, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a complete blood count to check for infection or anemia. Second, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. And third, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to check your thyroid function. Finally, I recommend an electrocardiogram to evaluate your heart rhythm. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yeah, absolutely. That… sounds sensible. If it'll help figure out what’s going on with the heart stuff, and make sure it's not anything… really bad… then yes, please. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again. How long do those tests take, and will I get results right away? And… how much will they cost, roughly? I don’t have insurance, so I’m a little worried about the bill.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I understand your concern about the cost, and I’ll do my best to keep things as affordable as possible. The blood tests should only take about 15-20 minutes, and the ECG is very quick – maybe 5 minutes. The lab results typically come back within a few business days, and I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them. As for the cost, without insurance, the CBC and BMP will likely be around $80-$100 each, and the TSH test is around $50-$70. The ECG is usually the most expensive, around $150-$200. So, the total cost could be somewhere in the range of $330-$440. I can also see if the lab offers any discounts for self-pay patients, and we can discuss a payment plan if needed. Would you like me to check on the discounts now?
PATIENT: Okay… that's… more than I was hoping for, but I guess it’s better to know what’s going on. Yeah, please check on any discounts. And a payment plan would be… really helpful. I really appreciate you looking into that. I feel a little better just knowing we’re trying to figure it out. Should I schedule a follow-up appointment now, just to go over the results when they come back?
DOCTOR: You're welcome. I’m glad you’re feeling a little better. Okay, good news. The lab does offer a 10% discount for self-pay patients, which would bring the total cost down to around $297-$396. As for a follow-up appointment, yes, let’s schedule one for about a week from today, assuming the results take roughly a week to come back. That will give us time to review them thoroughly and discuss the next steps. How does next Thursday at 2 PM sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfect. Next Thursday at 2 PM is good. And thank you so much for checking on the discount. That makes a big difference. I guess I'll just go to the lab whenever you tell me to, and they'll know what to do? I’m kinda nervous about all this, but I’m glad I came in.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaxston. I understand your nervousness, but you did the right thing by coming in. Here’s the lab order. You can go to [Name of Local Lab] anytime during their business hours. Just tell them you have an order from Dr. Bacy, and they'll take care of everything. The results will be sent directly to my office. In the meantime, if your headaches worsen significantly, or you develop any new symptoms like fever, stiff neck, weakness, or trouble speaking, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been really helpful, Doctor. Thank you again. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I’ll see you next Thursday then.
DOCTOR: Alright, you're very welcome, Jaxston. I look forward to seeing you next Thursday. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns.
