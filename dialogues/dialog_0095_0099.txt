DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I received a letter about some results from a test… a GI Endo test, it was called? And it said something wasn’t quite right. I must admit, I’m a bit worried about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a GI endoscopy. I see. Yes, I have the results here. To help me understand things better, could you tell me a little bit about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, for several months now, I’ve been experiencing some… discomfort. It's mainly in my stomach, a sort of burning sensation. And occasionally, some… well, let's just say difficulty with digestion. My primary care physician, Dr. Ramirez, thought it best to investigate further, so she recommended the endoscopy. She said it would give them a clearer picture of what was happening inside. Is that… a good explanation? I hope I’m not being too vague.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly clear, Ms. Minatra. Burning sensation and digestive issues... alright. And how long have these symptoms been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Let me think… It began, I believe, sometime in late November of last year. So, roughly eight months now. It wasn't constant at first, just occasional flare-ups after meals. But it's become more frequent in the last few months, and the discomfort is more… pronounced, shall we say. It’s starting to interfere with my appetite, which is unusual for me. I always enjoyed a good meal.
DOCTOR: Okay, eight months, progressively worsening. Any particular foods seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. I thought it was spicy foods at first, so I cut back on those. But it didn’t seem to make a significant difference, truthfully. More recently, I've noticed it's worse with… well, anything really heavy. Red meat, fried foods, things like that. And citrus fruits, perhaps? It's hard to pinpoint exactly, but those seem to be the most likely culprits. I’ve been trying to eat lighter meals, mostly fish and vegetables, to see if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the burning and digestive issues?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. This is perhaps a little embarrassing to mention, but… there's been some… bleeding. Not a great deal, but I've noticed traces of blood in my stool a few times. It's not every time, but enough to be concerning. And I have felt… rather tired lately. More fatigued than usual, I suppose. It's difficult to say if that's related, of course, as I am getting older. But I thought it best to mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay, bleeding and fatigue. That's important information. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, a little. I haven’t been keeping strict track, but my clothes seem a bit looser than they used to be. I wouldn’t say it’s drastic, perhaps five or six pounds over the last couple of months? It’s… subtle, but noticeable. I have a good appetite when I can eat, so I hadn't connected it to the other symptoms until now. It's unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to cover all bases, have you noticed any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No nausea or vomiting at all. That's one thing I haven’t experienced. Just the burning, the digestive issues, the fatigue, the slight bleeding, and the weight loss. It’s… a rather unpleasant combination, I must say. Is this… serious, Doctor? I apologize for asking directly, but I find myself quite anxious about this.
DOCTOR: Okay. The endoscopy did show some inflammation in your stomach and duodenum, and a few small ulcers. That explains the burning and the bleeding. The fatigue and weight loss could be related to blood loss, or indicate something more going on. We need to determine the cause of the ulcers. Do you take any medications currently, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take a medication for my blood pressure – Lisinopril, it’s called. I’ve been on it for about ten years now. And occasionally, I take an antacid – Tums – for the heartburn, but that’s only when it flares up. I don’t take anything else regularly. Should those medications be causing this? I’m a bit confused. And… what are ulcers, exactly? I apologize for my ignorance.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and occasional Tums. Ulcers are sores that develop in the lining of the stomach or duodenum. They can cause pain, bleeding, and other symptoms. Lisinopril can sometimes contribute to digestive issues, but it’s less common. We’ll need to rule out other causes, specifically Helicobacter pylori infection, which is a common bacterial infection that causes ulcers. Have you ever had a test for H. pylori before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I don’t believe so. I’ve had many tests over the years, of course, but I don’t recall anything specifically for that. What sort of test is it? And… is it serious? I must admit, I am rather unfamiliar with all of this. It’s a little overwhelming, if I may be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay. We can do a simple stool test to check for H. pylori. It’s non-invasive, just a sample collection. If that’s negative, we may need to consider a breath test or, less commonly, an endoscopy with biopsy to get a definitive answer. While we're waiting for those results, I’m going to prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, to reduce stomach acid and help the ulcers heal. It’s important to follow the directions carefully. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have no known allergies to any medications. That's one thing I can be certain of, thankfully. A stool test sounds… manageable. And a PPI, you say? I’m happy to take whatever helps. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I’ll follow your instructions to the letter. I just want to get to the bottom of this and feel better. What sort of timeframe are we looking at for the test results?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The stool test usually takes about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week after the results are available, to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, black, tarry stools, or vomiting blood, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Three to five days. I can certainly manage that. I will be sure to schedule the follow-up appointment. And I appreciate the warning about the emergency room. I will keep a close watch on things. You mentioned black, tarry stools... is that a sign that something is very wrong? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I’m rather anxious about this, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Ms. Minatra. It’s my job to explain things and alleviate your concerns. Black, tarry stools indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract, and it can be a sign of a more serious issue, requiring immediate attention. We're not saying that's what's happening now, but it's important to be aware of the signs. We're taking things one step at a time, starting with the stool test. Do you understand those instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Black, tarry stools mean I need to go to the emergency room. I've made a mental note. And yes, I believe I understand the instructions for the stool test. A small sample, collect it carefully, and bring it to the lab. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Perhaps specific foods to avoid while we wait for the results? I want to do everything I can to help speed up the process and get to the bottom of this. I truly appreciate your patience with my… many concerns.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. It’s important you feel comfortable. While we wait for the results, it's best to avoid spicy foods, acidic foods like citrus fruits and tomatoes, caffeine, alcohol, and fatty foods. These can irritate your stomach. Stick to bland, easily digestible foods. And try to eat smaller, more frequent meals. Here’s a handout with a list of recommended foods. I think that covers everything for now. Remember, if you have any concerning symptoms, don't hesitate to contact the office or go to the emergency room. I’ll see you back here in about a week to discuss the results. Do you have any final questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I truly appreciate your patience with me. I’ll follow your instructions carefully and avoid those foods. I’ll schedule the follow-up appointment immediately. Thank you again, Doctor Vanochten. You’ve put my mind at ease, at least for now. I look forward to seeing you again next week. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Minatra. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. .
