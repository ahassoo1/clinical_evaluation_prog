DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is… nice to meet you as well. I have… trouble with my sinuses. It’s been… a little while now. Not sure exactly how long. Everything feels… foggy, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “Foggy” is a good way to describe it. It sounds frustrating. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what's going on. When you say trouble with your sinuses, can you describe the symptoms specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… symptoms. It… hurts, mostly. Like… pressure. Behind my eyes, and… in my cheeks. And sometimes… I have trouble breathing through my nose. It feels… blocked. Not always, just… often. Is that… a symptom? I don't know all the… the words. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: It absolutely is a symptom, Mikeisha. Pressure and congestion are very common with sinus issues. And it's perfectly okay if you don't know all the medical terms—that’s what I'm here for. You mentioned the pressure is behind your eyes and in your cheeks. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes. Mostly. Some days it's… not so bad. Other days… it feels like a lot. It's… hard to explain. It feels worse when I… bend over. Or when it’s very cold. Does that make sense? Also… sometimes my head feels… heavy. Very heavy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Worsening with bending over and in cold weather is definitely helpful information. And the heaviness you’re describing – is that a general headache feeling, or is it localized to a specific area?
PATIENT: It's… all over, I think. Not just one spot. Like… a band around my head. And sometimes… in my neck too. It’s not… a sharp pain, more… a dull ache. It doesn't… stop me from doing things, but it’s… annoying. Very annoying. I take… some pills. For the pain. But they don’t… always work.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache all over your head and neck, and the pain pills aren’t consistently effective. Can you tell me what kind of pain pills you're taking, and how often you take them?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a good question. My husband, he gets them. He… works with a lot of people. I just… take what he gives me. I don't… remember the name. Small, white pills, I think. I take… two, maybe three, when it hurts bad. Sometimes… every day. Sometimes… not for a few days. I don’t… keep track very well. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mikeisha, don't apologize. It's good you're being honest with me. It's important for me to know what you’re taking, even if you don’t know the exact name. Let’s try to figure it out. Do you happen to know where your husband gets the medication?
PATIENT: No. He… doesn't say. He just… gives them to me. He works… outside. A lot. With his friends. He says they… help. I don't ask questions. He… worries about me. It feels… rude to ask. And I don’t want to… bother him. He works very hard.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. It's good of you to want to respect his privacy, but it's also very important for your health that we know what you're taking. Since you're not sure, and it's concerning that it's not a medication prescribed specifically for you, I'd like to do a quick exam, if that's okay. It will help me get a better idea of what's going on and rule out anything serious. We'll check your sinuses, ears, and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… alright. If it helps. I… trust you, Doctor. I just… I don’t like… feeling this way. The pain… it makes it hard to… concentrate. So if looking will help… then please do. I just… hope it doesn’t hurt.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mikeisha. I'll be as gentle as possible. It shouldn't be painful, just a little bit of pressure. Alright, let's start with your forehead. Tell me if this is tender anywhere… okay, and now your cheeks… any pain with pressure here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. There. That hurts. A little. And… a little bit here too. Not as much. But… yes. It's… uncomfortable. It feels… swollen, maybe? I don't know. It's hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm noting tenderness on your left cheek is greater than on your right. Deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Lungs sound clear. Say "Ah" for me… Good. Throat looks a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Your ears also look normal. Overall, it sounds like you’re experiencing some sinus inflammation, likely sinusitis. The tenderness and your description of the pain fits with that. However, the fact that you don't know what pain medication you're taking, and the length of time you've been experiencing these symptoms, makes me want to be a little cautious. It’s possible this could be a chronic issue.
PATIENT: Chronic? What does… chronic mean? Is it… bad? I just want the pain to… go away. And… I don’t like taking pills I don’t know about. My husband… he just wants to help. But… I don’t want to… make things worse. What should I do?
DOCTOR: Chronic just means it's been going on for a long time, or keeps coming back. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad, but it does mean we need to investigate a little further to find the best way to manage it. You're right to be concerned about taking medication you don't know about. That’s definitely not ideal, and we need to address that with your husband. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a CT scan of your sinuses. It will give us a detailed look at what's going on inside and help us determine the best course of action. Also, I'm going to recommend that you see an ENT specialist – an Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor – for a more thorough evaluation. They specialize in these kinds of issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A scan… and another doctor? That sounds… complicated. But… if it will help… then yes. I suppose. I don’t want to… keep feeling like this. My head… it gets so heavy. Will the scan… hurt? And… I don’t have… insurance. Will it be… expensive? I don’t want to… cause too much trouble. My husband… he works so hard.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mikeisha. The CT scan itself doesn't hurt at all – you'll just lie still on a table while the machine takes pictures. It’s very quick. I understand your worry about the cost, and the fact that you don’t have insurance. Let’s see what we can do. I’m going to have my nurse, Maria, speak with you about financial assistance options available through the clinic and the hospital. She's very good at helping patients navigate those things. We can also discuss the possibility of getting a referral to a specialist who offers a sliding scale fee based on income. For now, I'm going to write a prescription for a nasal saline rinse. It can help to clear out your sinuses and provide some relief. And, as I mentioned, I’ll have Maria speak with you about next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A rinse… that sounds… manageable. And someone to help with the costs… that would be… very good. Thank you, Doctor. I… appreciate you taking the time. I just… I don’t want to… worry my husband. He works so hard… and I don't want to… burden him. I hope… it's not too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. It's my job to help, and you shouldn't feel like you're a burden. It's good you have a supportive husband, and we’ll do everything we can to figure out what's going on and get you feeling better. I'll go ahead and write that prescription for the nasal saline rinse now. Maria will be in shortly to discuss the financial assistance options and schedule a follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to ask her any questions you have. Do you have any other questions for me right now before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s… all. I just… want to go home. And… rest. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. Get some rest, and don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. Maria will be with you shortly. Have a good day. .
