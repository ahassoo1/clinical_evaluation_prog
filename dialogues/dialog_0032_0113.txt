DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Pipkorn, was it? Yes, well, it's this… going to the bathroom. Too much. That’s what my wife, bless her heart, told me to come about. Keeps saying I’m spending too much time in there. I don't rightly remember why she's fussing so much, but women… always worrying about something.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it's good that your wife is attentive to your health, Mr. Segretto. Frequent urination can be a sign of several things, and it’s best to investigate. When you say “too much,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, goodness. I don’t keep track of such things. Just… more than I used to, I suppose. Used to be able to go a good stretch without having to… bother. Now it feels like I just finish and have to go again not long after. It’s… inconvenient, that’s what it is. And wakes me up at night sometimes. Though, to be fair, I’m an older man, things are bound to… loosen up a bit, aren’t they?
DOCTOR: Indeed. Age does bring about changes, Mr. Segretto. However, simply attributing it to age without further investigation would be… imprudent. You mentioned waking up at night to urinate. How many times per night would you estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're asking me to count? Goodness gracious. Not every night, mind you. Maybe… two, three times a week? Sometimes none at all. It's all rather… haphazard. I don't pay much attention to these things. Always have more important things on my mind, like the state of the garden and whether the price of wheat will go up. Does it really matter how many times? It’s the principle of the thing, being disturbed in my sleep.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Mr. Segretto. While I appreciate your… broader concerns, quantifying these occurrences helps to determine the underlying cause. Frequent nighttime urination, or nocturia, can indicate several potential issues, ranging from simple fluid intake to more significant conditions. Let’s try to be as precise as possible. On a typical week, would you say it’s closer to two times, three times, or perhaps even more than three nights that you’re getting up to urinate?
PATIENT: Goodness, you're a persistent one, aren't you? Alright, alright. Let me think… hmm. Three, I suppose. Maybe four if I've had a bit of… juice before bed. My wife likes to make rhubarb juice. It's quite good, but… well, you know. Makes you go. Four nights, then. Though I really don’t see what the fuss is about. It’s not like I’m suffering or anything. Just a bit of… inconvenience. Is that enough counting for you?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Segretto. Four nights a week is significant enough to warrant further investigation. Now, besides the rhubarb juice, do you notice any other patterns?
PATIENT: Patterns? Like what kind of patterns? I'm a farmer, Doctor, not a… pattern-finder. Well, I suppose if I drink a lot of water in the evening… it happens more. Common sense, really. And if I’ve had a particularly salty meal. Makes me thirsty, then I drink, then… you know. But that's about it. Nothing fancy. I've lived a long life, I know my body. It's just… getting older. It's the natural order of things, isn't it? Though I suppose you young doctors like to poke and prod and find something wrong with everything.
DOCTOR: While I respect your experience, Mr. Segretto, dismissing these symptoms as simply “getting older” could be… a mistake. Frequent urination, particularly at night, can be a sign of underlying conditions like diabetes, prostate enlargement, or even a urinary tract infection. We need to rule those possibilities out. I’d like to perform a brief physical exam and order a simple urine test. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re going to poke and prod? I knew it. Just what I feared. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t got time for all that. I have a garden to tend, wheat to worry about… poking around… sounds unpleasant. Is it absolutely necessary? I feel fine, other than this… bathroom business. Perhaps it's just the rhubarb juice. Could you not just tell me to drink less juice and be done with it? A urine test… honestly. It sounds… invasive. And I haven't been eating much sugar lately, so diabetes is out of the question. I’ve always been a healthy man.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, while I appreciate your assessment of your health, a urine test is a routine procedure that provides valuable information. It is not invasive, and it is crucial for ruling out potential medical concerns. To proceed responsibly, I must gather sufficient data. Dismissing your symptoms without investigation would be… unprofessional. I understand your concerns about time, but this will only take a few minutes. Will you allow me to perform the exam and order the test?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But you better be quick about it. And don't go poking around too much. Honestly, I've lived a long life and never needed so much fuss. It’s probably just the rhubarb juice, I’m telling you. But if you must… just get it over with. But I’m warning you, if it keeps me from my garden… you’ll be hearing about it. What exactly does this “exam” entail? I don’t want any surprises. And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: The exam is quite straightforward, Mr. Segretto. I will simply listen to your abdomen, palpate it gently to check for any tenderness, and then a quick neurological assessment. After that, we will collect a urine sample. It will not be painful. I assure you, it's a standard part of any medical evaluation. Please, follow me. We'll start with the abdominal exam. It will only take a few moments. And I will be as efficient as possible. It’s important to remember that ruling out potential issues is always the most prudent course of action.
PATIENT: Right. Prudent. That's what you said. Very well. Let’s get this over with, then. But be gentle, Doctor. I’m a delicate flower, you know. Especially after all these years of farming. And please, no surprises. I still think it’s the rhubarb juice.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. We’ll proceed gently. Now, if you could lie back on the examination table, please. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It helps us assess the overall health of your internal organs. Please, breathe normally. Auscultation is normal. No bruits or abnormal sounds detected. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness or discomfort.
PATIENT: Hmmph. That’s cold. This table is awfully cold. And you’re poking… rather a lot. A little tender… right there. Not painful, mind you, just… sensitive. Old age, probably. Everything’s a bit… worn out. Are you sure you need to poke so much? It’s making me nervous. And what exactly are you looking for, anyway? Just tell me if it’s the rhubarb juice and let me be on my way.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Segretto. The tenderness you’re describing requires further assessment. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes, and dismissing it as simply “old age” would be irresponsible. The palpation allows me to identify any masses, organ enlargement, or areas of inflammation. I’m not finding any significant masses, but there is mild tenderness in the lower quadrants, as you indicated. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple neurological questions. Just to ensure everything is functioning normally. Can you tell me your name and today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Neurological questions? What does that have to do with my bladder? Honestly, you doctors… always looking for something wrong. My name is Arlan Segretto. And today is… August second. 2025. Though, honestly, all the dates seem to blur together these days. I'm seventy-four years old, you know. My memory isn't what it used to be. Is this going to take much longer? I have weeding to do. And I promised my wife I’d check on the tomatoes. This is all rather disruptive, you know. Just tell me if it's the rhubarb juice and let me get back to my garden.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, your name and the date are correct, but I am assessing your overall neurological function to ensure there are no underlying factors contributing to your urinary symptoms. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Ugh. There. Happy? I haven't done much manual labor lately, you know. My wife insists I take it easy. Though, to be honest, I miss working the land. But she worries. Always worrying. Is this finally almost over? I'm starting to feel rather foolish lying here being poked and prodded. And my back is getting sore. Just tell me about the rhubarb juice.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, while rhubarb juice can certainly act as a diuretic and contribute to increased urination, your symptoms, combined with the mild tenderness and reduced grip strength, warrant further investigation. Dismissing this solely as the juice would be… a disservice to your health. I’d like to order a urine analysis to check for infection, glucose levels, and kidney function. I also recommend a basic blood test to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. Finally, I think a prostate exam is also necessary, given your age and symptoms. Will you allow me to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: A prostate exam? Absolutely not! No, no, no. That's… that's unnecessary. That's… invasive! I'm seventy-four years old, Doctor, I've lived a long life, I don't need poking around down there. Absolutely not! I’m perfectly fine, just a bit of bathroom trouble. It's the rhubarb juice, I tell you! Just give me something for the… frequent urination and let me be on my way. No blood tests, no prostate exams, absolutely not! You're trying to find something wrong where there isn't anything wrong! I'm leaving now. I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions, Doctor. And I've decided I don't need any more poking and prodding. I'm going home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I understand your reluctance, but as a physician, I have a professional obligation to ensure your health and well-being. While you have the right to refuse treatment, I strongly advise against it. Ignoring potential underlying conditions could have serious consequences. I cannot in good conscience simply prescribe medication without a proper diagnosis. I recommend you reconsider. However, if you are adamant about refusing the tests, I can provide you with a referral to another physician. But I must document your refusal in your medical record. Would you like me to proceed with the referral?
PATIENT: Another physician? No. Absolutely not! I don’t want another doctor poking and prodding me. Honestly, the amount of fuss you're making over a bit of bathroom trouble is… ridiculous. You’re trying to turn a simple issue into something complicated. Look, I'll tell you what. Just… just give me something for the frequent urination. Anything. A pill, a potion, whatever. And I’ll promise to drink less rhubarb juice. Is that acceptable? Just… make it stop. I don't want any more tests, no more exams, no more fuss. Just a simple solution. Is that too much to ask? Please. Just help me get back to my garden.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I must reiterate that prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis is… not ideal. However, given your adamant refusal of further investigation, I can offer a temporary solution to manage your symptoms. I can prescribe a mild anticholinergic medication, which may help reduce bladder contractions and decrease the frequency of urination. However, please understand that this is a symptomatic treatment and does not address the underlying cause. It's crucial to monitor your symptoms closely. If they worsen or new symptoms develop, you must seek medical attention immediately. And I strongly advise you to reconsider a more thorough evaluation in the future. Do you understand these limitations?
PATIENT: Limitations? Yes, yes, I understand. Drink less rhubarb juice, take a pill, and don't bother you anymore. That’s all I need. Honestly, you doctors… always making mountains out of molehills. Fine. I'll take your pill. Just… write it down quickly. I have weeding to do. And my wife will be wondering where I am. Just… get it over with. And please, don't lecture me about rhubarb juice again.
DOCTOR: Here is the prescription. Please take it as directed and be mindful of the potential side effects, which are outlined in the leaflet. This form details the importance of follow-up care and the risks of delaying a proper diagnosis. I strongly advise you to reconsider a more thorough evaluation in the future. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. This is all I need. Honestly, the amount of fuss you’ve made… Just… thank you. I think. And please, don’t bother calling me about the rhubarb juice. And tell your wife… hello. I have weeding to do.
