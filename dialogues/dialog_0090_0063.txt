DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kur. It’s my back. It’s been really hurting. Worse than usual, and… well, you know why, right? About the other thing. The cancer. It just… feels different this time.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see your history here. And you're feeling this back pain is related to the cancer?
PATIENT: I think so. It's hard to say for sure, you know? It’s just… where it is, and how bad it is. It's not like a pulled muscle. It’s… deep. And it goes all the way around. Like a tight band. Does that make sense? I don't know a lot about… body stuff.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Meigs. "Tight band" is a good description. And you're right to bring up the cancer. We always have to consider that when something new happens. Now, can you tell me a little more about when this pain started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… three days ago? It was just a little ache at first. I thought maybe I slept wrong. But then yesterday… yesterday it got really bad. I had to ask my daughter to help me get out of bed. It hasn't gotten better at all. It’s pretty constant, even when I’m sitting.
DOCTOR: Constant pain, starting three days ago… and worsening. And it’s impacting your ability to do things, like getting out of bed. Alright. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well… nothing really makes it better. I tried some of those heat pads, but they didn't do much. Sitting is bad. Standing is bad. Lying down… sometimes it's a little better, but not much. Moving around… makes it worse, for sure. It’s just… always there, you know? A dull ache, with sharp pains if I move the wrong way. I took some of the pills the last doctor gave me, but they didn't help this time.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. And what pills were those, Ms. Meigs?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me see… They were… white, small ones. I think they said… Percocet? Something like that. I only had a few left from the last time. I finished them yesterday. I didn’t want to take more without asking, because I know they're… strong. And they didn’t even touch the pain this time, so I figured there wasn’t much point.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's good you didn't continue those without speaking to me. Percocet, and ineffective this time. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your back, obviously. Can you tell me if you've had any other symptoms—any numbness, tingling, weakness in your legs, or problems with your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: No numbness or tingling. My legs feel okay, though they're a little shaky sometimes, but that’s just from the pain, I think. No problems with… with going to the bathroom. Everything feels normal there. Just the back pain. And… I’ve been more tired than usual, but I figured that was also from the pain. It’s hard to sleep when it hurts so much. Okay, I can lie down.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have you lie flat on your stomach first, if you’re able. I’m going to palpate your spine and the muscles around it. Try to relax as much as possible, and tell me if anything feels particularly tender.
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, I’m flat. Just… be careful. It hurts to move. I’ll try to relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just feeling for any areas of tenderness or muscle spasm. Hmm… There is definite tenderness along the thoracic spine – right here and here. And some muscle guarding. No step-off deformity that I can detect, but there's significant discomfort with even gentle palpation. Now, I’m going to gently ask you to try and bend forward and to each side, if you can tolerate it. Tell me if anything changes the pain or causes new pain.
PATIENT: Ow… yes, that’s… very tender. And bending… oh, Doctor, I don’t think I can bend very much. It hurts too much. No, stop. It’s really bad. Like… like something is going to break. It’s not just a muscle thing, is it? It feels… deeper. Sorry. I’m probably making this harder.
DOCTOR: No, you're not making it harder, Ms. Meigs. It's good you're telling me what you're feeling. And you're right, this isn't just a muscle issue. Given your history, and the location and nature of the pain… We need to consider the possibility of vertebral involvement. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, just to get a baseline, and then we'll discuss some imaging we need to order. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Um… I don’t think so. I’ve never had… imaging before, really. Just… X-rays once, a long time ago. For my shoulder. No, I don’t remember any allergies. I'm a little scared now, Doctor. What kind of imaging? And… what are you thinking it is? Is it… bad? I'm sorry, I'm being a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be scared, Ms. Meigs. It's good to ask questions. I want to explain everything clearly. We need to get an MRI of your thoracic spine. An MRI will give us detailed pictures of the bones and nerves in your back. It's the best way to see if there's any involvement from the cancer, and to understand the cause of your pain. It's not necessarily "bad," but it's important we know what we're dealing with so we can create the best plan for you. We need to rule things out. Now, before we proceed, let's quickly review your medication list again to make absolutely certain there are no contraindications for the MRI, and then we’ll get the orders placed. Do you remember anything else you've taken, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Okay… MRI. I understand. Pictures. That’s good. To know. Okay. Let me think… I take a little bit of… Tylenol, sometimes. For headaches. Just the regular kind. And… I take a vitamin D supplement. My daughter told me to. She says I don’t get enough sun. That's it, I think. Really. Just the Tylenol and the Vitamin D. And the Tylenol is only when my head hurts, not every day. I haven’t taken any Tylenol today.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tylenol occasionally and Vitamin D. That’s helpful. No recent surgeries or any metal implants, correct?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. And… no metal. Nothing. Just… me. Is this going to take long? The MRI? I have to get my daughter to pick up the kids from school. She’s already stressed enough.
DOCTOR: The MRI itself will take about 30-45 minutes, Ms. Meigs. However, there is usually some preparation time involved, and it may take a bit to get you scheduled. I’ll have the radiology department call you directly to arrange an appointment that works best. And I will make sure we get the results as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I am going to prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant to help with the pain and spasms. It won’t fix the problem, but hopefully it will provide some relief. We'll discuss the results of the MRI when we have them and formulate a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Muscle relaxant… okay. That sounds good. Something for the pain would be… wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. I just… I just want to feel better. And get back to helping my daughter. She needs me. Will the radiology department call me today? I don’t want to forget. Or… will I need to call them?
DOCTOR: Yes, radiology will call you today to schedule the MRI, Ms. Meigs. I will make a note on the order to have them prioritize getting you in as quickly as possible. And I'll have my nurse call you tomorrow to check in and make sure they’ve contacted you. Here is the prescription for the muscle relaxant. Please take it as directed, and let me know if you experience any side effects. Now, before you go, I want to reiterate – if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or a high fever – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Okay, I understand. Radiology today, nurse tomorrow, and… emergency room if things get worse. Weakness, bladder, fever. Got it. No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Kur. You explained everything so well. And… you listened. That means a lot. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I'll see you soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
