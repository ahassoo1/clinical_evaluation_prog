DOCTOR: Hi Deloris, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly, I can’t quite recall everything. Something about a letter…for a pet? My niece, she said I needed one. She handles most of my…business, you see. I just needed to get it sorted, that’s all. A bit of a formality, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like this is more of a check-up related to a letter your niece requested. We can definitely sort that out. Just to be sure I have everything correct for the records – and to make sure nothing else is going on – could you tell me a little bit about what the letter was for?
PATIENT: Ugh, records. Honestly. Look, it's a dog. A little fluffy thing. My grand-daughter, she wanted me to get a letter so she could…keep him. Something about the landlord, I think? He’s being difficult. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to these things. It's a perfectly lovely dog, though. Very well-behaved. Probably better behaved than some people I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the letter is regarding permission to keep a dog at your residence, due to landlord concerns. That makes sense. And it sounds like you're otherwise feeling well?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, perfectly fine! Aside from the usual aches and pains, you know, for someone my age. Nothing to bother you with. I'm not one for complaining. Honestly, I think these landlords just like to make trouble. A perfectly good dog… It’s just a small thing, really. This letter is the only reason I'm here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just to be thorough – and to make sure we cover all bases – could you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t do general health. I eat when I’m hungry, sleep when I’m tired. I’m not one for all those check-ups and tests. What does that have to do with a dog, anyway? Are you questioning my ability to care for a fluffy little animal? Honestly, it’s a bit insulting.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, not at all, Deloris. I'm absolutely not questioning your ability to care for a dog! I just ask routine questions to get a complete picture. It helps me understand if anything might affect your overall well-being. It’s standard procedure. For example, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those big words... I think…the doctor a long time ago said something about my…pressure? It wasn’t anything serious. Just told me to watch my salt intake. And…I’m a bit heavy, I suppose. But who isn’t these days? Honestly, all that talk about numbers and conditions... it’s just exhausting. Is this really necessary for a letter about a dog?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, managed with dietary changes, and you've noticed some weight gain. That’s helpful to know. And it is relevant, Deloris. Sometimes seemingly minor things can impact your energy levels and ability to care for…well, anything, really. To finish up the medical history part, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Oh, goodness. Let me think… There was that time with my gall bladder, ages ago. A very unpleasant experience, I assure you. And…I broke my wrist once, falling off a chair while reaching for a particularly delicious mango. But that was…decades ago. Nothing major. Honestly, I’m quite healthy for my age, you know. I have good genes. My mother lived to be ninety! Is that enough information, finally?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Gallbladder removal and a broken wrist, both in the past. And a family history of longevity, that’s wonderful. Now, just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, now you’re just fishing. Let me see… I take a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. A small blue pill. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take one of those…Melatonin things. My niece buys them for me. Honestly, I don’t even remember the names of these things. Just little pills. Nothing important. It’s not like I’m on a whole cocktail of medication, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an as-needed medication for arthritis and melatonin for sleep. I appreciate you telling me. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, I don't believe in allergies. A little sniffle here and there is just part of life. But… I think, years ago, I had a reaction to some sort of shellfish. A rather nasty rash. But that was decades ago, and I haven't touched shellfish since. And… I’m a bit sensitive to dust, I suppose. Makes me sneeze. But that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Honestly, people make such a fuss about these things. Is this finally over? I really just need the letter for the dog.
DOCTOR: Alright, we're almost there. So, a history of a shellfish allergy and some sensitivity to dust. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Honestly, Doctor, what is a lifestyle? I live. I eat. I sleep. I watch television. I visit my grand-children. I used to dance, years ago. But my knees aren't what they used to be. I don’t do anything strenuous. I'm retired, you see. I spend most of my time relaxing. Is this what you were looking for? Honestly, it's not a very exciting life, but it's my life.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Deloris. It sounds like a very pleasant life! And it's good to know you’re enjoying your retirement. Now, just one final question, and then we can get to the letter. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother would have had a fit! And alcohol…well, I might have a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally. A very small glass. Just to relax. Nothing excessive, you understand. I’m not a drinker. Honestly, I prefer a nice cup of tea. Much healthier, you know. Is that the last question, finally? I’m starting to feel a bit lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s everything, thank you. You’ve given me a very clear picture of your health. Now, let's talk about this letter for your dog. Do you know what specifically the landlord is requesting?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. Finally. Honestly, my niece handled most of that. Something about proof of vaccinations, I think? And…a statement saying I’m a responsible pet owner. Something along those lines. He just seems…hesitant. A very nice man, I believe, but very particular. Honestly, I can't remember the details. My niece said it was all very straightforward. She's very efficient, you know. Can you just…write something saying I'm a perfectly capable pet owner and the dog is well-behaved? That should be enough, shouldn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I can certainly write a letter stating that you’re a responsible pet owner and that the dog appears to be well-behaved. To make it more official, it would be helpful if you have the dog's vaccination records with you. Do you happen to have those?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Vaccination records… I don't think so. My niece probably has them. Honestly, I leave all those details to her. She's so much more organized than I am. Would it be alright if I just…brought them in later? She promised to email them to me. Perhaps she’s already sent them?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. We can proceed without them for now, and you can bring them in when you have them. We’ll just include a statement that the dog is up-to-date on vaccinations based on your report. Okay, I’ve drafted a letter stating that you are a responsible pet owner, that the dog is well-behaved, and that you will provide proof of vaccinations as soon as possible. Would you like me to read it over with you before we print it?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, dear. Yes, please do. Honestly, my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. And I don’t trust myself to read small print. Thank you so much for your patience, Doctor. Honestly, this has been quite an ordeal. Just a small letter…you wouldn’t believe the fuss.
DOCTOR: "To Whom It May Concern: I am writing to confirm that Deloris Wrye is a responsible and caring pet owner. During my consultation with Ms. Wrye today, August 2, 2025, she demonstrated a clear commitment to the well-being of her dog. Ms. Wrye reports that her dog is well-behaved and up-to-date on all necessary vaccinations, and she will provide documentation of vaccinations upon request. I trust Ms. Wrye to provide a safe and healthy environment for her pet. Sincerely, Dr. Courtnee Maskal, Family Medicine." Does that sound accurate to you, Deloris?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, perfectly lovely. That sounds just right. "Demonstrated a clear commitment..." Very flattering. And "trust Ms. Wrye..." That’s good. Very good indeed. Perhaps you could add something about how much joy the dog brings to my life? It would be nice to mention that. But if not, it’s alright. It’s perfectly fine as is. Can we just get it printed now? I’m rather eager to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I can add a sentence about the joy the dog brings to your life. Just one moment... "To Whom It May Concern: I am writing to confirm that Deloris Wrye is a responsible and caring pet owner. During my consultation with Ms. Wrye today, August 2, 2025, she demonstrated a clear commitment to the well-being of her dog. Ms. Wrye reports that her dog is well-behaved and up-to-date on all necessary vaccinations, and she will provide documentation of vaccinations upon request. Ms. Wrye also expressed the joy her dog brings to her life. I trust Ms. Wrye to provide a safe and healthy environment for her pet. Sincerely, Dr. Courtnee Maskal, Family Medicine." Is that to your satisfaction?
PATIENT: Oh, that's perfect! Absolutely perfect. "Expressed the joy..." Lovely wording. Very sensitive. Yes, please, let’s print it. I can't wait to show my niece. She’ll be so pleased. Honestly, this has been a much smoother experience than I anticipated. Thank you, Doctor. You’re a lifesaver.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Deloris. I’m glad I could help. Here you go. Just let me know if there’s anything else I can assist you with. And please don't hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if you have any health concerns. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your time with your dog! Is there anything else for today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you again, dear! This is wonderful. No, no, that’s all. Truly. I think I've taken up enough of your time already. Honestly, I didn’t realize a letter about a dog would require so much paperwork. I think I'll be on my way now. Thank you again for your patience and understanding. I appreciate everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Deloris. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Have a lovely day!
