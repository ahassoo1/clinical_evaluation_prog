DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mrs. Cassimatis, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. It's this itch... everywhere, really. It's been driving me crazy for a few weeks now. Not like a bug bite, just... constant. It's worse at night, I think.
DOCTOR: Everywhere, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty much. Arms, legs, back... even my tummy. It’s not red or bumpy, not usually anyway. Sometimes it looks a little dry, but mostly it just…feels like ants marching under my skin, you know? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Let me think... not really. I mean, the usual aches and pains of getting older, ha! No new soaps or lotions, no new foods… I’ve been cooking the same things for years, pretty much. Oh! Wait… I did start using a new laundry detergent a few weeks ago, right around when this started. It's supposed to be good for sensitive skin, but… maybe it’s not? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Laundry detergent…right. And how’s your sleep been?
PATIENT: Oh, not great, dear. Not great at all. The itching keeps me up, of course. I toss and turn. I used to be a sound sleeper, but now… I wake up a few times a night, and sometimes I just can't get back to sleep. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other skin conditions, like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never had anything like eczema or… what was it, psoriasis? No, I’ve always just had normal skin, you know? A little dry in the winter, but nothing serious. My mother had good skin, and I always thought I inherited that. This is just…weird.
DOCTOR: Any known allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I eat everything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not food, not plants… nothing. I used to garden a lot, and never had a problem with poison ivy or anything like that. Oh! Except for dust. I’m a little sensitive to dust, makes me sneeze, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. It's been a little high, the doctor told me to take a small pill every day. That's it. Nothing else. See? Just this little one.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. My mother, she lived to be 85, very healthy. My father… he had diabetes, I think. And my brother, he had heart trouble. Not much in the way of skin problems, though, as far as I know. It’s hard to remember, you know? It was a long time ago. Everyone always just worried about heart problems and things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's have a look at your skin. If you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Go ahead, dear. It’s probably not much to see, just…dryness, maybe? But you take a look.
DOCTOR: Hm. Not much redness, as you said. No visible rash or lesions. Skin feels…slightly dry, but not significantly. Let me check your back. Could you lean forward for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s a little hard to bend like this, my back isn't what it used to be, but I can manage. Go ahead, dear.
DOCTOR: Still no rash. Some dryness. It's hard to say. It sounds like it could be a simple case of dry skin, exacerbated by stress or…perhaps the detergent. We can try a topical steroid cream. Nothing strong, just for a week or so. And a good moisturizer. Cetaphin or Eucerin, something like that.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that sounds…reasonable. A cream, alright. I suppose I can try that. And you think it could be the detergent, even though it’s supposed to be gentle? I hate to think it’s something I’m using.
DOCTOR: It's possible. These things happen. Sometimes “sensitive skin” formulas just don’t agree with people. I’ll write you a prescription for the cream, and you should see some improvement in a few days. If it doesn't clear up, or gets worse, then we can consider other possibilities.
PATIENT: Alright. And the moisturizer... you said Cetaphin or… something? How often should I put it on? And is there anything else I should be doing? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Twice a day. After you shower, and before bed. Avoid hot water. It dries out your skin. And… avoid scratching, if you can. Common sense, really. Here. This will have instructions. Anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. No, I don't think so. Just…thank you, dear. I appreciate you looking at it. I hope this cream works. It’s just so uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, if it doesn't improve, come back and see me. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. You too. Have a good day. .
