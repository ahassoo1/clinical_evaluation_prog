DOCTOR: Good morning, Reneisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and I haven’t changed anything in my diet or exercise routine. It’s rather perplexing, to be honest. It’s been happening for a few months now, and I wanted to see if we could figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Unexpected weight gain can be worrying, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. A few months, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately four months now, starting… let me think… around the end of April, I believe. It wasn’t rapid at first, just a pound or two, but it's been more consistent lately. About a pound a week, perhaps. It's… unsettling, because I truly haven't altered my habits.
DOCTOR: Alright, about a pound a week for the last few months, starting around the end of April. And you’re certain there haven’t been any changes to your diet or exercise routine during that time?
PATIENT: Positive. Absolutely certain. I prepare most of my own meals, and my husband and I walk our dog, Barnabas, every evening – same route, same pace. We’ve always been quite… regular, you could say. It's not as if I’ve suddenly started indulging in sweets or skipping my walks. It’s just… happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And when you say ‘regular’ with your walks, roughly how long and how often are we talking?
PATIENT: Approximately forty-five minutes each evening, Doctor. Every single evening, barring exceptionally inclement weather, of course. We live in the countryside, so the weather does sometimes dictate our plans. But normally, forty-five minutes. A brisk pace – not a race, but not a leisurely stroll, either.
DOCTOR: Right, forty-five minutes daily, barring bad weather. Good. And have you noticed any other changes alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. Now that you mention it, I’ve been feeling… more tired than usual, even after a full night’s sleep. And, this is perhaps a small detail, but my skin has been rather dry lately. I’ve had to increase my lotion usage, significantly. I wouldn't say it's itchy, just… parched.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and dry skin along with the weight gain. Thank you. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health history. Do you have any known medical conditions currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. No chronic illnesses, no major surgeries, nothing of that nature. I have regular check-ups with my family physician, and he’s always said I’m in remarkably good health for my age. Just the usual seasonal allergies, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And how about in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had high blood pressure in her later years, and my father… he had type 2 diabetes, but it was well-managed with diet and medication. Both have passed now, unfortunately. And my husband’s side, they’ve had the typical things – heart trouble, arthritis… nothing particularly alarming, I suppose. Is that the sort of information you require, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Knowing about your family history gives me a better picture. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer a natural approach when possible, and thankfully, I haven’t required any regular medication. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, and a multivitamin during the winter months, purely as a preventative measure. I find fresh air and a healthy diet are usually sufficient.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or supplements. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to anything – foods, medications, environmental factors?
PATIENT: Just seasonal allergies, as I mentioned before. Pollen, mostly. I get a bit of a sniffle and itchy eyes in the spring and fall, but nothing that requires more than a tissue and perhaps an over-the-counter antihistamine. No food allergies, no reactions to medications that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a concerning reaction to anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. And before we proceed, could you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am approximately one hundred and fifty-five centimeters tall – that’s about five feet and one inch, I believe. And my current weight… …is eighty-three kilograms. It's a little disheartening to state it, truthfully. It’s been creeping up, as you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Reneisha. One hundred and fifty-five centimeters, eighty-three kilograms. Okay, and just one more quick question before we move on to a physical exam: do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. Never have, never will. My husband doesn’t smoke either. We both believe in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and that includes avoiding such habits. My father smoked for a period of time, and it did not end well, so I was raised with a rather strong aversion to it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s excellent. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It's very helpful. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and thyroid, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I understand it’s necessary, and I want to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. I do appreciate your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 92. Your heart sounds are normal, a regular rate and rhythm. Lung sounds are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Thyroid feels normal in size and consistency, no nodules detected. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Have you noticed that swelling before?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have noticed the swelling in my ankles, actually. It’s been gradually increasing over the past few weeks, coinciding with the weight gain, I believe. It isn't terribly painful, just… noticeable. Especially in the evenings. I attributed it to standing too long when gardening, but perhaps it’s connected to something else?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. The timing is certainly noteworthy. Now, given your symptoms – unexplained weight gain, fatigue, dry skin, ankle swelling – and your blood pressure, I'd like to order a few blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. We'll check your thyroid function, blood sugar, kidney function, and a complete blood count. These tests will help us rule out several possibilities, including hypothyroidism and diabetes. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. I trust your judgment implicitly. Hypothyroidism… that’s what my aunt had, I believe. It caused similar symptoms. Blood tests seem like a logical next step. Please, proceed with whatever you deem necessary. The sooner we have some answers, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write you a lab requisition. You can get these tests done at the clinic lab, or at any lab of your choosing. Once the results are back, usually within a few days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or severe symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend you continue with your regular healthy habits – maintain a balanced diet, get regular exercise, and ensure you get adequate rest. I’ll also give you a handout on managing mild swelling in your ankles—elevate your legs when possible and stay hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. You’ve been remarkably thorough, and you’ve addressed all of my concerns. I appreciate your attentiveness and clear explanations. Thank you for taking the time to listen and for formulating a plan. I shall schedule the blood tests as soon as possible. And I will be sure to contact you if anything changes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Reneisha. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
