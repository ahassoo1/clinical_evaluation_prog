DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Krok, 83 years old. Good. Well, come in, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, Doctor... Overgaard, is it? Yes. A rather… delicate matter, you see. Something of an… emission. An unwelcome one. It’s been… present. For a spell. Not a pleasant sensation, I assure you.
DOCTOR: An emission, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. A… discharge. From… down there. It’s quite bothersome, frankly. One doesn’t expect such things at my age. It’s… unusual. And frankly, rather embarrassing to discuss. Though, I suppose one must when it is causing… discomfort. Do you follow? I haven't the slightest idea why it's happening.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Krok. Just need to clarify a few things. When you say "for a spell," how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… Dates escape me these days. Let me think. Before… before the heatwave, certainly. It was… cooler then. Perhaps a month? Six weeks? It's all a blur, truthfully. My wife, bless her heart, notices things more than I do. She mentioned it first, said it was… visible. A most undignified observation, I must say.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately six weeks. And it’s visible… to you and your wife. Is there any pain associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Pain… not precisely pain, Doctor. More… irritation. A slight… burning. And… a feeling of… dampness. Most unpleasant. It doesn’t ache, if that makes sense. Just… bothersome. I wouldn’t call it excruciating, but it certainly isn’t… comfortable. It makes one feel rather… unclean. Is that a sufficient description?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Mr. Krok. Irritation and a burning sensation. Is there any odor associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Odor… well. One doesn't seek such odors, Doctor. Yes, I suppose there is. Not… pleasant. A rather… stale smell. Not overpowering, thankfully, but… noticeable. My wife, again, was the one to point it out. She has a rather sensitive nose, you see. I myself barely register these things anymore. It's… a shame, really. Though perhaps it's just as well.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has there been any change in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Urinary habits? What do you mean, Doctor? Do you mean… going to the lavatory? It’s… normal, as far as I can tell. Perhaps a little more frequent, now that you mention it. But I drink a good deal of tea, you see. That explains it, I should think. No burning during, if that is what you are asking. Just… more often. Is that what you mean by ‘habits’? This is all rather… clinical, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I meant. Frequency. Okay, more frequent urination. And no pain with urination. Have you noticed any blood in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Good heavens, no! I should hope not! No, absolutely not. My wife would have said something immediately. She keeps a very close watch on… everything, you see. No blood, Doctor. Definitely not. That sounds… alarming. Are you suggesting something serious? This is all rather upsetting, you know. I came in for a discharge, not… blood.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Krok, I am simply trying to gather all the necessary information. No need to be alarmed. Just routine questions. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or body aches recently?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? No, no. Nothing of the sort. I get a little warm in the afternoons, naturally, it’s been quite hot, as I said. But no fever. And no aches. I'm an old man, Doctor, I always have a few aches. That's just… life. A little stiffness in the joints, perhaps. But nothing… significant. Honestly, I feel perfectly well, aside from this… unfortunate business. It's just… degrading, you know? To be discussing such things with a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, chills or body aches. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. That’s a long story, Doctor. I've lived a long life, you see. I had a touch of… something… in my chest years ago. They gave me pills. It went away. My wife handles all the details now, truthfully. She'll remind me if there's anything… crucial. I believe I have… elevated something… in my blood. Cholesterol, perhaps? She keeps talking about numbers. Honestly, it all goes in one ear and out the other. I suppose I’m generally… healthy, for my age. As healthy as one can be, anyway. Does that suffice? I really don't recall specifics. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to confirm some of this. Has anything like this discharge ever happened before?
PATIENT: Before… let me see. No. No, I don't believe so. Never. Not in my recollection. Certainly not to this extent. I’ve had… minor ailments, of course. A cold here, a cough there. But nothing like this… emission. It’s… unprecedented. It's quite unsettling, frankly. Perhaps it’s the tea? My wife says I drink too much. But I enjoy a good cup of Earl Grey, you see. It's a comfort. But no, never this before. I assure you. It's... new. And rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior history of this. Now, any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hospitalizations… Let me think. Oh, years ago, a minor procedure on my… knee, I believe. A sports injury, from my youth. A rather foolish endeavor, now that I think about it. And once, a brief stay for… appendicitis, I think. But that was decades ago. A very long time. Aside from that… nothing significant. Nothing that I recall, at least. It was all a blur, you see. My wife, again, would know the specifics. She has an excellent memory for such things. I'm afraid my recollections are rather… hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knee surgery and appendectomy, decades ago. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, yes. A little pill for my… blood pressure, I think. And something for my… joints. They make them ache less, you see. And sometimes, when I can't sleep, a little something to… calm me. But that’s only when necessary. And I take a vitamin, a multi-vitamin, every day. My wife insists. She says it’s good for me. A little orange pill. Aside from that… no. Nothing else. I prefer to avoid pills whenever possible, you see. Too many side effects, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication, something for your joints, a sleep aid as needed, and a multi-vitamin. One last question before we move on to the physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. Never had any allergies in my life. Not to food, not to pills, not to anything. I can eat anything, drink anything, touch anything. A perfectly robust constitution, you see. My wife always says so. She's tried to get me to be careful, but I'm perfectly fine. No allergies whatsoever. Thank goodness for that, you know. It would be most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Krok. Thank you for that thorough history. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. Just a quick examination of the area to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Oh. Well. I hadn’t anticipated… such a thoroughness. It's… rather personal, you see. But… if it’s necessary, I suppose. Just… please be gentle, Doctor. And… discreet. This is all quite… undignified. But if it will help determine the cause of this… emission, then very well. Proceed, I suppose. But quickly, if you would be so kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to examine your abdomen and then, with your permission, a quick examination of the genital area. We'll start with your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. I'll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Very well. But… do be gentle, Doctor. It's quite sensitive, you see. A little… pressure, perhaps. Not pain, exactly. Just… awareness. My abdomen isn't as firm as it once was, you know. Age, you see. But no, nothing… alarming. Just a little pressure. And… a sense of being… prodded. Is that alright? I'm not accustomed to this sort of… scrutiny.
DOCTOR: Okay. Abdomen is soft, non-tender to palpation. No masses appreciated. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants. Now, to proceed with the genital exam. I understand this is sensitive, and I will be as quick and respectful as possible. Please let me know if you experience any pain or discomfort. I will be using a gloved hand for the examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is… most unpleasant. A gloved hand… I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary. But please, Doctor. Be quick. And… discreet. This is… a most undignified situation. And… do be gentle. I repeat, gentle. It's… sensitive, you see. Very sensitive. Proceed, I suppose, but with the utmost caution. And… perhaps a distraction? A conversation? Anything to… divert my attention? This is… deeply unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krok. I'm just going to take a look now. I do observe some redness and mild swelling of the glans. And I’m noticing a small amount of discharge. It appears to be purulent, meaning it has some pus in it. It's not a large amount, but it's present. It doesn't appear to be acutely inflamed, but there is some irritation. Based on this initial examination, it could be a number of things - a mild infection, potentially a sexually transmitted infection, or even a local irritation. To be certain, we’ll need to take a sample of the discharge to send to the lab for analysis. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Infection? Sexually transmitted…? Good heavens, no! I have been… happily married for sixty years! A most devoted relationship, I assure you. This is… preposterous! A local irritation… perhaps. But an infection? Absolutely not! A sample…? Oh dear. This is becoming increasingly… unpleasant. Must we? I suppose… if it will definitively rule out… such things. But please, Doctor. Be as quick as possible. And… discreet. This is… deeply embarrassing. A swab, I presume? Oh dear, oh dear. Very well. Proceed, I suppose. But swiftly.
DOCTOR: Yes, a swab is all we need, Mr. Krok. Just a quick and gentle collection. It may feel slightly uncomfortable, but it should only take a moment. Alright, that's done. I’ve labeled the sample, and we’ll send it to the lab for testing. It should take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a course of antibiotics as a precautionary measure, just to rule out any potential infection. Would you have any allergies to any antibiotics?
PATIENT: Finally. Thank heavens that’s done. Yes, antibiotics… Perhaps. My wife keeps a list of my allergies. Let me see… Penicillin, I believe. A most unpleasant reaction. Made me… quite ill. And… tetracycline, if I recall correctly. Caused… stomach upset. Aside from those two, I believe I’m generally… tolerant. But please, double-check with my wife. She has a far superior memory than I do. This is… unsettling, you know? To be discussing such things. And… an infection? It's… preposterous. But if you deem it necessary, then very well. Proceed, I suppose. But gently. And discreetly.
DOCTOR: Okay, penicillin and tetracycline allergy noted. I'll prescribe you a course of azithromycin, a different class of antibiotic, which should be safe for you. It’s a single dose, so you’ll only need to take one pill. Here’s the prescription. Take one pill today and then, after the results come back from the lab, we’ll determine if any further treatment is needed. We'll also need to send a urine sample. We'll need that to rule out an upper infection. Do you have any questions about the medication or the tests?
PATIENT: Azithromycin… A single dose, you say? That's… preferable. And a urine sample… oh dear. More samples. Very well. I suppose. But this is… increasingly inconvenient, you know? My wife will be most… displeased. And what if the results come back… unfavorable? What if it is… something unpleasant? Are you certain this is necessary, Doctor? Are you certain it couldn't be… simply a local irritation? I'm… rather concerned, you see. And… apprehensive. I simply wish to return to my normal life, you know? A quiet life, with my wife. And without… samples. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Krok. I assure you, we're taking a cautious approach. We need to rule out any potential infections to ensure we're providing you with the best possible care. While it could be a simple irritation, it’s important to get a definitive diagnosis. The urine sample will help us to determine if there is any infection in your urinary tract. If the results come back negative, then we can explore other causes and treat accordingly. We'll start with the antibiotics and the urine test, and then re-evaluate based on the results. I understand it’s inconvenient, but it’s a necessary step. I’ll make a note in your chart to have my nurse call you in a few days to follow up on the test results and see how you are feeling. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, increased pain, or difficulty urinating, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I suppose… I trust your judgment. Though I remain… apprehensive. And inconvenienced, naturally. My wife will be… displeased. Very well. I shall take the pill. And provide the sample. And… await the results. I suppose there’s nothing else to be done. But please, Doctor… do be thorough. And discreet. Thank you… I think. I shall see you… later. And please… convey my apologies to my wife for the inconvenience. She’s… a most understanding woman, but even she has her limits.
