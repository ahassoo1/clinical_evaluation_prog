DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning. Quicksey, you say? Okay. Chest… feels funny. And heart… goes too fast sometimes. Blood pressure, wife says it’s high. She makes me check it. Always worrying. Just want to be quick, okay? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand you’d like to be quick, and we’ll do our best to be efficient. It sounds like you’re experiencing some concerning symptoms – a feeling in your chest, a fast heartbeat at times, and elevated blood pressure as noted by your wife. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me more about this “funny” feeling in your chest?
PATIENT: Funny… like tight. Not pain, exactly. More… squeezed. Happens when I get upset. Wife yells a lot. Makes it worse. And… sometimes just happens. No reason. Just… tight. Been happening… oh, a long time now. Years. Never bothered telling doctor before. Didn’t seem important. Now wife makes a fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a tightness in your chest, not a sharp pain, and it seems to be worse when you're upset, but also happens without a clear trigger. It’s been going on for years, but your wife is now encouraging you to get it checked out. I appreciate you coming in to discuss this with me. When this tightness occurs, does it radiate anywhere – for example, to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Radiate? What does that mean? You use too many big words. Like… does it go somewhere? Sometimes… arm feels heavy. Left arm. Not always. And… maybe jaw feels… tight too. Like when I chew gum too much. Is that what you mean? Look, I’m not a doctor. Just tell me if I’m dying, okay? This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask me to explain things more clearly, Mr. Sobkowicz. "Radiate" simply means whether the feeling spreads from your chest to other areas of your body. And you explained it perfectly – whether it travels to your arm or jaw, for example. It's good you mentioned it does go to your left arm and sometimes your jaw. That’s important information. I understand your concern about wasting time, and I want to assure you we will work efficiently to figure out what’s going on. It’s not necessarily about dying, but these symptoms definitely warrant investigation. Let’s start with some basic questions, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood… something. Wife says I have it. Takes pills. Lots of pills. And… cholesterol. Something about fat. She makes me eat… special food. I don’t like it. Diabetes? No. Never heard of that. Old man sickness. I used to be strong. Worked hard all my life. Don't need fancy names for getting old. You write it down, okay? Just write what I tell you. Not what my wife says.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Sobkowicz. So, you've been told you have high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and you’re currently taking medication for those. You haven't been diagnosed with diabetes. And you'd prefer I document your own understanding of your medical history, rather than relying solely on your wife's account. That’s perfectly fine. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Once. Long time ago. Army. Shrapnel. Leg. Not important now. Healed fine. Surgeries… maybe? Wife makes me go to the… eye doctor. They put drops in. That's it. Nothing big. Not like… broken bones or anything. I’m a tough man. Don’t break easily. Stop asking about the past. What about now? What’s wrong with me now? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. I apologize if I’m taking too long with these questions. Knowing your history helps me understand what might be going on now. You had shrapnel injury to your leg during your time in the Army, and you regularly see an eye doctor for check-ups. Otherwise, no major surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has had heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family? Hmph. Mother… died old. Very old. Father… worked too hard. Just… stopped. Never saw a doctor. They didn't have doctors back then. Brother… drank too much. Not healthy. That's all I know. We didn’t talk about… feelings. Just worked. No one worried about hearts or… blood. Waste of time. Look, can we get this over with? I’m starting to feel… tight. Again.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like there isn't a strong family history of these specific conditions that you're aware of. Given that you're starting to feel the tightness again, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then we can discuss next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Quickly. And… don’t tell me everything is fine if it’s not. I can tell when you're lying. Wife does that all the time. Just tell me the truth. And stop talking so much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. Your blood pressure is elevated – 160/95. Your heart rate is a bit fast – 92 beats per minute, and I am detecting a slightly irregular rhythm. I also hear a… murmur. It's subtle, but present. Your lungs sound clear. Given your symptoms – the chest tightness, the fast, irregular heart rate, the elevated blood pressure, and the murmur – I recommend we order an EKG, or electrocardiogram, to get a better look at your heart’s electrical activity. We should also run some blood tests, including a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall health and rule out any other potential causes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Murmur? Irregular? What does that mean? Is it bad? Just… tell me straight. Am I going to die? Don’t give me tests. I hate tests. Just tell me what's wrong. And can’t you give me something for the tightness now? It’s getting worse. This is… ridiculous. I want to go home. Now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your frustration and anxiety. You're right to want answers, and I'm not trying to avoid them. "Murmur" simply means an extra sound your heart is making. It can be perfectly normal, or it can indicate a problem with your heart valves. The irregularity in your heart rhythm means your heart isn’t beating as evenly as it should. These findings, combined with your chest tightness, do require further investigation. I would not recommend ignoring them. The EKG and blood tests will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on and help me determine the best course of action. I can offer you a nitroglycerin tablet, which can help relieve chest tightness. However, this is a temporary solution and doesn't address the underlying cause. I want to assure you that we are taking this seriously. Let’s get these tests done, and then we can discuss the results and a plan to get you feeling better. I’ll explain everything in plain language, and I promise to answer all your questions. Would you allow me to proceed with the EKG and blood tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. Quickly. And no more big words. And… make sure that nurse is gentle. I don’t like needles. And… tell me if it's serious. Don’t hide anything. My wife will know anyway. Just… hurry up. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'll make sure the nurse is gentle, and I will explain everything clearly, both to you and your wife if you wish. Let me call for the nurse now to start the tests. It will only take a few minutes. I'll be right here to answer any questions you have while she’s setting things up. "Nurse, could you please come in and prepare Mr. Sobkowicz for an EKG and blood draw?
