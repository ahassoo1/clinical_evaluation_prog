DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get this over with. My husband made me come. He says my blood pressure is too high, whatever that means. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Dudney. While feeling well is certainly important, high blood pressure – or hypertension – often doesn’t present with any noticeable symptoms, which is why it’s important to check it regularly. Your husband is quite right to be concerned, and I appreciate him encouraging you to come in. To get a better understanding of the situation, could you tell me if you’ve ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. Never. And honestly, I think he worries too much. He reads too many things on the internet. Is that all you need to know? Can we just take whatever medicine and be done with it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. However, it’s crucial to gather a complete picture before starting any medication. Simply prescribing something without a thorough assessment wouldn’t be responsible care. To clarify, when was the last time you had a routine check-up with a doctor?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember. Years ago, probably. I don’t really go to doctors unless something is seriously wrong. And right now, nothing is seriously wrong. My husband just keeps bugging me about this machine he bought. It gave him a scare, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I see. It's good that your husband is being proactive about your health, even if it feels like a bit much right now. Since you haven’t had a check-up in some time, I’d like to ask a few questions about your general health and any past medical history. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick. What do you want to know? Just don’t ask me about…feelings, okay? I don't do feelings.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Dudney. I will focus on the medical aspects. Let’s start with any past illnesses or surgeries you may have had. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I’ve been pretty healthy my whole life. A few colds, maybe. Broken a bone when I was a kid, but that’s it. I work outside a lot, so I’m strong. This whole thing is probably just a fluke.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Working outdoors certainly promotes good health. Now, regarding your family history – are there any conditions that run in your family, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: My mother had…something with her heart, I think. She died when I was young. And my dad, he had high blood sugar, maybe? He took pills for it. That's all I really know. They didn't talk about it much. It was…a long time ago. And honestly, I don't spend much time thinking about them. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Dudney. Thank you. Knowing about family history, even if the details are limited, is important. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. And ibuprofen if my back hurts from work. That’s it. Seriously, that’s it. I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel weird. This is getting ridiculous. Are we almost done?
DOCTOR: Almost, Ms. Dudney. Just a few more questions, and then I'd like to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I eat everything. I'm Navajo, we don't have allergies. This is all so unnecessary. Can we just skip to the part where you tell me if I need a pill or not? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. However, a complete assessment is vital to ensuring I provide you with the best possible care. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes for elevated blood pressure before considering medication. Before we proceed with the physical exam, could you briefly describe your typical diet and how much physical activity you get each week?
PATIENT: Look, I already told you I work outside. That's physical activity. As for diet... I eat what my husband cooks. Mostly meat and frybread. It’s traditional. I don’t eat a lot of…salad or whatever. Is that what you want to hear? I don’t have time for a lecture. Can we please just get this over with?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Dudney. Knowing your typical lifestyle is helpful. Alright, let’s proceed with a quick physical exam. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure, then listen to your heart and lungs. If you're comfortable, I'd also like to check your pulse and take your temperature. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And hurry. I have a garden to tend to. This is taking way too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's begin. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 152 over 94. Your heart sounds regular, but slightly fast. Your lungs are clear, but your breathing is a little shallow. Your pulse is 88 beats per minute, which is slightly elevated. Your temperature is 98.6°F. Based on these initial findings, your blood pressure is higher than the recommended level. This, along with the slightly elevated heart rate, warrants further investigation. I would like to discuss some possible causes and what we can do to address this. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Ugh. See? I knew it. My husband is going to be insufferable. What does “further investigation” even mean? More tests? More poking and prodding? I don’t like this one bit. Just tell me what I have to do to make him stop worrying. Is it a pill? Because if it's a pill, let’s just get it over with. I don’t have time for…investigations.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Dudney. “Further investigation” simply means we need to gather a bit more information to understand why your blood pressure is elevated. It doesn’t necessarily mean extensive testing. Typically, I would recommend a few simple blood tests to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. This will help us rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the high blood pressure. An EKG, a quick and painless test, can assess your heart’s electrical activity. Regarding medication, it's too early to say definitively whether a pill is necessary. We need the results of these tests first. Starting medication without understanding the cause could mask an underlying issue. Would you be willing to consider these tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…make it quick. And no needles if you can help it. I hate needles. And tell your nurse to be gentle. I don't want any bruises. Honestly, this is such a waste of time. My garden is going to be overrun with weeds at this rate. Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Dudney, and I assure you we'll do everything to make the process as comfortable as possible. I will personally speak with the nurse to ensure she is gentle and efficient. We can discuss strategies to minimize discomfort, and I’ll explain each step beforehand. I’ll order the blood tests and an EKG for you. The lab is just down the hall, and the EKG technician is available this afternoon. I’ll also have the nurse draw the blood first, to see if we can avoid a separate needle stick if the technician can also take a sample. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend starting some simple lifestyle changes. Even small adjustments can make a difference. We can discuss those now if you'd like, or after the test results are available. Would you prefer one or the other?
PATIENT: Just…get the tests done. I don’t want to talk about “lifestyle changes” right now. I already told you, I work outside. What more do you want me to do? Honestly, this is ridiculous. Just…let me know when it’s over. And please, no lectures. I’m serious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Dudney. I understand. I will let you know as soon as the test results are available. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, if you experience any severe headaches, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just…hurry. And tell your nurse to be quick. I really need to get back to my garden. I’m wasting a perfectly good afternoon. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Dudney. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. Thank you for your patience. .
