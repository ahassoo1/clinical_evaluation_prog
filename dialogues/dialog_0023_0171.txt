DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. It's my nails, okay? They just... look wrong. I don't know what else to tell ya. They ain't been lookin' good for a while now. Not like they used to, anyway.
DOCTOR: "Right. Your nails. And for how long have they 'not been looking good,' as you put it?
PATIENT: Oh, geez... a while. Maybe... six months? A year? Time kinda runs together, you know? I ain't good with dates. They just got... bumpy. And the color is off. Not a nice pink, more… greyish. It’s kinda gross, to be honest. I don’t usually look at my hands, but my friend pointed it out. She’s always judgin'.
DOCTOR: "Six to twelve months. Alright. And has anything changed in that time?
PATIENT: Changed? Like… what do you mean? I still do the same things. Wash dishes, cook... nothin' fancy. I don't remember doin' anything different to my hands. Maybe more cleaning? I had a little spill last month, but I cleaned it up right away. Does that count? Honestly, I don't know. Everything feels the same.
DOCTOR: “More cleaning… Alright. And are you experiencing any pain or discomfort in your nails or the surrounding skin?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. They just… look bad. A little itchy sometimes, maybe, but nothin' a little lotion can't fix. It's more of an eyesore, to be honest. I don't like lookin' at 'em, and I definitely don't wanna be showin' 'em off. You know? I used to get compliments on my hands, and now… not so much.
DOCTOR: "Alright. And do you notice any changes in the shape of your nails, any lifting, or cracking?
PATIENT: Cracking... sometimes, yeah. They split easy, especially the thumb nails. I just file 'em down, but they always seem to get worse. Lifting? I don't know... maybe a little at the edges? I don't stare at 'em that close. I mean, they're nails. What's there to look at? They're just not pretty anymore. Does that make sense? I just want 'em to look normal again.
DOCTOR: "It does, Ms. Thut. Let's take a look. Please extend your hands, palms up." "I'm going to examine your nails more closely to see what we're dealing with."
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Fine. Be gentle, okay? They're sensitive. And don't judge 'em too hard, alright? They've seen better days.
DOCTOR: "I see some mild discoloration, a grayish hue as you mentioned, and some slight thickening. There’s also some onycholysis—that’s lifting of the nail plate from the nail bed—particularly on the thumbs and index fingers. No pitting that I can see immediately, but it’s subtle. And there is some transverse ridging, indicating some slower growth. The skin around the nails appears generally healthy, no signs of infection currently. I'll document these findings."
PATIENT: Onycho... what-now? You lost me. Is that bad? Seriously, just tell me in plain English. Are my nails gonna fall off? My friend said it could be a fungus. Is it a fungus? Because that sounds awful. I don't want no fungus!
DOCTOR: "Onycholysis simply means the nail is separating from the nail bed. It’s not an emergency, no, your nails won’t simply ‘fall off.’ But it can be indicative of several things. And yes, a fungal infection is one possibility, but it could also be due to trauma—even minor repetitive trauma—or certain skin conditions. I need to rule things out. I'm going to order a nail clipping for a fungal culture to determine if that's the cause. It will involve sending a small piece of your nail to the lab for analysis."
PATIENT: A lab? Ugh, great. Just what I needed. More poking and prodding. Okay, fine. But don’t take too much off, alright? I still gotta use my hands. And how long is this gonna take? I don't wanna be comin' back here a million times. This is already takin' up my whole morning. And what if it is a fungus? Is it contagious? My friend's been comin' over a lot lately... Oh, and can I still paint my nails while I'm waitin' for the results? I got a new color I wanna try. It's a pretty pink.
DOCTOR: "It will only be a small clipping, Ms. Thut, barely noticeable. The lab results typically take about two weeks. If it is a fungal infection, it can be contagious, though not highly so. Good hygiene practices—keeping your nails clean and dry, avoiding sharing nail tools—can minimize the risk. As for painting your nails, I advise against it while we are awaiting the results. Nail polish can trap moisture and potentially worsen the condition, and it can also interfere with the accuracy of the culture if further testing is needed. We need a clear sample."
PATIENT: Ugh, two weeks! That's forever! Fine, no nail polish. But if my friend asks, tell her I'm sick or somethin'. She'll never let it go if I tell her I'm at the doctor. And can I still cook? I need to make dinner tonight. My casserole's a masterpiece, you know? Don't wanna ruin it just 'cause my nails look funny. So, what do I do while I'm waitin'? Just... ignore 'em? And what if it's somethin' really bad? Like, somethin' I gotta take pills for? I hate pills.
DOCTOR: "You can continue with your normal activities, including cooking, as long as you maintain good hygiene—thorough handwashing and drying. Avoiding trauma to the nails is also recommended. As for your friend, that is your decision. If the culture comes back positive for a fungus, treatment typically involves a topical antifungal medication, although oral medications may be necessary in some cases. We’ll discuss all options thoroughly if that is the outcome. I will also document in your chart that you expressed concerns about oral medications. It’s premature to assume a severe outcome, Ms. Thut. Let’s wait for the results of the culture first. I’m scheduling a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to review them. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Two weeks… Ugh. Fine. Two weeks it is. Just get it over with. And can I get a note for work? Just in case I gotta take a little time off. My boss is a pain, you know? Always judgin'. Alright, schedule the appointment. But make it for later in the day. I don't wanna start my day worryin' about my nails. And, uh, make sure the doctor's a nice one. I don’t need another judgy person lookin' at my hands. Honestly, it's just a lot. Can I just get the clipping done now? I wanna get out of here.
DOCTOR: “Certainly, Ms. Thut. I will include a note for work stating you have a medical appointment and may need to adjust your schedule accordingly. I'll schedule your follow-up for 3:00 PM two weeks from today. And I assure you, the doctor you see will be professional and thorough. Now, let's get this nail clipping done. Please extend the nail of your thumb."
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Here. Be gentle, okay? I mean it. And don't make it bleed. I get queasy easy. Honestly, my hands are just a mess. I probably shouldn't even bother with 'em anymore. But my friend... she always has perfect nails. It's so unfair. Just hurry up, alright? I wanna get outta here.
DOCTOR: "There. All done. Very minimal bleeding, if any. I've collected the sample, and we've documented your concerns. I will send this to the lab, and we’ll review the results in two weeks. Is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: Ugh, that wasn’t so bad. Actually, it wasn’t bad at all. Still… two weeks. No, I think that’s it. Just… don’t call me with bad news. And try to remember I get queasy easy. And… maybe try to find a nice doctor for my follow-up? One who doesn’t judge. Alright. I guess I'm done here then? Thanks, I guess. .
DOCTOR: "You’re welcome, Ms. Thut. We will be sure to contact you with the results and schedule your follow-up. I've documented your preferences and concerns. Have a good day." .
