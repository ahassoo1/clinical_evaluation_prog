DOCTOR: Hi Esthela, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you, Doctor. It’s… rather important that we discuss this. I’ve begun seeing someone, and frankly, I need to ensure all is… as it should be, health-wise. One simply doesn’t take chances these days, you understand. I prefer to be proactive.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Esthela. Being proactive about your health is always a good idea, and that's very wise of you. It sounds like you're getting some new partners and want to make sure everything is healthy before proceeding. Is that right?
PATIENT: “Partners” sounds… rather informal, Doctor. I am dating someone. A gentleman. And yes, precisely. I want to be certain there are no… unpleasant surprises. I've always been quite particular about my well-being, and I expect a certain standard from… associates. It’s simply common sense. One must be discerning, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. Discretion and well-being are paramount. I completely understand. So, to get a clearer picture, are you looking for a general check-up, or are there specific concerns that prompted you to schedule this appointment?
PATIENT: Specific concerns? Well, one hears so many… stories. About things one should be tested for. I wouldn’t presume to list them, Doctor; I trust you are aware of the… contemporary issues. But yes, a thorough examination. Everything. I wouldn't want to leave anything to chance. And frankly, I’d prefer if we didn’t delve into too much detail about… the particulars of my personal life. It’s rather private, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. Your privacy is extremely important, and I completely respect that. We'll focus entirely on your health needs and what’s necessary for a thorough evaluation. It sounds like you’re thinking about a screening for sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, and a general health assessment. Is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: “Sexually transmitted infections” is… rather blunt, Doctor. But yes, that is… essentially correct. I simply want to be certain. I’ve always been meticulous about these things. And a general assessment wouldn’t go amiss. One feels more secure knowing one is… up to par, so to speak. Are these tests… comprehensive? I wouldn’t want to be remiss in any area. And, if you don't mind my asking, what sort of… protocol do you employ here? I trust you use the most… advanced methods?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. We strive to provide the most comprehensive and advanced care possible. Our STI screening panel includes tests for common infections like chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and herpes simplex virus. We can also test for hepatitis B and C if you'd like. It's a very thorough process. As for protocol, we follow CDC guidelines for testing and treatment. We use state-of-the-art equipment and techniques, and all tests are performed with the utmost confidentiality. We can do a blood draw and a urine sample today, and depending on your risk factors, we might also do a swab test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Swab tests… That sounds… rather intrusive, Doctor. Is it absolutely necessary? I rather dislike unnecessary procedures. And what about results? How long will I have to wait? I have a… rather busy schedule. And are these results explained… thoroughly? I wouldn’t want any ambiguity. I prefer things to be… precise and straightforward.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation with the swab tests, Esthela. They aren't always necessary, and it depends on the specific areas you'd like screened and your risk factors. We can absolutely discuss options – a more comprehensive blood panel can cover a lot of ground. As for results, we typically get them back within 3-5 business days. I personally review all results and explain them thoroughly to you – no ambiguity, as you requested. We'll go over everything in detail, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Honestly, Doctor, I rarely bother with doctors. I maintain a… very healthy lifestyle, and I've always been quite… robust. I had the usual childhood ailments, measles, mumps… nothing serious. No chronic conditions, thankfully. My mother had… some issues with her blood pressure, but I've always been very careful with my diet. I do take a multivitamin. Does that suffice? I find exhaustive lists of ailments rather… depressing.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Esthela, that you’ve been generally healthy. It’s always best to be proactive, even with a healthy lifestyle. Knowing a little about family history can also be helpful. Did your mother have any other health concerns besides blood pressure?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, my mother was… a rather complicated woman. She had… anxieties. And she was always convinced she was coming down with something. I believe she spent a considerable amount of time consulting various specialists. As for specific ailments… honestly, I couldn't possibly recall. It was a litany of complaints, mostly imagined, I suspect. She did have… some issues with her joints, towards the end. But that was likely just old age. I’d really rather not dwell on it. It’s all rather… unpleasant. Are we getting anywhere with this? I was hoping for a swift and efficient examination, not a genealogical excavation.
DOCTOR: I understand, Esthela. It sounds like focusing on your health is the most important thing. We can certainly do that. Let's move on to your social history, if that's alright. This simply helps me understand your lifestyle a bit better. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you implying something? I assure you, I lead a very respectable life. I do not "smoke," I do not partake in "recreational drugs," and I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner… occasionally. A very small glass, mind you. I believe moderation is key. And I certainly don't need to be lectured on the perils of unhealthy habits. I take excellent care of myself, as I've already stated. Is this standard procedure? It feels… rather intrusive.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt intrusive, Esthela. It’s simply standard medical practice to gather a complete health history. I certainly wasn’t implying anything, and I assure you, I respect your lifestyle choices. Alright, let's move on to allergies and current medications. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I don't believe so. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can tolerate most foods. Perhaps a slight… sensitivity to shellfish, but I avoid it anyway. It’s simply not refined. As for medications… I take a daily multivitamin, as I mentioned, and occasionally an antacid, if I indulge in particularly rich cuisine. But nothing regular. I prefer to rely on a healthy diet and a good night's sleep. Are we nearing the end of this… interrogation? I had anticipated a more… streamlined process.
DOCTOR: Almost there, Esthela. Just a few more questions, and then we can move on to the physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. Before we do that, can you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Are you attempting to assess my… proportions? It’s rather impertinent, don't you think? However, if you must know, I am approximately five foot seven inches, and… well, let's just say I'm comfortably proportioned. I prefer not to dwell on numbers. It’s simply… vulgar. Are you quite finished with these… personal inquiries? I believe I’ve provided ample information.
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize, Esthela. I didn’t mean to offend you. I understand your discomfort. It’s standard practice to record height and weight for general health assessment, and I can certainly note your description instead of taking measurements. Alright, let's move on to the physical exam, if you're comfortable. We can start with listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But please be gentle. I do not appreciate being prodded and poked. And do try to be discreet. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. Listening to my heart and lungs… As long as it doesn't take long. I have a… rather important engagement this evening.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. We'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. Take a nice, deep breath for me... and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm not detecting any unusual noises. Now, I'd like to check your blood pressure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… fine. But please ensure it's not too tight. I dislike constricted sensations. And do try to be swift. I have a… a delicate constitution, you know. One can become rather faint with these… medical procedures. And do tell me if you detect anything… alarming. I prefer to be informed, however unpleasant the news may be. I simply cannot abide surprises.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130 over 80. That's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this time. We can keep an eye on it during future visits. It may be related to stress or just a bit of a temporary fluctuation. Now, I'd like to take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ears, nose, and throat… Must you? It feels rather… invasive. I assure you, there's nothing amiss. I maintain a meticulously clean lifestyle. However, if it's absolutely necessary… proceed with caution. And do try not to linger. I have a… a very sensitive gag reflex, you know. I’d rather not create a scene.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. We’ll be quick and gentle. Everything looks clear in your ears and nose. Your throat is slightly pink, but there’s no sign of infection or inflammation. Now, just one more thing: I’d like to listen to your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Listen to my… abdomen? Really, Doctor, is this absolutely necessary? I assure you, everything is perfectly normal. I maintain a strict diet and… and a very active lifestyle. This feels… excessively intrusive. I am beginning to question the necessity of this entire examination. Perhaps a simple blood test would have sufficed. I’m not comfortable with this, Doctor. Not at all.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Esthela. My apologies. I’m clearly pushing your comfort level, and that is not my intention. We can absolutely skip that part. It sounds like you’re very proactive about your health, and I respect that. Given your discomfort, we can proceed with the STI screening, as you requested, and leave the full physical exam for another time, if you wish. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be… infinitely preferable. The screening will suffice, thank you. I trust your laboratory is reputable? I wouldn’t want any… errors. And please ensure complete confidentiality. My… reputation is paramount, you understand. And do try to be swift. I have a… a very important engagement this evening. A gentleman is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. Our laboratory is fully accredited and adheres to the highest standards of quality and accuracy. And confidentiality is, of course, our top priority. Everything will be handled with the utmost discretion. I'll have the nurse come in to draw some blood for the screening. It will only take a few minutes. While we're waiting, can you tell me a little more about your current relationship?
PATIENT: My… relationship? Really, Doctor, must we delve into such… personal matters? It feels rather… impertinent. However, if you insist… He is a gentleman. Very refined. We are… getting to know each other. That is all that is relevant, surely? I fail to see how the details of our courtship are pertinent to a medical examination. I trust you’re not attempting to… psychoanalyze me, Doctor? I find that… distasteful.
DOCTOR: My deepest apologies, Esthela. I didn't mean to pry. It’s simply standard practice to understand your risk factors, and the nature of your relationships can contribute to that. It was inappropriate of me to ask, and I won’t pursue that line of questioning any further. Let's focus on the screening itself. Are you experiencing any symptoms—any unusual discharge, sores, or pain—that you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Doctor, are you implying something untoward? I assure you, my health is impeccable. I would never allow myself to reach a state where… symptoms manifest. I maintain a very… disciplined lifestyle. I find your question rather… insulting. However, if you must know, I have experienced no such… discomfort. None whatsoever. I simply wish to be certain. As I’ve repeatedly stated. I prefer to be proactive. But I find your insinuations… distasteful.
DOCTOR: My deepest apologies, Esthela. I assure you, no offense was intended. I was simply covering all bases, and I apologize for causing any discomfort. Given your excellent health and proactive approach, we can proceed with the screening, and I’ll be sure to explain the results thoroughly. It sounds like your peace of mind is the most important thing. The nurse should be here shortly to draw your blood. Is there anything else I can do for you while we wait?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Just… swiftness and discretion, please. And a clear, concise explanation of the results. I have a… a rather busy schedule, and I wouldn't want to be delayed. And please… no further inquiries into my… personal life. It’s rather private, you understand. I trust we are finished with this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. Swiftness, discretion, and a clear explanation – I understand completely. No further personal inquiries, I promise. I’ll leave you to the nurse, and we'll take excellent care of you. Thank you for coming in today. I hope you have a wonderful evening.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Esthela. Take care. .
