DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my head. Been…not right lately. My wife, she’s the one who really insisted I come. Says I’ve been getting…lost in things. Not lost outside, mind you. Lost in what I’m doing. It’s frustrating, to be honest. I’ve set tile for forty years, and I shouldn’t be forgetting where I put the wet saw.
DOCTOR: “Lost in things,” you say. Okay. Forty years of tile setting is a good, steady profession. And this…forgetfulness, it’s recent?
PATIENT: Recent-ish. Maybe…six months now? It started small, little things. Misplacing my tools. Forgetting which batch of thinset I mixed first. But it’s gotten worse. Last week, I started a bathroom floor and…I just stopped. Couldn’t remember what came next. My wife had to remind me how to lay the pattern. It's embarrassing, really. A man should know these things.
DOCTOR: Embarrassing, yes, but more importantly, concerning. So, it's impacting your work now, specifically the ability to complete a job. Besides the work, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… My wife says I repeat myself. A lot. Ask the same question five times in an hour. And… I get irritated easier. Small things bother me now that didn't before. Like…the radio being too loud. Or someone leaving a tool in the wrong place. It's not that I'm angry, exactly… just… annoyed. And sometimes, I have trouble finding the right words. Not all the time, but it happens.
DOCTOR: Repeating questions, increased irritability, difficulty finding words… Okay. And these word-finding difficulties… can you give me an example?
PATIENT: Well, yesterday I was telling my neighbor about fixing his fence. And I… I knew what I wanted to say about the post… the wooden thing you put in the ground… but the word wouldn't come. It was right there, on the tip of my tongue. I just kept saying "that thing… you know… the pole!" He finally figured it out, but it was frustrating. And I've been calling my wife "dear" for years, but the other day, I couldn't remember her name for a moment. Just… blank.
DOCTOR: "That thing...the pole." Right. And this happened with your wife’s name as well. Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been a healthy man. Worked hard my whole life. My wife keeps telling me I need to slow down, but… what else am I going to do? My doctor back home… before we moved here… he always said my blood pressure was a little high, but he never put me on any pills. Just told me to watch my salt. And I don’t have diabetes. I like sweets, but not that much. I go to the dentist regular.
DOCTOR: "A little high" blood pressure can still be relevant. And while you don't think you have diabetes, we'll need to confirm that. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything serious?
PATIENT: Let me think… When I was a boy, back in Cambodia, I had my appendix taken out. That was a long time ago. And when I first came to this country, I broke my arm falling off a roof. Construction accident. But other than that… no. No serious hospital stays. I’ve had the flu a few times, a bad cold now and then, but nothing that kept me down for long. I’m a tough man, doctor.
DOCTOR: “Tough” is good, but doesn’t preclude medical issues. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I haven't taken many pills in my life, truthfully. A little aspirin for a headache now and then. My wife, she's the one with all the allergies. Pollen, dust, cats… everything bothers her. I can eat anything, drink anything. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. My wife makes sure I take it every morning with my breakfast. Says it’s good for my memory. Irony, isn’t it? And sometimes, if my knees are acting up, I take ibuprofen. But that's it. Nothing else. Simple man, doctor.
DOCTOR: “Simple” doesn’t always equate to uncomplicated. Now, let’s do a brief exam. I’m going to check your reflexes, your balance, and do a quick memory test. Just to get a baseline. Then we'll talk about some potential next steps. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine. Though I doubt it will show anything. I still feel…sharp. It’s just these little slips. These… moments. I can stand. But don't expect me to do any fancy acrobatics.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you walk to that chair and back for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Easy enough. There. Done. What are you looking for? I haven’t fallen down yet.
DOCTOR: I'm looking for stability, coordination… subtle changes. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Remember them, and I'll ask you later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Go ahead and repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. There. Done. Easy. Like I said, I haven’t lost all my marbles. Now, are we finished with the tests? I have tiles to set, you know.
DOCTOR: We're not finished yet. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. What year is it?
PATIENT: What year? Honestly, doctor, I don’t go around keeping track of the year like it’s a competition. It's… two thousand and twenty-five, isn't it? August. Yes, definitely August. My wife just told me it was the second.
DOCTOR: And what state are we in?
PATIENT: Honestly? Rural. That’s what it feels like, anyway. But I think it’s… Ohio? We moved here last year from… well, it doesn’t matter where we came from. It’s Ohio, right? Small town. Quiet.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are in Ohio. Now, can you spell "world" for me?
PATIENT: W… O… R… L… D. There. Is that right? I used to be very good at spelling. Back in school… it was one of my best subjects.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you repeat the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: …Three words? Oh… uh… apple… table… and… something else. Something round… a… a coin? No… a… it’s on the tip of my tongue! I know I remembered them! It was… penny! Yes, penny. Apple, table, penny. Was that right? I’m sure I got them all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason. Based on what you've told me, and the brief exam, I'm concerned about possible cognitive impairment. Your wife’s observations, the forgetfulness, the repetition, the difficulty with words… combined with the results of this brief assessment… it warrants further investigation. I want to be upfront with you: this could be a number of things, from mild memory loss related to age, to something more serious like early-stage dementia. It’s too early to say definitively. We need to rule out other causes first. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. I also want you to have a brain scan - an MRI, preferably. And I'm going to refer you to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation. They'll do a more in-depth cognitive assessment and can help us determine the cause of these symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Dementia? No. No, that can't be it. I… I still feel sharp. I can still set tile. I can still…think. But… blood work, a scan… a neurologist? Alright. Alright, doctor. If that’s what you think is best. But I don't like the sound of any of it. It feels… unnecessary. But… my wife… she'll be relieved. She's been worried sick. So, yes. Do the tests. Do whatever you think you need to do. But please… tell me if it’s nothing. Tell me if I’m just… getting old.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. We'll take it one step at a time. The tests will help us rule out other possible causes and get a clearer picture of what's going on. I’ll order the blood work today, and I’ll have my nurse schedule the MRI and the neurology appointment for you. In the meantime, I want you to continue with your daily routine as much as possible. Keep your mind active, engage in activities you enjoy, and let your wife know what's going on. I also recommend avoiding any activities that require a lot of concentration or judgment until we have more information. I’ll also send a referral to occupational therapy. They can assess your home environment for safety, and help you with strategies to compensate for any cognitive changes. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Occupational therapy? Is that… for people who can't work anymore? Look, doctor, I appreciate you taking the time. And I'll do the tests. But I don’t want my life turned upside down over a few missed words and a forgotten tool. I'm a tile setter. That's what I do. I need to be able to work. I need to be able to provide for my family. Can you at least…tell me how long this process will take? How long before we know something? And… will it affect my ability to drive? My wife does most of the shopping, but I still like to take the car to town sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. Occupational therapy isn’t just for people who can’t work. They can help you adapt to any changes and maximize your independence. They’ll assess your abilities and provide strategies to help you continue doing what you enjoy. As for the timeline, the blood work results should be back within a week. The MRI and neurology appointment may take a bit longer to schedule, possibly a few weeks, depending on availability. Once we have those results, we’ll have a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Regarding driving, that's a valid concern. We won’t make any decisions about that until we have a complete assessment from the neurologist. They’ll evaluate your cognitive and physical abilities and determine if you’re still safe to drive. I will need you to be honest with them during the evaluation. Until then, I recommend avoiding driving at night or in challenging conditions. And if you feel even slightly unsure or disoriented while driving, please pull over and ask someone for help. I’ll also give you a list of resources – local support groups, information about dementia, and contact information for the Alzheimer’s Association. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Alzheimer's… that’s what my aunt died of. It was… a long decline. Not a pleasant way to go. You really think it could be that? And… what if it is? What’s the next step then? Is there anything… anything I can do to stop it? Or…slow it down?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, it's too early to say definitively whether this is Alzheimer's or another form of dementia. We need to get the results of the tests first. However, you're right to ask about treatment options. Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and no way to stop its progression entirely. There are medications that can help manage the symptoms, such as memory loss and confusion, but they won’t reverse the damage. There are also lifestyle changes that can help slow the decline, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and staying mentally and socially active. And there are support services available to help you and your family cope with the challenges of dementia. The most important thing right now is to get a diagnosis, so we can start planning for the future. We'll discuss all of your options once we have the results of the tests. I’m going to have my nurse come in and give you a referral form for the blood work, and schedule a follow up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. She'll also give you some information about resources. Do you have any other questions before she comes in?
PATIENT: No. I… I think that’s enough for now. Just… please, doctor. Don't rush to any conclusions. I need to know what I'm dealing with. I need to be able to… think. I need to be able to work. And I need to be able to provide for my family. Thank you, doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. We'll take it one step at a time. And we won’t make any decisions without discussing them with you thoroughly. My nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork. Have a good day. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions.
PATIENT: .
