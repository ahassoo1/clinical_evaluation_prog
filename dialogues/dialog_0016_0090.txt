DOCTOR: Hi Mackenzi, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe I need to get cleared beforehand? It’s… cosmetic. I apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I’m a little hazy on the details right now.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mackenzi, that’s perfectly alright. Many people feel a bit anxious leading up to procedures, and it can definitely make things feel foggy. Cosmetic surgery clearance is a common reason for visits. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about the surgery you’re planning?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s… a tummy tuck. Yes, that’s right. A tummy tuck and… perhaps a little lift. I think that was part of it. My husband… he did most of the researching and arranging, and it’s been… a while since then. It was his wish, really, and I’d like to… honor that. But I don’t recall all the specifics the doctors discussed with him. It feels… strange to be doing this without him.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed, especially with everything you've been through. It's good of you to want to honor his wishes. Okay, a tummy tuck and possibly a lift. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Of course. Um… I try to eat reasonably well, mostly. Lots of fruits and vegetables. I do enjoy a good cup of coffee, if that’s relevant. And I walk when I can, though lately… it hasn’t been as much. I used to be quite active with my husband, gardening mostly. We had a lovely garden. As for any… serious conditions, I don’t believe I have any. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I have private insurance, if that’s helpful. I apologize again for being… vague. It’s just… difficult to remember everything.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. We’ll take things at your pace. That’s helpful to know about the coffee and the gardening – it gives me a good idea of your baseline activity level. And having private insurance is good. Okay. Have you had any surgeries in the past, even something small like getting your wisdom teeth removed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Wisdom teeth, yes, a very long time ago. And… I think I had my appendix out when I was a child. It was… quite a while ago, I barely remember it. Nothing else comes to mind, no. No other operations, at least that I’m aware of. It’s really difficult to recall details, even about things that happened when I was younger. Everything feels… blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, wisdom teeth and appendectomy. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those. I don’t think so, anyway. My husband always took care of my check-ups, and he would have mentioned something if there were any issues. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything like that. I feel… generally healthy, just a bit tired sometimes, but I think that’s just… life. And grief. It takes a lot out of you.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mackenzi. Grief absolutely takes a toll on your body and energy levels. It’s important to acknowledge that. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, um… just a multivitamin, occasionally. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. That’s it, I think. Nothing else regularly. My husband used to keep track of everything, and I haven’t really gotten back into the habit since… well, since he passed. I apologize for being so disorganized.
DOCTOR: You’re not disorganized at all, Mackenzi. It's perfectly understandable to have things feel a bit out of order after such a loss. Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. I've never had any reactions to anything, as far as I know. No food allergies, no issues with medications… I remember asking my husband about this once, and he said I was remarkably allergy-free. It was one less thing to worry about, he said.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Okay. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if that's alright. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a little difficult. My mother passed away when I was quite young, and I didn’t know my father. As for other relatives… I wasn’t very close to them, and we didn’t really discuss medical history. I believe my grandmother had… something with her heart, maybe? But I don’t know the details. And perhaps an aunt had cancer, but it was a very long time ago. I apologize, I wish I could be more helpful. My memory is… so unreliable. It feels like a fog sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mackenzi. It's completely understandable. You've shared what you know, and that's what's important. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Just a glass of wine on special occasions, perhaps. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. My husband… he didn’t approve, and neither do I. We preferred a quiet evening at home, reading or gardening. It was a much healthier lifestyle, I believe.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. That gives me a good picture of your lifestyle. Okay, Mackenzi. Now, to get a better idea of your overall health, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a brief look at your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. I suppose it’s necessary. I just… I don’t usually enjoy being poked and prodded, if you don’t mind my saying so. But I understand it’s important. Just… please be gentle? It’s been a while since I’ve had a proper check-up. And… everything feels a little sensitive, lately. I hope that doesn't make it difficult.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mackenzi. I completely understand. We'll take it very slow and be as gentle as possible. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. Okay, just relaxing your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 128/78, which is perfectly normal. Your heart sounds regular and strong. No murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear and open. Good breath sounds on both sides. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any masses or tenderness. It's a little sensitive in the lower abdomen, as you mentioned, but nothing concerning at this moment. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: It’s… a little uncomfortable, yes. Not sharp pain, exactly, just… a dull ache. It’s been like that for a while now, on and off. I thought it might just be… stress, or grief. I haven’t paid much attention to it, to be honest. It doesn’t interfere with my daily life, not really. Just… a nagging discomfort. It feels better when I lie down, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. A dull ache in the lower abdomen can have many causes, and it's good we're noting it. Based on the physical exam, everything seems generally well, but the lower abdominal discomfort warrants further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel . These tests will help rule out any underlying infection, inflammation, or kidney issues. Would you be comfortable with me ordering those for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If it will help determine the cause of the discomfort, then yes, please do. I'd like to know what's going on, if possible. I just… I hope it's nothing serious. I’m not very good with medical things, as you can tell. I tend to worry unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: You’re not alone in feeling anxious about medical tests, Mackenzi. It's perfectly natural to worry. We'll take things one step at a time. Okay, I’ve ordered the CBC and BMP. You can have those done at the lab just down the hall. The results should be available within 24-48 hours, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, fever, or nausea, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough and kind, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for being so patient with my… vagueness. And thank you for ordering the tests. It gives me a little peace of mind, knowing we’re trying to figure things out. I suppose… I’ll see you when the results are back?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. It was my pleasure. And you’re not vague at all, you’re simply processing a lot, and that's perfectly understandable. Yes, let's schedule a follow-up appointment for three business days from now to discuss the results. The receptionist can take care of that for you before you leave. In the meantime, if anything changes or you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's all. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your kindness and understanding. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. You have a good day as well. And please remember to take things easy. .
