DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Dr. Alanes, is it? Well, frankly, it's not a social visit. My daughter insisted I come. Says I need a “clearance” before I can… well, before I can get a little work done. She worries too much, that one. It's just a bit of… smoothing out, you understand. Not a big deal. Let's get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. It sounds like you’re seeking medical clearance for some planned home repairs. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll do our best to make this as efficient as possible. To start, could you tell me a little more about the “smoothing out” you mentioned?
PATIENT: Home repairs? What on earth are you talking about? It’s my face, young lady. My face. I want a little nip and tuck. A facelift. Honestly, do I look like I’m here to fix a leaky faucet? And efficient is good. Very good. I have a perfectly good afternoon planned, you know. Don’t waste my time.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Mr. Orwin. I seem to have misheard. A facelift, of course. Thank you for clarifying. I completely understand wanting to be respectful of your time. Before we proceed, could you tell me about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Good, for an old man. I still get out and about. I used to do terrazzo work, you know. Real craftsmanship. Not like these days. Now everything's plastic and… well, never mind. I don’t get sick much. A little arthritis, aches and pains, what do you expect at my age? I don’t go to doctors unless absolutely necessary, and this is only because she made me. Is that good enough for you?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Orwin. A little arthritis and typical aches and pains for your age is quite common. And I understand your reluctance to come to the doctor unnecessarily. Could you tell me a little more about the arthritis?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my hands and knees. Makes gripping tools a bit difficult, which is why I retired, honestly. Not that I miss the dust. Mostly just stiff in the mornings. I take… well, I used to take something for it. A little pill. Can't recall the name now. My daughter handles all that. She keeps the pills organized. Honestly, it’s probably just old age catching up with me. Do we really need to delve into this? It doesn’t affect my face.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. It's good to know it's primarily in your hands and knees. And it's perfectly alright if you don't recall the medication name – we can look it up in your records if you'd like. Just to get a complete picture, have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Other conditions? Goodness. Let me think… I had a bit of high blood pressure years ago. The doctor put me on pills for that too. Again, my daughter manages all of that. I think it’s under control now. Haven't had any serious illnesses, no heart attacks or anything like that. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old. Honestly, I'm a pretty healthy man for 81. Are you writing all this down? It's a waste of paper, frankly.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am documenting everything, Mr. Orwin. It's important for a complete medical history, even if it seems like a waste of paper. High blood pressure is good to know. Now, regarding any surgeries you may have had in the past… have you ever undergone any surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Hmmm. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. That’s about it. Nothing else. No knee replacements, no hip replacements, nothing fancy. I always prided myself on being able to fix things myself, you see? Didn’t need doctors cutting me open. Now, is this really necessary? My daughter said something about anesthesia and wanting to be sure… frankly, it sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: An appendectomy when you were young. Good to know. And I understand your concerns about the anesthesia and the fuss. It's standard procedure to review your medical history thoroughly before any surgical procedure, even a cosmetic one, to ensure your safety. Now, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I eat everything. Always have. Maybe a little sniffle with pollen in the spring, but that's it. Nothing serious. My daughter always asks if I'm allergic to anything when I go to a new doctor, and I always tell her the same thing. No allergies. I’m a hearty Norwegian, you see. We don't succumb to silly allergies. Honestly, this is getting tedious. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. No known allergies. That's good. And I apologize if this feels tedious. I just want to be thorough. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Like I said before, my daughter manages all that. I… I think I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. And maybe something for my arthritis. She keeps them all organized in those little plastic containers. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention. I just take what she tells me to take. It's easier that way. Can we be done now? I have a perfectly good afternoon planned, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. It sounds like you're on medication for blood pressure and possibly arthritis, managed by your daughter. I’m going to quickly review your EHR to confirm the medication list and dosages, if you don't mind. Then, I’d like to do a brief physical exam just to get a baseline before we discuss the facelift further. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: EHR? Whatever that is. Just get it over with. And a physical exam? Really? I’m not falling apart, you know. But fine, do what you have to do. Just be quick about it. I’m not a fan of doctors poking and prodding. Honestly, it’s a waste of time, but if that's what you need to do… go ahead. But I expect a speedy recovery. I have things to do. Let's get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I've reviewed your record and it confirms you're currently taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for high blood pressure and Naproxen 500mg twice daily for arthritis. Now, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll take a quick look at your throat and skin. Does that sound alright?
