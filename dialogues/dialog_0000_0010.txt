DOCTOR: Right. Jahaad Tomassoni, 25 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, and I was hoping you could take a look. Honestly, I don’t recall exactly when it started, or how it began. It just… appeared, gradually.
DOCTOR: Gradually, you say. Hmm. Okay. And where exactly is this swelling?
PATIENT: It’s mostly… around my neck, I believe. And perhaps a little bit on my face. It’s not terribly painful, just… noticeable. It feels… puffy, if that makes sense. I apologize for being so vague; my memory isn’t what it used to be. Is this… is this something serious, do you think?
DOCTOR: Puffy around the neck and face. Not painful, just noticeable. And you’re unsure of when it began. Alright. We’ll figure it out. It’s good you came in to have it checked. Now, has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Let me think… Not that I can recall, specifically. My routine is rather… consistent, I suppose. I work, I eat, I sleep. Perhaps a new brand of tea? Though I doubt that would cause this… It’s all quite hazy, unfortunately. Do you mean like, have I been feeling ill? Because no, not really. Just… this swelling.
DOCTOR: Alright. No changes in routine, no illness. New tea… we'll note that. Let’s go through a little more detail, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any difficulty breathing or swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing or swallowing… No, not that I've noticed. Everything seems to be… functioning as usual, in that regard. I haven't choked or felt like something is stuck. But perhaps it’s subtle? It’s hard to say, I suppose. I don't pay close attention to things unless there's a problem. Would it be noticeable if it was becoming difficult?
DOCTOR: It would be noticeable. Okay. Any fever, chills, night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever, chills, night sweats… No, I don’t believe so. I haven’t felt particularly warm or cold, and I sleep quite soundly, so I wouldn’t notice night sweats if they were happening, I suspect. I’m quite a heavy sleeper. This is all very perplexing. I feel perfectly well otherwise, which is why I’m struggling to understand the swelling.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, chills, or night sweats. And you feel otherwise well. Let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Honestly, Dr. Batara, I’m rather unsure. I don’t have a strong recollection of past illnesses or diagnoses. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I’ve had the usual childhood vaccinations, I believe, and I see a dentist regularly, but beyond that… I’m afraid I can’t offer much assistance. Would my primary care physician have this information?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can obtain those records. Do you happen to know if anyone in your family has a history of thyroid problems, autoimmune diseases, or… swelling of the neck?
PATIENT: Thyroid problems… autoimmune diseases… That’s… a difficult question. I don’t have much contact with my family, unfortunately. My parents passed away some time ago, and I don’t have any siblings. I vaguely remember my mother being unwell occasionally, but I never knew the specifics. And I’m afraid I don’t know if anyone in the family experienced swelling… It’s all very fragmented, I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to some current medications. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, I believe. And occasionally, ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s infrequent. I don’t take anything regularly, besides the vitamin. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, so I generally avoid medication when possible. Does that include herbal teas? Would some teas affect this swelling? Perhaps the new one I mentioned?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re mindful of your health. Herbal teas can sometimes have interactions, though it’s less common. Okay. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never experienced a significant allergic reaction. I eat a fairly varied diet, and I haven't had any issues with new foods. I don't have any known sensitivities, thankfully. It's all very… unremarkable, I realize. I'm just a rather ordinary, healthy person with some unexplained swelling. It's quite frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's take a look and see if we can get some more information. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your neck to feel for any abnormalities. Can you lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Dr. Batara. Please, do take your time. I trust your expertise. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted. Neck is supple, no significant tenderness to palpation. I do note some mild diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, though it's difficult to assess precisely without further imaging. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Skin is normal temperature, no erythema or lesions.
PATIENT: Hmm… mild diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, you say? Is that… concerning? I must admit, I’m a little anxious. I’ve never had anything like this before, and the lack of clear answers is rather unsettling. What sort of imaging would be necessary? And what might be causing this enlargement, in your professional opinion?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re anxious. Mild thyroid enlargement isn’t necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but it does warrant further investigation. We’ll need to order some blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels—TSH, T4, and T3. This will help us determine if your thyroid is functioning properly. We may also want to order a thyroid ultrasound to get a more detailed image of the gland and rule out any nodules or other abnormalities. In terms of potential causes… thyroid enlargement can be caused by a variety of factors, including iodine deficiency, Hashimoto's thyroiditis , or, less commonly, thyroid cancer. We need the blood tests and ultrasound to narrow down the possibilities. It's important not to jump to conclusions at this stage.
PATIENT: Blood tests and an ultrasound… that sounds… thorough. Autoimmune condition… cancer… I understand the need for caution, and I appreciate your honesty, Dr. Batara. Hashimoto's thyroiditis… would that explain the swelling? And would the blood tests detect that? I suppose I should schedule those as soon as possible. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any dietary restrictions or lifestyle changes you would recommend?
DOCTOR: Hashimoto's thyroiditis could explain the swelling, yes. It’s an autoimmune condition where the body attacks the thyroid gland, causing inflammation and enlargement. The blood tests, specifically the thyroid antibody tests, can help us determine if that’s the cause. In the meantime, there’s no need for any drastic changes. Maintain a healthy diet, get adequate sleep, and avoid excessive stress. Iodine is important for thyroid function, but you shouldn’t take iodine supplements without consulting with me first. Too much iodine can actually worsen certain thyroid conditions. I'll write you a lab requisition for the thyroid panel and schedule the ultrasound for you. The ultrasound technician will be able to give you specific instructions on how to prepare. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that's very helpful, thank you. No questions about the tests themselves. Perhaps… what is the typical timeline for getting the results back? And if it is Hashimoto’s, what sort of treatment is involved? I understand you can’t give me a definitive diagnosis yet, but just a general idea would be reassuring. I’m a bit of a planner, you see, and I like to be prepared for all eventualities. It’s also… a little difficult for me to remember details, so I’m trying to take notes as well. Thank you for your patience.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. The ultrasound results should be available within a few days as well. If it is Hashimoto's, the treatment typically involves thyroid hormone replacement therapy—specifically, synthetic levothyroxine. This medication replaces the hormone your thyroid isn’t producing, and it can effectively manage the symptoms. It’s a lifelong medication, but it’s generally well-tolerated and allows people with Hashimoto’s to live normal, healthy lives. We would monitor your thyroid hormone levels regularly to ensure you’re on the correct dose. Does that answer your questions for now?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… very reassuring, thank you, Dr. Batara. Knowing that there’s a manageable treatment option is a great relief. I believe that covers everything, for now. I'll schedule the lab work and ultrasound as soon as possible. Thank you for your time, your patience, and your clear explanations. I appreciate your thoroughness. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jahaad. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. We'll review the results together and discuss the next steps. Have a good day, and take care. .
