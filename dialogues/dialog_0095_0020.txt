DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is this about my back? It has been… not good. Not good at all. I get pain, you see. Mostly when I… when I bend. Or stand for too long at the shop.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain. And it’s worse with bending and standing, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Bending is… oof. And the shop… I fix cars, you see. Lots of standing. Lots of… reaching. It makes it worse, yes. It is not a new thing, but it is… more now.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it's been happening for a while, but recently it's gotten more intense. Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Yes, more intense. Like… a dull ache, mostly. But sometimes… sometimes it is sharp. When I lift something heavy, maybe. Or if I twist wrong. It goes down my leg a little, too. Not all the way, but… down the back of my leg. It is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache as the main pain, with sharp pains that come and go, especially with lifting or twisting. And you’re feeling some pain radiating down the back of your leg. Is it just one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just one leg, Doctor. The left one. It does not go all the way to my foot, thankfully. Just… the back of my thigh, mostly. And my… my bottom, a little bit. Is that… is that important? I don't know all the names for things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s important information. Pain radiating to the thigh and buttock is helpful to know. Okay. And when did you first start noticing this increase in pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… two weeks ago? It was a slow thing, at first. Just a little bit more achy than usual. But last week… it got worse. Much worse. I had to stop working on a car on Tuesday. Too much pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about two weeks ago it started to worsen, and you had to stop working on Tuesday due to the pain. Have you tried anything to relieve the pain in those two weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. My friend, she gives me some… cream. For the muscles. It helps a little, maybe. And I try to sit down more. Rest, you see. But it is hard to rest when I have things to do. And the cream… it doesn’t last long. I take some pills, too. For aches. But they don't help much anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you've tried a muscle cream and some over-the-counter pain pills, but they’re not providing much relief. Do you know what’s in the pain pills?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… acetaminophen? Is that right? My daughter buys them for me. She says they are good for aches. I don’t really look at the bottle, I just… take them when it hurts. I am sorry, I don't know much about these things. It just hurts, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, acetaminophen. And just to clarify, are you taking any other medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the pills for aches, when I need them. I try not to take too many. I don't like to take pills, if I can help it. I had a… a bad experience with pills once, a long time ago. I prefer to just work, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other regular medications. And thank you for letting me know about your previous experience with pills. That's good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have… high blood pressure, maybe? The doctor told me a long time ago. I take pills for that, sometimes. But not all the time. And my knees are bad, too. Old injury. But that’s just… aches. It is my back that is the problem now. I am not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, which you sometimes take medication for, and some knee pain from an old injury. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure when you do take it?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, Doctor. I just… my daughter gives me the pills. She knows what I need. I don't look at the names. I am sorry. I really don’t remember. It is a white pill, maybe? I am very bad with names.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can look into that later. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Maybe when I was a little girl, for my tonsils? But I don’t really remember. Nothing major, if I did. Nothing on my back, certainly. I have been lucky, I think. Until now, with my back.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major surgeries as far as you can recall. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my husband… he passed away a few years ago. He had… heart problems. And my daughter, she is healthy, thankfully. She lives far away. She worries about me. My mother… she had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. But that is all I can really remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. I have never had a reaction to anything. My daughter always asks me, but I always say no. I eat everything, I take what she gives me… I don't have any allergies, thankfully. I think. I don’t remember anything bad happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we do a physical exam, let me just ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No, no. I never smoke. My husband, he smoked, but I never did. And I don’t drink alcohol. Not much, anyway. Maybe a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but very rarely. And I certainly don’t use… those drugs. No, no. I just work.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, regarding your work. You mentioned you fix cars. How physically demanding is that work, generally?
PATIENT: Oh, very demanding, Doctor. Very demanding. Lots of bending, lifting, reaching… standing all day. It is not easy work. Especially now, with my back. It used to be okay, but… now it is hard. I try to take breaks, but there is always something to do. It is my livelihood, you see. I need to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Benites, thank you for that information. It sounds like a very physically demanding job. Alright, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. I can lie down. Please, go ahead. It hurts a little to move, you see. But I will try.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Benites, just lie on your back for me, please. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your reflexes and strength in your legs. And finally, I’ll gently feel along your spine to see where the pain is most pronounced. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay, heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Strength is 5/5 in both legs. Now, let's check your spine. Can you point to where you’re feeling the most pain?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Right here. It hurts… when I press. And it goes down my leg sometimes, like… like a shooting pain. Not all the time, but… yes, right here is the worst. Ooh, that hurts a little. Be careful, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, there’s definite tenderness here in the lumbar region, and some muscle spasm. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion. Can you try to bend forward, slowly?
PATIENT: Ooh… that hurts, Doctor. I can’t go very far. It… it stops right here. It feels… stuck. And it hurts to go further. Please, stop me if it is too much. It is very painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Benites, don’t push yourself. That’s alright. Limited range of motion with pain. And now, I’m going to do a straight leg raise test. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No numbness or tingling. Just… pain. The pain in my back, and sometimes down my leg. But not… numb. Is something wrong, Doctor? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Benites, the straight leg raise on your left side reproduces your leg pain, which is consistent with possible nerve irritation. Based on the physical exam and your history, it sounds like you may have a lumbar strain with possible sciatica – irritation of the sciatic nerve. However, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lumbar spine to rule out any structural problems. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: X-ray? Is it… is it dangerous, Doctor? And what will it show? Will it show if something is broken? I worry about… about being old. I just want to fix my back, so I can go back to work. What do you think, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Ms. Benites, an X-ray uses a very small amount of radiation, and the benefits of getting a clear diagnosis outweigh the risks in this case. It will show us the bones in your spine and help rule out any fractures or other structural issues. It won’t show the nerves themselves, but it’s a good first step. As for whether it’s serious, it’s hard to say for sure without the X-ray. A lumbar strain is common and often improves with conservative treatment – rest, physical therapy, and pain management. Sciatica can be more bothersome, but it’s also usually treatable. We'll know more once we have the X-ray results. I am going to get an order for the X-ray now. The technician will explain the procedure to you. It's quick and painless. Would you like me to call your daughter to let her know what’s going on?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. Call my daughter, please. She worries about me. And… thank you. You are very kind. I hope it is not too bad. Just… just fix my back, so I can go back to work.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Benites. I will call your daughter right away. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant and some pain medication to help manage your discomfort while we wait for the X-ray results. I'll also give you some instructions on how to care for your back at home – things like avoiding heavy lifting and bending, and using heat or ice. Here are the prescriptions and instructions. I want you to take it easy for the next few days, and let me know if your pain gets worse. We’ll discuss the X-ray results as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you for calling my daughter. That is very kind of you. I will… I will take it easy. And I will follow your instructions. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel… a little better now. Knowing what is going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. I will see you back here once we have the X-ray results. Take care, and remember to rest.
