DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, the nurse gave me some papers after my check-up, and it says my cholesterol is a little high. That’s what I’m here about, I think. Hyperlipidemia… is that right? It's a mouthful.
DOCTOR: Yes, hyperlipidemia. It is a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is! So, is that bad? I mean, what does “high cholesterol” even mean? I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly. Not a lot of fried foods or anything.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Geho, it means there's too much of a fatty substance in your blood. It builds up in your arteries, you see, and that can… well, it's not ideal. It restricts blood flow. You say you eat healthy, but "mostly" isn’t a diagnosis. Can you be more specific about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Oh. That doesn't sound good. Restricting blood flow… no, that doesn't sound good at all. Let me think… Well, for breakfast I usually have oatmeal with some fruit. Lunch is often a sandwich, turkey usually, on whole wheat. And dinner… it varies. Sometimes fish, sometimes chicken, sometimes pasta. I do like a little cheese with my pasta, if that matters. And I have a small piece of dark chocolate almost every night. Is that bad? I thought dark chocolate was good for you.
DOCTOR: Dark chocolate has some benefits, yes, but it's still…chocolate. And cheese, while not inherently terrible, is rather high in saturated fat. Let's focus on the bigger picture. How often would you say you eat red meat?
PATIENT: Hmm… red meat. Not very often, honestly. Maybe once a month? Sometimes less. Usually it’s for a special occasion, like a birthday or something. I don’t really crave it, if that makes sense. My mother always made a lovely roast, but I don't make it myself often. I prefer fish, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise… well, I try to walk most days. Not a long walk, mind you, maybe half an hour. I live near a park, so I stroll around there. I used to do more when I was younger, swimming mostly, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. Does strolling count? It gets my heart rate up a little, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It's…a start. Now, let's review your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've been pretty healthy, all my life, really. I had the usual childhood things, you know, chickenpox, measles, but nothing serious. I had my blood pressure checked regularly with my old doctor, and it was always fine. And I've never been told I had diabetes. Medicare sends me those reminders for check-ups, and everything's always been okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago. And I had a small operation on my knee a few years back, just to clean up some cartilage. Nothing major, it wasn’t very painful. That's about it, I think. I've been very lucky, really. I try to avoid hospitals if I can.
DOCTOR: Very well. And family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... That's a little tricky. My father had some heart trouble later in life, I think. He didn’t take very good care of himself, smoked a lot, you know. And my mother... she had arthritis, mostly. I don't think anyone else had any serious heart problems, but my family isn't very good at talking about that sort of thing. It was always a bit of a taboo subject, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I prefer to… well, I prefer to just try and stay healthy on my own, if that makes sense. I've always been a bit cautious about medications, always worried about side effects. That's probably silly, but… that’s just me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then we can discuss this further. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll check your blood pressure again. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… sensible. I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. My knees aren’t very good in the cold, you see. I’m glad it's not too drafty in here.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat on the examination table. I'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is… 142 over 88. A bit elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are normal. Alright, Ms. Geho, everything seems structurally sound, but your blood pressure is higher than we’d like, and the murmur warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? A murmur… what does that mean exactly? Is it serious? And what about my cholesterol? Is it really that high? I’m starting to get a bit worried now. I thought I was taking pretty good care of myself.
DOCTOR: A murmur isn't necessarily serious, Ms. Geho. It simply means there's an unusual sound during your heartbeat. It could be nothing, but we need to investigate further to rule out any underlying issues. As for your cholesterol, your total cholesterol is 240, your LDL is 160, and your HDL is 40. These numbers are… elevated. Frankly, they are higher than they should be. Lifestyle changes alone may not be sufficient in your case. We need to discuss medication options.
PATIENT: Oh. 240… is that bad? I don’t understand these numbers. LDL and HDL… what do those even mean? And medication… I really don’t like the sound of that. Are there… other options? Maybe I could just eat even healthier? Or exercise more? I really don't want to take pills every day. I'm worried about side effects, like I said. Is there anything else we can try first?
DOCTOR: Ms. Geho, LDL is the “bad” cholesterol, the one that builds up in your arteries. HDL is the “good” cholesterol. A low HDL and high LDL is a problematic combination. While dietary changes and exercise are always recommended, your numbers are significantly elevated. Relying on those alone at this point would be… insufficient. I understand your concerns about medication, but statins are generally very safe and effective. The benefits far outweigh the risks in your case. We could try a more aggressive diet and exercise plan for three months and re-evaluate, but frankly, I believe you would benefit significantly from starting a low-dose statin now. We’ll monitor your liver enzymes regularly, of course. Are you familiar with statins?
PATIENT: No, I don't think I am. I've heard the name, maybe on television, but I don't know what they do exactly. And what about side effects? I've heard… things. Muscle aches, memory problems… I worry about those sorts of things. Is there a… a gentler statin? Or maybe a different kind of medication altogether? I really don't want to feel worse just to lower my cholesterol. I’m starting to feel quite overwhelmed, to be honest. This is a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Statins work by blocking an enzyme in your liver that produces cholesterol. They are the gold standard for lowering LDL cholesterol. As for side effects, muscle aches are the most common, but they are usually mild and manageable. Memory problems are rare. There are different statins, yes, but they all work similarly. We can start with a very low dose of atorvastatin – 10 milligrams – and see how you tolerate it. We’ll do blood work in one month to check your cholesterol levels and liver enzymes. I strongly advise against delaying treatment. Your numbers warrant intervention now to minimize your risk of cardiovascular events. Do you have any questions about this, Ms. Geho?
PATIENT: Cardiovascular events… that sounds scary. A month… okay. 10 milligrams… is that a lot? I suppose if it's a low dose… But what if I do get muscle aches? Would I have to stop taking it? And what if… what if it affects my memory? I’m a retired aerospace engineer, you see. I like to read, and I like to keep my mind active. I wouldn’t want anything to interfere with that. I just… I wish there was something else we could try. Is there anything at all? Perhaps a supplement? I’ve heard good things about red yeast rice… Would that be an option, maybe alongside the… the statin, just to start?
DOCTOR: Red yeast rice contains a naturally occurring statin, Ms. Geho, but the amount is inconsistent and unregulated. Relying on it is not a substitute for proven medical treatment. As for your concerns, muscle aches are usually mild and temporary. If they occur, we can adjust the dose or switch to a different statin. Memory problems are exceedingly rare. I understand your apprehension, but delaying treatment will only increase your risk. I am recommending a low-dose statin – 10 milligrams of atorvastatin – and regular monitoring. I will write you a prescription. Here is the prescription. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in one month for blood work and a re-evaluation. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: I… I suppose not. But I’m still worried. Very worried. I’ll try the statin, as you recommend, but I’d like to keep my options open. I’m going to do some more research on red yeast rice, and I’m going to try to eat even healthier, and walk more. I’ll see how I feel, and we’ll talk again in a month. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… advice.
