DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor recently, and it’s… different. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but it’s not my usual smell, and it’s making me a little self-conscious.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to be concerned about changes in your body, and you’re not alone – many people experience this at some point. It's good you brought it to my attention. Can you describe what you mean by “different”?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay, let me think. It’s not bad, exactly. It’s just… stronger, I guess. And maybe a little… musky? I usually smell pretty neutral, or just a bit like soap, but this is… more noticeable. I’ve been using the same deodorant for years, and I haven’t changed anything in my routine, so that’s what’s so strange. It started maybe a month ago? It's hard to pinpoint exactly when.
DOCTOR: Okay, stronger and musky, starting about a month ago, and you haven’t changed deodorants or your general hygiene routine. That’s helpful. And just to clarify, is this odor constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's pretty constant, I think. I notice it first thing in the morning, and it seems to stay with me all day. It doesn’t really get worse with activity, it’s just… always there, a little bit. I've even tried sniffing my armpits throughout the day, which feels a bit silly, but I wanted to be sure!
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all to be observant of your body, Kerriann. That's actually very proactive of you. Okay, constant odor, present even in the morning. That does give us some clues. Now, let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes recently – any weight loss or gain, changes in your diet, new medications, or increased stress levels?
PATIENT: Let’s see… no significant weight loss or gain. My diet hasn’t changed much, pretty much the same as always. No new medications, thankfully. Stress… well, my divorce was finalized about six months ago, so things have been a little calmer on that front, but adjusting to being on my own is… something. It’s not overwhelming, but it’s definitely a change.
DOCTOR: I understand. Adjusting to a major life change like a divorce is significant, even if it’s a positive step. Stress can definitely impact the body in unexpected ways. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, just to get a more complete picture. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, thyroid problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I had high blood pressure for a little while a few years back, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for a long time now. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension is good to know. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and I broke my arm once when I was in college, but nothing major since then. No hospitalizations, thankfully. I’ve been lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure medication, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. And I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. I try to eat a pretty balanced diet, so I don't always remember to take it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily, and occasional multivitamins. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way too, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's very good to know. And finally, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had diabetes, type 2, and my father had high blood pressure, like me. My grandmother on my mother’s side had some kind of thyroid problem, but I don’t know the details, it was a long time ago. Nothing else that I can think of, really. They all lived pretty long lives, actually, despite those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and a thyroid issue on the maternal side. Thank you, that's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at your skin to rule out anything obvious. It’s a pretty standard check-up. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Lymph nodes feel normal. Skin looks good – no rashes or unusual discoloration. Blood pressure is 130/80 today, which is well-controlled. Now, I’m going to ask you to lift your arms above your head and let me check your armpits. Just to make sure there isn't anything obvious going on there. It's a standard part of the exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything looks normal there as well. No signs of infection or anything concerning. Given your history and the physical exam, the change in body odor is likely related to hormonal fluctuations, potentially stemming from the adjustment period after your divorce. Stress can definitely play a role in hormonal changes. It's also possible, though less likely given the negative exam, that there’s a subtle change in your skin microbiome. However, to be thorough, I'd like to order some blood work. We'll check your thyroid function, basic metabolic panel, and a complete blood count. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. I’d rather be sure, and if it’s just hormones, that’s good to know too. Blood work is fine.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll get the lab orders sent over electronically to the lab just down the hall. They should be able to draw the blood right away. You don't need an appointment. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend continuing your current hygiene routine. If the odor is particularly bothersome, you could try an antibacterial soap, but avoid anything too harsh as it can irritate your skin. Also, staying hydrated and managing stress through relaxation techniques – things like yoga or meditation – can be helpful. I’ll give you a call with the results as soon as they come in, typically within 2-3 business days. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very reasonable. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate this. It's reassuring to know there's a plan. Two to three business days is fine, I can wait.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I'm glad I could help. It’s always best to address these things, even if they seem minor. Don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before the results come back. Here's a summary of our plan, and the lab order information. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That summary sheet is perfect, and you’ve answered all my questions. Thank you again, Doctor Gegan. I feel much better now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I’m glad I could ease your mind. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
