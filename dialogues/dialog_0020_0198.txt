DOCTOR: Good morning, Liza. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Beinborn. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, I've been thinking a lot lately about… finding some peace, I guess. I heard good things about mindfulness and meditation, and I thought maybe this would be a good place to ask about it. I work a pretty hands-on job – repairing signals and track switches for the railway – and it can be quite stressful sometimes, keeping everything running smoothly and safely. It’s not a bad job, but… it would be nice to have a way to calm things down in my head when I'm not working, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're looking for ways to manage stress, and exploring mindfulness is a good step. It's very common for people in demanding jobs to experience that. So, when you say "stress," can you describe what that feels like for you?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s not usually a panic or anything like that. More like… a constant buzzing in the back of my mind. Like I’m always checking, re-checking, thinking about what could go wrong, even when everything is alright. It makes it hard to switch off at the end of the day. Sometimes my sleep isn’t the best, just… restless. And occasionally, a bit of a tight feeling in my chest, though that doesn’t happen often. It’s mostly just… a lot of thinking. I remember once, we had a small derailment – thankfully no one was hurt – and for weeks afterward, I just kept replaying everything in my head, trying to figure out if I could have prevented it. Even though everyone said it wasn’t my fault. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Liza. It sounds like you’re experiencing some anxiety, and it's very understandable given your profession. It's good you’re aware of these feelings and wanting to address them. You mentioned the chest tightness – has that been happening more recently, or is it something that comes and goes?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. It wasn't frequent at all for a long time. Maybe once or twice a year, if I had a particularly stressful week. But in the last few months, it’s been… maybe three or four times? It's not painful, exactly. More like… uncomfortable. Like someone is squeezing. It usually goes away on its own after a little while, or if I focus on my breathing. It hasn't been severe enough to stop me from doing anything, thankfully. I just… don't like the feeling of it. And it makes me worry more, which I'm sure doesn’t help!
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. It's good it's not severe, but you're right, any chest discomfort warrants attention. Let's briefly review your medical history, just to get a clearer picture. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure, heart problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. My doctor always says my blood pressure is a little on the lower side, actually. I had a routine check-up last year, and everything was normal. No diabetes in the family either. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing major since. I do wear glasses, as you can see, and my back can be a little stiff after a long day at work, but that’s about it. I’m on Medicare, so I get regular check-ups.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, thankfully. And I haven't been hospitalized since I was a little girl with a bad case of pneumonia when I was seven. It was a long time ago! Everything's been smooth sailing health-wise since then, honestly. I try to eat reasonably well, and I get a fair amount of walking in, just by the nature of my job. It's not a desk job, that's for sure!
DOCTOR: That's good. So, no allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I can eat pretty much anything. My grandmother used to make all sorts of Bulgarian dishes – some of them quite spicy! – and I never had any trouble with them. My coworkers tease me that I have a cast iron stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills unless absolutely necessary. I might take an occasional pain reliever for a headache, but that's it. And even then, it’s just ibuprofen or something similar. I try to get by without medication whenever possible. I find a good night’s sleep usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: Okay. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, would you mind if I do a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Not at all. Go right ahead. I don’t mind at all. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’m used to being poked and prodded a little, with my job – checking everything is safe and secure, you know.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just have a seat on the table, that would be perfect. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just do a quick general exam. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is very good, 118 over 72. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems within normal limits physically. Now, you mentioned the chest tightness. Can you show me where you usually feel it?
PATIENT: It’s usually right… here. Not a sharp pain, like a stabbing. More of a… squeezing feeling. Sometimes it radiates a little bit into my shoulders, but not always. It’s not constant, like I said. Comes and goes, usually when I’m feeling particularly stressed or anxious. It’s hard to explain… it's not like anything I've ever felt before, really. It's just… uncomfortable. And it makes me worry, which probably makes it worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re describing what could be musculoskeletal discomfort, potentially related to stress and anxiety. However, given your description, and the fact it radiates to your shoulders, it's important to rule out any cardiac concerns, just to be safe. Would you be open to getting an EKG, just to get a baseline reading of your heart’s electrical activity?
PATIENT: An EKG? Hmm… I suppose so. If it will put my mind at rest, then yes, that sounds sensible. I’m not afraid of it, it’s just… I haven’t had one before. Is it uncomfortable? And how long does it take? I do have to get back to work this afternoon, so I’m a little mindful of time.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be mindful of time. An EKG is very quick and painless. It involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart's electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. We can get it done right here in the clinic. It’s a standard precaution, especially with chest discomfort, and it will give us peace of mind. We can also discuss some coping strategies for your stress and anxiety while we wait for the results. Would you like me to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds like a good plan. If it’s quick and won't take up too much of my afternoon, then let’s get it done. And yes, discussing some ways to manage the stress would be wonderful. I’m open to anything, really. Mindfulness, meditation… whatever you think might help. I'm willing to give it a try.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse will be right in to get you set up for the EKG. While we wait, let's talk a little more about your stress. What sorts of things specifically trigger it at work?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not usually one specific thing. It’s more of a cumulative effect, I think. The responsibility, mostly. Making sure everything is running safely, that the signals are functioning correctly, the tracks are clear… there's a lot that relies on our team, you know? And sometimes, we have unexpected issues – a signal malfunction, a weather event, a derailment, thankfully rare, but it happens. Then it’s a scramble to fix things quickly and efficiently. And the pressure to get everything back on schedule… it can be quite intense. It's not a physically dangerous job, not usually, but the mental strain can be exhausting. And you're constantly thinking, "What if..."
DOCTOR: That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like you carry a significant mental load, and that’s completely understandable. The "what if" thinking is very common with high-responsibility jobs. Have you ever tried any specific techniques to manage that stress, even something as simple as deep breathing exercises or taking short breaks during the day?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I tend to just… push through it, to be honest. I'm not one for sitting still for long. I've tried taking a few deep breaths sometimes when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed, but I find it hard to focus on it. My mind just races. And breaks are difficult too. There's always something that needs to be checked or monitored. It feels like if I take my attention away for even a few minutes, something will go wrong. It’s probably irrational, but that’s how it feels. My coworkers sometimes tell me I need to slow down and take care of myself, but it’s hard to get into the habit.
DOCTOR: That’s very common, and you’re not alone in feeling that way. It's admirable that you’re dedicated to your job, but it's important to remember that taking care of yourself isn't selfish—it actually makes you more effective in the long run. It sounds like you might benefit from some structured relaxation techniques, like progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness exercises. These techniques can help you calm your mind and body, even in stressful situations. We can also explore some cognitive behavioral techniques to help you challenge those "what if" thoughts. Would you be open to me providing you with some resources on these techniques?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. I’m willing to try anything, as long as it doesn’t involve a lot of sitting still for hours! Resources would be great. Perhaps some handouts or a website I could look at? And if there’s a local class I could take, that might be good too. Something short and practical, not too complicated. I appreciate you suggesting things. It’s helpful to know I’m not just… expected to deal with it on my own.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely not alone, Liza, and you're not expected to deal with it on your own. I’m glad I could help. I'll print out some handouts with information on progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness exercises, as well as a list of local resources for stress management classes. While we wait for the EKG results, let's talk briefly about your sleep. You mentioned it's sometimes restless. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. It's good to have something concrete to work with. My sleep… it’s not terrible, but it’s not the best either. I usually fall asleep alright, but I wake up a few times during the night. It’s not usually anything specific, just… restless. My mind keeps going over things, replaying events from the day. Sometimes I’ll wake up with a feeling of anxiety, even if I can’t pinpoint why. And I don’t always feel fully rested in the morning. It’s not every night, but it happens enough that I notice it. I don’t have any trouble staying asleep once I’m back down, just… the waking up in the middle of the night.
DOCTOR: That's quite common with stress and anxiety. It sounds like you're experiencing some sleep disturbance. It’s important to address that, as sleep is crucial for both physical and mental health. Nurse, do we have the EKG results yet?
PATIENT: Good. Hopefully, it’s nothing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, Liza. The EKG looks completely normal. There are no signs of any heart problems. That's excellent news. So, to summarize, you’re experiencing stress and anxiety related to your job, which is causing restless sleep and some chest discomfort. Physically, everything looks good. I recommend we focus on stress management techniques, like progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness exercises. I'll give you some handouts with information on those techniques, as well as a list of local resources. Would you be interested in a referral to a therapist specializing in stress and anxiety management?
PATIENT: That’s… very reassuring to hear about the EKG. Thank you. And yes, a referral to a therapist… that might be helpful. I've never really spoken to anyone about this before, so it feels a little daunting, but if you think it would be beneficial, then yes, I’m willing to try it. Especially if they specialize in stress management, given my job. I just… want to find a way to cope with it better, and hopefully get a better night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Taking that first step can be daunting, but it’s a sign of strength, not weakness. I have a list of excellent therapists in the area who specialize in stress and anxiety management. I'll write you a referral. I’ll also give you a handout with some immediate coping strategies for when you're feeling overwhelmed, like deep breathing exercises and grounding techniques. And remember, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, don't hesitate to contact me. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and offer suggestions. I feel much better now, knowing I’m not just… stuck dealing with this on my own. The handouts and the referral will be very helpful. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. I’m glad I could help. Remember, taking care of your mental health is just as important as taking care of your physical health. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. I’ll have the nurse print out those handouts and the referral for you now. Have a good day, and please, take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: .
