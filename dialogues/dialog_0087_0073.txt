DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't have time for this. It's my stomach. It's been…bad. Really bad. Everything I eat goes right through me. I've tried…things. Over-the-counter stuff. It hasn't helped. That's why I'm here, I guess. But honestly, I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: I understand you're short on time, Ms. Woodring, and I'll do my best to be efficient. “Bad” can mean a lot of things. Could you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You need me to explain what diarrhea is? It's… watery. Frequent. I go to the bathroom constantly. And it's not just a little bit, okay? It's… a lot. And it started a few days ago, and it's not getting better, which is why I bothered coming in. I don't usually complain.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent, watery stools starting a few days ago, and not improving with over-the-counter medications. And you said it's… substantial. Any nausea, vomiting, or fever accompanying this?
PATIENT: No fever. No throwing up. Just…this. And a lot of cramping. It feels like my insides are trying to escape, if that makes any sense. Honestly, it’s just…inconvenient. I have things to do. I don’t have time to be running to the bathroom every hour. I need to know what's causing this and how to fix it, quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no vomiting, significant cramping. Has anything specific made it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Honestly? Nothing makes it better. And pretty much everything makes it worse. I tried eating bland food yesterday – toast, crackers – and it didn't matter. Coffee makes it worse, obviously. But so did…well, pretty much everything else. I just…stopped trying to eat anything, really. I'm mostly just drinking water at this point, and even that feels risky.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no dietary changes have helped, and even drinking water feels uncomfortable. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Look, are you seriously asking me that? Do I look like I enjoy talking about this? Of course I've noticed! It's not just water, okay? It's…messy. And yes, there's blood. A little bit. Not a huge amount, but enough to know it's there. Is that what you wanted to hear? Now, can we please get to the part where you tell me what's wrong and how to fix it?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you for clarifying. Blood in the stool is important information. And I apologize if my questions feel intrusive – I need to gather as much detail as possible to understand what's happening. Have you had any recent travel, or been exposed to anyone who is sick?
PATIENT: Travel? No. I haven’t left this town in months. And sick people? Everyone's sick these days. I work with the public, for goodness sake. I paint houses, I'm around people all the time. I can't exactly quarantine myself every time someone sneezes. Look, I’m a healthy person. I’ve always been healthy. This is… unusual. I don’t need a lecture about germs. I need a solution.
DOCTOR: Alright. No recent travel, exposure to sick individuals is likely given your profession. And this is a change from your usual good health. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…make it quick. I have work waiting. And please, don't poke too much. It's…sensitive. Honestly, I'm starting to regret even coming in. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. If you could lie down on the examination table, please. I’ll start with listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds, though they are slightly hyperactive. There is some tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. No rebound tenderness or guarding. That's helpful information. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have infectious gastroenteritis – what most people call a stomach bug. The blood in the stool, while concerning, is not necessarily indicative of something serious in this context, but we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: A stomach bug? Seriously? After all that questioning, all this poking around, it's a stomach bug? I could have told you that myself. I've had those before. Why did I even bother coming in? So, what do I do about it? I need something to stop it, and I need it now. Don't tell me to drink fluids, I'm already doing that. I need a medicine. Something that actually works.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. While a stomach bug is the most likely diagnosis, we need to be thorough to rule out other possibilities, particularly given the presence of blood in your stool. I'm going to order a stool sample to check for bacterial infection, parasites, and inflammation. It's a standard precaution. In the meantime, to manage your symptoms, I can prescribe an anti-diarrheal medication, loperamide. It should help slow things down. However, it’s important to use it as directed and stop it if your symptoms worsen. We also need to ensure you stay hydrated. Given your cramping and discomfort, I'll also prescribe a medication to help with abdominal spasms. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’m not allergic to anything. Honestly, I just want this over with. Can you just write the prescriptions and be done? I have a job to get back to. And please, make sure the anti-diarrheal is something strong. This has been going on long enough. I don't want to be back here tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m prescribing loperamide 2mg, take two tablets after your first loose stool, then one tablet after each subsequent loose stool, not to exceed eight tablets in 24 hours. And I’m also prescribing hyoscyamine 0.125mg, take one tablet every four to six hours as needed for abdominal cramping. Here are your prescriptions. You can pick them up at your usual pharmacy. I also want you to follow a bland diet for the next 24-48 hours – toast, crackers, rice, bananas. Avoid dairy, fatty foods, and sugary drinks. And most importantly, stay hydrated. We'll need to see you back in 3-5 days for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the stool sample. If your symptoms worsen – high fever, severe abdominal pain, bloody stools that continue or worsen, or signs of dehydration – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just…thank you. I guess. Honestly, this whole thing has been a waste of time. I hope these pills actually work. I really don't have time to be sick. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon, Ms. Woodring. And please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. .
