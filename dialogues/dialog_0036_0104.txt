DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh. Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… my throat. It hurts. Really hurts when I swallow. I don't… well, I don't have time for a lot of this, if you don't mind. Just… fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand you're in a hurry, Tammie, and we’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this quickly. "Really hurts when you swallow" is good information. Can you tell me a little more about when this throat pain started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start? Honestly… a few days, I think? Maybe longer. It's all a bit of a blur, you know. Things have been… difficult. Not important right now. It just hurts when I eat. And drink. Which is… inconvenient. I don’t really keep track of these things. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Tammie. We’ll work with what you can remember. “A few days, maybe longer” is helpful. Has anything made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Yes. Talking. Definitely talking. And… that hot tea my niece gave me. She means well, but it felt like fire. Nothing… nothing really makes it better. I tried… some lozenges, I think. From the store. Didn't do much. Honestly, I just want to know what you need to do to fix it. I have things to get back to. Important things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so talking and hot tea make it worse, and lozenges didn't help much. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, dear. Let me think… I… I feel a bit tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And maybe a little… stuffy? In my head. Not a headache, exactly. Just… congested. Is that what you mean? I really don't pay attention to these things. I just… push through. It’s what you have to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some fatigue and congestion along with the sore throat. Have you had a fever or chills at all?
PATIENT: A fever? Oh, goodness no. I haven't… I haven't checked. I don’t have a thermometer. And I don't… feel hot. I don’t usually get fevers. Just… this sore throat. And the tiredness. It's very… disruptive. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: No, we're getting there, Tammie. Just a few more questions. Have you noticed any cough, runny nose, or body aches?
PATIENT: A cough… sometimes. A little one. Not a bad one. More of a… tickle, really. And… no, no runny nose. And my… aches? I’m always a bit achy. From the work, you see. It’s a… physical job. So, I don't know if that counts. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know what's wrong and what I need to do. I'm a very busy woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slight cough and some general aches from work. Have you been around anyone who has been sick recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. People are always sick. Especially at the plant. Everyone coughs and sneezes. It’s… unavoidable. My coworker, Miriama, had a terrible cold last week, but… everyone gets colds. I don't… I don't remember anyone being particularly worse than usual. Is that useful information? I really need to get back. I have schedules to keep.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Tammie. Okay, let's do a quick exam of your throat, ears, and lungs. It will just take a few moments. Please open your mouth for me and say "ah."
PATIENT: Fine. But please be quick. Just get it over with. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, your throat is a bit red and inflamed, and I see some mild swelling of your tonsils. Your ears look clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out. Lungs sound clear as well, but I do hear a bit of congestion. It’s likely you have a viral pharyngitis – a sore throat from a virus. It’s very common. The congestion could be from the same virus or just a bit of a cold.
PATIENT: A… viral what? Is that… serious? I have things to do, Doctor. I can't be sick. What does that mean? Will I need… shots? Or pills? I really don’t have time for complications. Just tell me what I need to take. And how long will this… viral thing last? Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: No, Tammie, it’s not serious. "Viral pharyngitis" just means a sore throat caused by a virus – like a common cold. It will likely resolve on its own within a week or so. No shots are needed. We don't use antibiotics for viruses, as they won’t help. I recommend supportive care: rest, plenty of fluids – water, tea, broth – and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to manage the pain and fever, if you develop one. Lozenges can also help soothe your throat. Are you allergic to either of those medications?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I… I don’t really take much of anything. I just push through. But… ibuprofen. My stomach doesn't… agree with it. Acetaminophen is fine, I suppose. So… rest, drink fluids, and take that… acetaminophen. Is that all? Can I go now? I have very important things to get back to. Schedules. People depending on me. Really, Doctor, I appreciate you seeing me, but… this has taken a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. Rest, fluids, and acetaminophen as needed for pain. Avoid ibuprofen. Given your job and the fact you haven't been feeling well, I recommend avoiding close contact with others as much as possible to prevent spreading anything, if it is contagious. And if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain – please come back immediately or go to the emergency room. I’m going to write a brief note for your work excusing you for a few days. Would you like that?
PATIENT: A note? Oh. Yes. Yes, that would be… helpful. Thank you. People at the plant are… particular. They won’t believe me without something in writing. Is that… is that everything? Can I please go now? I have schedules to manage. It's really quite important. And thank you for the note. That's… considerate.
DOCTOR: Here’s the note for your work. It excuses you for three days due to a viral upper respiratory infection. I’ll also write down the recommendations—rest, fluids, acetaminophen—on a piece of paper for you. Please don’t hesitate to come back if things get worse. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Tammie?
PATIENT: No. No, that’s… that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Schedules. That's all I think about. Thank you again. And… good day. .
