DOCTOR: Hi Demondre, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doc. Good to meet you too. Um, nothin’ really wrong, ya know? Just…curious, I guess. Been meanin’ to get a check-up for a while now, figured today was as good a day as any. I work on the boats, keepin’ things oiled and runnin’. Just wanna make sure I’m still good to go, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a really good idea to get a baseline check-up, even without a specific complaint. Preventative care is important, especially with a physically demanding job like working on the boats. Let me pull up your chart here…Alright, Demondre Heindel, age 25. It looks like this is your first visit with us. To get started, can you tell me a little more about what "good to go" means for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, first time here. Usually just tough it out, but…maybe I should be smarter about that. “Good to go” means I can still lift stuff, climb around on the engines, work long hours without feelin’ completely beat. Like, no aches that won’t go away, no gettin’ winded too easy, ya know? Just feelin’ strong and able to do the job. I guess. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly. You want to maintain your physical capabilities for work. That’s a very reasonable goal. Okay, so no persistent aches, and good endurance are important to you. Let's go through a quick history to get a better picture of things. Have you had any significant medical illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… nothin’ major. When I was a little kid I broke my arm fallin’ outta a tree, had to get a cast. But that was ages ago. And, uh…I had the flu pretty bad a couple times. Other than that…nope. Not really. I try to stay healthy, ya know? I eat okay, mostly. When I can eat regular, that is. Work schedule’s kinda weird sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a broken arm as a child, and the flu a couple of times. Nothing serious recently. And you mentioned a sometimes irregular eating schedule due to work – we can definitely talk about that later. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Didn't even get my tonsils taken out when I was little. Always been lucky, I guess. Mostly just bumps and bruises from workin' on the boats. Nothin' a little ice and time can't fix.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! No surgeries is definitely a plus. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that runs in the family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mom, she's got high blood pressure, takes pills for it. And my grandpa on my dad’s side, he had… I think it was somethin' with his heart, but he passed away a while ago. I don’t really remember all the details. My dad’s pretty healthy, as far as I know. And I don’t really know much about my grandma on my mom's side - haven't seen her in years. Does that make sense? It’s kinda hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. High blood pressure in your mom and a heart condition in your grandfather – that's good information to have. We'll keep those in mind. Now, just to get a full picture, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Don’t take nothin’ regularly. Maybe some ibuprofen when my back’s sore from liftin’ stuff, but that’s it. And, uh…sometimes I take somethin' for sleep if I can’t get shut-eye. But not every night, ya know? It's just…a little somethin' over the counter. Can’t remember the name right now. Sorry, I’m not good with names.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize! It’s common to forget names. Just ibuprofen for back pain as needed, and an over-the-counter sleep aid occasionally. We'll try to get the name of that sleep aid later, if you remember. It’s important to know everything you’re taking, even if it’s occasional, as it can affect other things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. And I haven't ever had a bad reaction to any medicine. Well…once I got a rash from poison ivy, but that wasn't a medicine or nothin’. Just… poison ivy.
DOCTOR: Okay, good, no known allergies. Poison ivy doesn't count! Alright Demondre, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, that's fine. Sounds good, Doc. Just let me know whatcha need me to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, let’s check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. I’ll also feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Just relax your arm, please. Your blood pressure is 130/85. That’s slightly elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. We’ll keep an eye on it. Your pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6, and your respiratory rate is 16. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. Just breathe normally. Sounds good. No murmurs or unusual sounds. And now your lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me… Excellent. Lungs are clear. Let's take a quick look in your ears…Everything looks normal in both ears. And your nose and throat look clear as well. No signs of infection. I'm going to gently feel your abdomen…Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. Feels okay. A little…empty, maybe? I haven't really been eatin' much lately, like I said. Work schedule’s been crazy. But nothin' hurts, ya know? Just… feels kinda weird sometimes. Like, empty.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. The abdomen is soft, and no tenderness reported. I noticed you mentioned not eating much. Are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. Just... not hungry a lot. And when I do eat, it's usually quick, ya know? Grab somethin' on the go. No time to sit down and have a proper meal. And when I'm tired, I really don’t feel like eatin’ at all. It's kinda hard to explain. I guess I just don’t prioritize eatin’ when I'm busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a decreased appetite and irregular eating patterns, often linked to your work schedule and fatigue. That's good information to have. Now, just a few more quick things. Let’s check your reflexes. Everything looks normal there. Alright Demondre, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems to be within normal limits, but I am a little concerned about your decreased appetite and irregular eating habits. It’s important to make sure you’re getting enough nutrients, especially with a physically demanding job. Also, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and we'll want to monitor that as well.
PATIENT: Yeah, I kinda figured somethin’ was up with the eatin’ thing. I just thought it was from bein’ tired all the time. And the blood pressure… that's somethin' I should probably worry about, huh? My mom always tells me to eat better, but… it's just hard when I'm workin' so much. What do you think I should do?
DOCTOR: You're right to be proactive about it. Your mom’s right, of course. Even if it's hard, it's important. Given your work schedule and fatigue, I'm concerned about potential nutritional deficiencies and the impact on your overall health. And the slightly elevated blood pressure warrants attention. I'd like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, electrolyte balance, and overall organ function. We should also repeat the blood pressure measurement in a week or so, ideally at different times of the day, to get a better baseline. I’m also going to recommend a consultation with a registered dietitian. They can help you develop a meal plan that fits your work schedule and ensures you’re getting enough nutrients, even when you're busy. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. Blood work and a dietitian… okay. I can do that. I mean, I want to feel better, and I guess I haven’t really been takin’ care of myself. When you put it like that… it makes sense. When can I get the blood work done? And how do I get ahold of the dietitian?
DOCTOR: That’s a great attitude, Demondre. It's the first step! I’ll send an order to the lab here at the clinic. You can go any time Monday through Friday, no appointment needed. The results usually take 2-3 business days. As for the dietitian, here’s a referral form with a few names and contact information for registered dietitians in the area. Many accept Medicare, but it’s best to confirm with them directly. They’ll work with you to create a personalized meal plan. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the blood work results and see how you’re doing with the meal plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, two weeks sounds perfect. I'll get the blood work done this week, and call the dietitian. I appreciate you helpin’ me out, Doc. I've been meanin' to do this for a while, but... I just didn't know where to start. Is there anything else I need to do right now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Demondre. It’s my job to help you get on the right track. No, that’s all for today. I'll have the lab order and referral form sent to the front desk for you. Just remember to prioritize your health, even when you're busy. Small changes can make a big difference. If you experience any new symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s a printed summary of everything we discussed today, and the contact information for the clinic. Have a good rest of your day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Okay, Doc, I will. Thanks again. You have a good day too.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Demondre. You take care now.
