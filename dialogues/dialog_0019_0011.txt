DOCTOR: Well, hello there, Armando. Good to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get right to it. I need a… a permission slip. For somethin' the young folks are doin' now. A… cosmetic thing. My niece, she tells me I gotta come get cleared by a doctor before I do it. Said somethin' 'bout bein' safe. I don't rightly know what it is, but she's insistent.
DOCTOR: A permission slip, alright. Sounds like it might be for a tattoo or… perhaps a piercing?
PATIENT: A tattoo? Goodness no. I ain't puttin' no pictures on my body. And a… piercin'? Heavens to Betsy. No, no, it’s… it’s one of them face things. Makes you look younger, she says. With needles and… somethin' injected. I think she called it… filler? Yes, filler. That’s it. Filler. It's somethin' to do with my face, alright? I just need you to say it’s okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, “filler.” That would be a dermal filler, usually hyaluronic acid. It can restore volume and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. I understand your niece wants you to get cleared first, which is very responsible of her. Before I can give you the okay, I need to ask a few questions, just to make sure it’s safe for you. Do you have any allergies to… well, anything in particular?
PATIENT: Allergies? Lands sakes, Doctor, I'm 64 years old. I've lived a life. I'm allergic to bein' inconvenienced, if that counts. But no, I don't recall anythin' specific. Dust, maybe. And rude people, certainly. But nothin' a doctor needs to worry 'bout. Look, is this gonna take long? I got a bingo game to get to this evenin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good to know. And I promise I'll try to be quick. Bingo is important! Now, have you had any medical conditions diagnosed, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Heart problems… hmm. Old Man Hemmings down the street, he had somethin’ with his heart. Terrible thing. Me? No, no. Doc checked me out a few years back. Said I was… “remarkably resilient” for my age. That's what he said. Resilient. I think that means I don't break easy. Never had the sugar sickness either. I do get a little… winded climbin' stairs, but that’s just age, I reckon. Don't go writin' all sorts of things down now.
DOCTOR: "Remarkably resilient" is excellent! That's very good to hear. And a little shortness of breath with stairs is common as we get older. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Old Doc Abernathy took out my tonsils when I was a boy. That was… a long time ago. And… oh, yes! I had a mole removed from my back, maybe ten years back? Small thing. Nothin' serious. They cut it off and stitched me up. That's it, I think. I don’t go under the knife unless absolutely necessary. Too much risk, if you ask me. Now, are we gettin' anywhere with this permission slip? My niece is gonna be on my case if I don't hurry back.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsils as a child and a mole removal. Good to know. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can get to the examination. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness no. I believe in lettin' nature take its course. A little peppermint tea for the stomach, maybe. And I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, ‘cause the sun ain’t what it used to be. But that's it. No pills, no potions, nothin’ fancy. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Simple. Now, can we please get this over with? I'm beginnin' to suspect my niece sent me here just to annoy me.
DOCTOR: Alright, peppermint tea and vitamin D. Very sensible. Now, Armando, before I can give you the go-ahead for this filler, I do need to do a quick physical exam. Just to make sure everything looks healthy and there are no contraindications. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam, huh? More pokin' and proddin'. Honestly. Well, I suppose I don’t have much choice. But make it quick, Doctor. I ain’t got all day, you know. And be gentle! My skin is delicate. Delicate, I tell ya! Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Armando, I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a look at your face. Okay, heart sounds are regular. A little bit of… age-related changes, but nothing concerning. Lungs sound clear. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to take a look at your face. Just to assess the skin and look for any unusual moles or growths. Alright, your skin appears generally healthy, a bit of age-related wrinkling as expected. I don’t see any concerning moles or growths. Do you have any areas of particular concern on your face?
PATIENT: Wrinklin', you say? Well, of course I have wrinklin'! I’m 64 years old! What did you expect, smooth as a baby’s bottom? Honestly. No, no particular concerns. Just… well, my niece says I look tired. She says it's these lines around my mouth that make me look… old. That's what she said. Old. And she keeps talkin' 'bout these "nasolabial folds" or somethin'. Sounds like a disease. I just want to look a little… fresher, I suppose. Is that too much to ask? Now, are we done yet? My bingo game starts in… well, I don't know, but it's soon!
DOCTOR: Alright, so we're focusing on the lines around your mouth and those nasolabial folds. Those are very common as we age, and fillers can help to restore some volume and soften their appearance. Now, Armando, it’s important to understand that dermal fillers aren’t without risks. There’s a small chance of bruising, swelling, redness, and, in rare cases, more serious complications. It's crucial to go to a qualified and experienced injector. Given your age and general health, I don't see any major contraindications, but I do recommend starting with a small amount of filler to see how your skin reacts. Do you understand these risks?
PATIENT: Risks, you say? Bruisin' and swellin'? Goodness gracious. Sounds awful. I don't like the sound of "serious complications" one bit. Honestly, Doctor, I'm beginnin' to think my niece is tryin' to poison me. Qualified and experienced… what does that even mean? I just want to look a little better, not end up in the hospital! Now, look, can you just write me a note sayin' I'm cleared, and I'll be on my way? I don't need all these fancy explanations. And if I do end up lookin' like a balloon, I'm holdin' you responsible! Now, please, Doctor, just the note!
DOCTOR: Alright, Armando. I understand. I’m going to write you a note stating that you’ve been evaluated and are medically cleared to undergo dermal filler injections, but please, I strongly advise you to discuss all the risks and benefits thoroughly with the injector. And choose someone who is highly qualified and experienced. Here you go. It also states my recommendation to proceed with caution and choose an experienced practitioner. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, that's somethin', I suppose. No, no, that’s all. I just want to get this over with. Thank you, Doctor. Though I'm not entirely sure I am thankful. This whole thing sounds like a lot of trouble for not much gain. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a bingo game to catch. And if I see my niece, I'm givin' her a piece of my mind! .
