DOCTOR: Hi Courtnye, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s my bruising. It’s just been getting worse, and I’m on blood thinners, so… it’s a bit worrying, you know? I bump into things normally, but this feels different.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is worrying, especially being on blood thinners. Okay, let’s talk about this bruising. First, can you tell me a little bit more about when you first noticed it starting to get worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I’d say, maybe… three weeks ago? Around July 10th, give or take a few days. I remember because my cousin came to visit then, and she commented on a bruise on my arm. I just thought I’d knocked it on something, but then another one popped up, and another… just seeming to come out of nowhere, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks ago, around July 10th. And you said they seem to appear without a clear injury?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Like, I haven’t felt myself hitting anything hard enough to cause these. Just… there. On my legs mostly, but I had one on my stomach the other day, which was weird. And they’re bigger than usual, and… darker, I think. It’s hard to explain. I usually just ignore small bruises, but these are… noticeable.
DOCTOR: I understand. Noticeable bruising, appearing without a clear cause, and darker than usual… that definitely warrants a closer look, especially with you being on blood thinners. To get a better picture, can you tell me a bit about where exactly on your legs you’re seeing these bruises?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Mostly on my shins, you know, the front of my legs? And a couple on my thighs, but those are smaller. Not like… all over, just patches here and there. And, um… sometimes my ankles get a bit discolored too, but I thought that was just swelling. Is that important? I don’t usually pay too much attention to it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, shins and thighs, with some possible discoloration around your ankles. Yes, ankle discoloration is important to know about. Let’s talk about that swelling – does it happen after you’ve been on your feet a lot, or is it more constant?
PATIENT: It’s… more after I’ve been on my feet. I work, you know, on the computer a lot, so I sit most of the day, but when I have to go out and do errands or something, by the end of the day my ankles are pretty swollen. I usually just put my feet up. I don’t know if that’s related to the bruising, though. Honestly, I’m starting to worry it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, and it’s good you’re bringing this all to my attention. Swelling can be related, but we need to rule other things out first. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, the doctor told me I had high blood pressure a few years back, so I’m on medication for that. And I had a bad bout of the flu last winter, but that’s it, really. Nothing major. Oh! And I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. Does that matter? I always forget what the doctors want to know.
DOCTOR: That’s all good information, thank you. High blood pressure, medication for that, and gallbladder removal ten years ago – yes, that's helpful. And don’t worry about forgetting things, it happens! We’ll get through everything. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, um… I take the blood thinner, of course. Warfarin, I think it’s called. And I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said my levels were low. Oh, and sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a melatonin tablet. That’s it, I promise! I try not to take too much, I don’t like being on lots of pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Warfarin, vitamin D, and melatonin as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I know of. I've eaten everything, tried everything, pretty much. Never had a reaction to anything. My family always jokes I have an iron stomach. Does that mean anything? I'm just trying to be helpful. I just want to know if something is seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, thank you. And you are being very helpful. Okay, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like bleeding disorders, heart problems, or anything else significant?
PATIENT: Hmm… My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… something with her heart, I think. She had to have a pacemaker. And my uncle, he has diabetes. And… that’s about all I can think of, really. My family doesn’t really talk about medical stuff much, to be honest. It’s kind of a taboo topic. Is that useful? I'm not sure how much detail I can give you.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, thank you. Heart condition in your grandmother and diabetes in your uncle. Okay, and lastly, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Like I said, I work on the computer most of the day, so I sit a lot. I try to walk when I can, but it’s hard. I don't really exercise regularly. I eat… okay, I guess. I try to eat healthy, but I have a sweet tooth, so… chocolate is my weakness. And I don't drink or smoke. Is there anything specific you want to know? I'm ready to get this sorted, if that makes sense. I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. Okay, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at the bruising on your legs. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s causing all this bruising. I'm ready when you are. Is there anything I should do beforehand? Like, should I move my legs or anything? I'm always a bit nervous at the doctor's.
DOCTOR: No, no need to do anything special. Just relax. If you could just sit up on the table, that would be great. I'll start by checking your blood pressure. It's just a quick squeeze on your arm. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Okay, now let’s take a look at the bruising on your legs. Could you please point to the areas that are most concerning to you?
PATIENT: Um… here. This one is the biggest, and it's been there for about a week. And here, on my thigh. That one doesn't hurt as much, but it's darker than usual. And, um… My ankle feels a little tender sometimes, and it’s a bit discolored. It’s hard to tell if it’s just swelling or a bruise, honestly. They all just seem to be popping up everywhere. Is that normal? I’m really starting to worry.
DOCTOR: Okay. The bruising on your shin is approximately 8cm in diameter, with significant discoloration – a mix of purple and dark blue. It’s tender to the touch, but no warmth or swelling extending beyond the immediate area. The bruise on your thigh is smaller, about 3cm, and also displays dark discoloration, though less tenderness. And your ankle does exhibit some swelling and discoloration, but it's difficult to determine if it’s solely due to swelling or if there’s bruising underneath. I'm also noting some slight edema – fluid retention – in both ankles. Given your history of being on warfarin, the recent increase in bruising, and the swelling in your ankles, I want to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll check your INR – that measures how quickly your blood is clotting – as well as a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. It's important to rule out any underlying causes for the bruising and assess your overall health. Do you have any questions about the blood tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests… okay. So, it could be something wrong with the warfarin? Is that what you’re thinking? I try to take it exactly as prescribed, but… I’m a bit forgetful sometimes, to be honest. Maybe I missed a dose or something? I don't know… I just don’t want it to be anything serious. How long will it take to get the results? And… will I need more tests after that? I'm starting to get a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious, and it’s good you’re voicing your concerns. It could be related to the warfarin – either a dosage issue or something affecting how your body metabolizes the medication. But we need the blood tests to confirm that. Missing a dose or variations in your diet can definitely impact your INR levels. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours. Once we have those, we’ll review them together and determine if any further testing is needed. It's possible we'll need to adjust your warfarin dosage or investigate other potential causes for the bruising. We don’t want to jump to conclusions before we have all the information. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could lead to injury, and if you do bump yourself, apply ice to the area. I'm also going to give you a handout with information about warfarin and things to watch out for. And if you experience any significant bleeding – like nosebleeds that won’t stop, blood in your urine or stool, or excessive bruising – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… avoid injury, ice if I bump myself, and watch for bleeding. And wait for the blood test results. That sounds… manageable, I guess. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s… it’s just a lot to take in. I really hope it’s nothing serious. I just want to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: I understand, Courtnye. It is a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly natural to be worried. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you once we have the lab results. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, try not to stress too much. We're here to help you figure this out. .
