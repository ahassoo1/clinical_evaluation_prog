DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. Welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Smetak, is it? Well, it’s… it’s this tiredness. Just dreadful tiredness. Comes on suddenly, you see. I feel like I’ve done a week’s hard work when I haven’t done anything. And the young man at the lab, he said something about… numbers. Not good numbers, he said. I don’t keep up with these things, you know. My husband usually handles all that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Smetak is right. It’s good you came in to get this checked out. Tiredness can be caused by so many things. And those “numbers” from the lab… we’ll definitely look at those together. Let me just pull up your lab results here… Ah, yes. It looks like your hemoglobin is a bit low. Now, do you mind if I ask a few questions, just to get a better understanding of what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Hemoglobin? Is that… blood? I don’t know, Doctor. I really don’t. Questions are fine, I suppose. Though I warn you, my memory isn’t what it used to be. And frankly, I don't see what questions could possibly help. It's just… tiredness. A bone-deep tiredness. It's not like I've been scaling mountains! Though, I have been quite active, you know, with the diving. But that was… a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: Yes, hemoglobin is a part of your blood – it carries oxygen around your body. Low hemoglobin can certainly cause tiredness. And you’re right, it’s not always about doing something strenuous. It can happen for other reasons. You mentioned diving. That's good to know. When was the last time you went diving, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Diving… oh dear. That was… well, a long, long time ago. My husband, bless his soul, he was the real diver. I did it with him, of course. Supported him. Held things. You know, a good wife supports her husband. But the last time… goodness. Must have been… the early 2000s, I think? Maybe even before. We travelled a lot. The Caribbean, mostly. It was… a different life. I haven’t really thought about it in years. It's hardly relevant, is it? It's not like I’m still down there! This tiredness is happening now.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not irrelevant at all. It helps me understand your overall health history. It’s good you shared that. Okay. And aside from the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. Well, my muscles ache sometimes. Just a dull ache, not a sharp pain. And I’ve been a bit… clumsy, I suppose. Dropped a few things. Tripped over the rug. Old age, probably. Though my husband says I’ve always been a bit clumsy. He’s a tease, that man. Oh, and I haven't been eating much. Everything just seems… tasteless. Not that I’m trying to lose weight, you understand. Just no appetite. Is that a symptom? I don’t know what’s a symptom anymore! Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a muddle.
DOCTOR: It is a muddle sometimes, and that's perfectly alright. Those things you're describing – the muscle aches, clumsiness, and loss of appetite – those can all be related. Now, have you noticed any shortness of breath, or any paleness, maybe in your skin or gums?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Not really. I get a bit winded going up the stairs, but that’s just… stairs. We live on the second floor, you know. And paleness… well, I haven’t really looked. I don’t spend much time looking at myself these days. My husband says I look fine. He always says that. Though he’s a bit… distracted lately. Keeps forgetting things. We’re both getting old, I suppose. It’s just… a part of life, isn’t it? Losing your puff and looking a bit grey. It’s not something to get terribly worried about, is it? Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I’m wasting your time. It’s just tiredness! A bit of tiredness and a few aches. Everyone gets tired.
DOCTOR: It’s not a waste of time at all, Ardelle. It’s my job to investigate these things, even if they seem small. And it’s very important to me that you feel comfortable sharing everything, no matter how insignificant it might seem. Now, have you noticed any unusual bleeding, like nosebleeds, or bleeding gums when you brush your teeth?
PATIENT: Unusual bleeding… No, not really. I haven't checked my gums, honestly. My teeth aren't what they used to be, but I brush them. My husband reminds me. He's very particular about dental hygiene. Nosebleeds… not recently. I used to get them when I was a girl, but that was ages ago. Honestly, Doctor, this is all very… unsettling. You're asking me about things I've never even thought about. It's just tiredness, and a bit of ache, and I don't eat much. Why are you asking about bleeding? Is it something serious? Are you going to tell me I'm terribly ill? My husband would be beside himself. He worries so.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ardelle. I'm not trying to alarm you, I promise. I'm just gathering information to get a clear picture of what's going on. Asking about bleeding is a standard part of investigating tiredness and low hemoglobin. It helps me rule out different possibilities. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My medical history… Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a child. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. That was a long time ago. And… and I had the flu a few times. Nothing serious, you understand. I've never been a sickly person. My husband always said I was as strong as an ox. He’s a bit of a romantic, that man. As for diagnoses… I don’t think so. The doctor always just told me to rest and take some vitamins. I don't really remember going to the doctor much. My husband handled all that. Is this important? Are you looking for something specific? Honestly, Doctor, my mind is a complete blank. It's just… tiredness. And a bit of ache. And I don’t eat much. Is that all there is to it?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've been quite healthy for most of your life, which is wonderful. And it's alright that you don't recall many details—many people don't. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Vitamins, yes. My husband gives me a multivitamin every day. He’s very good about that. And… and sometimes I take something for my arthritis. Just when it flares up. It’s a little pink pill. I don’t know the name of it. My husband gets it for me. And… and sometimes I take a pain reliever for my headaches. Just when they’re really bad. Again, my husband gets it. He manages all the medications. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t pay much attention. He just tells me what to take and when. He’s very organized. It’s just… a few pills. Nothing major. Is that important? Are you looking for something specific? Honestly, Doctor, this is all very unsettling. It's just… tiredness. And a bit of ache. And I don’t eat much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It's good to know you're taking a multivitamin, and that you have something for arthritis pain. And it's important we know about all the medications, even those for occasional use. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll check your skin and a few other things. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
