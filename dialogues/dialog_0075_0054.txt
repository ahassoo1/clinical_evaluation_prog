DOCTOR: Good morning, Rayshon. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Cough… yeah, I got cough. Long time already. And… tired all the time. Feel like… not strong. Also, my nose… always blocked. Get sick a lot, with… with the nose thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, fatigue, and a blocked nose with frequent sicknesses. That gives us a starting point. Let’s try to get a bit more detail. First, about the cough – how long have you had it, approximately?
PATIENT: Long time… Maybe… six months? Or more? I dunno exactly. It comes and goes, but it never really goes away, you know? Always a little tickle in my throat. Sometimes worse when I… when it's cold? I think. I forget. It’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Right, six months or more, comes and goes but always present, and potentially worse in the cold. I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint these things. Is the cough productive – meaning, do you cough anything up?
PATIENT: Cough up? Like… spit? Yeah, sometimes. A little bit. White stuff. Not much, though. Usually just… wet. Like water. Sometimes a little… yellow? But mostly white. I don’t pay much attention, to be honest. Just wipe it away. It’s… gross. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Rayshon. That’s helpful information. So, mostly white mucus, occasionally yellow, and not a large amount. And you mentioned fatigue. Can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Just… tired. All the time. Even after sleep. Like… heavy. Hard to do things. Work is hard. I fix tires, you know? Need strong. But… not strong now. Like… old man tired. And sometimes… headache? But not all the time. Just when… when I really tired, I think. I forget. Sorry. Is bad?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad that you’re telling me. It’s good you’re sharing this with me. Fatigue even after sleep and headaches when particularly tired. We'll figure this out. Now, about your blocked nose – is there any pain or pressure associated with that?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not bad pain, just… stuffy. Like… blocked. And sometimes… ache? Around my eyes? A little bit. When the nose is really blocked. And… sometimes hard to breathe? Through the nose. Need to breathe from mouth. Like that. Sorry, I’m not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Rayshon. It’s helpful to know the stuffiness is sometimes accompanied by pressure around your eyes and difficulty breathing through your nose, forcing you to breathe through your mouth. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any allergies that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… I dunno. Maybe? Sometimes… itchy skin? But not always. And sometimes… sneeze a lot? When the flowers are… blooming? But I don’t know if that’s allergy. Everyone sneeze with flowers, right? I never think about it. Sorry, I don’t know much about allergies. I just… fix tires.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you may have some seasonal allergies, potentially related to flowers. We can explore that further. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes, I take… Panadol? When headache. That's it. And… sometimes, I take something for the cough? From the shop. Just… cough syrup. The… red one? I forget the name. It doesn’t help much, though. I don’t take anything regularly. Just when I really need it. Sorry, I don’t like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Panadol for headaches and occasional cough syrup, but nothing regularly. That's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Uh… when I was little… I got sick. Very sick. With… with fever. And cough. Need to stay in hospital. But I don’t remember what it was. And… my wife, she says I got… something with the chest? But I forget. Long time ago. Nothing now. I think. Sorry, I’m not good with remembering things like that. It’s hard. I just… fix tires.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Rayshon. It's perfectly understandable to not remember details from a long time ago. We can try to access your medical records if you'd like. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for other reasons?
PATIENT: No. I don’t think so. Maybe… when I cut my hand? Fixing a tire. Need stitches. But that’s it. Never stay in hospital overnight. Just… bandage. And… stitches. That’s all. Sorry. I try to be careful. Don't want to stay in hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, just stitches for a hand injury. No other surgeries or hospital stays. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, or cancer?
PATIENT: Uh… my father… he had… something with his heart? I think. Need to… need to take pills. And… my mother… she had… sugar? Diabetes, maybe? But I don't really know. We don't really talk about it much. And my sister… she has… asthma? Always using the… the puffer? But that’s all I remember. Sorry, my family is… far away. And we don't talk a lot.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Rayshon. It’s helpful to know about the heart condition, diabetes, and asthma in your family. Let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No! No smoke. Never. Bad for health, you know? I fix tires. Need strong lungs. Smoke is… no good. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A little bit. With dinner? Maybe one or two glasses of beer? Not every day. Maybe… once a week? Or less. Not much. I don’t like it much. Sorry. It makes me… sleepy.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional, light alcohol consumption. Now, before we proceed, let me ask you about any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. Never had any problems. I eat everything. Sometimes… itchy mouth with some fruits? But not always. And… I think I’m okay with the pills. Never had a bad reaction. Sorry. I don't really pay attention to allergies. I just… fix tires. Is all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, although you’ve mentioned occasional itchy mouth with some fruits. Alright, Rayshon. I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs, check your throat, and take your temperature and blood pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. That’s good. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… fix tires, is all I know. But I want to feel better. So… whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle? Sorry. I don’t like… needles.
DOCTOR: Of course, Rayshon. I will be as gentle as possible. And we will take things slowly. No needles right now, I promise. Okay, I’m listening to your lungs now. I can hear some slight wheezing, particularly on your right side. Your breathing sounds a little restricted. Your throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Your temperature is 37.8 degrees Celsius – slightly elevated. Your blood pressure is 130/85 – a little high, but not dramatically so. Alright, so we have a slightly elevated temperature, a little bit of wheezing in your lungs, and your blood pressure is slightly elevated. The red throat could be a sign of inflammation, but it’s not severe.
PATIENT: Wheezing? What’s that? Is bad? And… high blood pressure? I don’t understand. I just… feel tired. And cough. Is that… serious? Sorry, I’m getting worried now. I just want to fix tires. But I can’t if I feel like this.
DOCTOR: It's okay to be worried, Rayshon. It's good you're expressing your concerns. Let me explain. Wheezing is a whistling sound when you breathe. It usually means your airways are narrowed, making it harder to breathe. It’s often caused by inflammation, like in asthma or a respiratory infection. It’s not immediately life-threatening, but it does need to be addressed. As for your blood pressure, it's slightly higher than the ideal range. High blood pressure, over time, can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke, but we can manage it with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. Right now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you might have a respiratory infection, possibly with some underlying inflammation in your airways. It's important to rule out anything more serious, like pneumonia. I think we should order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. I’d also like to do a blood test to check for infection and inflammation. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood test? Is… is it serious? I don’t like… hospitals. And needles. Is there… something else we can do? Maybe… more cough syrup? I just want to feel better. I have tires to fix. I don't want to stay long. And I don't have insurance. Is it expensive? Sorry, I'm getting very worried now.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to be worried, Rayshon. I'm going to explain everything as clearly as possible. The X-ray is a simple procedure – it’s a quick image of your lungs and it doesn’t involve any needles. It helps us see if there’s any sign of pneumonia or other lung problems. It's not a major procedure. The blood test involves a small needle prick, but it's over quickly. It helps us check for signs of infection and inflammation. I understand your concern about cost, especially without insurance. Let’s talk about that. I’ll see if we can get a discounted rate for the X-ray and blood test. We can also discuss options for affordable medication if needed. I want to assure you that I'm not rushing you into anything. However, I want to be thorough and make sure we rule out anything serious. A respiratory infection, if left untreated, can sometimes lead to complications. Based on your symptoms, I strongly recommend we proceed with the X-ray and blood test. Would you allow me to get the orders for those, and we can discuss the costs before proceeding?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, Doctor. You’re right. I need to know. And… I need to feel better. Tires won’t fix themselves. Just… please be quick? And… and not too expensive? I don’t have much money. And… and explain everything clearly. I don't understand medical things. Okay… you do the tests. Just… be gentle. And please tell me what’s wrong. I just want to go back to fixing tires.
