DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It’s… Teretha. Just Teretha, please. Well, it’s this tingling. It’s in my hands mostly, and sometimes my feet. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s just… annoying. I’m hoping you can figure out what’s going on. I don't want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Teretha. “Annoying” is a perfectly valid way to describe a symptom. We want to get to the bottom of this. To help me understand better, could you tell me a little more about this tingling?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not always there. Comes and goes, you know? Like pins and needles, but not always painful. Sometimes it feels… numb, like when your leg falls asleep. It’s worse when I’m… well, when I've been on my feet all day, delivering the mail. That’s probably it, honestly. Long days, lots of walking. I’m a mail carrier, you see. Been doing it for… oh, goodness, almost 30 years now.
DOCTOR: Thirty years is a long time! That is a physically demanding job. So, the tingling is primarily in your hands and feet, comes and goes, feels like pins and needles or numbness, and is worse after being on your feet all day. Is it worse in both hands and feet, or is it more pronounced on one side?
PATIENT: It’s… hmm. I think it’s a little worse in my hands, yes. Definitely my hands. My feet, it comes and goes, but the hands… I drop things more often, you know? Small things. Keys, pens… It’s embarrassing, really. Makes me feel clumsy. And it’s not constant, mind you. Just… more frequent in my hands.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s helpful to know it’s more noticeable in your hands and that you're experiencing some difficulty with dropping things. That certainly warrants further investigation. Now, have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… not really. I mean, I get tired, of course. Long days, like I said. But not weak. I can still carry the mail, still sort it, still do everything I need to. It’s just… a little harder sometimes. Like my grip isn’t as strong, maybe? But I wouldn’t say I’m weak. Is that making sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Teretha. So, no significant weakness, but perhaps a feeling of reduced grip strength. Let's talk a little bit about other symptoms. Have you noticed any pain anywhere – in your hands, feet, arms, legs, back, or neck?
PATIENT: No, no real pain. A little achy sometimes, after a long day, but not… pain. It’s more the tingling, the numbness. And the dropping things, of course. But no sharp pain, no burning, nothing like that. Just… this annoying sensation. I’m just hoping it’s not something serious. I need to keep working.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and we'll do our best to figure out what's going on. No pain is good to know. Now, thinking beyond your hands and feet, have you noticed any changes in your balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Hmm. Balance… not really. I haven’t fallen or anything. I walk just fine. I mean, I’m a bit more careful now, maybe, since I drop things. But my balance is okay. I wouldn’t say it’s changed. Coordination… maybe a little clumsy, but that’s probably just the dropping things. Honestly, dear, I'm not a very graceful person anyway. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in balance and you don't feel any unsteadiness. That's helpful. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, arthritis, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… the doctor always said my blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on a pill for it years ago. I stopped taking it a while back, though. Felt better without it, and he didn't seem too worried. Arthritis… no, never been diagnosed. Thyroid… no. Just the blood pressure, really. And a bad back once, a long time ago, but that healed up. I don’t go to the doctor much, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that was previously treated with medication, but you are currently off of it. And a previous back injury that has since healed. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Not even my tonsils! I've been pretty lucky, I guess. Mostly just aches and pains. Nothing serious enough for cutting. Except… I did have a bad fall when I was a little girl, broke my arm. But that was a long time ago. They just put a cast on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child, treated with a cast, and no other surgeries. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take a little something for my aches and pains, over the counter. Ibuprofen, that kind of thing. But nothing regularly. And no vitamins or supplements. I should probably take something, I know, but I just… forget. I'm not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for aches and pains. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, really. Ukrainian food, mostly. Lots of potatoes and cabbage. But I don’t think that’s got anything to do with my tingling, is it?
DOCTOR: No, I don’t believe so! Now, thinking about your family… do you know of any family members who have experienced similar symptoms – tingling, numbness, weakness – or any conditions like diabetes, arthritis, or nerve problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had some trouble with her hands when she got older. Not exactly tingling, but… stiff joints, you know? Arthritis, I think. And my uncle, he had diabetes. But I don’t know if he had any numbness or tingling. Honestly, dear, we don't talk about medical things much. It's… not a tradition. I know there was something on my father's side, but I can't put my finger on it. Old family, lots of history. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of arthritis in your mother and diabetes in your uncle. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, like I said, I'm a mail carrier. Lots of walking. Long hours on my feet. I live alone since my husband passed, so I do most things myself. I try to eat healthy, but it's hard sometimes when you're on your own. I used to garden, but I haven't had the energy lately. And I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little wine with dinner sometimes. It’s a quiet life, mostly. A very quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Teretha. That gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, please? My hands are a little sensitive today. And… I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I will be as gentle as possible. And I’ll explain everything as I go, no surprises, I promise. Okay, your grip strength is slightly weaker on your right hand compared to your left, but it’s not dramatically so. Now I’m going to check your reflexes. Okay, your reflexes are normal, and your sensation appears intact, although there's a slight decreased sensation to light touch in your fingertips and toes on both sides. I’m also noting a very subtle tremor in your hands when you extend your arms. So, overall, the exam findings show slightly decreased grip strength on your right hand, a slight decrease in sensation to light touch in your fingertips and toes, and a subtle tremor in your hands. These findings are consistent with possible peripheral neuropathy, but further testing is needed to confirm this.
PATIENT: Peripheral… what now? Is that… bad? I don’t even know what that is. And a tremor? I hadn’t even noticed that. Is it something serious? I just want to know if I can still work, dear. That's all I care about.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Teretha. It’s perfectly normal to be worried when you hear medical terms you’re not familiar with. Peripheral neuropathy simply means that there’s some damage to the nerves outside of your brain and spinal cord – the nerves in your hands and feet. It can cause symptoms like tingling, numbness, weakness, and pain. There are many different causes, and it's not always serious. The tremor I noted was very subtle, and you may not have noticed it yourself. It means a slight shaking, and it can also be associated with neuropathy, or with other conditions. To determine the cause of your symptoms, I would like to order some blood tests. These will help me check your blood sugar levels to rule out diabetes, as well as other potential causes of neuropathy. I'd also recommend an electromyography, or EMG, test. This test measures the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves and can help pinpoint the location and extent of any nerve damage. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… More tests… Oh, dear. I don't like tests. But… I suppose I have to, if you think it's necessary. I just want to know what’s going on. Is it something that can be fixed? Can I still deliver the mail? That’s all I want to know. Blood tests… okay, I can do blood tests. And… electro… what was it? EMG? Is that painful? I don’t have good veins, you know. They always have trouble finding them. And needles… I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Teretha. I’ll do my best to make the process as comfortable as possible. The EMG test involves inserting a very small needle into your muscles. It can cause a brief, mild discomfort, similar to a muscle cramp, but it’s generally not very painful. The technician will explain everything to you before the test, and you can stop at any time if you’re uncomfortable. We'll start with the blood tests. I’ll give you a lab requisition form, and you can go to the lab at your convenience. They are skilled at drawing blood, even from difficult veins, so I’m sure they’ll be able to find one. Whether or not you can continue delivering the mail depends on the cause and severity of your symptoms. Once we have the results of the tests, we can discuss your treatment options and whether any modifications to your work activities are necessary. We'll take it one step at a time, alright?
PATIENT: One step at a time… yes, alright. A lab requisition form… okay. Where is this lab? Is it far? I don't drive much anymore. And… what if the tests show something bad? I just want to get back to normal. That's all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Teretha. It’s natural to worry about the unknown. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, which is about a 15-minute drive from here. If driving is difficult for you, I can arrange for a transportation service to take you there and back. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, would you? That would be wonderful, dear. That would be a great help. I do worry about driving alone, especially with my hands… sometimes they get shaky. Thank you. That takes a load off my mind. And… what about the results? How long will it take to get them? And… will you explain everything to me when I get them? I don’t understand all the medical jargon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. I’m happy to help in any way I can. The lab results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. Once I receive them, I’ll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. And absolutely, I will explain everything to you in plain language. I understand that medical jargon can be confusing, and I’ll make sure you understand all your options before making any decisions. I want you to feel comfortable and empowered throughout this process. Here’s the lab requisition form. Please take it with you, and don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get through this together, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, dear. You've been very kind. I appreciate it. I feel a little better now, knowing I’m not alone in this. I think… I think that's all for now. I should probably get going. I don't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. It was my pleasure to meet you, and I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Take care, and please drive safely. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You too. Goodbye.
