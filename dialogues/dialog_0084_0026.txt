DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this… tiredness. Just dreadful tiredness. It comes and goes, you see. Makes it hard to… well, do things. And the young man at the lab said something about… my numbers being off. Something about my… muscles? I don't rightly recall. It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tiredness that comes and goes, and some lab results you’re concerned about. We can definitely look into that. When you say “numbers being off,” do you remember what the lab test was called, or what the young man said specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no, I don’t. Young man… very polite, but spoke so fast. Something about… creatine? Is that a vitamin? And… kinase? It sounded important, but I’ve never had trouble with… with things before. Honestly, I just want to feel like myself again. Used to be able to work all day, no problem. Commercial diving is hard work, you know.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving! Wow, that is hard work. Okay, creatine and kinase… those are things we check in a blood test, and they can tell us about your muscles. It sounds like your lab results might be pointing to a problem with muscle function. To get a better picture, could you tell me a bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well… it's not like being sleepy, you understand? It’s more like… heavy. Like carrying stones. Everything feels like it takes so much effort. Even getting out of a chair. And it comes on suddenly, sometimes. I’ll be fine, doing something, and then… poof. Just completely drained. It lasts a few days, maybe a week, and then it… eases up. But it keeps coming back. My husband, Tenzin, does most of the chores now. He says I need to rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, “heavy” and sudden onset… that’s helpful. And it’s affecting your daily activities. Have you noticed any muscle pain or weakness along with this tiredness?
PATIENT: Muscle pain… hmm. Not exactly pain, no. More like… achey. A dull ache, mostly in my legs. And sometimes, when I try to stand up, they feel… wobbly. Like they might give out. It doesn’t happen all the time, mind you. Just… sometimes. It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve always been strong.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness and achiness can be concerning, especially with your history of physical work. Now, let's go through a bit more of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I take something for my blood pressure. The little white pills. Dr. Sharma prescribed them years ago. And my knees bother me sometimes, the arthritis. But that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing serious. Oh! And I had that… tummy trouble a few years back. But that cleared up with the medicine. Honestly, I can’t remember all of it. Things just… blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication, arthritis, and some past tummy trouble. We’ll get the specifics from your records. Do you recall what the medicine was for the tummy trouble?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, not a clue. Something… pink, I think? A little pill. The pharmacist was very helpful. He told me what to do. I just… take the pills when I need them. It was a long time ago. I don't keep track of such things. My husband, Tenzin, manages all the medication now. He's very organized.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly fine. Tenzin sounds like a great help. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, no vitamins. I tried those once, but they tasted awful. And… no, nothing else. Just the little white pills for my blood pressure. And sometimes, a pain reliever for my knees, when they’re really bothering me. But that's only now and then. I'm very careful about what I put in my body, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication and occasional pain reliever. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don't care for shellfish, but that's just a preference, not an allergy. And I've never had a bad reaction to any medicine. Tenzin always asks the pharmacist, just in case. He's very thorough.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a difficult one. My parents… they passed away a long time ago. And we didn't really… talk about such things. They were simple people, farmers. I think my mother had… bad knees, like me. But that’s all I can recall. It wasn’t something we discussed much. Things were different then.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It’s common for family medical history to be limited. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean? Are you asking about… friends? Well, I have a few friends from the temple. We have tea together sometimes. And my husband, Tenzin, is my best friend, of course. We've been married for fifty years! A long time. We don’t go out much anymore. Too tiring. We mostly stay home, read, watch television. It’s a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet life with Tenzin and friends from the temple. And do you currently smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol… only a tiny sip of wine at special occasions, with Tenzin. It’s not something we do often. We prefer tea. Much healthier. Tenzin always says I need to take care of myself. He’s a very sensible man.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a few simple tests to check your muscle strength and reflexes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Hmmph. A physical exam… very well. But don’t expect too much. I’m an old woman. And please, be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And don’t take too long. I get tired easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Oitker. We'll take it slow and be gentle. It won’t take long. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little bit elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Your heart and lungs sound okay, but your breathing sounds a bit quieter than usual. Now, let’s check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Squeeze my hands, you say? Very well. But don’t pull too hard. There. Is that enough? It’s harder than it looks, you know. All these years of diving, and my hands are starting to feel… unreliable.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Oitker. That was helpful. Your grip is a bit weaker than expected, but that can be common with age and inactivity. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you sit with your legs dangling, please?
PATIENT: There. Is this alright? They feel a bit… numb, actually. Not painful, just… not quite right. I used to be able to sit like this for hours, no problem. Now… it’s a bit of an effort. Hurry up, please. I’m starting to feel… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Your reflexes are a bit slower than usual. And can you stand up and walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? Oh dear, I feel rather… wobbly. This is all very… undignified, you know. I used to be so strong and nimble. Now… I’m afraid I’m falling apart.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Oitker. That was very helpful. You're a little unsteady on your feet, but not falling. Based on the physical exam and your history, it sounds like we need to investigate the cause of your fatigue and muscle weakness. I suspect it could be several things, including a vitamin deficiency, a thyroid problem, or even a condition affecting your muscles themselves. To get a better idea, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and muscle enzymes, like creatine kinase, which you mentioned earlier. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: More blood tests? Oh dear. I hate needles. But… if you think it’s necessary. I just want to feel like myself again. Alright, alright. Do what you have to do. But please, be quick about it. And tell the young man to be gentle this time. I don't want to faint. And Tenzin will want to know all the results, of course. He worries so.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Oitker. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'll make a note to tell the lab technician to be careful. I’ll also make sure Tenzin receives a copy of the results. I’m going to write up the lab order now. While I’m doing this, do you have any other concerns or questions for me?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Just… will it take long to get the results? I don't want to be waiting for weeks. And will these tests… hurt? I'm not a fan of doctors, you know. Always poking and prodding. And… what if it’s something serious? I don't want to die, Doctor. I still have a lot of tea to drink with Tenzin.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Oitker. The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days. As for the tests themselves, they shouldn't hurt. It's just a small pinch, like a mosquito bite. And please don’t worry about it being something serious. We're just trying to find the cause of your fatigue so we can get you feeling better. We’ll take things one step at a time. While we wait for the results, I recommend you continue to rest and drink plenty of fluids. If your symptoms worsen, such as if you experience severe muscle pain or difficulty breathing, please come back to see me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Two or three days… that’s… acceptable. And rest and fluids… Tenzin will be pleased to hear that. He’s always telling me to slow down. And if it gets worse… I suppose I’ll come back. But please, Doctor, do your best to find out what’s wrong. I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like this. Now… can I go home? I’m starting to feel rather tired again.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Oitker. Let's get you home. Here’s the lab order. You can take this to the lab at the front desk. They’ll schedule your blood draw. I'll have my nurse call you in a couple of days with the results. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Get some rest, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: .
