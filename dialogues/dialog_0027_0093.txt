DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, right. Dr. Fazzina, is it? Look, honestly, it’s a bit fuzzy. Something about… not sleeping great? And feeling a bit… off. My wife, God rest her soul, always said I needed to look after myself more. I guess this is that. It’s just… everything feels a little slow these days. Not a huge deal, really. Just figured I’d get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “A bit fuzzy” and feeling “off”… and some trouble sleeping. It's good you're getting it checked, Mr. Redfern. It is important to look after yourself. Can you tell me a little more about the sleep issue?
PATIENT: Ugh, details. See, that’s where I struggle. I just… toss and turn. Not every night, mind you. But enough that I feel tired when I wake up. It’s not like I’m counting sheep or anything. Just… restless. I don't really remember falling asleep, if that makes sense? It’s like my mind just… switches off. And then on again. I wouldn’t call it insomnia, exactly. More… inefficient, I suppose. Is that a thing?
DOCTOR: “Inefficient” sleep… I think I understand what you mean. So, it’s not necessarily difficulty falling asleep, but more that the sleep doesn’t feel restful, and you don’t feel refreshed in the morning?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… pretty much it. Restful is a good word. It feels like I've been lying down for eight hours, not sleeping for eight hours. And I wake up… not exactly groggy, just… not there. Like my brain hasn’t quite booted up yet. It’s hard to explain. Look, I fix violins for a living, not brains. I’m probably making this sound ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, not at all ridiculous, Mr. Redfern. It’s helpful to hear how you describe it. And you mentioned feeling “off” – can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: “Off”… right. It’s… hard to put a finger on it. Just a general lack of… pep. I used to be able to work on a violin all day, no problem. Now, I’m finding myself needing to sit down more often. My back aches a bit, but nothing major. And I’m just… slower, I guess. Takes me longer to concentrate. It’s probably just getting old, to be honest. Though, 29 isn’t that old, is it? It feels like something’s missing, like a low battery. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. A low battery… I can relate to that feeling. You mentioned back pain. Is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, mostly. It’s not like a sharp, stabbing pain, just a dull ache. Worse if I’ve been bent over a workbench for a long time. I usually just ignore it. A bit of stretching helps, sometimes. Honestly, I'm not one for complaining to doctors. My wife used to drag me to everything, but… well. It’s not like it ever really fixed anything, you know? It’s just… a bit of stiffness. Part of getting older, I assume. Still, thought I’d mention it, seeing as you asked. Is this going to involve needles? I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Redfern. We’ll take things slowly. And we'll certainly avoid anything you're not comfortable with. No needles unless absolutely necessary. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, obviously. And I broke my arm once falling out of a tree, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. My wife always handled all the doctor stuff. She was very… organized. I just… did the fixing. I’ve got Medicare, I suppose. Is that what you need to know? Honestly, I can’t even remember the last time I saw a doctor before today. Everything was fine, up until… well. You know. Just the usual check-ups for her. Does that help? I don’t think I have much to offer in the medical history department.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. And thank you for letting me know. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Not a fan of pills, if I'm honest. Never really needed them. My wife took some things for her… well, never mind. I don't even know what they were. Just… nothing. I drink coffee, if that counts. And maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. But that’s it. Clean as a whistle, medically speaking. Always preferred a natural approach, if possible. Though, admittedly, I haven't really tried any natural approaches. Just haven't needed to. Yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Just coffee and occasional wine. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah. Not that I know of. My wife always asked before cooking, just in case, but I never had any issues. Dust bothers me a bit when I'm working on the violins, but that's not an allergy, is it? Just… irritating. I can't think of anything else. I’ve eaten pretty much everything at some point. And never had a reaction. I’m a pretty simple man, really. Not much to complicate things. Though, I did once eat a particularly dodgy oyster… but that wasn't an allergy, just bad luck.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Have you had any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Weight? Hmm. I suppose I’ve put on a little. Not much, but… yeah. My wife, God bless her, she always made sure I ate well. And… well, I haven’t been as disciplined since. I don’t weigh myself regularly, to be honest. Probably around… 105 kilos, give or take. I'm a tall fella, 190 centimetres, so it's mostly muscle. Or what used to be muscle. It's hard to say for sure. I haven't really been keeping track of things, lately. It's not something I worry about much, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately 105 kilograms, 190 centimetres. And finally, Mr. Redfern, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. Now that’s a tricky one. My father, he… well, he had a bit of a weak heart. I think. He didn’t really talk about it much. And my mother, she had… arthritis, I believe. A lot of joint pain. Nothing major, as far as I know. My wife's side of the family, they were all pretty healthy, actually. Lots of long lives. I honestly don't know much about their medical history either. We weren't really a family for talking about these things. It was mostly just… ignored. Like everything else, really. So, weak heart, maybe arthritis… that’s about all I can offer. Sorry I'm not more helpful. I'm terrible with details, as you've probably noticed.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Redfern. You’ve given me what you know, and that’s perfectly sufficient. Okay, if you're comfortable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and a few basic things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Whatever you need to do. Just… no needles, right? I’m serious. I really don’t like needles. Go ahead. I'll just… try to relax. Though, with my luck, I'll probably tense up the entire time. Do I need to take my shoes off? Is there a gown? Honestly, I haven’t been to a doctor in so long, I have no idea what the procedure is.
DOCTOR: No needles, I promise. And no, you don’t need to take your shoes off or put on a gown. Just relax on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. Breathe normally, you say? Easy enough. Though, with all this attention, I'm finding it a bit hard to focus. Just… get it over with quickly, if you could. I have violins to fix, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, just breathe deeply in and out. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise sounds regular. Lungs are clear, but there is some mild wheezing on exhalation. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms in front of you?
PATIENT: Arms extended. Though, I haven't done much physical work lately, so don't expect miracles. I'm probably all rusty. What exactly are you looking for? Is this going to hurt? I'm not a fan of surprises, if you can avoid them. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your legs. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but still present. Nothing too concerning. Now, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Uh, no. Not really. A little… strange, but no pain. It's just… I haven't had anyone poke around in there for a long time. It's not exactly a pleasant sensation, but I'm not complaining. Just… get it over with quickly, if you could. My stomach isn't used to this sort of attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a little tenderness in the lower abdomen, but nothing significant. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing fatigue, some difficulty sleeping, and a low level of energy. The mild wheezing and abdominal tenderness could indicate some underlying inflammation. I’d like to order some blood work and a chest X-ray to get a better picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work and an X-ray… right. More poking and prodding. I suppose it’s necessary, if you think it’s important. But… no needles, right? You promised. And will the X-ray take long? I have a violin to deliver next week, and I really need to get back to work. I just… I’m not good at waiting around. And frankly, the thought of all these tests is a bit unnerving. Is it going to be expensive? My Medicare… is it covered?
DOCTOR: No needles, I promise. The blood work is just a standard draw, and the X-ray is quick and painless. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes total. As for the cost, Medicare should cover the majority of it, but there may be a small co-pay. We can check with the billing department to confirm your coverage. I'd also like to rule out any potential thyroid issues, given your fatigue. The blood work will include a thyroid panel. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, just in case?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Uh… I don’t think so. I’ve never had any dye injected into me, as far as I know. My wife always handled all the medical stuff, so I wasn’t really involved in these details. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but I can’t be certain. Is it something common? Should I be worried? I just… I don’t like surprises. And I really need to get back to work. This violin is a valuable one, and the client is very… particular. Is it possible to skip the dye if I’m not allergic? Or at least postpone it? I just… I’m not feeling very optimistic about all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll skip the contrast dye for now. We can always consider it later if the initial blood work results warrant it. The blood work will give us a good baseline, and the X-ray will help rule out any lung issues. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding excessive stress. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work and chest X-ray, and the nurse will schedule the appointments for you. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Well, how long will it take to get the results? I really need to know if this is going to interfere with my work schedule. And… is there anything I can do now to feel better? Any herbal remedies or supplements you’d recommend? I’ve heard some good things about chamomile tea… Is that worth a try? And… …is it possible this is just… stress? I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed since… well, never mind. Just… is stress a likely cause? I just want to get back to normal, if possible. And… …will this be a long process? I really don’t like long processes.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within 3-5 business days. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available. As for feeling better now, chamomile tea is a good start. It can help with relaxation and sleep. Stress is definitely a likely contributor. It can manifest in many ways, including fatigue and difficulty sleeping. We can discuss stress management techniques if the blood work doesn’t reveal any underlying medical issues. As for whether this will be a long process… it’s difficult to say without knowing the results. But we’ll take it one step at a time. We'll start with the basics, and if needed, we can explore further options. Don’t worry, we’ll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your appointments and answer any further questions you may have. Is there anything else I can help you with before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… helpful. I still don’t like needles, though. And I really hope this doesn’t interfere with my violin work. It's a valuable one, you see. A Stradivarius replica. The client is very particular. Okay. I’ll just… wait for the nurse. And try to relax. Though, relaxing isn't exactly my strong suit. Thank you again, Doctor. .
