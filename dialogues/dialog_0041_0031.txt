DOCTOR: Hi Nixon, welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg is quite swollen, you see. And I have… a funny heart beat sometimes, the doctor told me it was atrial… something. I think that's what they called it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a swollen left leg and a history of what sounds like atrial fibrillation... got it. Hmm. Can you tell me a little more about the swelling?
PATIENT: Right. It started a few days ago, I believe. It’s mostly in my calf, I think that’s what it’s called? The lower part of my leg. It feels… tight, and a bit achy. Not terrible pain, just… uncomfortable. It’s bigger than my other leg, definitely. I haven’t bumped it or anything, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well, when I sit with it up, it seems a bit better. Like, if I put my feet up on a chair. But when I’ve been walking around a lot, it gets worse, you see? It doesn't go away completely, but it’s more noticeable after I’ve been on my feet for a while. I haven't tried anything to make it better, other than putting it up. I wasn't sure what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, elevation helps, and walking makes it worse… good to know. Now, about that funny heartbeat… do you feel it often?
PATIENT: It doesn't happen all the time, no. Maybe a few times a week? It feels like it’s… fluttering, I suppose. Like a little bird flapping in my chest. It doesn't last long, usually just a few seconds, maybe a minute. It’s a bit worrying, that’s why I came in. The doctor said something about a rhythm… but I didn’t quite catch everything.
DOCTOR: Right, fluttering sensation, a few times a week, lasting seconds to a minute… Okay. And did that doctor give you any medication for the heartbeat, or suggest anything else at the time?
PATIENT: Yes, they did. They gave me… a small white pill. I take it every day. And they told me to watch for… dizziness, I think. And if it got very bad, to go to the hospital. I’m not very good at remembering things, I’m afraid. I have it here, if that helps?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Nixon. It’s good you have the medication with you. Could I take a look at the pill, please?
PATIENT: Certainly. Here you are. It’s… quite small, as you can see. The writing on the bag is a bit faded, but I think it says… 'Bisoprolol'? I hope I’m reading that right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bisoprolol, 5mg. That's a beta-blocker, commonly used for atrial fibrillation. Now, let's do a quick exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in... and out... Okay, good. Heart sounds are a little fast, but regular at the moment. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your pulses in your legs. Pulses are present, but a little weaker on the left side compared to the right. And finally, I’m going to gently feel your calf to check for tenderness and warmth. There's some mild tenderness when I press here, and the calf does feel slightly warmer than the right one. No obvious signs of a blood clot, but we'll need to be cautious.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That… doesn’t sound very good, does it? The warmer calf and all. I was a little worried it might be something serious. What does this mean, Doctor? Is it… bad? I hope it’s nothing too terrible. I have… a bit of a busy schedule, you see. I’m teaching computer science, and the students… well, they need me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. It’s good you’re being proactive about this. It could be a few things. Given the swelling, warmth, tenderness, and the history of atrial fibrillation, we need to rule out a blood clot in your leg – a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. The atrial fibrillation increases your risk for that. It's not necessarily terrible, but a DVT can be serious if it travels to your lungs. We’re going to do a quick blood test called a D-dimer. It's a simple blood draw, and it can help us determine if further investigation is needed. If the D-dimer is elevated, we'll likely need an ultrasound to look for a clot. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A blood test and… an ultrasound? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. And a bit scary, to be honest. A clot going to my lungs… that doesn’t sound good at all. Is it… common for people with this… atrial… thing to get these clots? And what happens if it is a clot? Will I need to go to the hospital? I’m not very good with medical things, you see. It all sounds a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let's break it down. Yes, people with atrial fibrillation are at a higher risk for blood clots, simply because the irregular heartbeat can cause blood to pool in the heart and form clots. The good news is, we're being proactive. The D-dimer test will give us a better understanding of the situation. If it is elevated, an ultrasound is a non-invasive way to see if there's a clot present. If a clot is found, treatment usually involves blood thinners to prevent it from growing and to prevent new clots from forming. Depending on the size and location of the clot, you might need to be admitted to the hospital for a short time, but that's not always the case. We'll discuss all your options if that becomes necessary. For now, let’s just focus on getting the blood test done. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. A blood test sounds… manageable. I can do a blood test. And… blood thinners. I’ll try not to worry about that just yet. Thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so clearly. You’ve been very patient with me. Where do I go for the blood test? And… how long will it take to get the results? I hope it’s not too long. I have a class tomorrow morning, you see.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I'm glad I could help. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. The nurse will draw the blood; it'll only take a few minutes. The results usually come back within a few hours, but it can sometimes take longer depending on how busy the lab is. I'll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they're available. If they're elevated, we'll schedule that ultrasound right away. In the meantime, try to avoid prolonged standing or sitting, and elevate your leg whenever possible. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. I’ll go to the lab right away. And I will try to keep my leg up. Thank you again for everything. I feel a little better knowing what we’re looking for. I hope it’s nothing too serious. I’ll see you later, then, if the results come back… needing an ultrasound.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. You take care. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before the results come back. We'll figure this out.
