DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Nani. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I haven’t been feeling myself lately. Just… down. I suppose that's the best way to put it. I'd like to get this sorted, if you don't mind, as I have a busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. I understand. Feeling “not yourself” is a valid reason to seek medical attention, and we will certainly try to get to the bottom of this. To help me understand what’s been going on, could you tell me more about what you mean by “down”?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's… a lack of enjoyment, I suppose. Things I used to find pleasure in – my work, seeing friends – they just don’t… spark joy anymore. And I’m tired. Always tired. It’s not the tiredness from a hard day’s work, more… a weariness of the spirit, if that makes any sense. It’s been going on for a few months now, maybe longer. Honestly, the months are blurring together these days. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Nani. Thank you for sharing that. A loss of enjoyment and persistent fatigue, particularly when it feels different from typical tiredness, is important information. It sounds like this has been impacting you for a significant period. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if there have been any specific events or changes in your life around the time you noticed these feelings starting?
PATIENT: Specific events… Well, my divorce was finalized about six months ago. It wasn’t… amicable. A lot of back and forth. Still is, frankly. He’s a difficult man. Aside from that… nothing leaps to mind. Work’s been steady, though a bit demanding with the summer crowds. I've been keeping busy, which I thought would help, but… it hasn’t. Do you need me to think harder? I sometimes forget things these days.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Nani. The divorce being finalized six months ago is very relevant information, and it’s understandable that a difficult separation could be contributing to how you’re feeling. It's quite common to experience emotional difficulties following a major life change like that. To further assess things, I’d like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: My appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I eat like a bird, others I have no interest at all. And yes, I suppose I've lost a bit of weight. Not intentionally. My clothes feel looser, but I haven't weighed myself properly in… oh dear, I can't even remember. It's not something I pay much attention to, honestly. As long as I can still do my job, I don't worry too much. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Nani. Changes in appetite and unintentional weight loss can be associated with a number of things, including emotional distress, but it’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes. Now, I'm going to ask you about your sleep. Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or do you find yourself sleeping too much?
PATIENT: Staying asleep is the problem. I fall asleep easily enough, usually from sheer exhaustion, but I wake up… repeatedly. Several times a night. And then I lie awake for ages, my mind racing. Thinking about… everything. My work, the divorce, the future. It’s very frustrating. I don’t feel rested when I wake up, even if I’ve been in bed for eight hours. Does that make sense? I used to sleep like a log. Before… all of this.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Nani. Fragmented sleep and difficulty staying asleep, especially when accompanied by racing thoughts, is a common symptom of both emotional distress and certain medical conditions. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but I recovered fully. And I have high blood pressure, which I manage with medication. Otherwise… no, nothing major. I'm generally quite healthy, all things considered. I've always been active, even now. Skiing, swimming, lifeguarding – it keeps me going. Do you need to know about specific medications? I have a list somewhere, but I'm not sure where.
DOCTOR: Yes, please, if you could locate that list that would be very helpful. Knowing your current medications is important to rule out any potential interactions or side effects. In the meantime, let's talk about your family history. Are there any mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety, that run in your family?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. My mother was a very stoic woman. Didn't show much emotion, good or bad. My father was… distant. We weren’t a family that talked about feelings, if you know what I mean. I don’t recall anyone being… unwell, as such. Though, looking back, perhaps they were just good at hiding it. It’s not something we discussed. Is that helpful? I’m afraid I don’t have much information on that front. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a little overwhelmed. This is a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Nani. Family history can be difficult to ascertain, and it's common for families not to openly discuss mental health. It’s understandable that you don’t have much information. And I apologize if I'm overwhelming you with questions. I just want to be thorough. Now, one last set of questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you're agreeable. Could you tell me a little about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? What do you mean? Do you want to know if I drink? Smoke? I don’t. Never have. I enjoy a good cup of tea, though. As for seeing people… I have a few friends, mostly colleagues from work. We get together occasionally, for dinner or a movie. But since the divorce… I haven’t been as social. It's… difficult to explain. I just don't have the energy, or the inclination. Is that what you were asking? I really just want to get to the bottom of this, if you don’t mind me saying. I have a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I meant, Nani, and thank you for sharing that. It sounds like your social life has been affected by the recent changes in your life. Now, if you are agreeable, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also take a quick look at your throat and ears, just to rule out any obvious medical causes for your fatigue. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. If you must. The sooner this is over, the better. I have a shift starting at three. Just… please be quick. And gentle, if possible. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated – 148 over 92. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Your pulse is 78, which is normal, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling. Your throat looks clear as well. No signs of infection. Ears also appear normal. Everything appears physically normal, Nani. That doesn’t rule out other causes for your symptoms, but it does help us narrow things down.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? Am I ill? Do I need medication? I haven’t got time for a long investigation. I need to know what's wrong, and I need a solution. Quickly, please. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: I understand your urgency, Nani. While the physical exam didn't reveal any immediate cause for your symptoms, that doesn’t mean there isn’t something going on. Based on what you’ve told me – the loss of enjoyment, persistent fatigue, difficulty sleeping, unintentional weight loss, and recent divorce – the most likely explanation is major depressive disorder. However, I want to be very clear: I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without further evaluation. It's important to rule out other possibilities, such as thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, or other underlying medical conditions. To that end, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid panel, and vitamin D level. This will help us get a clearer picture of your overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And can’t you just… prescribe something to help me sleep? Something to get me through this busy period? I have a responsibility to my patients, and I can't afford to be exhausted. Just a temporary solution, until we get the results. Is that possible? I really don’t have time for a lengthy process.
DOCTOR: I understand your need for a quick solution, Nani. I am happy to discuss options to help you manage your sleep in the short term. However, I want to be very careful about prescribing medication without a clear diagnosis. It's important to consider the potential side effects and interactions, and to ensure it’s the right course of action for you. Given your symptoms and the recent life stressor, a trial of a low-dose antidepressant with sedative properties might be appropriate, in conjunction with the blood work to rule out other causes. This would address both the potential sleep disturbance and the underlying mood symptoms. Would you be open to discussing a low-dose medication, understanding that we’ll need to monitor your response and adjust as needed?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my work. And it doesn’t have… unpleasant side effects. I can't afford to be dizzy or sluggish. I need something that will allow me to function normally. What kind of medication are you thinking of? And how long will it take to start working? I have a very busy schedule, Doctor. I’m not able to afford a prolonged period of adjustment.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Nani. A common choice in these situations is Trazodone, a low-dose antidepressant often used for sleep. It generally has fewer side effects than other antidepressants, and is less likely to cause daytime drowsiness at low doses. It’s also relatively quick-acting, with most people experiencing some improvement within a few days. However, it's important to be aware of potential side effects, such as dizziness, dry mouth, or constipation. We’ll start with a low dose – 50mg at bedtime – and monitor your response closely. If you experience any bothersome side effects, we can adjust the dose or switch to a different medication. If you are agreeable, I’ll write you a prescription for 50mg of Trazodone to be taken at bedtime. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss your response and review the blood work results. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning side effects or your symptoms worsen, please contact the office immediately. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. 50mg… I suppose that's worth a try. As long as it doesn't interfere with my work. And I expect to see some improvement in two weeks. I’m a busy woman, Doctor. I don’t have time to waste. Please just… write the prescription. And schedule the follow-up appointment. I have a shift starting soon. The sooner this is over, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. Here is your prescription for Trazodone 50mg, to be taken at bedtime. I’ve also scheduled a follow-up appointment for you on August 16th at 10:00 AM. I’ve also sent the lab order to the lab. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. I’m hopeful that this will provide some relief. Thank you for coming in today. .
