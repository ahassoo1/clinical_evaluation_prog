DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Quicksey, you said? Yes, nice to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit… complicated. My daughter, she's thinking about having a baby. And she thought… she thought I should come talk to someone first. About… things. Before it happens. I'm not sure exactly what things, to be honest. She just said it was important.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like your daughter is being very thoughtful, wanting to make sure you’re prepared and informed. That’s wonderful of her. So, you’d like to discuss potential health concerns or things to consider as a future grandparent, and perhaps things you might want to discuss with her?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. I… I haven’t been a grandparent before. And it’s been a long time since I thought about… baby things. She just said I might have questions, or… or need to know stuff. I don’t even know where to begin, really. I'm a bit old now, you see. Things slip my mind.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Verrall. It has been a while for many of us! And it's excellent you're proactively thinking about this. We can certainly go over anything that's on your mind, and there’s absolutely no shame in needing a refresher. To start, let's talk a bit about your own health. It's important to ensure you're in the best possible shape to support your daughter and, eventually, your grandchild. Do you have a primary care physician who regularly monitors your health?
PATIENT: A doctor… yes, I had a doctor. Dr. Abernathy. But… he retired a few years back, I think. I haven’t really… gotten around to finding a new one. I’m usually okay, you see. Not much bothers me. But, I suppose it's good to have someone check things, isn't it? I can’t remember the last time anyone did a proper check-up.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is always good to have regular check-ups, even when feeling well. It allows us to catch any potential issues early on. Since you haven't seen a doctor in a while, perhaps we can start with a comprehensive review of your medical history and a basic physical exam today, if you're comfortable with that. To begin, can you tell me about any significant medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… hmm. Let me think. I had… something with my blood pressure, years ago. Dr. Abernathy said it was high. I think I took pills for it, for a while. But I stopped, I think. He said it was under control. And… I had a bad knee, a long time back. A football injury. Still bothers me sometimes, especially when it rains. Other than that… I can’t really remember anything major. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so history of hypertension, managed at one point with medication, and a knee injury. We’ll definitely want to revisit the blood pressure today. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Nothing. I stopped the blood pressure pills… must be ten years ago now? Maybe more. And I don’t really believe in those vitamins, to be honest. Always seemed like a waste of money to me. Just eat a sensible diet, that's what my mother always said.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications or supplements. That's good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. The knee, yes. I had surgery on the knee, a long time back. That was… oh, goodness, must be forty years ago now? They fixed something inside. And… I think I was in hospital once when I was a boy, with the measles. But that was a very long time ago. Nothing since then, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee surgery approximately forty years ago and hospitalization as a child for measles. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I eat everything. My daughter always tells me I should be more careful, but I’ve never had any trouble. I’ve eaten shellfish, nuts, everything. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. Never been allergic to anything, as far as I remember.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. She was always tired. And my uncle, on my father’s side… he had cancer, a long time back. Lung cancer, I think it was. He smoked, you see. A lot. My father… he was always very healthy, as far as I know. Never a day sick in his life. It’s hard to remember, though. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart disease in your mother and lung cancer in an uncle, associated with smoking. That's helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask about your social history, if that’s alright. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never liked it. Always smelled awful. My daughter tried to get me to try it once, when I was young, just to see what it was like, but I wouldn’t. Always thought it was a foolish habit. And, like I said, my uncle suffered for it. So, no. Never smoked.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s excellent. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Or a beer if I’m watching the football. Not much, though. I don’t really have much of a taste for it. Never been a big drinker. Just… sociable drinking, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, sociable drinking. And finally, do you work or have any hobbies that involve physical activity?
PATIENT: I used to be a Sales Engineer, travelling around a lot. That kept me busy, walking around factories and building sites. But I retired a few years back now. Mostly just potter around the garden these days. A bit of weeding, a bit of pruning. It's not much of a workout, but it keeps me active. And I like it.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Mr. Verrall. Gardening is excellent. Alright, we’ve covered a lot of important background information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. We’ll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Blood pressure, you say? That'll be interesting. It's been a long time since anyone checked that. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here for me. Alright, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, reading 148 over 92. Not drastically high, but certainly something we should keep an eye on. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. It's often harmless, but we'll want to monitor it. Your lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Ears look clear, and your throat is a bit dry, but no signs of infection. Okay, everything seems generally alright, but the elevated blood pressure and murmur warrant further investigation. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. We should also do an EKG to assess your heart function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests and… an EKG, you say? Is that painful? I don’t like needles, you see. And I worry about these things. I suppose if it's important, I can manage it. As long as it doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: The EKG is completely painless, Mr. Verrall. It involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t involve any needles at all. As for the blood tests, yes, there will be a small needle prick, but it's very quick. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will make it as comfortable as possible. It will only take a few minutes. The results will give us a better understanding of your overall health and help us determine if any further treatment is necessary. We can discuss the results when they come back, usually within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend trying to reduce your sodium intake and getting regular, moderate exercise, like your gardening. Would you like me to write out a request for those tests now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. A request for the tests, you say? And… sodium? What sort of things have a lot of sodium in them? I try to eat sensible things, but I don’t really pay attention to these details. And… I’m happy to keep gardening, as long as my knees hold out!
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here’s a lab request form. You can take this to any certified lab, and they'll take care of the blood draw and EKG. As for sodium, it's often hidden in processed foods—things like canned soups, processed meats, salty snacks, and even some breads. Reading food labels is a good way to keep track. I can have the nurse print out a handout with a list of low-sodium food options for you. While we wait for the results, it's also a good idea to monitor your blood pressure at home if you're able. You can purchase a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Do you think you'd be comfortable doing that?
PATIENT: A handout, you say? Yes, that would be very helpful. I’m not very good with computers, you see. And a home blood pressure monitor… hmmm. I suppose I could try. My daughter is good with those things, she could help me set it up. As long as it’s not too complicated. It sounds like a lot to remember, though.
DOCTOR: It does sound like a lot, but we’ll take it one step at a time. The nurse will get you that handout, and she can also provide some information on simple home blood pressure monitors. We want to make this as manageable as possible for you. So, to summarize, we've ordered blood tests and an EKG. We’ve discussed monitoring your blood pressure at home and reducing your sodium intake. I also recommend continuing your gardening, as long as it doesn't aggravate your knees. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. It’s good to know what’s going on, even if it’s a bit worrying. My daughter will be pleased I came. She's very concerned about everything. Thank you. I think I’ll just take this form and… try to remember everything you’ve told me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verral. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. The nurse will be in shortly to go over discharge instructions and provide the handouts. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: .
