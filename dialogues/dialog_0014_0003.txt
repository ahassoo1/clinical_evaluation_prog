DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get this over with. It’s my hand. It shakes. Been shaking for…well, a while now. Doesn't bother me too much, but my daughter insisted I come in. She worries about everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. A while now, you say. And it’s just the hand?
PATIENT: Just the hand, mostly. Though…sometimes I feel a little unsteady on my feet. But that could be anything, right? Old age, probably. I used to be able to hold a camera perfectly steady, you know. Directed some very important things, back in the day. Not like these…these things they make now. All flash, no substance. But that's beside the point. The hand shakes.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, the shaking started…when, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Honestly, Doctor, I don't keep track of these things. Years, probably. A few years. Maybe more. It came on slow, you know? Didn’t just suddenly start shaking. It’s…annoying. Makes it hard to eat soup. That’s what I notice, mostly. And holding a glass. I dropped a perfectly good glass of Chianti last week. My daughter was furious.
DOCTOR: Right, soup and glasses. And has anything changed about the shaking recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… I don’t know. It seems…worse when I'm nervous, maybe? Or when I’m trying to do something precise. Like…buttoning my coat. It's ridiculous. I used to be so good with my hands. Now look at me. A shaky old man. Honestly, I don't see what you need to know all the details for. Is there a pill you can just give me to stop it?
DOCTOR: Well, it’s important to understand why it’s happening before we just…give you a pill, Mr. Baide. It could be several things. Now, have you noticed any stiffness in the hand, or any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Stiffness…sometimes, a little, in the morning. But that’s just…old age. Like I said. Everything aches in the morning. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I have an appointment to meet my friend for lunch, and I’d like to be on time. He's a very important man. Doesn't have time for…shaky people.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s do a quick exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Can you extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't expect miracles. It's going to shake. There. Happy now? Honestly, I've had doctors look at me before. It's always the same. They poke and prod, then tell me I need to slow down. As if I haven’t tried that already!
DOCTOR: Okay. I see the tremor. It seems to be resting tremor, primarily. Now, can you tap your finger to your thumb, as quickly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It's not easy, you know. It feels…wrong. Everything feels wrong these days. I used to be able to edit film with incredible speed and precision. These young directors don’t understand anything about craftsmanship. They just rely on computers. Are you finished yet?
DOCTOR: Just a few more things. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can see your finger. What is this proving? I have perfectly good eyesight for an 80-year-old. Always had a good eye for detail, that's what made me a good director. Honestly, I don't understand why you're making me do all this. Is there a diagnosis, or am I just a science experiment?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it does sound like you likely have essential tremor. It’s common, especially as people get older, and it tends to worsen over time. It’s not usually life-threatening, but it can be bothersome. Now, I want to be clear: this isn’t a definitive diagnosis, and we should probably get a blood test to rule out other things. But for now, we can discuss some options.
PATIENT: Options? What kind of options? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, if it’s not going to kill me, I don’t want to hear about it. Just tell me if there's a pill. A little something to calm my hand. That’s all. My daughter will have a fit if she finds out I'm ignoring your recommendations, but… honestly, I’m tired. Very tired. Can we just get to the pills? .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. There are medications that can help manage the tremor. Propranolol is a common one, and it can be quite effective. However, it does have side effects, and it’s not appropriate for everyone. We'd need to check your medical history and blood pressure first. Also, lifestyle adjustments like limiting caffeine and stress can help. But I strongly recommend the blood test just to rule out other possibilities. It's a simple precaution. I'll order that now. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
