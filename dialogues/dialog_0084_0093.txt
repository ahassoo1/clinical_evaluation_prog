DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, right. Look, to be honest, I barely remember filling out all those forms. Something about…sleep? And getting, uh, fitter, I guess. It’s all a bit of a blur, really. My wife usually handled this sort of thing. She had a knack for remembering details. I just…don't. It's been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you indicated concerns about sleep and wanting to improve your fitness. That’s a good starting point. Let’s try to clarify things a bit. When you say you're having trouble sleeping, can you tell me more about how you're having trouble?
PATIENT: Trouble…right. Well, it’s not like I toss and turn all night, exactly. It’s more…I just don’t feel rested when I wake up. Like I haven't slept at all, even if I’ve been in bed for eight hours. And I wake up a lot. Not fully, you know? Just…aware. Like something’s…off. It's hard to explain. Honestly, I just feel…old. Which, I suppose, I am getting there. But it shouldn’t be this bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so not difficulty falling asleep, but non-restorative sleep and waking up frequently, feeling unrefreshed. And you’re feeling generally fatigued, is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sums it up nicely, actually. Non-restorative...sounds about right. And fatigued? Absolutely. I used to be able to work on instruments all day, no problem. Now? I'm knackered after a couple of hours. It's… frustrating. I mean, I like fixing things. It’s a good skill. It’s a shame to let it go because I'm too tired. It’s not like I’ve got anything else to fill my time with, either.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it start… That’s a good question. Everything feels a bit…muddled since…well, you know. After my wife passed, things just…blurred. Probably got worse then. Before that, I was…fine. Still tired sometimes, but everyone gets tired, right? It’s just…constant now. Maybe six months ago? A year? Honestly, I really couldn't say for sure. It all feels like one long, grey stretch.
DOCTOR: I understand it's difficult to pinpoint. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it's common for sleep and energy levels to be affected by grief. Okay, let's try this. Besides the fatigue and non-restorative sleep, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms…other symptoms? Let me think. I suppose my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don’t really feel hungry, not like I used to. And I’ve been…a bit forgetful, I guess. Although, that’s not exactly new. It’s just…worse. And…I don’t know. Just generally…down. Not actively sad, just…flat. Like there’s no point to anything, really. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite, increased forgetfulness, and feeling generally low or lacking motivation. Those are all important things to note. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Probably lost a bit. I haven’t really been keeping track. I haven’t been eating much, so it stands to reason, I suppose. I’m a tall fella, always been lean. But I reckon I’ve lost a little more than usual. It's hard to say exactly. Clothes feel a bit looser, if that’s any indication. I haven’t weighed myself in…well, ages.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A bit of stiffness in my back sometimes, from bending over instruments all day. But nothing major. Just old age, I suppose. Not that I'm doing much instrument work these days. But no, no real pain. Just…tiredness. It’s a different kind of ache, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… Not that I recall, no. I've always been a fairly healthy fella. Had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No major operations or anything like that. My wife handled all the doctor’s appointments and kept track of everything. I just…showed up when she told me to. I really don’t know much about it, to be honest. Medicare sends me a lot of papers, but I just pass them on to…well, I used to pass them on to her.
DOCTOR: Okay. The record confirms you haven’t had any major medical issues reported. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No, not that I remember. Never had the need for it. Maybe when I was a little boy, for a bad flu or something? But honestly, I couldn’t say for sure. It was a long time ago. I really don’t keep track of these things. I always figured I was healthy enough to avoid hospitals. My wife…she was the one who worried about that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Nothing regularly, no. Occasionally, I’ll take something for a headache, over-the-counter stuff. But nothing prescribed by a doctor. My wife, she had some pills for her blood pressure, but I don't take anything myself. I always figured I was lucky enough to not need any.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I’m aware of, no. I mean, I sneeze a bit in the spring, like everyone else. But I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction to anything. Never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. My wife always made sure I didn’t eat anything dodgy, but I don’t really pay much attention to ingredients lists, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Redfern. So to summarize, you're experiencing fatigue, non-restorative sleep, decreased appetite, increased forgetfulness, and feeling generally low. This started around six months to a year ago, likely worsening after the loss of your wife. You have no known medical conditions, no regular medications, and no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds…sensible. Whatever you think is best, doctor. Honestly, I’m just glad someone’s finally taking a look at this. I’ve been feeling like a bit of a wreck lately. A physical exam…right. Let’s get on with it then. I suppose. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just step over here and lie down, we’ll start with your heart and lungs. Then I'll check your reflexes and do a basic neurological assessment. It shouldn’t take long. Okay, take a deep breath for me…and another…Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little tender, maybe, but nothing major. Just… feels a bit empty, I suppose. I haven't been eating much, like I said. Everything just feels a bit…off, you know? It’s hard to explain. And I've lost weight, so I suppose it makes sense it wouldn't feel as…full.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your reflexes?
PATIENT: Reflexes? What do you mean? Like, hitting my knee with that little hammer thing? My wife used to tease me about having slow reflexes. She was always quicker than me. I suppose I haven't been doing much to keep them sharp lately either. Go ahead, if you need to. I haven't got anything to hide.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little diminished, but still present. Not a major concern at this point. Now, I’m just going to do a quick neurological assessment. I'll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then do some simple tasks to check your coordination. Okay, follow my finger... good. Now touch your nose with your finger... and now alternate touching your nose with each finger... Coordination seems slightly off, but again, not alarming. Okay, Mr. Redfern. Based on this quick exam, nothing immediately jumps out at me. However, given your symptoms – fatigue, sleep issues, decreased appetite, forgetfulness – and the recent loss of your wife, I’d like to order some blood work. It'll help us rule out any underlying medical causes, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or anemia. We should also test your Vitamin D levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, blood work sounds… sensible. If it helps figure things out, then absolutely. Vitamin D… right. My wife always said I should get more sun. Didn’t listen to her, of course. I suppose I should have. So, blood work. Where do we go for that? And… how long will it take to get the results? I haven't got anything pressing to do, but I’d like to know what’s going on, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll print out a lab requisition for you. You can go to the lab just down the street – they’re open until 5 pm today. It shouldn’t take long – maybe 15-20 minutes for the blood draw. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. In the meantime, I also want you to keep a sleep diary for a week. Just write down what time you go to bed, what time you wake up, and how you feel when you wake up. That will give us a better understanding of your sleep patterns. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, a sleep diary… right. I suppose I can manage that. It'll be something to do, at least. And 2-3 business days for the results… okay. I’ll head down to the lab after this, then. This all sounds… thorough, Doctor. Thank you. It’s good to know someone’s actually taking this seriously. I’ve been feeling like I'm just… fading away.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Redfern. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and remember, you’re not alone in this. Alright, well, I have another patient waiting. I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: Yeah, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I will. And… thank you again. I’ll see you in a few days, then. .
