DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you please tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Shely. Nice to meet you too. It’s good to be here. I'm just in for my usual shots, I guess. Routine stuff. You know, keepin’ up with things.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Routine vaccinations are very important. To ensure I have a complete understanding of your needs, could you please clarify which vaccinations you are referring to specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. Honestly? I don't really know. The nurse called, said it was time for some boosters or somethin’. I usually just let them know what I need, and they take care of it. I don't keep track of all that medical stuff, if that makes sense. It all kinda blurs together after a while.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly understandable, Ms. Fornes. Many patients find it difficult to keep track of vaccination schedules. Let me take a look at your record here… Ah, yes. It appears you are due for your Tdap booster – that’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – and also a flu shot, as it is approaching flu season. Do either of those sound familiar?
PATIENT: Tdap… hmm. That one might ring a bell. I think I had that a few years back, maybe when my grandson was born? Something about protecting him… yeah, that sounds right. And the flu shot, always. My husband and I get those every year. He gets sick so easily, I gotta make sure I don't bring anything home to him. So, yeah, those both sound right.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your record confirms you received a Tdap booster in 2022, which is within the recommended timeframe for a booster every ten years. And I see you consistently receive the influenza vaccine annually, which is wonderful preventative care. Before we proceed, I'd like to briefly review your medical history, if you don't mind. Just to be thorough. Have you experienced any new medical conditions or had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations since your last visit?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains that come with gettin’ older, you know? Arthritis in my knees is acting up a little more this summer with all the rain, but I’m managing it with some cream and trying to take it easy. No hospital visits, no new diagnoses, thankfully. I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. Knock on wood!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Fornes. And it’s excellent that you're managing the arthritis. We can certainly discuss that further if it becomes more troublesome. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones, for the arthritis or anything else?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen, when my knees really bother me. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. My grandma always said too much medicine is worse than the ailment, and I tend to agree. And some fish oil capsules, for the joints. That’s about it. Honestly, I mostly just try to stay active and eat right. That seems to help the most.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Ms. Fornes. Staying active and maintaining a healthy diet are foundational to good health. Are you allergic to any medications, or do you have any known allergies to anything else, such as food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and I spend plenty of time outdoors – gardening, fishing, hiking… never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. Though, I don’t care for shellfish much, but that’s more of a preference than an allergy.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent news. Now, just to complete the history, could you briefly tell me about your family’s medical background?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… Well, my mom lived to be 92, but she had some heart trouble towards the end. My dad passed away from a stroke when he was in his seventies. And my brother has high blood pressure, but other than that, we’re a pretty healthy bunch. Lots of strong Tlingit genes, I think! Nothing really major that I need to worry about, as far as I know. We didn't really talk about medical stuff much when I was growing up. It wasn't really the custom.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Fornes. It’s helpful to have that information. Now, I’d like to quickly perform a brief physical exam to ensure everything is as it should be before administering the vaccinations. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go right ahead. I don't mind a bit. I figured you’d want to listen to my heart and lungs or somethin’ anyway. Always good to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take some nice, deep breaths for me, please. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Your pulse is 78 and regular, and your blood pressure is 130/80. Lymph nodes are non-palpable and non-tender. Finally, I briefly examine her throat and ears. Throat is clear, no erythema or exudates. Ear canals are clear bilaterally. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits. Everything sounds and looks good. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort at the moment?
PATIENT: Nope, not a bit. Feelin’ perfectly fine, actually. Just a little nervous about shots, if I’m bein’ honest. Never liked ‘em, even as a kid. But I know they’re important, so I just try to get it over with.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Fornes. Many patients feel the same way about vaccinations. We'll do our best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. We will administer both the Tdap booster and the influenza vaccine today. Do you have a preference for which arm?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Does it matter? I guess… my left arm feels a little less sore usually. If that makes a difference. Otherwise, whichever’s easiest for you. I really don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Left arm it is. The influenza vaccine and the Tdap booster will be administered in your left deltoid muscle. I’m going to clean the area with an alcohol swab first, and then you may feel a brief pinch. It’s important to remain still during the injection. There you go. Both vaccinations have been administered. I’ll apply a bandage to each site. Please keep the bandages on for at least fifteen minutes. You may experience some mild soreness or redness at the injection sites, which should resolve within a few days. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, can help if needed. I'll document these vaccinations in your chart and provide you with a record of immunization. Do you have any questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, that sounds good. I appreciate you bein' so gentle, and explainin' everything. No questions, I think. Just gotta sit here a bit and make sure I don’t faint, right?
DOCTOR: That’s right. We’ll have you sit here for fifteen minutes just to monitor for any immediate reaction. It's rare to have a serious reaction, but it's always best to be cautious. I’ll be right here if you need anything at all. Your vital signs are stable, Ms. Fornes. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Feelin' alright, actually. A little achy where the shots were, but nothin' I can’t handle. Thanks for checkin’. I think I’m good to go. I appreciate you takin' such good care of me today, Dr. Shely.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fornes. I’m glad to hear you’re feeling alright. It’s important to report any unusual symptoms, such as high fever, severe soreness, or difficulty breathing, to your primary care physician. Here is your record of immunization. Please keep this for your records. Do you have any further questions or concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again for everything, Dr. Shely. It was a pleasure meeting you. I'll be sure to tell my husband you were very kind.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Ms. Fornes. Please give your husband my regards. Take care, and have a wonderful day!
