DOCTOR: Alright, Josie, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s my stomach. Been happening for…well, a while now. Food comes back up, you know? Not violently, just…regurgitation. It’s disgusting. And it's interfering with my life. I haven’t got all day to sit here describing my insides.
DOCTOR: Right. “Regurgitation.” A while now, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a while. Months. Maybe longer, honestly. I don’t keep precise records of when my stomach acts up. I have important things to do, running the city's emergency plans isn’t exactly a relaxing hobby, you know? It happens mostly after I eat, but sometimes just…randomly. It’s not pleasant. And frankly, I expect you to fix it.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. And what sort of things are you typically eating when this happens?
PATIENT: What does it matter what I eat? It happens with everything! Polish food, American food, doesn't matter. I eat normal food. I’m not one of these people with fancy diets. Look, I’m a busy man. Do you need a list of everything I’ve eaten in the last year? Because I certainly don’t have one. It’s food. Regular food. And it comes back up sometimes. Is that enough detail for you?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get… agitated. Just trying to get a picture here. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, changed? The world is changing, that’s for sure, not getting any better, but I haven’t changed anything. I eat, I sleep, I work. Same as always. Though, my wife did start making a new borscht recipe… but I doubt that’s it. She's a good cook, usually. Honestly, I just want this sorted. It's embarrassing, you know? Especially when I have to go to meetings.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it’s been happening for months, regardless of what you eat…and you’ve noticed no correlation with anything new in your routine, except perhaps your wife’s borscht. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, sometimes my chest feels a little…burning. Not terrible, just uncomfortable. Like indigestion, maybe? And I get a bit of a sour taste in my mouth sometimes, even when I haven’t eaten anything. That's about it. It's not like I'm doubled over in pain or anything. Just…annoying. And I'm a man who doesn't do annoying. It’s a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Chest burning, sour taste… Any nausea, vomiting – beyond the regurgitation we discussed?
PATIENT: No, not really vomiting. Like I said, it’s not violent. It just…comes up. A bit messy, sometimes. Regurgitation. It’s different. And no nausea, not usually. Just…the feeling that something's not quite right. I don’t sit around feeling sick, if that’s what you’re asking. I have a city to run, remember? I haven't got time for being unwell.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Alright. And are you taking anything for this?
PATIENT: Taking anything? No! Why would I be taking anything? I don’t just go around popping pills for every little discomfort. I’m a strong man. I’ve dealt with worse. My wife keeps suggesting antacids, but those things are just a temporary fix. I want a solution, not a band-aid. Honestly, this is taking too long. Are you going to figure out what’s wrong, or should I just go somewhere else?
DOCTOR: Alright, Josie. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a better picture. I want to listen to your abdomen and check for anything obvious. Can you lie down on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I have a meeting in an hour. And please, don't poke around too much. I haven't got all day to be examined. Honestly, the inefficiency of this whole process is…remarkable.
DOCTOR: Lie on your back, arms at your sides. I’ll just listen with the stethoscope. Okay. Sounds…normal. No obvious abnormalities. I’m going to palpate your abdomen now – just a gentle press. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Any pain there?
PATIENT: No! No pain. Just…uncomfortable. You’re poking around. It’s…disconcerting. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. This is all a waste of time. I’m telling you, it’s just indigestion. A bit of heartburn. It’s nothing serious. Are you sure you're even a real doctor? My wife’s cousin knows a chiropractor who's probably more helpful than this.
DOCTOR: Alright. No tenderness to palpation. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it could be gastroesophageal reflux disease – GERD – which is what we commonly call heartburn. The regurgitation, the chest burning, the sour taste… they all fit. However, given the persistence, and your age, we should rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: GERD? Heartburn? You mean to tell me I came all the way here, wasted an hour of my life, for heartburn? I’ve had heartburn before. A little antacid takes care of it. You’re suggesting I need tests for something I can fix with a five-dollar tablet? This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. What kind of tests are you talking about? And how long will they take? Because if they interfere with my schedule, I’m finding another doctor. Immediately.
DOCTOR: Alright, Josie. Let’s not jump to conclusions. While it could be GERD, we want to rule out things like esophageal strictures, or even more serious conditions. I’m recommending an upper endoscopy. It involves a small camera being passed down your esophagus to visualize the lining. It's a relatively quick procedure, usually takes about fifteen to twenty minutes, and we can schedule it for next week. We’ll also need a pH monitoring test, to measure the acid levels in your esophagus. That takes a little longer, about twenty-four hours.
PATIENT: A camera down my throat? For twenty-four hours? Are you serious? That sounds… barbaric. And a waste of my time. I run a city, Doctor. I don’t have time to be walking around with tubes in my throat. Absolutely not. I’m telling you, it’s just indigestion. A little bit of stress. I’ll take some antacids, maybe cut back on coffee, and see if that doesn’t fix it. No cameras. No tubes. Absolutely not. I think I’ve wasted enough of my time here. Thank you for…nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Josie. As you wish. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. Ignoring persistent symptoms can lead to complications. If your symptoms worsen, or don’t improve with antacids, please schedule an appointment to discuss further testing. Here's a prescription for omeprazole, a stronger acid-reducing medication. Take as directed. Have a good day. .
