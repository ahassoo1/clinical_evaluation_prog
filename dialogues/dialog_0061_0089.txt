DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Alese! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is lovely to meet you as well. Well, it’s… my stomach, really. It’s been causing me quite a bit of trouble lately. A rather severe pain, low down… in the abdomen, you see. It comes and goes, but when it does come, it’s… quite unpleasant. It's hard to explain precisely. I do have… something else going on, a condition… lupus, I believe they called it? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, so the details are a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Alese. It sounds uncomfortable, and I appreciate you letting me know about the lupus. That’s important information. So, this stomach pain – when did it start?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That is a good question. It feels like… a while now. Not suddenly, you understand. More of a gradual worsening, I suppose. Perhaps… a few months? Or was it longer? It’s terribly difficult to pinpoint, I apologize. Everything feels a bit… jumbled these days. It wasn't constant, not at first. Just… twinges, really. But they’ve gotten… more insistent lately, and much more painful.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Alese. It's perfectly okay to not remember exact dates. A few months of gradual worsening is helpful to know. And can you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Describing it… It’s… a cramping, really. A deep, aching cramp, low in my abdomen. It feels like… well, imagine a very tight knot, twisting and turning. Sometimes it’s just a dull ache, but other times it feels like someone is… pressing very hard. It can take my breath away, honestly. It radiates… around my lower back a bit, too. And I find it difficult to… settle, if you understand. Just finding a comfortable position is a struggle. Is that… helpful? I worry I’m not being very clear.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. A deep, cramping pain that radiates to your back and makes it hard to get comfortable… that gives me a good starting point. Now, have you noticed anything that makes the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a very astute question, Doctor. Let me see… worse… hmm. Eating seems to aggravate it, sometimes. Not always, but… heavier meals, certainly. And… stress, I think. When I’m feeling anxious or… unsettled, it seems to flare up. Better… Not much makes it better, to be truthful. Lying down helps a little, I suppose. And… warm baths. But it’s… temporary relief, really. A distraction, perhaps, rather than a true improvement. I haven’t noticed anything specific that consistently eases the pain, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, so eating, especially heavier meals, and stress seem to make it worse, and lying down or warm baths offer temporary relief. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, other symptoms… Let me see… I’ve been feeling rather… fatigued lately. More tired than usual, even after a good night’s sleep. And… my appetite has been a bit off. Not that I’m not eating, but I don't have much of a craving for anything. Occasionally… I’ve had some… difficulty with my bowels, if you understand. Not consistently, but… a bit of irregularity. And… a bit of nausea sometimes, but not vomiting. Just a queasy feeling. I’m not sure if all of this is connected, of course. It’s all rather… muddled, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, decreased appetite, some bowel irregularity, and occasional nausea… that’s good information to have, Alese. Now, regarding your lupus – do you currently take any medications for that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the lupus. I do. I take… let me see… I believe it’s called hydroxychloroquine. A small, white pill. And… sometimes, when I’m having a flare-up, the doctor prescribes prednisone. A steroid, I think. Though I haven't needed that recently, thankfully. I take the hydroxychloroquine daily, as prescribed, of course. And… I think I take something for the pain, as well, but my memory… it fails me. It’s a small, yellow capsule, perhaps? I apologize, I really should be more diligent about remembering these things.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Alese. It's understandable. So, you're on hydroxychloroquine daily for the lupus, and you occasionally take prednisone during flare-ups. You mentioned a small, yellow capsule for pain – do you remember when you started taking that, or what it’s for specifically?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the yellow capsule. I truly wish I could recall. It was… after a particularly bad flare-up, I believe. Perhaps… six months ago? Or was it longer? The doctor prescribed it for… general pain, I think. Muscle aches, perhaps? It's terribly frustrating, not being able to remember. I think it helps, but it's difficult to say for certain. I just… take it when the pain is particularly bothersome. I apologize for my vagueness. I should keep a better record of these things. I really ought to. It's just… so much to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a yellow capsule for general pain, started about six months ago, taken as needed. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or to anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see… I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. I recall being stung by a bee as a child, and having a bit of swelling, but nothing severe. And… I have a slight sensitivity to… certain fabrics. Wool, for example, can irritate my skin. But I wouldn't classify that as an allergy, precisely. No, I don't believe I have any significant allergies, Doctor. I do hope not, anyway. It would be most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies, just a sensitivity to certain fabrics like wool. Alright, Alese, thank you for answering all of those questions. That gives me a good understanding of what’s going on. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll just listen to your abdomen, and gently feel around to see if we can pinpoint where the pain is most intense. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. A physical exam sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment implicitly. Please, do whatever you need to do. I’ll try to remain as still as possible. It's just… please be gentle, if you would. The pain is… quite sensitive, as you know. And… if it becomes too uncomfortable, please do let me know, immediately. I wouldn't want to cause you any trouble.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Alese. I will be very gentle. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if anything is uncomfortable at all. Alright, let's start by listening to your abdomen. I'm just going to use the stethoscope here… Okay, I'm hearing normal bowel sounds, which is good. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain as I do this. I’ll start here, on the lower right side… Ouch… did that hurt?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, Doctor. That did hurt. Not terribly, but… a definite discomfort. A sharp, localized pain, right there. It feels… deeper than the general cramping I described earlier. More… focused. It’s… a bit tender, even when you’re not pressing so hard. It feels… almost like a bruise, if that makes any sense. Not visible, of course, but… that’s the sensation. Yes, that spot is… definitely the source of the most pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. And I’m noting some tenderness in that lower right quadrant. No significant tenderness elsewhere. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Heart and lungs sound clear. Okay, Alese. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, we need to investigate this further. Given the tenderness in your lower right abdomen, and your history of lupus, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to your lupus, but we also need to rule out other potential causes, such as diverticulitis, or a possible bowel issue. To help us figure out what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be alright with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests. I suppose that’s to be expected. I understand. It’s best to be thorough, of course. I would be alright with tests, Doctor. Though… what sort of tests are we talking about? Blood work, I presume? And… anything more invasive? I must confess, I'm not particularly fond of needles, or… anything more involved. I trust your judgment implicitly, of course, but… a little information would be most reassuring.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let me explain. I’d like to start with some blood work. That will help us look for signs of inflammation, infection, and to assess how your lupus is being managed. It’s a standard blood draw, so nothing too involved. Then, I think it’s important to get an imaging scan of your abdomen. I’m leaning towards a CT scan, which will give us a detailed picture of your intestines and other organs. It does involve a small amount of radiation, but it’s the most accurate way to determine the cause of your pain. We might also consider a stool sample, just to rule out any bowel infections. Do those tests sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh… a CT scan. Radiation… that doesn’t sound particularly pleasant. But… I understand it’s necessary. And… stool sample, yes, that’s… manageable. Blood work as well. Very well, Doctor. I suppose those tests are all… reasonable. I trust your judgment, as I said. Though… when would I have these tests done? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have… a rather busy schedule, you see. Not terribly hectic, but… I do have commitments.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. We can schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning, first thing. That way, you can get it done and over with. And we can arrange the CT scan for later this week, perhaps Friday?
PATIENT: Oh, Friday would be… quite acceptable. Yes, Friday works well. And the blood work tomorrow morning… excellent. Will I need to… prepare for the CT scan in any way? Fasting, perhaps? Or… anything else I should be aware of? I wouldn’t want to… inadvertently complicate matters. And… where would I have these tests done? Is it here, at the clinic? I appreciate your patience, Doctor. I do ask a great many questions, I fear.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Alese. It’s good to be informed. For the CT scan, yes, you will need to fast for at least four hours beforehand. Just no food or drinks during that time. You can still take your regular medications, unless I specifically advise you otherwise. And you'll need to drink a contrast dye before the scan, which will help us get a clearer picture of your insides. The tests will be done at the imaging center just across the street. We can get you a referral, and they’ll schedule the appointment for you. I'll write down all of these instructions for you, just to make sure you have everything clearly. And in the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your pain, or develop a fever, please contact us immediately. We want to make sure you're safe and comfortable. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. Fasting and contrast dye… I can manage that. And… yes, I believe I have one last question. You mentioned lupus being a possibility… what other causes are we considering? I don’t wish to… alarm myself, but… it's best to be prepared, you see. Knowing what we're ruling out… would be most reassuring. I understand if you're not comfortable discussing it at length, of course. I appreciate your time and patience, Doctor. You've been most kind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s good to be informed, and I'm happy to discuss this with you. Besides lupus, which can sometimes cause abdominal pain, we need to rule out a few other possibilities. Diverticulitis is one – that’s an inflammation of small pouches in the colon. A bowel obstruction, although less likely given your symptoms, is also something we need to consider. And, of course, there’s always the possibility of a simple infection, although your blood work will help us rule that out. It's important to remember that these are just possibilities at this point. We won't know for sure until we get the results of the tests. And I want to reassure you that we're taking this seriously, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of it. Do you have any questions about those possibilities, or would you like me to explain any of them in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… diverticulitis… I believe I’ve heard of that. And bowel obstruction… that sounds… rather unpleasant. Infections, of course, are always a concern. No, I believe I understand. It’s best to… be thorough, as you said. I’m grateful for your explanation, Doctor. And… I think that covers everything. I shall prepare for the tests, and… contact you immediately if my condition worsens. I appreciate your time and kindness, Doctor Kimm. You’ve been most reassuring.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alese. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns at all. We’re here to help. I’ll see you tomorrow morning for the blood work. Have a good rest of your day, and try not to worry. Bula vinaka!
