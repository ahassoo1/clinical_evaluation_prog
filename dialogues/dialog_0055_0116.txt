DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, please, tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you too, I suppose. Oh dear. Well, it’s my legs, you see. They bother me something awful at night. Cramp up, they do. It wakes me up. It has been going on for…well, a long time now. I don’t rightly know how long. A good while, though.
DOCTOR: "A good while." Very well. And is this cramping constant throughout the night, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Not…steady, no. It’ll be peaceful for a bit, then wham. A sharp pain. Then it fades after a little bit. It doesn’t happen every night, but when it does…it’s quite something. I used to just stretch them out, but that doesn’t seem to be helping as much anymore.
DOCTOR: And where exactly do you experience these cramps, Ms. Bilstein?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… mostly in my calves, I believe. The back of my legs, down low. Sometimes, it feels like it’s in my thighs too, but mostly the calves. It's hard to say for sure, really. Old age, you know. Things aren’t as clear as they used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these cramps?
PATIENT: Trigger? Oh dear… well, not that I can recall. I don't believe so. I walk a little each day, if the weather is nice. I sit and read a good bit too. But I haven't changed anything in my routine lately. Not that I remember, anyway. It just…started happening. Perhaps it's the cold? It’s been a bit chilly at night recently, hasn’t it?
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Bilstein?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I don't take anything. Never have, really. Always thought it best to let my body be. My husband, bless his soul, he was the one for pills. I just…avoided them. Not a fan, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Hmm. Allergies… Let me think… Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite…sturdy, I suppose. Never had much trouble with anything. A little sniffle now and then, but nothing serious. No rashes, no swelling, nothing like that. I don’t recall ever being allergic to anything, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein. If you’ll permit me, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. We’ll just take a look at your legs and check your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Perfectly sensible. Go right ahead. I haven't been examined in… goodness, I don't even remember the last time. I suppose it's a good idea.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat for me, if you are able. Now, let's begin. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups in both lower extremities. No fasciculations noted. Mild tenderness to palpation in the bilateral gastrocnemius muscles, but no significant swelling or warmth. Pulses are 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial bilaterally. Skin is warm and dry. No obvious signs of venous insufficiency. Normal range of motion in both ankles and knees. No edema present.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That tickled a bit. Everything feels…rather normal, I suppose. It’s just the cramping that’s the bother. So, what does all that…mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I do worry, you know. Old age makes one prone to worry.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Bilstein, based on the examination, there are no immediate concerns. The cramping you're experiencing is likely due to nocturnal leg cramps, which are quite common, particularly with age. The tenderness in your calf muscles suggests a possible muscular strain, but nothing of serious concern. However, given your age and the lack of a clear cause, it's important to rule out other potential contributing factors. While unlikely, we should consider the possibility of peripheral artery disease or nerve compression. To be thorough, I recommend a simple blood test to check your creatine kinase levels, to rule out muscle damage, and a basic metabolic panel. We can also discuss a referral to a vascular specialist if the cramping persists or worsens. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests and specialists… That sounds… rather involved. But if you think it's best, Doctor, I suppose I trust your judgment. I don't want anything serious being overlooked. Is it a lot of blood? I don't do well with needles, you see. And a specialist…will that cost a lot of money? I haven't much savings, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: The blood draw is standard, Ms. Bilstein. A few vials, nothing excessive. And I understand your concerns about cost. We can discuss options for affordable care, and I will provide you with a referral to a specialist who accepts patients with limited insurance. To start, let’s schedule the blood work. We’ll review the results, and then determine if a referral is necessary. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, stretching your calf muscles regularly, and ensuring you are getting adequate potassium and magnesium in your diet. Over-the-counter magnesium supplements can sometimes provide relief. Here is the requisition for the blood work. The lab is located just down the street. Do you have any difficulty getting there, or would you like me to arrange transportation for you?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s kind of you to offer transportation. No, I can manage. My son, bless his heart, he takes me to appointments sometimes, but he's busy with his work. I can walk it, if I have to. Potassium and magnesium, you say? I do enjoy bananas. And I try to eat my greens. I'll try to remember the supplements. Everything's a bit foggy these days. So, just take this to the lab, and they’ll do the…the blood work? And then I come back to see you?
DOCTOR: Precisely, Ms. Bilstein. Take this requisition to the lab. They will draw the blood samples. The results should be available in approximately 48-72 hours. You can either call my office to schedule a follow-up appointment, or I can have the results faxed directly to you, and you can contact us when you’ve reviewed them. Here is some additional information about nocturnal leg cramps. Review this at your leisure. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don’t think so. You’ve been very… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with an old woman like me. It's just… worrying, you see. Always worrying. No, I believe that’s all. Thank you again. I suppose I’ll be going then. Good day to you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Bilstein. Take care, and don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. Good day to you as well.
PATIENT: .
