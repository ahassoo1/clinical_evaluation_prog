DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Courtnye Hainley, that’s me. Honestly? It's kinda embarrassing, but I've been bruising like crazy lately. And I'm on... well, a blood thinner. The doctor put me on it a while back, and usually it's fine, but this is more than usual. It's just... a lot of purple.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hainley, thank you for sharing that. It's good you're bringing it up, and it's not embarrassing at all to discuss changes with your medications, especially a blood thinner. We want to make sure everything is working as it should and that you're safe. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little bit about why you were initially prescribed the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I just… I don't want to be a bother, you know? It was… um… a blood clot in my leg, a few years ago now. After a long flight, actually. They said I was at risk because of… well, family history, mostly. And sitting for too long. It was all a bit scary, to be honest. It’s been okay since, just the usual check-ups and the medicine. Until now.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Blood clots are scary, and it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about any changes, especially with a medication like this. And you’re definitely not a bother – that’s what I’m here for. So, a clot after a long flight, with a family history… that’s helpful information. And you said you’ve been experiencing more bruising than usual – can you describe where you’re noticing the bruising?
PATIENT: Everywhere, kinda? Like, I bumped my arm on the doorframe yesterday, tiny little bump, and it’s already the size of my hand. And I have some on my legs for no reason at all. Just… appeared. And a couple on my stomach, which is weird. I don't remember hitting myself there. It's not painful bruising, thankfully, just… a lot of it. And it's showing up faster, that's what’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bruising appearing with minimal trauma, and developing more quickly than usual, and in places you don't recall injuring… that's definitely something we need to investigate further. You mentioned it's not painful, which is good, but the ease with which it's happening is concerning. To get a complete picture, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions, besides the history of the blood clot?
PATIENT: Not really. I have… high blood pressure, but it's controlled with medication. And I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that's it. I'm pretty healthy, honestly. I try to walk every day, eat okay… nothing major. I don’t take a lot of pills, just the blood thinner and the blood pressure one.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. So, controlled high blood pressure and a past gallbladder removal, otherwise generally healthy. And just the two medications currently. Let’s talk about those medications for a moment. What is the name of the blood thinner you are taking, and what dosage?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It’s… Warfarin. Yes, Warfarin. And the dosage is… five milligrams. I take one pill every evening. I’ve been on the same dose for… oh, goodness, I think almost three years now. I get my blood tested regularly to make sure it’s right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin five milligrams daily, stable dose for almost three years, with regular blood monitoring. That's all very helpful. When was your last blood test to check your INR, if you recall?
PATIENT: Let me see… My appointment book is a mess. I think it was… July 18th? Yes, July 18th. The nurse called me with the results and said it was… within range. She didn’t say how within range, just that it was okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, July 18th, INR was within range, though you don't have the specific value. That's good information. While "within range" is reassuring, we'll want to double-check that value ourselves, just to be certain. Now, let’s briefly touch on your family history. You mentioned a family history contributed to your clot risk – could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. My grandfather on my mother's side… he had a lot of blood clots. Like, a lot. And my aunt, her sister, she had one after surgery. And my mother… she had a DVT once, but it was years ago. They said it was probably genetic, something to do with how our blood clots easier. That’s why they put me on the Warfarin, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Okay, significant family history of blood clots – grandfather and aunt with clots, and your mother with a prior DVT. That certainly explains the preventative approach with the Warfarin. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? Like, hobbies? I walk, like I said, pretty much every day. And I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. I don’t drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I definitely don’t smoke. I work a desk job, Information Security, so I sit a lot, which is probably bad. I wish I could be more active, but… it's hard with the work.
DOCTOR: Okay, regular walking, healthy diet, occasional wine, non-smoker, desk job with prolonged sitting… that's helpful. Prolonged sitting is something we'll need to discuss. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I know of. I eat everything, pretty much. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve been lucky, I guess. I’m not even allergic to penicillin, which my mother is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Alright, Ms. Hainley, thank you for that detailed information. It seems we have a good understanding of your medical history. Your INR on July 18th was 2.1, which is within the therapeutic range, but it's on the lower end. Given the increased bruising you're experiencing, I'd like to order a repeat INR test today, just to be certain. I also want to do a brief physical exam to assess the bruising and look for any other potential signs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? It’s just… worrying. The exam and the blood test sound good. As long as it doesn’t take too long, I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. I want to reassure you, we'll work as efficiently as possible. Okay, if you’d be comfortable, please have a seat here on the table. I’m going to take a look at the bruising on your arms and legs, and I’ll also listen to your heart and lungs and palpate your abdomen. It will just be a quick exam. Let's start by having you roll up your sleeves, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Here you go. It's mostly on my forearms, and a little on my upper arms. And like I said, there's some on my legs too, but it’s harder to see under my pants.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the bruising you’re referring to. It appears to be mostly ecchymoses - that’s the medical term for bruising - in various stages of healing. There doesn't appear to be any significant swelling or warmth, which is reassuring. I’m also not detecting any tenderness to the touch. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Overall, the exam doesn't reveal any immediate cause for concern beyond the increased bruising. However, we still need to investigate the cause. We’ll get the blood work done and assess the INR levels. While we wait for the results, could you describe any other symptoms you may be experiencing?
PATIENT: No, that’s it, really. No pain, no swelling, no fever. I’m just… tired, but I’m always a little tired. I sleep okay, I guess. No dizziness or anything like that. It’s just the bruising. It's just weird that it’s happening so much, and so easily. And it worries me, you know? About bleeding, or something.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about bleeding with a medication like Warfarin, and it’s good you’re bringing it up. The lack of other symptoms is reassuring, but we still need to determine the cause of the increased bruising. To rule out other potential causes, I’m going to order a complete blood count along with the INR. The CBC will help us assess your overall blood health, including your platelet count, which is important for clotting. While we wait for the results, I want to discuss some precautions you can take. Avoid activities that could lead to injury, and let your doctor know before any scheduled procedures. Also, make sure you’re reporting any unusual bleeding, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your urine or stool. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Precautions make sense. I’m pretty careful anyway, but I will definitely be extra cautious. And I'll report anything unusual. Is there anything I should be looking for specifically? Besides the obvious bleeding?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Hainley. Being proactive is excellent. Beyond the obvious signs of bleeding - nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your urine or stool, unusual bruising - keep an eye out for any prolonged headaches, dizziness, or weakness. These could also be signs of bleeding, though they are less common. Also, pay attention to any changes in your vision. Sudden vision changes can sometimes indicate bleeding in the brain, although this is a very rare occurrence. I want to reassure you again that we're taking this seriously and are working to determine the cause of the increased bruising. The CBC and repeat INR will give us a clearer picture. We'll review the results as soon as they are available, and we'll discuss the next steps at that time. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Just… how long does the blood work take? I really do have that meeting this afternoon. And I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question. The blood work should take about 15-20 minutes to draw and process. The results typically come back within an hour or two, so we should have them before your meeting. I’ll let the lab know to prioritize your results, and I’ll have my nurse page me as soon as they are available. We'll go over them together. Would you like me to call you if there are any delays?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be great. My number is 555-1212. And thank you. You’ve really put my mind at ease, even if I don’t know what’s going on yet.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hainley. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Alright, let’s get you over to the lab for the blood work. My nurse, Sarah, will be right with you to guide you. She’s excellent, and she’ll get you all set up. Again, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your meeting. I’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results.
PATIENT: Okay, great. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hainley. Have a seat in the waiting area, and Sarah will be with you shortly. .
