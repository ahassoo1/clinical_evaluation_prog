DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the time for this. It’s… a bit embarrassing. A white coating in my mouth. It’s unpleasant, and my wife insisted I come. She says it’s… contagious. I doubt that very much. It’s probably just something I ate.
DOCTOR: Contagious or not, it's good your wife encouraged you to come in. We should always check these things. A white coating can be a number of things, and it's best to rule out anything serious. Now, when did you first notice this coating?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Honestly, I don’t recall precisely. A week, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. It’s not as if I spend my days meticulously examining the inside of my mouth, Doctor. I have… responsibilities. It’s just there. And frankly, it's interfering with my appetite.
DOCTOR: Right. A week or so. Has it been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Worse, I suppose. Though it’s difficult to quantify, naturally. It’s… more noticeable. And it makes eating rather… disagreeable. I prefer a good steak, you see, and this… coating… interferes with the enjoyment.
DOCTOR: I understand. And is it just in your mouth, or have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Just in my mouth, Doctor. Really, I fail to see what else there would be. It’s not as if it’s spreading to my… extremities. Are you suggesting some sort of… plague? I assure you, I practice excellent hygiene. My wife is quite particular about these things.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schieber, I am not suggesting a plague. I'm simply trying to get a complete picture. Have you had any fever, chills, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Certainly not. And swallowing is… fine. A little uncomfortable, perhaps, with this… film, but perfectly manageable. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a faller. I work hard, I eat well, I am a robust individual. I doubt a simple coating is indicative of anything serious. Perhaps a stronger mouthwash is all I require?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any pain, redness, or sores in your mouth underneath the coating?
PATIENT: No. Not that I can see. It’s… a white film, Doctor. Like a dusting. It’s rather unsightly, to be frank. And it’s interfering with my work. I need to be presentable, you understand? Clients… they have expectations. It's distracting, constantly worrying about this… situation. Honestly, are you sure this requires a prolonged examination?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I understand your concerns, but I need to examine your mouth to determine the cause of this coating. It could be something simple, or it could be something that requires treatment. It's my job to rule things out. If you'll just open wide for me…
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, with all due respect, I find this rather… intrusive. I am a busy man. And frankly, I'm not convinced a brief glance will yield any useful information. It's a white coating. Perhaps you could simply write me a prescription for something and be done with it? My time is valuable. I really must insist...
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I am attempting to provide you with appropriate medical care. Refusing a basic examination is… frankly, unhelpful, and potentially detrimental to your health. I will not prescribe medication without knowing the cause of this condition. If you continue to refuse a simple examination, I will be unable to assist you further. It appears we have reached an impasse. .
