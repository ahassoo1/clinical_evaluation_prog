DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Marialena! It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Kimm. It’s very nice to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… discomfort with my bladder, a feeling of pressure, really. It’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. That’s good information to start with. And when you say "a little while now," could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’d say it started… approximately three weeks ago, maybe a bit longer. It comes and goes, but it's been fairly consistent over the last two weeks, if that makes sense. It isn’t constant pain, just… a persistent feeling of needing to go, even when I don’t necessarily need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three weeks onset, consistently for the past two weeks. Feeling the urge to go even when you don’t… got it. Is it more frequent during the day, at night, or is it pretty much the same?
PATIENT: It seems to be more noticeable during the day, truthfully. I don’t typically have issues sleeping through the night, so it doesn't wake me up or anything. It's more when I'm at work, or out running errands... just generally being more active, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, so more pronounced with activity. Have you noticed any pain when you urinate, or any difficulty starting or stopping?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain during urination. And no difficulty starting or stopping, either. It’s really just the… fullness, the pressure. It’s a bit uncomfortable, and I find myself going to the restroom more often, just in case. It hasn’t interfered with my work too much, but it’s definitely on my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or difficulty, just the increased frequency due to the sensation. And it’s causing you some concern, which is good you came in to get it checked out. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t noticed any changes in color or smell, no. Everything looks normal, if that makes sense. It’s just… the feeling itself is different. I don’t know if that’s helpful. It doesn’t burn, it’s not cloudy, nothing like that. Just this constant sensation.
DOCTOR: Okay, so normal appearance, just the sensation is off. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain along with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, or lower back pain at all. I've been feeling otherwise healthy, honestly. That’s part of why I waited a little bit to come in, because I didn't have any other symptoms. It just… persisted.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And just to get a little more of your history, have you had any urinary tract infections in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I had one when I was in college, maybe… eight or nine years ago? It was quite unpleasant, I remember that. I needed antibiotics to clear it up. I haven’t had any issues since, until now, of course. I’m a bit worried it might be another one, but it doesn't feel quite the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of one UTI about eight or nine years ago. That’s helpful. Do you remember if that infection involved any flank pain, or was it mostly just burning and frequency?
PATIENT: I believe it was mostly burning with urination and the increased frequency, as I recall. I don't specifically remember any pain in my flanks, but it was a long time ago, so my memory isn’t perfect. I do remember feeling very tired and achy overall, but I attributed that to the infection itself. I went to my primary care doctor then, and they confirmed it was a UTI.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to cover some other things, have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t made any drastic changes to my diet. I generally eat a fairly balanced diet, and haven't been consuming significantly more fluids than usual either. I do enjoy coffee in the mornings, of course, but that’s been a consistent habit for years.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent coffee intake. Have you been sexually active recently?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. My husband and I are… well, we are married. So, yes, we have been sexually active. It hasn't increased in frequency lately, it's been fairly consistent as well. I don't think it's related, but I wanted to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing. That’s important information. And just to round out the picture, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: I do take a daily multivitamin, but that's it. No prescription medications currently. And no known allergies to any medications. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I do have a slight sensitivity to penicillin, but it's not a full-blown allergy, more of a mild rash.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin only, and a mild rash with penicillin. That’s good to know. Let me just take a look at your EHR here to see previous visits… Okay, it looks like you haven’t been seen at our clinic before, but I do see a record transferred from your previous primary care physician. Confirms the history of one UTI eight years ago. Alright, Marialena, based on what you’ve told me, and your history, it could be a UTI, but the lack of pain and other typical symptoms makes me want to be a little more thorough. I'd like to do a quick physical exam and a urine sample to be sure. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I appreciate you being thorough. A physical exam and a urine sample is fine with me. Whatever you think is best. I’d like to know for certain what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could just go ahead and change into a gown on the exam table, I’ll be right in. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen and then we’ll collect the urine sample.
PATIENT: Certainly. I'll just be back here when I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. If you could lie back on the exam table, please. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. This won’t be uncomfortable. Okay, everything sounds normal there. No tenderness to palpation either. Now, I’ll just need you to collect a urine sample for us. There’s a cup in the bathroom, and instructions on how to collect a clean catch sample. I’ll give you a few minutes of privacy.
PATIENT: Here you go. I followed the instructions as best as I could. It’s… not the most pleasant thing, but it's done.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Marialena. I’ll send this off to the lab for a full analysis. It usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the results back. In the meantime, since we’re ruling out a UTI, and you don’t have a fever or any flank pain, I’m going to start with a diagnosis of possible bladder irritation. It could be a number of things, even just something as simple as dietary changes or sensitivity to a product you're using. To start, I recommend drinking plenty of water – about 8 glasses a day – and avoiding caffeine and alcohol for a few days, just to see if that makes a difference. If it doesn’t improve within a week, or if you start to develop any fever, back pain, or pain when you urinate, please call the office immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Dr. Kimm. Drinking more water and cutting out caffeine and alcohol is definitely something I can do. And I will absolutely contact the office if anything changes or worsens. Thank you for your thoroughness and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I want to make sure we address your concerns and find the source of the problem. We'll get the lab results back as soon as possible. I'm also going to order a complete blood count just as a baseline, even though you don’t have any other symptoms. It’s just a precaution. I’ll have the front desk schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a week, just to discuss the results and see how you’re doing. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. You’ve answered all of my questions and I feel much better having a plan in place. Thank you again for taking the time to listen and for being so kind and thorough. I appreciate your care, Dr. Kimm. I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. You're very welcome, Marialena. I'm glad I could help. Feel free to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The front desk will give you discharge instructions and schedule your follow-up. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next week.
