DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Cumper. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s get straight to it. It's about… well, it’s about this. <gestures vaguely at his stomach> It's not what it used to be, alright? And it’s bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand you want to be brief. “Not what it used to be” – can you tell me a little more specifically what you’re experiencing with your stomach?
PATIENT: Specifically? You want specifically? It’s…sagging! Look at it! Used to be hard as a rock, could take a punch, you know? Now? Flabby. Soft. It’s…disgraceful. I'm a pile driver operator, you know? A man needs a strong core for that work. It’s… it’s embarrassing. <adjusts shirt>
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're concerned about a change in the firmness of your abdomen. And this is affecting your ability to do your work?
PATIENT: Affecting my work? Boy, you think? It's affecting everything. I don't even like looking at myself in the mirror anymore. Used to be a handsome man. Still am, I suppose, but… not with that hanging there. It's a sign of weakness, you know? A sign of getting old. And I don't like it. Is there something you can do about it? And don’t tell me to exercise. I work hard enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like this change is causing you a good deal of distress, both physically and emotionally, and that’s important to address. Before we discuss potential solutions, I need to understand a bit more about what’s going on. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this loss of firmness?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Let me think. Well, my trousers don't fit as snug as they used to, that’s for sure. Need to keep pulling them up. And sometimes… sometimes I get a little winded climbing the stairs. But I put that down to getting older, naturally. Everything sags eventually, right? I don’t know about other changes. I don’t go poking and prodding at myself. What kind of changes are you asking about?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. When you say “winded”, is that a new symptom, or has that been happening for a while?
PATIENT: Hmm. Newish, I suppose. Not like it's stopped me from working, mind you. Just… takes a little longer to catch my breath. Used to be able to run up those stairs two at a time. Now… well, now it’s more of a… deliberate climb. It started maybe six months ago, around the time my wife passed. A lot on my mind then, you see.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. Grief can certainly take a toll on the body, and it's understandable that you've been experiencing some changes. So, loss of firmness in your abdomen, trousers feeling looser, and shortness of breath when climbing stairs, starting about six months ago. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What are you, a… a plumber now? Look, I don't need to discuss that with you. Is this necessary? I came here about my stomach, not… internal matters. I eat regular, mostly. Meat and potatoes, you know? A man’s diet. No fancy greens or anything. And I go when I need to. Is that good enough? Honestly, I’m losing patience.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Trendler. I'm only asking because changes in bowel habits can sometimes be related to abdominal issues. It's part of a thorough assessment. But we can move on if you're uncomfortable discussing that. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmph. No. Never had any of that nonsense. Strong Jamaican blood, you see. Good genes. Used to work out with my father every day. Pile driving is exercise, you know. He lived to be 90, and that was with real work, not fancy machines. Just… strong living. Private insurance, though. Always been healthy. Never needed much doctoring. Just… this. And it's annoying me.
DOCTOR: Okay. No existing medical conditions. Private insurance. Healthy overall, aside from the current concern. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. Why would I need surgery? A man uses his body, doesn’t break it. A few bumps and bruises over the years, from the job, of course. But no cutting. Never. And I don't want any now. I just want… well, I want it fixed. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask. I understand. To help me understand what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently examine your abdomen. It will help me rule out any underlying causes for the changes you're experiencing. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Get it over with. But be gentle. And quick. I haven't got all day, you know. Don’t go poking around too much. And I expect a straight answer. No fancy medical jargon. Just tell me what's wrong and what you can do about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll do my best to be quick and thorough. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Don’t go digging around. It’s…tender there, near the middle. Not painful, exactly, just…sensitive. Always has been, a bit. Used to get knocked about a bit on the job, you see. But it's not worse than usual. Just…noticeable now. You poking around makes me aware of it, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness to palpation in the mid-abdomen, no acute pain. I'm not digging, Mr. Trendler, just trying to get a sense of the area. Do you feel any swelling or any masses when I press here?
PATIENT: No! No swelling. Nothing like that. Just… flabby. Like I said. Soft. It's… disheartening, you know? A man should have a firm belly. It's a sign of strength! Don't go looking for things that aren't there. You’re making me nervous now. Just tell me what you think it is. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. I understand your concern. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief examination, it sounds like you’re experiencing some loss of abdominal muscle tone, which can happen with age, and particularly after periods of stress or significant life changes. The tenderness you’re feeling could be from previous work injuries or simply from the muscle tone loss. It doesn’t sound like anything immediately serious, but I’d like to order a few simple blood tests to rule out any underlying causes like nutritional deficiencies or inflammation. Also, given your shortness of breath, it would be prudent to get an EKG to check your heart function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and heart tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, it’s always something with doctors. Fine. Do what you have to do. But I expect results. And I expect a plan. I don’t want to just know what’s wrong, I want it fixed. And if it’s just… getting old… I don’t know what good that does me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've ordered the blood work and the EKG. The lab results usually take a few days to come back, and we can schedule the EKG for tomorrow morning. While we wait for the results, I recommend focusing on maintaining a healthy diet—plenty of protein to support muscle mass—and gentle exercise, like walking. We can also discuss core strengthening exercises once we have the lab results. Regardless of the results, we’ll work together to create a plan that helps you feel stronger and more comfortable. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Protein and walking… Honestly. I already told you, I work hard! Walking isn’t going to fix anything. Core strengthening? Sounds like nonsense. But… fine. Do your tests. I’ll come back when you have something to tell me. Don't waste my time with talk. Just give me a solution. And make it quick.
