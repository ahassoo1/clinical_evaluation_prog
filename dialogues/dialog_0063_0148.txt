DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepbro. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have several patients scheduled, so if you could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having some discomfort… down there. In the… testicular region, as the paper says. It’s not constant, but it’s… concerning. I’m not entirely sure when it started, truthfully. Things haven’t been the clearest lately, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Testicular region?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I apologize if I’m not being very clear. It’s the… the area with the, well, the testicles. It’s a pain, a dull ache, mostly. It comes and goes. I didn’t know where else to go, and it’s been bothering me enough that I thought I should get it checked. Is that alright? I just… I’m not used to talking about these things.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepbro, with all due respect, you are a woman. Are you certain you aren’t mistaken about the location of this… discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear… You are right. That is… strange. I… I suppose I’ve been feeling so unwell lately that my thoughts haven’t been entirely… focused. Perhaps I misspoke. It’s… lower abdominal pain, then. Yes, that feels right. A dull ache, low in my abdomen. It’s on the… left side, I believe. I am so sorry for the confusion, Doctor. It’s just been a difficult time. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Lower abdominal pain. Left side. Very well. And how long have you been experiencing this discomfort, approximately?
PATIENT: Approximately… oh, that’s a hard one. A few weeks, perhaps? It comes and goes, so it’s difficult to say for certain. Maybe a month? It’s not severe, it’s just… persistent. It doesn’t really interfere with my work, but it does… bother me at night sometimes. When I’m trying to rest. I’ve been taking some over-the-counter pain relievers, but they don’t seem to do much good.
DOCTOR: Over-the-counter pain relievers, ineffective. Any fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits accompanying this pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’ve noticed. No fever, no nausea, and my… bowel habits have been normal, I think. Perhaps a little… irregular, but nothing drastic. I’m sorry, I know this isn’t very helpful. I really wish I could be more precise, but… things just feel a bit fuzzy. I do get tired easily, though. And I’ve lost a little weight, but I thought that was just from not having much of an appetite.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and weight loss… Well, Ms. Stepbro, we'll need to rule a few things out. Let's start with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll need to palpate your abdomen. And try to relax, if you can.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. Whatever you think is best. I’ll try to relax. It’s just… I don’t do well with medical examinations, if I'm being honest. Not that I’ve had many lately, but… they always make me a little anxious. Is there anything I should be doing? Or… anything I shouldn’t?
DOCTOR: Just breathe normally. And try not to tense your muscles. I’m going to press gently here, here, and along your sides. Tell me if you feel any pain, and where specifically. Hmm. Tenderness in the left lower quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. No palpable masses. Bowel sounds are present, though slightly diminished. Now, let’s listen to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I… I think I feel a little nervous, if that’s alright to say. It’s probably nothing, but… just a little anxious. I hope you don’t mind. I’m not sure what you’re looking for, and that makes it harder to relax.
DOCTOR: Normal bowel sounds, as I said. Perhaps a bit hypoactive, but not concerning at this stage. I believe we need some laboratory work to rule out any infection or inflammation. I will order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. We will also need to perform a pelvic exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Oh… Doctor, I… I wasn't expecting that. Is it… necessary? I thought we were discussing abdominal pain. I’m not sure… I haven’t had one of those in a very long time. And truthfully, I’m a bit embarrassed. Is there another way to determine what’s going on? Perhaps another type of scan? I… I don't know if I'm comfortable with that, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepbro, with all due respect, we must be thorough. Abdominal pain in a woman can have multiple origins. A pelvic exam is standard procedure to rule out gynecological causes. Unless you have a very specific medical contraindication, it is necessary. We can discuss the findings afterwards, and if they are unremarkable, we will proceed with imaging. But first, we need to eliminate potential causes. I assure you, my staff will ensure your privacy and comfort. It’s a routine examination, really.
PATIENT: Oh… Very well, Doctor. If you truly believe it’s necessary… I suppose I understand. But… please be gentle. And… could you explain what you’re doing as you go? It would help me… to relax. I just… I’m not used to these things anymore. And… I apologize for being difficult. I just… get anxious easily.
DOCTOR: Nurse, please prepare the examination table and ensure Ms. Stepbro’s comfort. I will explain the procedure as I proceed, though I assure you, it is quite straightforward. We will simply be examining your external genitalia and then performing a speculum examination to visualize the cervix and vagina. It may cause some mild discomfort, but it should not be painful. Now, if you would kindly position yourself…
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Please… just let me know when you’re ready. I’m… ready when you are. But… please be gentle. And… could you explain everything before you do it? It would… help. A lot.
