DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s this… flushing. It happens on my face, you see. And sometimes my neck. It’s been going on for… oh, maybe a month now? Not every day, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Flushing, you say. A month, alright. And it’s primarily on your face and neck?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. Sometimes a little on my chest too, but not always. It feels… warm. Like when you have a fever, but I don’t have a fever. Just the redness. It comes and goes. Hard to say what makes it happen. I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is it associated with anything in particular?
PATIENT: Associated… you mean, does something cause it? I haven’t noticed. I eat the same things, mostly. Rice, dal… sometimes chicken. Nothing new. I don't drink alcohol, never have. And I don’t smoke. Maybe… when I get upset? But I don't get upset much.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no changes in diet, no alcohol or tobacco use. You suspect it might be linked to emotional stress, though not frequently. Let's try to pinpoint this a bit better. When this flushing occurs, how long does it typically last?
PATIENT: Hmm… good question. It’s usually… not long. Maybe five, ten minutes? Sometimes less. It just… comes on, gets red, and then fades away. It doesn't hurt, just feels… noticeable, you know? Makes me a little self-conscious.
DOCTOR: Okay. And would you describe it as coming on suddenly, or gradually?
PATIENT: Suddenly. Very suddenly. One minute I'm fine, the next… red. Like someone turned on a light. It’s not a slow thing. It is quick. That’s why it’s so strange. I haven't ever had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sudden onset flushing, lasting 5-10 minutes, primarily on the face and neck, occasionally chest. No associated pain. No changes in diet or habits. Let's go through a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… not really. I had the usual childhood things, but nothing serious. When I was younger, a little high blood pressure, but it went down with… diet, I think. The doctor didn’t say much about it. And… my wife, she passed away five years ago. Cancer. But I don’t have cancer. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay. History of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, now controlled with diet. And I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been a difficult time. Any surgeries or hospitalizations I should know about?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been in the hospital except when my wife… when she was sick. I stayed with her, of course, but I wasn’t in the hospital for anything myself. Just the usual check-ups with the doctor, you know. Nothing major. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries, no hospitalizations except for supporting your wife. And you mentioned diet helped with your blood pressure. What about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… my mother, she had diabetes. And… her sister, my aunt, she had heart trouble. But that was a long time ago. And they lived in India, so… it’s hard to say. We didn’t see them much. My father, he was healthy, as far as I know. That's all I can really remember. It wasn’t something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Maternal history of diabetes and heart trouble. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to eat well and get enough rest. That’s what my wife always said. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing at all. I don’t trust them much.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, vitamins, or supplements. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I eat everything. And I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. I’m pretty simple, really. No problems with food, no problems with… anything, usually. Just this flushing.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies, no medications. Well, Mr. Withycombe, this is helpful. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I'll take a look at your skin. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just tell me if anything seems wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72, regular. Heart and lungs sound clear. Your skin… well, right now it looks normal. No visible rash or lesions. However, I can see some slight redness on your cheeks and neck, but it's very subtle. It's not as pronounced as you described during an episode. Let me ask, do you notice anything that triggers this flushing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s the thing. I’ve been trying to think of something, anything… but nothing. It just happens. Sometimes when I'm talking, sometimes when I’m just sitting. It doesn’t seem to matter. Hot weather doesn't bother it, cold weather doesn’t bother it. Spicy food doesn't bother it. I really don’t know. It's very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. Well, based on what you've told me and the exam, it could be rosacea. It often presents with intermittent flushing, though there are other possibilities. Given your lack of other symptoms, and the fact that it's not constant, that’s where I would start. However, to be certain, I’d like to order some blood work. Just a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, that’s fine. If that will help, then yes. I don’t mind. Where do I go to get that done? Is there a place nearby? I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. There's a lab just down the street at 14 Oak Avenue. I'll write you a requisition form. You can go there anytime tomorrow. The results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding anything that might irritate your skin - harsh soaps, alcohol-based products. And try to keep a diary of when these flushing episodes occur. Note anything you were doing, eating, or feeling beforehand. It might help us identify a trigger. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds very reasonable. I can do that. A diary… I’ll write down everything. And I’ll go to the lab tomorrow. Thank you. I appreciate you looking into this. It’s been worrying me a little.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I understand your concern. We'll get to the bottom of this. Once we have the blood work results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if the flushing becomes severe, or you develop any other symptoms - fever, headache, dizziness - please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. You've been very helpful. I'll go to the lab tomorrow and keep the diary. Thank you again for taking the time to listen. I feel much better knowing we're trying to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. Get some rest, and we'll talk soon. Have a good day.
