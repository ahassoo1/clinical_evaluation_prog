DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, state the reason for your visit today. And try to be concise, if you would. My schedule is… rather full.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been… well, over 48 hours now, and it’s driving me mad. Honestly, it started yesterday morning, and I thought it would go away, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Forty-eight hours of hiccups, you say. Hmm. And has anything specific triggered these… disturbances?
PATIENT: Not that I can think of! I mean, nothing out of the ordinary. I was at work, managing the bookings for the summer concerts at the park. Usual day, really. Lots of phone calls, a bit of running around… I had a glass of iced tea, maybe around eleven, but I drink that all the time. No spicy food, nothing fell on me, no sudden shocks… honestly, Doctor, it just started. It’s very strange.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are these hiccups… constant?
PATIENT: No, not constant. They come and go, but they’re… frequent. Like, every few minutes. Sometimes a little longer between them, sometimes one right after another. It’s really unpredictable, and when they do come, they're quite strong. It's exhausting, to be honest. It makes it hard to concentrate, and I have a big event to plan next week.
DOCTOR: Exhausting, yes. I understand. Have you tried any… home remedies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! Everything I could think of! Holding my breath, drinking water upside down… I even had someone scare me, which just made me jump and hiccup more. A spoonful of sugar, a bit of lemon… nothing works, Doctor. Absolutely nothing. It's just… continuing. And it's starting to worry me, to be honest. I've never had hiccups last this long before.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, prolonged hiccups, while rarely indicative of a serious underlying condition, warrant a brief investigation. Let’s proceed with a quick physical exam. I need to listen to your lungs and check your diaphragm. Please, lie back on the examination table. And try to relax, if you can. Though, frankly, I suspect it's just… nerves.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. Nerves? I hadn’t thought of that… But I suppose it's possible. Work has been a little stressful lately, with the concert planning. But I'm usually pretty good at handling stress. Alright, let's get this over with then. Where should I lie?
DOCTOR: On your back, please. Arms at your sides. And try to breathe normally… as normal as one can with this… affliction. I'll listen to your lungs first. Take a deep breath in... and out.
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. Excuse me! That was… unfortunate. Deep breath… out. Is that alright, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Breathing is… adequate. Lungs are clear. No wheezing, no crackles. Now, I'm going to press on your abdomen to check for tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay. Ooh! That’s a little… sensitive. Not painful, exactly, just… a bit uncomfortable. Sort of a dull ache, really. Is that what you’re looking for, Doctor? It's usually fine, but… that spot.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness in the right subcostal region. Interesting. Not indicative of anything significant, usually, but we must document everything. Now, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or heartburn recently?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Absolutely no nausea or vomiting. And heartburn… it happens sometimes, but not lately. I haven’t had any issues with it for a few weeks, actually. No, no nausea, no vomiting, no heartburn. Just these… persistent, irritating hiccups. It's driving me mad, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Redeye, based on this brief examination, and considering the absence of any alarming symptoms, it is most likely a benign case of prolonged hiccups. Possibly related to diaphragmatic irritation, or as I said before, simple nerves. I will order a basic blood work panel to rule out any underlying electrolyte imbalances, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… sensible, I suppose. Electrolyte imbalances? I hadn't thought of that. Will the blood work tell you what’s causing the hiccups, though? Because if it's just nerves… what can I do about them? It's really starting to interfere with my work, Doctor. The concert planning is a big responsibility, and I need to be able to think clearly.
DOCTOR: The blood work will primarily rule out potential physiological causes. It won’t necessarily pinpoint the exact cause of the hiccups, no. As for your “nerves”, Ms. Redeye, I suggest stress management techniques. Perhaps yoga, meditation, or a warm bath. And avoid excessive caffeine. Here is the requisition form for your blood work. Please take this to the lab downstairs. They are open until five. We will review the results when they come back, and then we can discuss further options, if necessary. But frankly, I suspect this will resolve on its own. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Yoga and meditation… I suppose it’s worth a try. But honestly, Doctor, if it is just nerves, I don't see how I’m going to calm down when I have a concert to plan and these hiccups won’t stop! No, I don’t think that’s all… I just… I’m worried. And I feel like you’re not taking me seriously. I’ve had hiccups before, but never like this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Redeye, I assure you, I am a qualified physician. I have assessed your condition, and while I understand your anxiety, I do not respond well to patients attempting to dictate the course of their treatment. I have ordered the necessary tests, and we will proceed from there. Now, if you have no further questions, I have other patients waiting. Please, have a good day. .
