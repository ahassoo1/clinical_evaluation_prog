DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Krok, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Radford Krok. Though, truthfully, I haven’t been called “Mr.” in quite some time. My wife, bless her heart, handles most of the…correspondence these days. It’s all rather bothersome, really. What exactly are we discussing? My memory isn’t what it once was, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. I have your chart here…and it says you’re here for a general check-up?
PATIENT: A “general check-up”? Hmm. That sounds vaguely familiar…but no, I don’t believe so. I came because…well, it’s a delicate matter. Something…leaking. Down there. It’s most undignified, and frankly, quite bothersome. Is that what this is about? I wouldn’t bother a doctor for just anything, you know. It’s simply not done.
DOCTOR: Leaking, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, leaking. A…discharge. It’s been going on for…oh, goodness, I couldn’t say exactly. A few weeks, perhaps? It stains my trousers, you see. Not a good look for a man of my standing. I used to be quite meticulous about my appearance. I ran a very respectable farm equipment repair business, you know. A family business, passed down for generations. Though, the youngsters these days…they haven't the work ethic. Do you understand what I mean? This…problem is quite disrupting.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we need to…examine you, naturally. Don't worry, it's standard procedure. Just lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: “Examine”? Good heavens. Is that absolutely necessary? It seems rather…intrusive, doesn’t it? I suppose if it’s standard…but I must insist on complete discretion. And please, be quick about it. I haven’t got all day, you know. I have a rather lovely rose garden that needs tending to. Are you quite certain there isn't a simpler way to ascertain the…cause of this unfortunate situation? Perhaps a quick look will suffice?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, I've been doing this for twenty-five years. A proper examination is always necessary. It's not a matter of preference; it's a matter of medicine. Now, if you could just…cooperate. We’ll get this over with as quickly as possible.
PATIENT: Medicine, you say? Humph. Back in my day, doctors made house calls, and a gentleman didn’t have to…subject himself to this. Very undignified. I suppose if you insist…but I must warn you, I’m not particularly flexible anymore. And do try to be gentle. This isn’t a tractor engine, you know. It’s a rather sensitive area. Honestly, the state of modern healthcare…it's appalling. Is there anyone else I can see? Perhaps a male physician?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, with all due respect, I am a qualified physician. This isn’t a social call, it’s a medical assessment. Are you here to receive treatment, or not?
PATIENT: Treatment, yes, of course, treatment. I wouldn't be wasting my time otherwise! Though, I must say, your bedside manner is…lacking. Very abrupt. Still, if it's absolutely necessary…very well. But do hurry. My wife will be expecting me for tea. And please, try not to make a mess. It stains, you see. Dreadfully difficult to get out. I do wish there was a more…civilized way to go about this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. If you could lie back, and we’ll get started. I’ll need to examine the area…carefully. Please, just try to relax. Hmm…slight erythema…some discharge present, appears serous…no noticeable masses. Skin integrity intact, mostly. Blood pressure is…140 over 90. Bit elevated. Pulse is regular. Let me have a look at your reflexes…
PATIENT: Reflexes? Goodness, this is rather thorough, isn't it? It's…uncomfortable, I must say. And please, do be gentle with the…hammer. I have sensitive skin. Are you finding anything alarming? Anything that requires…urgent attention? This is all rather distressing, you know. I haven't felt this vulnerable in decades. Honestly, I blame the water. It's been terribly different lately. Not like the water we used to get. Everything’s changed. And do hurry. Tea is getting cold.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal, thankfully. Blood pressure is a little high, but not critically so. The discharge…it could be a number of things. Prostatitis, perhaps. Or a mild infection. It's difficult to say definitively without some lab work. I'm going to order a urine analysis and a prostate-specific antigen test. That'll give us a clearer picture. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, let me see…I believe I had a rather unpleasant reaction to something once, many years ago. A rash, I think. But I can’t recall what it was. Perhaps a bee sting? Or a particularly strong rose fertilizer? My wife handles all the medications, you see. She’s very meticulous about those things. Prostatitis…that sounds…serious. Is it contagious? I wouldn’t want to…transmit anything to my wife. She's been a bit under the weather lately. And what about this PSA test? Is that…painful? Honestly, this is all rather unsettling. I just want to get to the bottom of this and return to my roses.
DOCTOR: No, it's not contagious, Mr. Krok. And the PSA test is just a blood draw – a little prick, that’s all. It’s to check for prostate cancer, as elevated levels can sometimes indicate a problem. We’re just being thorough. I’ll write you a referral to the lab. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmm. Let me see…My wife gives me something for my knees, occasionally. A little white pill. And something for my blood pressure, I suppose. Though, I can’t recall the name. She keeps a very detailed list, you see. I wouldn’t dare tamper with it. It’s all rather complicated. I believe it starts with a ‘L’…or perhaps a ‘B’? Honestly, my memory isn’t what it once was. This whole situation is terribly flustered, and I’m drawing a complete blank. She’ll know. Just ask my wife. She handles everything. It’s best to just ask my wife. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll make a note to contact your wife to obtain a medication list. Look, Mr. Krok, I’m going to order the lab tests, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids, and avoid anything that might irritate your…condition. Any questions?
PATIENT: Avoid irritation…yes, that sounds sensible. And plenty of fluids, naturally. Though, what exactly constitutes "irritation"? Spicy food? Perhaps strong tea? My wife makes a rather potent brew… And will these tests be expensive? Medicare covers…most things, I believe. But I wouldn’t want to burden the system unnecessarily. Honestly, the whole thing is rather bothersome. And what if it’s…serious? My wife would be devastated. Perhaps a second opinion? Would that be advisable?
DOCTOR: Let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's probably nothing serious. And I can provide a referral to a urologist if you insist on a second opinion, but I assure you, it's likely just a minor infection. As for irritation, avoid caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods. And yes, Medicare should cover the tests. I'll have the lab submit a pre-authorization if needed. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Caffeine…alcohol…spicy foods. Very well. I can manage that, I suppose. Though, my wife does enjoy a glass of sherry with dinner. Perhaps just a small glass? And a mild curry now and then? It's good for the digestion, you see. As for the second opinion…no, no, let’s not trouble anyone unnecessarily. You seem quite competent. Though, perhaps a written summary of our discussion? Just for my records…and my wife’s, naturally. It helps to keep things organized. And are you quite certain this isn’t contagious? I wouldn’t want to…transmit anything. My wife is very delicate.
