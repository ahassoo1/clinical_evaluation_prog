DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I’m Dr. GonzalezPerez. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let's just get straight to it. I want to get pregnant. Simple as that. My husband… well, he was my husband… and we always used protection. Now I want a baby, and I don't want any trouble getting one, if you know what I mean. I’m not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: Very well. While I understand your desire to be efficient, Ms. Villarreal, a straightforward request like this still requires some… due diligence, shall we say?
PATIENT: Due diligence? Honestly. Look, I just want to know if everything's… working, alright? I’m healthy, I eat okay… I don't smoke, barely drink. I don’t want a whole lot of tests if it doesn’t need them. Is that so much to ask? I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, while I appreciate your…directness, a comprehensive assessment is always prudent when planning a pregnancy. It's not simply about whether things are "working," as you put it. We need to establish a baseline of your overall health. Now, let's begin with a review of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Look, it was years ago. I had… appendicitis, I think? When I was a kid. And… a bad flu a couple of times. Honestly, I don’t remember all the details. It was a long time ago. My husband always handled the doctor stuff. I just showed up for the shots. Is this really necessary? I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Appendicitis, alright. And you said a couple of instances of the flu. While those are relatively minor, it's still important to document. Do you recall when you had your appendix removed, approximately?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. A really long time ago. When I was little, probably. Before… everything. Look, I can’t give you exact dates. I really don't remember. And frankly, I'm not sure why it even matters right now. I just want to know if I can have a baby! Is that too much to ask? I don’t have time for a life story.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I understand your frustration. However, the timing of previous surgeries can be relevant. We also need to discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, certain types of cancer, or genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history... My mother... she had high blood pressure, I think. And her sister had... something with her knees. Arthritis? I don’t know. Nobody really talked about it much. Honestly, it was a lot of…gossip and complaining, not actual medical details. And my father...he was healthy as a horse, always working. No problems. Look, we weren’t a family that went to the doctor a lot. It was just…not something we did. Is this going somewhere?
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure in your mother, and a knee issue, potentially arthritis, in her sister. That’s… something. Now, let’s move on to your current medications and any allergies you may have. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every now and then. And sometimes I take something for headaches, but it's… over the counter, you know? Ibuprofen, maybe? Honestly, I can't even remember the name. It’s the blue pills. And no allergies. Never had any. Look, I’m a pretty simple person. I eat, I sleep, I work. I don’t go around taking a bunch of medications. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, regarding your social history... I understand you work, but could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that even mean? I work. I go home. I watch some TV. Sometimes I meet up with friends. It's not complicated. Look, I don’t go skydiving or anything. I’m a perfectly normal person. Are you trying to find something wrong with me? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like I’m being interrogated. Just tell me if I can have a baby or not!
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I assure you, I am not attempting to find something "wrong" with you. These questions are standard procedure. We need to understand your overall health to best advise you on family planning. Now, have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: No! That's... that's why I'm here, isn't it? My husband and I… we always used protection. Always. Never. I haven't been pregnant. Look, are we getting anywhere with this or are you just going to keep asking pointless questions? I have appointments to get to, you know. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior pregnancies, as you've stated. Given your age – 43 – and the lack of a detailed medical history, I'd like to proceed with a basic physical exam and some blood work. This will allow me to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions that could affect your ability to conceive. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I don't have all day. But make it quick, alright? And please, no needles if you can help it. Honestly, I hate doctors. Just tell me what I need to do and let's get this done. I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's begin with your blood pressure, heart rate, and a quick auscultation of your lungs. Then we'll proceed with a basic abdominal exam. If you’d be so kind as to lie down on the table.
PATIENT: Fine. Just... hurry. Honestly, I don't have the patience for this. Is there anything I need to take off? I'm still wearing my good shoes.
DOCTOR: You may remove your clothing from the waist up, and I’ll provide you with a gown. It’s simply to allow for proper auscultation of your heart and lungs. We'll keep it brief, as you requested.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Just get it over with. And don't look. I haven't been to a gym in years, alright? This is embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat. Blood pressure is… 135 over 85. Slightly elevated, but not overly concerning at this time. Heart rate is regular, 78 beats per minute. Lung sounds are clear, bilateral. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpable. Overall, physical exam is within normal limits, though your blood pressure warrants monitoring. We’ll need to run some bloodwork to get a more comprehensive picture.
PATIENT: Ugh, alright. Monitoring? Bloodwork? What exactly are you looking for? Is something wrong? Look, just tell me straight. I don't want any vague answers or medical jargon, alright? I just want to know if I can have a baby or not. And how long is this bloodwork going to take? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, as I’ve explained, it's premature to assume something is wrong. The blood work will assess your hormone levels – specifically, to evaluate ovarian function – and check for any underlying conditions that could impact fertility, such as thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. It’s a standard panel. The results typically take 3-5 business days. In the meantime, I recommend you begin taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid. It is also advisable to maintain a healthy diet, engage in moderate exercise, and avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. These steps will improve your overall health and potentially enhance your chances of conception.
PATIENT: Ugh, folic acid, healthy diet... I already do that, mostly. Look, I’m not an idiot. I know basic health stuff. Fine, I'll take the vitamins. But three to five days? That’s ridiculous. I need to know sooner than that. Is there anything you can do to speed it up? Honestly, this is a waste of my time. Is that it? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Ms. Villarreal, the processing time for laboratory results is beyond my control. We rely on an external facility. I understand your frustration, however. I can note your urgency in the request, which may expedite the process slightly, but I cannot guarantee it. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms – such as heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or dizziness – please contact the office immediately. I’ll also provide you with a referral to a specialist in reproductive endocrinology, should you wish to pursue more advanced fertility testing or treatment options. We will schedule a follow up appointment once the results are available. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
PATIENT: Ugh, a specialist? Look, I just want a baby, not a whole medical investigation! Fine, put the specialist’s number on the paper. I'll look into it. And just… hurry with the results, alright? Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. This is all so much more complicated than I thought. No, that's it. Just give me the paper and let me go. I have things to do. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Villarreal. I’ll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day.
