DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um, well, it's about my bruising. It's been getting worse, even though I'm already on blood thinners. It's just... more than usual, you know? I'm a little worried about it.
DOCTOR: Right, bruising that's getting worse despite being on blood thinners… that definitely warrants a look. Hmm. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It started maybe a week ago, just little ones on my arms. I figured, okay, normal, I bump into things. But then they started appearing on my legs, and they’re bigger now. And they just…don't seem to be going away. I haven't changed anything about how I take my medicine, or anything like that. I’m pretty careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, starting on the arms, now on the legs…and they're persisting despite the medication. And you haven’t changed anything with how you take your blood thinner?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing. Same dose, same time every day. I set an alarm, actually, 'cause I'm real good at forgetting things except details like that, haha. It’s the same pills, same everything.
DOCTOR: Right, good you have a routine. That’s helpful. And you mentioned the bruising doesn’t seem to be going away… is it painful at all, or is it more of a cosmetic concern?
PATIENT: Not really painful, no. More…tender, if I press on it. But not like, ouch, I hurt myself pain. It's just... unsettling, you know? And it's spreading. I tripped yesterday, barely even a bump, and I already see a new spot forming on my thigh.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Tender to the touch, spreading even with minor trauma… let's do a quick exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, sure. That sounds good. I just…hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just feeling around, checking the size and firmness of the bruising. I see some discoloration on both arms and legs, as you mentioned. The bruising feels… somewhat firm. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No fever, no dizziness. I’ve been a little tired, but honestly, who isn't? My appetite's normal. I haven't noticed any bleeding from my gums or anything like that. Oh! Actually… maybe a few more headaches than usual, but nothing major, just a little throbbing sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, dizziness, appetite is good, no unusual bleeding… slightly more headaches than usual. That’s helpful. Now, do you recall any recent illnesses, infections, or changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Not really. No illnesses, no infections. My diet's pretty much the same as always. Lots of fruit, veggies, fish… I try to eat healthy. I did start taking a new vitamin a couple of weeks ago, a B12 supplement, 'cause my doctor said my levels were a little low. But that's the only change.
DOCTOR: Right, a new B12 supplement… okay. And just to confirm, who prescribed the blood thinner, and what are you taking exactly?
PATIENT: My regular doctor, Dr. Patel, prescribed it. It’s… uh… let me see… Warfarin, 5 milligrams. One pill every evening. I’ve been on it for about two years now, since my heart thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin 5mg, prescribed by Dr. Patel, for about two years. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. No food allergies, no drug allergies… nothing. I've always been pretty lucky that way, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just one last thing for now… can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mom had high blood pressure, and my grandpa on my dad's side had diabetes. Nothing else really that I know of. My family isn’t really the type to talk about medical stuff, you know? It’s…a Tongan thing. We just kinda deal with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure and diabetes. Thank you. Alright, Courtnye. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, it’s a bit concerning that you’re bruising more easily despite being on Warfarin. We need to investigate this further to rule out anything serious. I'm going to order some blood work. It will check your Warfarin levels, your complete blood count, and some other things to see if we can pinpoint the cause of the bruising. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Blood work, okay. No, not really. Sounds… sensible. Will that tell us if the new vitamin is messing with the medicine?
DOCTOR: Yes, it will give us some clues. The blood work can help us determine if the B12 supplement is interacting with your Warfarin, or if there’s another reason for the increased bruising. We'll also check your liver and kidney function, just to be thorough. I’ll have the lab draw a few vials of blood, and the results should be back in a couple of days. I will call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if you notice any significant bleeding – like nosebleeds that won’t stop, blood in your urine or stool, or heavy bleeding from a cut – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I understand. Significant bleeding, go to the ER. I'll remember that. A couple of days for the results… alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you looking into this.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. I want to rule everything out to ensure your safety. We'll get to the bottom of this. Let me give you a lab requisition form and instructions. The lab is just down the hall on your left. After the blood work, you can go home and rest. If you have any questions at all before I call with the results, don't hesitate to call the clinic.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will. I think that’s everything, right? I just… hope it’s not something too serious.
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: That’s right. Just the blood work for now. And try not to worry too much, we’re being proactive. Have a good day, Courtnye.
