DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Look, I just... well, my wife thought it would be a good idea. A check-up, she said. Specifically, an HIV test. Honestly, I think it's a bit ridiculous, but here I am. I don’t really need a test, but she worries, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Belan. It’s always good to be proactive about one’s health, and it’s considerate of your wife to encourage that. Even without specific concerns, routine check-ups can be helpful. And of course, testing for HIV is a very common and sensible precaution. To be thorough, though, I do need to ask a few questions. It helps me understand your overall health picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Questions. Fine. Just... don't expect me to go into too much detail. I lead a perfectly normal life, you know. And I assure you, I haven’t been... gallivanting. It's just a formality, I suppose. Get it over with, then. What do you need to know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Belan. I appreciate your candor. We’ll keep it as brief as possible. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any illnesses or conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... nothing major. When I was a boy, I had the usual childhood things – measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. Nothing that required any serious treatment. A bit of the flu here and there, but who doesn’t get the flu? I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree – a very foolish thing, I admit. Honestly, that’s about it. I'm a healthy man. Always have been. Always will be. Do you write all this down? It seems a bit… excessive for a simple check-up.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do document everything, Mr. Belan. It’s important for a complete medical record. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Never. I've never had to go under the knife. I pride myself on taking care of myself. Good diet, regular exercise… well, regular enough. No need for drastic measures like surgery. Honestly, the thought of it… quite unpleasant. Are we nearly done with these questions yet? It feels like an interrogation.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Mr. Belan. Just a few more questions to get a complete picture. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Significant? What constitutes 'significant'? My grandmother... she had a bad cough for a while. Old age, mostly. My uncle, he had high blood pressure, I think. But that's just… what old people get, isn't it? My mother was fine, perfectly healthy. My father... he worked very hard, mostly. I suppose he got a bit tired. Look, my family is a hardy bunch. We don't really do illness. It's just not… respectable. Is this going somewhere? I’m starting to feel a bit uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Belan. It’s helpful to know even seemingly minor details. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Really? Are you implying something, Doctor? I am a respectable married man! I might have a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally – a very small glass, mind you – but that’s for enjoyment, not… whatever it is you're suggesting. Smoke? Heavens, no. Drugs? Absolutely not! I have never, and will never, partake in such… vulgar activities. Honestly, this is quite insulting. Are you asking everyone these questions, or just me? I find this line of questioning rather inappropriate.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions have offended you, Mr. Belan. I assure you, I ask these questions of all my patients as part of a routine medical assessment. It helps me understand potential risk factors and provide the best possible care. It’s not a judgment, simply information gathering. Now, before we proceed further, are you allergic to any medications or substances?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. As if I would need medication. But, alright. No. No allergies. Never had one in my life. I've always been rather… robust, as I've mentioned. Dust, perhaps, a little bit. But nothing serious. Certainly not any of those… pharmaceutical concoctions. Are you absolutely sure you need to ask me all of this? It feels like you are looking for something that isn't there. I came here for a test, not an inquisition. Let’s just get on with it, shall we? The sooner I'm out of here, the better.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. We can proceed with the HIV test as requested. Before we do, I want to briefly explain the testing process and what a positive or negative result would mean. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Explain it quickly, then. I haven't got all day. I already know what HIV is, you know. My wife certainly made sure of that. Just tell me what happens, and how long it will take. And please, no overly graphic details. I really don't want to dwell on… unpleasantness. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The test involves a simple blood draw. We’ll take a small sample, and it will be sent to the lab for analysis. It typically takes about a week to get the results back. A negative result means you haven’t been infected with HIV. A positive result means antibodies to the virus were detected, indicating infection. If that were to occur, we would discuss further testing to confirm the result and then explore treatment options. Would you like me to explain the different stages of HIV infection?
PATIENT: No, no, no. Absolutely not. I do not need a lecture on the stages of a disease I don't have. I understand the basics. Positive means bad, negative means good. That’s enough detail for me, thank you very much. Just take the blood, tell me the result, and let me get on with my life. Honestly, I’m starting to regret agreeing to this whole thing. It’s all very… unsettling. Just… proceed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. I understand your apprehension. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It will be just a quick prick, and then we'll have you on your way. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely none. Just… get it over with. And please, tell the nurse to be gentle. I don’t like needles. Honestly, the whole thing is ridiculous. A waste of time and perfectly good money, if you ask me. But my wife… well, you know. Just hurry up. I have things to do. .
