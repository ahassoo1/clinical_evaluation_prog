DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Honestly? Just need some papers signed. Some forms for… well, for things. They said I needed a notary to verify them, and this is where they told me to come. I hope that makes sense. I just want to get it over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. We do provide notarization services here. Just to be clear, are these forms related to any specific medical condition or benefit application?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, they are health forms. I’m applying for… something. It’s a little complicated. I honestly don't remember the name of the program. Something about help with costs, I think. I haven’t got the best memory these days, you see. It's for getting a little assistance, that’s all. And they need it official, with a signature and everything. Do you need a copy of what I’m talking about?
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. Yes, if you could provide me with the forms, that would be helpful. That way I can see exactly what's required. Even though it’s primarily a notarization request, I always like to quickly glance over them, just to ensure everything is in order and to see if there's anything I can assist you with beyond the signature. It's no trouble at all.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, here they are. Sorry for the mess. I keep everything in here! Here you go. They're probably a bit wrinkled, I’ve been carrying them around for a week now. I hope you can read them. It's mostly just boxes to check and things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Melvenia. These are… application forms for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program – LIHEAP, it seems. And some documentation for potential Medicaid eligibility. It looks like you’ve already filled out a good portion of them. I see a section here asking about any current medical conditions. Are you currently being treated for anything in particular?
PATIENT: Oh! LIHEAP… yes, that’s it! And Medicaid… right. See? I knew it was something like that. No, not really treated for anything. I've got the usual aches and pains for someone my age, but nothing a little rest doesn't fix. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, that’s why I have these glasses. But I don’t go to the doctor regularly. Mostly just try to take care of myself. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Melvenia. It’s helpful to have a general picture of your health. Just to be thorough, and since you're applying for Medicaid, could you tell me if you have any chronic conditions like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. My mother had that, but I’ve never been told I do. Heart problems… not that I know of. My doctor years ago said my blood pressure was a little high once, but he said it wasn’t anything to worry about. Honestly, it was so long ago I barely remember. I really haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I'm not insured, you see, and it’s expensive. Is this important for the signing? I just want to get these forms done.
DOCTOR: I understand, Melvenia. It is good to know about these things, even if it was a while ago. It helps us provide more informed care, should you need it in the future. Since you mentioned a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, it would be prudent to take a quick reading just to get a baseline. It's a simple procedure, and it will give us a better understanding of your current health status. It won’t delay the signing of your forms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If it’s really quick, and it won’t hold things up… yes, okay. But please, don't make a big deal of it. I get nervous at the doctor, even for something small. Just… get it over with, if you can. I just want these papers signed.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. It will be very quick and painless, I promise. No need to worry. Just relax your arm for me, please. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 88. While not critically high, it would be beneficial to monitor it and discuss potential lifestyle changes or further evaluation. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to talk about that if you’d like. For now, though, let’s proceed with the notarization. Do you have a valid photo ID with you?
PATIENT: Oh. That is high, isn’t it? I knew I shouldn’t have had that extra cup of coffee this morning. No, I don’t think I need a follow-up right now. I'll just try to… relax more, I guess. Here’s my driver's license. It's still current, I think. I renewed it last year. Please, hurry, if you don’t mind. I have things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Melvenia. Everything looks in order. Just if you could sign here and here, and initial each of these boxes. Take your time. And please let me know if you have any questions.
PATIENT: There… is that everything? I hope I did it right. It's been a long time since I've had to sign so many things. .
DOCTOR: Excellent, Melvenia. Everything looks perfect. These are now officially notarized. I’ll make a copy for our records and return the originals to you. Before you go, I do want to reiterate my suggestion to follow up on your blood pressure. We have financial assistance programs available that can help cover the cost of a visit and any necessary medications. Would you like me to provide you with information about those programs?
