DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be honest, it's my speech. It’s… been a bit off, lately. Sort of slurred, you see. I don't really know when it started, exactly. It just… happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, slurred speech. That’s definitely something we want to look into. When you say “happened,” can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm… it wasn’t sudden, not like a switch flipped. It was… gradual, I suppose. Maybe over the past few weeks? It's hard to pinpoint. I just noticed things weren't coming out as clearly as they used to, and my husband, he pointed it out too. He said I sounded… muffled, sometimes. I really don't remember anything specific causing it, though. Nothing I can think of, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over a few weeks, noticed by both you and your husband. That’s helpful. And you haven’t had any recent injuries, illnesses, or anything particularly stressful happen around the time you started noticing this?
PATIENT: No, not that I can recall, Doctor. Everything’s been… fairly routine, actually. Work’s been the same – construction management, you know. It can be a bit demanding, but nothing out of the ordinary. No falls, no sickness… Just the usual day-to-day. I'm married, and we haven't had any… big changes or anything. Honestly, I wish I could be more specific, but it’s all a bit hazy. I do apologize for not being more helpful. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Adyn. It's perfectly normal to not have a clear recollection of when something started. We’ll figure it out together. You mentioned construction management – does that involve a lot of physical labor or exposure to dust or fumes?
PATIENT: It’s mostly overseeing things, Doctor – making sure projects are on schedule, coordinating with the crews. I do spend time on the sites, of course. There's a bit of walking, and yes, plenty of dust and fumes, I suppose. Concrete dust, paint, things like that. We usually have masks, but… sometimes they're not the most comfortable, so people don't wear them as much as they should. I wouldn't say I'm constantly exposed, but it’s definitely part of the job. Does that make a difference?
DOCTOR: It absolutely can make a difference. Exposure to those kinds of things is something we'll need to consider. Now, beyond the slurred speech, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. Maybe a little bit of… tiredness, lately. But work is tiring, so I just assumed it was that. No headaches, no dizziness… my vision seems fine. I haven’t had any trouble swallowing or anything like that. No weakness in my arms or legs. Honestly, it’s mostly just the speech. It's just… concerning, you know? It's a little frightening, to be honest, not knowing what's going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Adyn. It’s good that you're being proactive and getting it checked out. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your cranial nerves, reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we can talk about possible next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I'll do my best to cooperate. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, first I’m just going to feel around your neck, checking for any swelling. This is just a routine part of the exam. Now, I'm going to check your eyes – I’ll ask you to follow my finger without moving your head. And then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your cranial nerves are mostly intact, though I did note some slight weakness on the left side of your face when you smiled. Not significant, but something we’ll keep an eye on. Your reflexes are normal. Now, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that’s concerning. I didn’t notice anything myself. Let me see… I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I've never been diagnosed with anything major, Doctor. No diabetes, no heart problems, no stroke… I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, but that’s about it. I'm on Medicare, as you can see from the paperwork. My husband handles most of the medical stuff, to be honest. He’s quite organized. I'm sorry I can't be more specific. I really don’t keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Adyn. Medicare is helpful. And it’s good that you have a supportive husband. We can always get information from his records if needed. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I don't take anything regularly, Doctor. Nothing for blood pressure, cholesterol, or anything like that. Sometimes I take over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches, but that's it. Just ibuprofen or something similar. And occasionally, if I have trouble sleeping, I'll take a melatonin tablet. But it's very infrequent. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important to know everything you’re taking, even over-the-counter medications, as they can sometimes interact or have side effects. Good, that’s helpful. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods, no problems there. I haven't had any bad reactions to medications either. I’ve had penicillin before, no issues. No allergies to pollen, dust, or anything like that. I really think I'm pretty allergy-free, actually. My husband always says I’m too stoic to be allergic to anything!
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a tough one, Doctor. My parents are both… well, they’ve both passed away now. My mother died of a heart attack when she was fairly young, I think. And my father… he had some kind of cancer, but I don’t remember the specifics. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very involved with his medical care. I have a brother, and he’s perfectly healthy as far as I know. We don’t really talk much about medical stuff. I wish I could be more helpful, but I don't have a lot of information.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Adyn. You've given me a lot of good information. It's common to not have a full family medical history. Now, just a few more questions about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I've never smoked a day in my life. My parents were both smokers, and I saw what it did to them, so I stayed well clear. It certainly wasn't a good example to set, but it was a very effective deterrent!
DOCTOR: Good. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally, Doctor. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, especially on weekends. Nothing excessive, I assure you. My husband and I might share a bottle on special occasions, but that’s about it. It’s certainly not a regular habit. I wouldn't say I'm a drinker, not at all. Just a social glass now and then. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: It is. It helps me get a full picture. And finally, do you work with asbestos or any other hazardous materials, besides the dust we discussed?
PATIENT: Asbestos… hmm. No, not directly. At the construction sites, we sometimes have to deal with older buildings, but I don’t handle the asbestos removal myself. That's always done by a specialized team, you see. I oversee the project, but I don’t get directly involved with the hazardous materials. Just the dust and fumes, like we discussed earlier. I make sure everyone is wearing the proper protective equipment, but… well, not everyone always complies. Is that what you’re concerned about?
DOCTOR: Yes, the dust and fumes are definitely something to consider. Alright, Adyn. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be something neurological, although the weakness is subtle. It could also be related to your work environment. We need to rule out some serious things. I’m going to order an MRI of your brain to get a better look. I’m also going to order some blood work to check for inflammation and other potential issues. And, I’m going to refer you to a neurologist for a consultation. Would you be alright with that?
PATIENT: An MRI… a neurologist… Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes, absolutely. I want to get to the bottom of this. It’s just… a bit frightening, to be honest. But I trust your judgment. How long will it take to get the results? And what does this all mean? I apologize if I’m being a bit… anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Adyn. It’s good that we're getting this checked out. The MRI results usually take a few days to come back – I'd say 3-5 business days. The blood work should be faster, maybe a couple of days. I'm not going to jump to any conclusions until we have the results. The MRI will help us rule out things like a stroke, tumor, or multiple sclerosis. The neurologist will be able to do a more thorough neurological exam and help us pinpoint the cause of your symptoms. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. We'll discuss the results as soon as I have them. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… not at the moment, Doctor. I think I just need to process everything. Will this affect my work? I have responsibilities, you see. And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime, besides resting? Anything at all? I apologize for all the questions, but I'm just… a bit worried, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be worried, and you’re not bothering me at all. It’s my job to answer your questions. Regarding your work, I wouldn't recommend strenuous physical activity until we have the results of the MRI. Depending on the results, we may need to discuss temporary modifications or restrictions. As for what you can do in the meantime, just focus on getting rest and staying hydrated. If you notice any worsening of your symptoms – like increased slurred speech, weakness, dizziness, or headaches – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'm going to have my nurse schedule you for the MRI and the neurology appointment. She’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for the MRI. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… hmm. No, not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had an MRI before, so I don’t think I’ve ever been exposed to it. My husband usually handles all the medical details, you see. I apologize for not knowing. Is it something I should be particularly worried about?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Adyn. It's good to know. A mild allergic reaction to contrast dye is possible, but it’s rare. The radiology department will ask you some questions before the scan to assess your risk. Alright, I think that covers everything for today. I’m going to write up a summary of our conversation and the orders for the MRI and neurology appointment. My nurse will be with you shortly to schedule those and give you any additional instructions. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your time and your patience. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns. I suppose I'll just wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
