DOCTOR: Hi Carmaleta, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Look, I don’t really have a lot of time, to be honest. It's about having a baby. I want to make sure everything works before I even try, you know? My husband… well, he passed, and I don’t want any surprises if I decide to… move forward. I'm 43, so things probably aren't as simple as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You want to assess your fertility before trying to conceive, and you're mindful of your age. That's very responsible of you. We can definitely do that. First, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history… Honestly, it was a while ago. Yes, I was pregnant once. It… didn’t go well. Very sad. I don’t really like to talk about it. It was a long time ago, and I’d rather not get into the details. Is that okay? It was… complicated. Just assume everything was normal before that, if you can.
DOCTOR: Okay, I completely understand. No pressure to share anything you're not comfortable with. We can definitely proceed without going into specifics about that pregnancy. So, assuming everything was normal before then, are you currently on any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… Oh! Just a blood pressure thing. The doctor prescribed it a few years back, after my husband… never mind. It's a small pill, once a day. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. Why does that even matter?
DOCTOR: It matters because some medications can affect fertility or a pregnancy. What’s the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Ugh, names… I never remember names. Let me see… It’s… a white pill. Small. I pick it up every month from the pharmacy. Honestly, I just tell them my name and they give it to me. I don't bother looking at the label. Is there a way you can just… look it up or something? I really don’t want to spend all day trying to recall pill names.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s see if we can find it in your record. Just a moment… Ah, yes, it looks like you're taking Lisinopril 20mg daily. That’s good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I mean, I don’t think so. I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes with dust, but that’s just normal, isn’t it? Nothing serious. I ate shellfish once and my throat felt a little itchy, but I ate a lot of it! Maybe it was just… too much shellfish. It wasn't like a full-blown reaction. Honestly, I don't worry about allergies much. People make too much fuss these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known severe allergies. That’s good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your cycle. When was your last menstrual period?
PATIENT: Ugh, that question. Honestly, it’s… irregular. Very irregular. It’s been a while since it was… predictable. I don’t really keep track, to be honest. It comes when it comes. It’s not like I’m planning anything, you know? I just assume it’ll happen eventually. Why is that important? It's not like I need to plan a party around it.
DOCTOR: Okay, irregular cycles are common, especially as we get older. It's important to know because it gives us clues about how your body is functioning. We might need to do some blood tests to check your hormone levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, lovely. More poking and prodding. Fine, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have things to do, you know. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And tell me what you're looking for, so I'm not sitting here wondering what you’re up to. Honestly, doctors love making a big deal out of nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. We'll try to be as quick as possible. We'll be checking your hormone levels – things like FSH, LH, estrogen, and progesterone – to see how your ovaries are functioning. We’ll also check a basic metabolic panel and complete blood count just to get a general picture of your health. Before we do that, just a quick check - are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Do I have to answer that? It's very personal. Look, let’s just say I’m… not actively looking. It’s not relevant, is it? I came here to see if I can get pregnant, not to discuss my… personal life. I’m a widow. Is that enough information? Honestly, doctors always ask the most awkward questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, I apologize if that was too personal. It helps us understand the overall picture and rule out any potential issues. No problem at all. Alright. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I just want to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic abdominal exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. Quickly, please. I have a… a lunch appointment. A very important lunch. Honestly, I don't understand why I have to be poked and prodded for everything. I just want to know if I can have a baby, not a full medical workup! Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated but not alarming. Heart and lungs sound clear. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. No obvious abnormalities. Now, I'd like to order those blood tests. Would you be comfortable giving a sample today?
PATIENT: Ugh, more samples? Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a science experiment. Fine, whatever. Just tell me where to go. The quicker this is over, the better. Is there anything else I need to do? Honestly, I'm wasting my entire afternoon here. I had plans, you know. Important plans! Just… point me to the lab, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, the lab is just down the hall, first door on the left. They'll need a urine and blood sample. I've already sent the order electronically, so just tell them your name and date of birth. Once you've given your samples, we can discuss the results in a few days. I'll have my nurse call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can answer for you before you go?
PATIENT: No, no. Just… get it over with. Honestly, I'm done here. I need a cup of tea. And a very long nap. Tell your nurse to call me quickly. Don't make me wait around. Honestly, I have a life, you know? Just… thank you. I suppose. Now, if you'll excuse me. .
