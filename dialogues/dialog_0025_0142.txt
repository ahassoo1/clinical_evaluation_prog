DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Lawther, have a seat. So, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi. Right, well… it's my head, mostly. I get these headaches. Really bad ones. And… I sweat a lot when they happen. My heart races too, feels like it's gonna jump outta my chest. It's been goin' on for a while now, on and off. Honestly, I don’t really keep track of when, exactly. Just… happens.
DOCTOR: “On and off” isn’t terribly helpful, Mr. Lawther. We need some kind of timeline to figure out what’s going on. But alright. Let’s try this. When you say “bad,” can you describe the headache?
PATIENT: Yeah, I get that. Sorry, I'm not great with dates or anything. It’s just… they come and go. Bad… hmm. It’s like… a really tight band around my head, kinda. And it feels like… pressure, buildin' up. It’s not like a throbbing pain, not usually. More… squeezing. And it gets worse if I move around too much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Squeezing… alright. And you said it worsens with movement. Is it consistently worsened, or does it depend on what kind of movement?
PATIENT: Uh… good question. I think… yeah, it's worse with bigger movements. Like, walkin' up stairs is awful. Or bendin' over. Just normal walkin' isn't usually too bad, unless I'm already feelin' it startin' up. Then even that gets tough. It's hard to explain, really. It’s like… the more I do, the more it hurts, y’know? I don't really push myself when I feel one comin’ on, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright, escalating pain with exertion… that's something. Now, you mentioned sweating and a racing heart. Do those always happen with the headache, or are they separate sometimes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Usually, yeah, they happen at the same time. The sweating starts kinda before the headache gets really bad, like a warnin'. And the heart thing… that really kicks in when the headache's at its worst. But… I think I've had a headache or two where it was just the head pain, nothin’ else. But I'm really not sure. It was a long time ago, maybe. Honestly, it’s all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Blurry is… not ideal, Mr. Lawther. We need to try and be precise. Let’s move on. Any nausea or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: Nausea… sometimes. Not every time, but yeah. It’s kinda a queasy feeling, mostly. Like I might be sick, but I haven’t actually thrown up. Not that I remember, anyway. It doesn’t last long, usually. Just feels a bit off, like somethin’s not right in my stomach. It's usually when the headache's really bad, if that makes sense. I tend to just lie down when it gets like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you sensitive to light or sound when these headaches occur?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, definitely. Light is… bad. Really bad. I usually have to close the curtains, turn off the lights, the whole thing. And loud noises… ugh, they make it so much worse. Like a hammer poundin' in my head. That's why I usually just lie in a dark, quiet room when it happens. I don't really like bein' around people when I've got one of these comin’ on.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you experienced any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. That's a tough one. Not that I've noticed, really. I haven't been to the eye doctor in… well, a long time. Maybe things are a bit blurry sometimes, but I just figured it was from lookin' at screens all day. I work with… stuff, you know? Production work. Not lookin' at tiny things or anything, just… general stuff. I don’t really think it’s related, to be honest. I can see okay, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history. Any prior illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Uh… not much, really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, had surgery to fix it. But that was ages ago. And… I get colds sometimes, like everyone else. Nothing serious. I haven't really been sick with anything major. I just… I don’t really go to the doctor much, if I can avoid it. I usually just try to sleep it off. It usually goes away on its own.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mum… she got migraines a lot when she was younger, I think. Bad ones. She used to lie in a dark room for days sometimes. My dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. But other than that… nothin' I can really remember. We didn't really talk about health stuff much, if I'm honest. It wasn't really a thing. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Migraines in the mother… alright. Do you know if anyone else in your family had similar headaches?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of, no. My siblings… they get regular headaches sometimes, but not like these. Not with the sweating and the heart thing. Just… normal headaches, like from stress or not gettin' enough sleep. Nothin' serious. I’m the only one who gets these really bad ones, as far as I know. It’s kinda scary, to be honest. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… what does that even mean? Oh, you mean… like, my life? Well, I’m divorced. That was… a while ago now. I don’t really… go out much. I work, I come home, I sleep. Not much else. I don’t drink or smoke. Never really liked it. I used to… hang out with friends sometimes, but not anymore. It’s just easier this way, to be honest. Less complicated.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ at all. I don’t like takin' pills, if I can avoid it. Never really seen the point. I just try to tough it out. I haven’t even taken anything for these headaches, honestly. Just… lie in a dark room and wait for it to pass. I know it’s probably not the best way to deal with it, but… I haven’t really found anything that helps anyway. And I don't really have insurance, so… it's not like I can just go to the doctor whenever I feel sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. We're going to do a quick physical exam. Please step onto the scale and I'll take your blood pressure and pulse. Then we can discuss this further.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, sure. Sounds good. I hope it's not too bad. I get a bit nervous around doctors, if I'm honest. Not a fan of needles or anything.
DOCTOR: 73 kilograms… and 196 centimeters. Alright. Blood pressure is 142/90. Pulse is 88 and regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are normal, but a bit fast. No tenderness to palpation. Neurological exam is grossly intact, but I’ll need to do further testing. These readings are… concerning. Your blood pressure is elevated. And the fact that your heart rate is elevated even when you're not exerting yourself is something we need to investigate.
PATIENT: Elevated? Oh. That doesn’t sound good. What does that mean? I just thought it was… my heart racin' when the headaches come on. Is that… bad? I feel kinda dizzy now, if I’m honest. Maybe it's the nerves. What kind of testing do you mean? Like, needles and stuff?
DOCTOR: It means we need to rule out some serious possibilities, Mr. Lawther. Elevated blood pressure can lead to… complications. And a consistently elevated heart rate suggests something more than just anxiety. No, I'm not going to jump to conclusions. But we need to do some blood work to check your electrolytes, kidney function, thyroid levels, and rule out any underlying infections. We will also order an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Yes, it will involve a needle, but it's a quick and relatively painless procedure. I'm also concerned about the headaches themselves. Given your symptoms and the elevated blood pressure, we need to consider the possibility of a secondary headache disorder.
PATIENT: Secondary… what? That sounds scary. Kidney stuff and… thyroid? I don't even know what that is. And an… EKG? Is that where you put the sticky things on your chest? I really don’t like needles. And all this talk about complications… is it serious? What kind of complications? I just want the headaches to stop, I don’t want… whatever this is. Is it gonna cost a lot of money? I told you, I don’t have insurance.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, I understand your anxiety, but you need to calm down. “Secondary headache” simply means the headache is a symptom of another underlying medical condition, not a problem with your head itself. The blood work and EKG are necessary to rule out those conditions. The cost… is a problem, I admit. We can discuss options for payment assistance, but delaying treatment could have serious consequences. As for the complications… elevated blood pressure can lead to heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and other life-threatening conditions. We need to identify the cause of your headaches and address it promptly. Look, I’m going to order the blood work and EKG. I'll also give you a referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation. And I strongly recommend you find a way to afford this treatment. Your health is at stake. I will also send you home with instructions for monitoring your blood pressure at home and a list of resources for financial assistance. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No… no allergies that I know of. None. I… I haven’t taken anything in years. So, you're saying it could be… serious? Like, really serious? I just… I don’t have a lot of money. And I don’t have anyone to help me with this. My ex-wife… well, that didn't end well. And my family… they’re not really around. What if… what if it's something bad? Can't you just give me something for the headaches? Something to make them stop? Without all this… this stuff?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, I understand your concerns, but simply masking the symptoms is not a solution. It's like putting a bandage on a broken bone. The underlying problem will continue to worsen, potentially leading to irreversible damage. I cannot ethically prescribe medication without a proper diagnosis. Furthermore, given your elevated blood pressure, it would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous to do so. You need to have the blood work and EKG done. It’s non-negotiable. I will have my staff assist you with finding resources for affordable testing. And I will write a referral to a cardiologist. I strongly urge you to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. I'm documenting all of this in your chart. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. Blood work… EKG… cardiologist… Fine. Do what you have to do. Just… please hurry. I don’t want to be sick. Can I… can I go now? I need to… think.
DOCTOR: My staff will provide you with the necessary paperwork and instructions. Please schedule the tests as soon as possible. And remember, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. .
PATIENT: .
