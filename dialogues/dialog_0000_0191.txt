DOCTOR: Right. Tierney Shaub, 64. Not insured, which… explains some things. Well. Let’s get down to business. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor Batara. Thank you for seeing me. I… I requested to be tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, really. I just… wanted to know my status.
DOCTOR: HIV testing. Of course. And what prompted this… desire to know your status now, after all this time?
PATIENT: Well, it's a bit difficult to talk about, honestly. My husband… he passed away last month. Unexpectedly. And… we had a long marriage. A very long marriage. And after everything, I just… I want to be sure. For my peace of mind, and… for my family. It’s probably silly, waiting this long, but… it feels important now.
DOCTOR: Unexpected passing… right. And were you both… exclusive during your marriage?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely. We were very devoted to each other. We didn’t… well, neither of us had been with anyone else, not that I know of. We met young and… stayed together. It’s just… you hear things, don’t you? And with everything happening, it’s just… better to be certain, I think. It’s a lot to process already, and uncertainty just makes it harder.
DOCTOR: "You hear things." Yes, people do. And it's good you're being… cautious. Though, frankly, at your age and with a long, stable marriage… the risk is minimal. Still. We’ll do the test. Have you ever been tested before?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Never. It… it wasn’t something we talked about, honestly. Back then, it wasn’t… as common a concern, I suppose. And, as I said, we were… exclusive. But now… I just want to be absolutely sure. I suppose it sounds foolish, given the circumstances, but… better safe than sorry, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Foolish is a strong word. Just… pragmatic. Alright. We’ll do a standard blood draw. It’s a simple procedure. I’ll also need to ask a few questions – some rather personal ones, I’m afraid. It’s standard protocol, don’t take it personally. Do you have any allergies to latex or other medical materials?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve had vaccinations over the years, and haven't had a reaction. Nothing comes to mind. I suppose I’ve been quite fortunate, health-wise, up until recently. This… this is all a bit new, if you understand. A bit overwhelming. Are these questions… about my history, then?
DOCTOR: Precisely. Your medical history, your… lifestyle. Nothing escapes the forms, unfortunately. Let’s start with medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. I haven't needed anything regularly. Just over-the-counter pain relievers from time to time for aches and pains, but nothing prescribed by a doctor. Just… the usual things for someone my age, I suppose. I try to stay active, you see, and mostly I’m alright. It's… it's been a difficult few weeks, naturally. Everything feels a little… different now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any history of sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, absolutely not. As I said, my husband and I… we were faithful to each other. It’s… it's a little upsetting to even be asked, to be honest. I understand it’s protocol, but… it feels like you’re implying something. Perhaps that was unkind of me to say. I'm just… a little sensitive right now. It’s all rather stressful.
DOCTOR: I’m merely covering all bases. It’s my job, Mrs. Shaub. No implication intended. Let’s move on. Do you use intravenous drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I’ve never used drugs in my life. I… I find the line of questioning a little… intrusive, to be honest. I understand you have a job to do, but… it feels as though you don't believe me when I say we lived a quiet, faithful life. Is there something I can do to reassure you? Perhaps a letter from my general practitioner? I just… want to get this test done and put my mind at ease, not feel as though I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Very well, very well. I simply need to exclude possibilities. It's called due diligence. A letter from your general practitioner is… unnecessary. Let’s just finish the questionnaire. Have you ever received a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A long time ago, actually. When I was giving birth to my daughter, almost forty years ago. It was… a complicated delivery, and I needed a transfusion. Other than that, no. That was the only time. I don't recall any issues with it at the time. Everything went well, thankfully. It’s… a little strange remembering all these things now, under these circumstances. Everything feels so… different.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I have high blood pressure. It’s been managed with diet and exercise for many years, mostly. My doctor keeps an eye on it, and it’s usually stable. But… it does run in my family, so I have to be careful. Other than that… just the aches and pains you’d expect at my age. Nothing serious, really. I try to stay as active as possible, despite everything. It helps with the… the grief, you see.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no. I’ve never smoked. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but that's it. I’ve always believed in moderation, you see. It’s better for your health, and… well, my husband didn’t care much for drinking, so I didn’t want to do it in front of him. It’s a habit, really. A good habit, I think. It’s just… everything feels so strange now. It's hard to concentrate on these questions. It feels like a lifetime ago.
