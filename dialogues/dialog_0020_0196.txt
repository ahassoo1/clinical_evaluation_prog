DOCTOR: Good morning, Janie. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Beinborn, right? Well, honestly… I’m just… tired. Really tired. It’s been going on for a while now, I think. It’s hard to say exactly how long. Everything feels a bit blurry these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, “really tired” and it’s been going on for a while. You said everything feels a bit blurry… are you referring to your vision, or do you mean more generally, like with your memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Oh… both, I suppose. My daughter keeps saying I repeat myself. And sometimes… I just can't seem to find the right words. It's frustrating. My eyesight… well, it’s not bad bad, but things aren’t as sharp as they used to be. I just figured it was… getting older, you know? But this tiredness… it’s more than that. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. We’ll try to figure out what’s going on. Just to get a clearer picture, can you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day… hmm. Well, I wake up… eventually. It takes a few tries with the alarm. Then I have a little coffee, and try to get some things done around the house. I used to do more… gardening, baking… now it's mostly just… keeping things tidy. I volunteer at the pharmacy a couple of times a week, but even that feels… hard sometimes. I’m a pharmacy tech, you know. Or… was a pharmacy tech. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. Then I have dinner, watch a bit of TV, and try to go to bed. It's… pretty boring, really. And exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fair amount of activity, even if it feels tiring now. Volunteering at the pharmacy… that's good to know. Do you notice the tiredness being worse at a particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… it’s worst in the afternoons. After lunch, usually. I just feel… heavy. Like I could fall asleep right there. And then it’s hard to get going again. Mornings are… a little better, I guess. But even then, it takes a lot of effort just to get out of bed. It’s just… always there, you know? That feeling of… being worn out.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse in the afternoons, consistently tired. And you mentioned feeling heavy. Are you experiencing any muscle weakness or aches along with that?
PATIENT: Muscle aches… sometimes. Not bad aches, just… a dull sort of soreness. Mostly in my shoulders and back, I think. It’s hard to say if it’s from the tiredness or just… getting older. I do feel… stiff sometimes, especially in the mornings. But I just thought that was… arthritis, maybe? My mother had it. I don't know. Everything just feels… mixed up.
DOCTOR: Okay, some muscle soreness and stiffness, particularly in the mornings. And a family history of arthritis. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. Well, I had my gallbladder out… years ago. And… high blood pressure, I think. The doctor put me on some pills for that. I take them every day. And… Honestly, I can’t remember much else. My daughter usually handles all that paperwork. I just… take the pills she gives me. I'm sorry. It's all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Janie. Don’t worry about it at all. It's common for things to be a bit fuzzy. We can look through your records. You mentioned high blood pressure medication - do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: No, I really don’t. I just take a little white pill every morning. My daughter refills it for me. I… I don't pay much attention to the names, honestly. I just know it's for my blood pressure. She brings the pills, I take them. That's all. I wish I could be more helpful. I just feel… so confused these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you're currently taking Lisinopril for high blood pressure. That's a common medication. And you said you had your gallbladder out years ago. Any other surgeries or hospitalizations that you recall?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes, that sounds right. My daughter always said it started with an 'L'. No… I don’t think so. Just the gallbladder, as far as I remember. I had that done… oh, goodness, must be twenty years ago now. I haven’t been in the hospital since then. No, definitely not. I just… get tired. That's the problem. Everything else is just… a blur. .
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries or hospitalizations. We'll move on to family history then. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
