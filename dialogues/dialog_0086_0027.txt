DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s get right to it. It’s this… stuff. Comes up. Especially after I eat. It’s… unpleasant. And it’s been happening more lately.
DOCTOR: Right. “Stuff coming up,” you say. And more recently, it’s been happening with increasing frequency… after meals, specifically. Could you be a bit more specific about this “stuff”?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean, specific? It’s… food. Partially digested food, I suppose. And acid. It tastes… sour. Like someone poured vinegar in my throat. It's not like I’m enjoying describing this, you know. I eat a perfectly normal diet – good, solid Polish cooking, mostly – and then blorp, it comes back up. It’s embarrassing, really. And it leaves a nasty taste. Is that specific enough for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. “Partially digested food, sour taste, after eating…” It sounds like you're experiencing regurgitation, Mr. Altine. Now, is this a forceful expulsion – like vomiting – or more of a… passive return?
PATIENT: Regur… what now? Look, I don’t speak doctor-talk. Is it coming out with a lot of force? No. It's not like being sick. It just… comes up. Slowly. Like a tide, maybe. Not violent, if that’s what you’re asking. Honestly, I haven't been paying attention to the mechanics of it, I just want it to stop. And it usually happens when I'm lying down, or bending over. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, regurgitation – food coming back up, not forceful, worse when lying down or bending over… It sounds like it could be gastroesophageal reflux – GERD, we call it. Although, we need to rule out other things, naturally. Do you experience any burning sensation in your chest – heartburn?
PATIENT: Heartburn? Sometimes. It’s not… constant. More of a discomfort. Like a warmth… that isn’t exactly pleasant. Though, honestly, with everything else going on, I barely notice it anymore. I just assumed it was part of the… overall unpleasantness. I take antacids now and then, which helps a bit. But I don’t want to be popping pills for the rest of my life just because I enjoy a good kielbasa.
DOCTOR: Antacids, you say. How often are you needing to take them?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know. A couple times a week, maybe? Depends. If I had a particularly heavy meal, or if I’m… well, lying down after eating. I don't keep a log or anything, I'm not a scientist! It's just when I need them, I take them. Are you going to ask me the exact ingredients of my last five meals now? Because that's just… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Altine, I won't be asking about your last five meals. However, it's important to understand the frequency. "A couple times a week" can mean different things to different people. And while antacids can provide temporary relief, they don’t address the underlying cause. Now, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. I haven’t lost any weight. I’ve actually… probably gained a bit. My wife keeps telling me to watch my figure, but a man needs his comfort food, you know? Especially with all this… going on. Look, I’m a fairly large man, if that makes any difference. Always have been. Strong constitution, that’s what my father used to say. This isn't helping, frankly. I’m starting to feel like I’m being interrogated.
DOCTOR: It's not an interrogation, Mr. Altine. It’s a medical history. Now, regarding your weight, I simply needed to rule out some more serious possibilities. Let's move on. Do you have any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No. Food goes down just fine. It’s what happens after that's the problem! Look, I don’t understand why you keep asking me all these… tangential questions. Just tell me what’s wrong and what I need to do to fix it. I’ve got things to do. My wife is expecting me for lunch. And honestly, the thought of eating anything right now is making me… nervous. So, let’s wrap this up, shall we?
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on what you've described, it does sound like GERD. It’s quite common. However, given your age, and the fact that this is a relatively recent development, I think we need to perform a quick examination, and potentially order some tests to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other, less common conditions. Perhaps an endoscopy. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Endo… what now? You want to put a camera down my throat? Absolutely not! Look, I came here for a quick fix, not some invasive procedure. I don’t see what that has to do with anything. I eat normal food, I’m a healthy man, just a bit… unlucky with my digestion, that’s all. Can’t you just give me something stronger than antacids? Something that will actually work? I’m not putting a camera down my throat, Doctor. That's out of the question. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. While I strongly advise against dismissing further investigation, I understand your reluctance. I can prescribe a proton pump inhibitor - a stronger medication to reduce stomach acid. However, be aware that these have potential side effects and won’t address the underlying cause. If your symptoms worsen, or new symptoms develop, you must return immediately, and consider the endoscopy then. Do you have any allergies to medications?
