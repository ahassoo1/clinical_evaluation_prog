DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ambris. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time. It’s… my breath. It smells bad. Really bad, apparently. My ex-husband definitely made that clear. I just need something to fix it, quickly. I don’t need a whole life story, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ambris. I appreciate you being direct. We can absolutely address this quickly. It’s good you’re seeking to resolve this. "Bad breath," or halitosis, can have several causes. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed the odor?
PATIENT: Honestly? Probably… forever? I mean, it’s never been good. But it’s gotten worse lately, I guess. Since… well, since everything with Tomas ended. I don't know why that would matter. It’s not like my feelings are causing bad breath. It’s probably just… bad luck. Look, I brush, sometimes I floss. Is that enough information? I really don’t have time to go through my entire dental history.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ambris, and I appreciate you sharing that. It’s not unusual for these things to fluctuate, and a change in life circumstances can sometimes be a factor, even if indirectly. We’ll get to the bottom of this efficiently. To clarify, when you say you brush, how often would you estimate that is per day?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Usually… once. Sometimes twice if I have a meeting. I work highway maintenance, okay? It's not exactly glamorous. There's dirt and… things. It’s not like I'm sitting around pampering my teeth all day. And floss? When I remember. Don’t judge me. It’s not like I enjoy having bad breath. Is that what you're implying?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Ambris. I am not implying any judgment. Highway maintenance sounds physically demanding, and your honesty is very helpful. Infrequent brushing and flossing can contribute to halitosis, but it's also important to rule out other potential causes. Do you notice any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Like what? I don’t have a fever. My gums don’t bleed, usually. My teeth hurt sometimes, but that’s probably just from… well, things getting stuck in them, with the work. Look, is this going to involve a lot of poking around? I really don’t like dentists. I haven’t been in years, honestly. It’s just… unpleasant. Can’t you just give me a mouthwash or something? A really strong one?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Ambris. We will proceed at your pace. A strong mouthwash can provide temporary relief, but it's often a symptom manager, not a solution to the underlying cause. To determine the best course of action, I'd like to perform a brief oral examination. It will involve me looking at your teeth and gums. I can be as gentle as possible. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t go poking around too much. And be quick about it. I have a shift to get back to, you know? People rely on me. They don't want potholes messing up their cars because I'm at the dentist. Honestly, this is a waste of time. I bet it’s just stress. People get bad breath when they're stressed, right?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ambris. I appreciate your patience. Stress can contribute to dry mouth, which can exacerbate halitosis, so you’re not incorrect there. However, it’s important to rule out other causes. Alright, Ms. Ambris. I'm observing some mild inflammation of your gums, and your tongue has a bit of a coating. This, combined with your reported brushing frequency, suggests gingivitis may be a contributing factor. It appears non-severe at this time. Do you experience any pain or bleeding when you brush or floss?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Sometimes, yeah. A little. I just figured it was… from the work. Dirt and stuff getting under my gums. It's not like a lot. Just a little spot, when I'm really scrubbing. And yeah, sometimes my gums are tender, especially when I eat something hard. It’s just… part of the job. I don't make a fuss about it. Honestly, I’m surprised you’re making such a big deal out of a little gum bleeding. People have real problems, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Ambris, and I appreciate you clarifying. It's good you're aware of the bleeding, even if it seems minor. It’s not my intention to minimize your concerns or imply you have "real problems," but gum inflammation can lead to more significant issues if left untreated. Given your description and the examination findings, I believe we’re dealing with mild gingivitis, likely exacerbated by infrequent brushing and flossing. Do you have any allergies to any medications or dental products?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I don’t take much, honestly. Maybe some ibuprofen for a headache sometimes, if it’s really bad. But nothing regularly. I just… I don't really like putting things in my body if I don’t have to. Is this going to involve a prescription? Because I really don't want to mess with prescriptions. My ex-husband… well, it’s a long story. But I just don't like them.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation regarding prescriptions, Ms. Ambris. We can certainly explore non-pharmacological options first. I wouldn’t prescribe anything at this time. To improve your oral health and address the halitosis, I recommend a few things. First, increasing your brushing frequency to twice a day with fluoride toothpaste. Second, incorporating daily flossing into your routine. And third, I recommend a tongue scraper to remove the coating on your tongue, as that harbors bacteria. Would you be willing to try these measures?
PATIENT: Fine. Twice a day brushing… and the floss thing. And a… tongue scraper? Sounds awful. But… yeah. I’ll try. Just don’t expect miracles. It’s not like I have a lot of free time to dedicate to my teeth. Honestly, it’s a lot to ask. But if it gets rid of the… smell, I guess I can make an effort. How long do I have to do this before I see a difference? Because I’m not committing to this forever.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Ambris. It's not about a lifetime commitment, but rather consistent effort. You should start to notice a difference within a week or two of consistent twice-daily brushing, daily flossing, and tongue scraping. If you don't see improvement after two weeks, or if your gums become significantly more tender or begin to bleed excessively, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can discuss other options, potentially a referral to a dentist for a professional cleaning. Would you like me to provide you with written instructions regarding proper brushing and flossing techniques and the benefits of tongue scraping?
PATIENT: No, I think I can figure it out. Brushing is brushing, right? And I’ve flossed before, a few times. I don’t need a pamphlet telling me how to hold the string. Honestly, I’m ready to go. This has taken up enough of my time. Can I just… leave now? I have a shift to get back to. People are counting on me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ambris. I appreciate you coming in and being honest about your concerns. Remember, consistent oral hygiene is key. Don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment if your condition doesn’t improve, or if you have any further questions. I’ll have the receptionist provide you with a brief summary of our discussion for your records. Have a safe and productive shift. .
