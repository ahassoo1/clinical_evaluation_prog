DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been feeling myself lately. A bit…down, you could say. I suppose that's why I’m here. I’d like to get this sorted out if possible; I have a life to live, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Not feeling yourself” can mean a lot of things. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about that “down” feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where to begin? It’s not…a specific sadness, exactly. More like a weight. Everything feels…difficult. Even getting out of bed some mornings is a struggle. I used to be so active, you see. Lifeguarding keeps a person busy. Ski patrol too. But lately…it’s just hard to want to do anything. It's been going on for…oh, goodness, a few months now, I suppose. Perhaps longer. Time does slip away, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does. A few months… okay. So, a loss of motivation, feeling weighed down, difficulty getting started with things… and it’s impacting activities you used to enjoy, like lifeguarding and ski patrol. That gives me a better starting point. Has anything specific happened around the time this started?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think…Well, my divorce was finalized about six months ago. It wasn’t…pleasant. A long time coming, but still. It's a bit unsettling, being alone again after so many years. I’m trying to adjust, of course. I have my friends, and I keep busy when I can. But it's…different. Perhaps that's what's bothering me. It feels rather foolish to dwell on something like that at my age, but there it is.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound foolish at all, Nani. Major life changes like a divorce absolutely can have a significant impact on how you feel, even after a long time coming. It's perfectly understandable that you're experiencing some difficulties adjusting. Okay. To get a clearer picture, and rule out other possibilities, could you tell me a little bit about how you've been sleeping and eating lately?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, my sleep hasn't been the best, I must admit. I wake up frequently, and sometimes I just lie there for ages before I can get back to sleep. It's rather frustrating. As for eating…my appetite has been off and on. Some days I eat normally, others I barely touch my food. My friends have noticed, actually. They keep telling me I look thinner. It's nothing drastic, but…noticeable. I'm trying to eat better, but it's difficult when I don’t feel much like eating at all. I suppose it's all connected, isn't it? The sleep, the eating…and just feeling…low.
DOCTOR: It sounds like it very well could be connected, yes. Changes in sleep and appetite are common with these kinds of feelings. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Well, I’ve been…less patient, I suppose. I used to enjoy being around people, but lately, I find myself wanting to be alone more and more. And I’ve had trouble concentrating. When I try to read – which I used to love – my mind just wanders. It’s frustrating! I feel like I’m losing my sharpness. I don't know…it’s just a general sense of…being out of sorts. Is that helpful? I'm not very good at explaining things, I fear.
DOCTOR: You're explaining perfectly well, Nani. It is helpful. Loss of interest, feeling irritable, difficulty concentrating…those are all things we look for. Now, let’s quickly go over some other things just to get a complete picture. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no, not really. A little bit of ache in my joints now and then, but that’s just old age creeping up on me, I suspect. Nothing significant. No headaches or anything like that. I'm generally quite healthy, aside from the…situation, of course. I try to stay active, even though it’s been difficult lately. And I take my vitamins, religiously. I believe in looking after oneself. Is there anything else you need to know? I do have an appointment later this afternoon, you see. I’d like to be finished soon if possible.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No, nothing else immediately comes to mind. Just a few more quick questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Never. My mother always said I had good genes. I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, as I mentioned, but that’s it. Regular check-ups with the doctor, and he always said I was in good shape, considering. I did have a bad fall skiing a few years back, broke my wrist, but it healed up completely. Otherwise, no serious illnesses or anything like that. I'm a rather healthy woman, truly. It’s just…this. This feeling. It’s so unlike me.
DOCTOR: Okay, and are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see. Just a daily multivitamin, as I said. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take some ibuprofen. That’s it, really. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, mind you. Just the basics. I don't believe in loading up on pills unless absolutely necessary. I prefer natural remedies when possible. Is that alright? I’m perhaps being a bit long-winded, I apologize.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Nani. It's good to know. Alright, one final thing. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of. None at all. I can eat anything, take any medication without any problems. I’m quite lucky in that regard, I suppose. That’s everything, isn’t it? Are we finished now? I do have to rush, as I mentioned. My friend is taking me to a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's everything. Thank you for being so thorough. Based on what you’ve told me, and considering your age and recent life changes, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. Now, I want to be very clear, I'm not making a definitive diagnosis right now. But it’s something we need to consider. The feelings you're describing – the low mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep and appetite, difficulty concentrating – are all common symptoms. Would you mind if I do a brief physical exam just to rule out any other potential medical causes?
PATIENT: Depression… Well. That's…not entirely unexpected, I suppose. My friends have been hinting at it. It's just…difficult to admit, you see. A strong woman like me, brought low by…sadness. But yes, of course. If you think it’s necessary, do the exam. I trust your judgment, Doctor. As quickly as possible, if you please. The luncheon… it's important to me. It’s a chance to see friends, and perhaps…regain some of my spirits. But please, don’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won't take long, just a quick check of your heart, lungs, and a neurological exam. If you could just have a seat here, and we'll get started. Take a deep breath for me…and let it out slowly. Good. Everything sounds normal there. Now, could you just follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Like this? Is that alright? My eyesight isn't what it used to be, you know. I may need glasses for this. Just let me know if I'm not following correctly. I'm trying my best. This is rather unsettling, you know. Being poked and prodded. It reminds me of…well, never mind. Just hurry, if you don't mind. I'm not one for medical examinations, as you can tell.
DOCTOR: Perfectly fine, Nani. You're doing wonderfully. Your eye movements are normal. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Can you just relax your legs for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Relax… I'm trying. It’s just… I haven’t been examined like this in years. It feels rather…invasive, if I may say so. Are we almost finished? My luncheon starts soon, you see. And I really don't want to miss it. It's a bit of a drive. I do apologize for being such a fussbudget. I'm normally a very composed woman. This…this situation has rather thrown me off balance.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Your reflexes are normal as well. Everything seems physically normal, which, as I said, supports the possibility of depression. Now, I want to assure you that depression is a very common and treatable condition. It’s not a sign of weakness, and you’re not alone in this. Many people experience this, and it’s often very responsive to treatment. The good news is that we have several options. We could start with talk therapy – seeing a counselor to help you process your feelings and develop coping mechanisms. Or, if you prefer, we could consider medication. There are several antidepressants that can help regulate your mood. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Medication… I'm not sure. I’ve always been hesitant about taking pills. My mother always said to rely on your own strength, and…well. I suppose I've been doing that for a long time. But perhaps…perhaps it's time to consider other options. Talk therapy… that sounds… less invasive. But I'm not sure I'm good at talking about my feelings. It’s always been difficult for me. But…well. I suppose I could try. If you think it’s the best option, Doctor, I’m willing to give it a try. But I don’t want to waste time, if it's not going to be effective. I do need to get my life back on track, you see. My friends… they’re counting on me. Do you have someone you recommend? And how long would it take? I really must be careful with my schedule.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Nani. Starting with talk therapy is often a good first step. It allows you to explore your feelings in a safe and supportive environment, and it doesn't involve medication. I have a list of excellent therapists in the area. Here, these all have good reputations and experience with patients experiencing similar feelings to yours. I'd recommend calling and speaking with a few of them to see who you feel most comfortable with. As for how long it would take, that's hard to say. It varies from person to person. Typically, it involves weekly sessions for several months. We can re-evaluate after a few sessions to see if it’s a good fit and if you’re making progress. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild sleep aid. It’s not a long-term solution, but it might help you get some rest while you’re starting therapy. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A sleep aid… yes, that would be most helpful. I haven’t been sleeping well at all, as you know. And weekly sessions… yes, I suppose that’s manageable. I’ll call these therapists, as you suggested, and see who’s available. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very understanding and helpful. I still feel a bit apprehensive, if I may say so. But I do appreciate your guidance. It’s reassuring to know that there are options available. Is there anything else I need to do, or anything else I should be aware of? And can I ask you a question? It’s rather personal, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nani. It's perfectly understandable to feel apprehensive, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. As for anything else, just try to be kind to yourself. Take things one day at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’re struggling. And please, ask whatever questions you have. That’s what I’m here for. What's on your mind?
