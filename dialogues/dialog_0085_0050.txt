DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… good to meet you too, I think. My cough. It just won’t go away. Been… a long time now. Dry as dust, it is. Mostly just at night, keeps waking me up. I don't rightly remember when it started, exactly. Feels like… always? Maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, a persistent cough, mostly at night. That certainly sounds bothersome, especially when it's keeping you from a good night's sleep. And you said it feels like it's been going on for a long time… perhaps always?
PATIENT: Yes, always feels like it. Or a really, really long time. My wife… she used to make me tea for it. Ginger, I think. But… she's gone now. So I just… deal with it. It's not… painful, just… annoying. And makes my throat sore sometimes. I don’t know if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s understandable that things feel different now. And yes, it absolutely makes a difference to know it's not painful, just annoying and causing some throat soreness. Let's try to get a better idea of what might be going on. Besides the cough and throat soreness, have you noticed anything else – any fever, chills, shortness of breath, wheezing, or changes in your energy level?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I know of. No chills. Shortness of breath… hmm. I get tired easier now, but I’m ninety years old, Doctor! So that's probably just… old age. Wheezing… I don't think so. I mostly just… sit now. Used to work on cars, a long time ago. Body work. But not anymore. Everything aches anyway. Does that… help? I'm not very good at remembering details, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Pavlovic. And you're right to point out the aches – that's important context. It’s good you recognize the potential connection with age and previous work. So, no fever, no chills, no wheezing, and you’ve noticed increased fatigue. And the cough is dry. Okay. Have you ever smoked, or been exposed to a lot of smoke or dust over the years, besides the car work?
PATIENT: Smoke… a little. When I was younger, maybe a few cigarettes. Not many. And the car work… lots of dust, sanding and such. And fumes, I guess. Sometimes I’d get a headache from the fumes. But that was a long time ago. My wife always told me to open the windows. She was a good woman. Did I tell you she liked gardening?
DOCTOR: You mentioned your wife liked gardening – that's lovely. It sounds like she was very thoughtful. And yes, the exposure to dust and fumes with the car work is good information. We'll definitely keep that in mind. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like asthma, COPD, heart problems, or anything else – in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a hard question. I’ve been to doctors, of course, over the years. But I don’t… remember what they told me. Something with my heart, maybe? When I was younger. But I don't recall the details. Old age again, I suppose. My wife used to keep track of all that. She was very organized. And I never liked going to the doctor much, to be honest. It usually meant bad news.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Pavlovic. It's very common to forget details over time, and it's perfectly alright if you don't remember specifics. And you're right, doctor's visits aren't always pleasant. Since you recall something about your heart, let’s check your records. Okay, it looks like you were diagnosed with mild hypertension—high blood pressure—about 15 years ago. It doesn’t seem to have been actively managed for the past several years. Have you been taking any medications at all recently?
PATIENT: Hypertension… that sounds… important. High blood pressure. I don’t remember anyone telling me to take anything for that. No, I don’t take any pills at all, Doctor. Just… try to take it easy. My wife used to make me chamomile tea for my nerves. And I take a little… tonic sometimes. For my joints. But that's all. It doesn't really help, much. My knees ache something fierce these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just the tonic for your joints. And you mentioned chamomile tea. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. Never had any trouble with food. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I’m outside, but that's just… bugs, I guess. I used to garden a little with my wife, but not anymore. Too much bending. She always said I was allergic to work. She had a good sense of humor.
DOCTOR: She sounds wonderful, Mr. Pavlovic. Alright, so no known allergies. And just to confirm, you're currently not taking any medications aside from the tonic for your joints?
PATIENT: That’s right, Doctor. Just the tonic. And chamomile tea when I remember. It’s… a little bottle. Smells nice. My wife bought it for me. Said it would help me relax. It doesn't really, but it tastes good. I mostly just sit now, you see. Don't get out much. The world… changes too fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. And I understand. It's alright to prefer a quieter life. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam. Well… I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. My wife always said I should listen to the doctor. She was a practical woman. It's just… I don't like being poked and prodded, if you know what I mean. But do what you need to do, Doctor. It's probably just old age, anyway.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pavlovic. I'll be as gentle as possible. And you're right, it could very well be related to aging. It's important to rule out other possibilities, though. Okay, your heart sounds a little… irregular. Not alarming, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound a little… diminished, which is common with age. And your blood pressure is a bit elevated – 150/90. Now, let’s take a look at your throat. Your throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Okay. Everything seems relatively stable, but the irregular heartbeat and elevated blood pressure are things we need to address. Do you ever experience any dizziness, chest pain, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Dizziness… sometimes. When I stand up too fast. But I just hold onto the furniture. Chest pain… no, not really. A little ache sometimes, but that’s probably just… old age. Shortness of breath… when I try to climb the stairs. But I don't climb the stairs much anymore. Mostly just sit, like I said. My wife always said I was a homebody. She wasn't wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness when standing, and shortness of breath with exertion. That gives me a bit more information. Given your age, history of mild hypertension, irregular heartbeat, and elevated blood pressure, I suspect your cough is likely related to a combination of factors - possibly some underlying heart condition contributing to fluid build-up in your lungs, along with some mild bronchitis from being generally less active. But to be certain, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be okay with a chest X-ray and an EKG?
PATIENT: Tests… oh dear. I don't like tests. My wife always said I was a terrible patient. An X-ray… and an EKG… what does that involve? I don't want anything… stuck to me. Or poked and prodded. Is it really necessary, Doctor? Couldn't we just… try the tea? Or the tonic?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Pavlovic. Tests can be unsettling, but they're really important for getting a clear picture of what's going on. The chest X-ray is a simple imaging test – you'll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds, it doesn't involve anything being stuck to you, and there’s no poking or prodding. It helps us see if there’s any fluid build-up in your lungs. The EKG is also painless. We’ll put a few small, sticky patches – electrodes – on your chest and arms. They record your heart's electrical activity, so we can check for any irregular rhythms. It's not about dismissing the tea or tonic - those can certainly help with comfort. But these tests will help us determine the cause of your cough and ensure we’re not missing anything serious. If we can find out what’s going on, we can come up with the best treatment plan for you. Would you be willing to consider the tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Sticky patches… and a machine. My wife always said I was a worrywart. But… if you think it’s really necessary, Doctor… I suppose I can try. But please… be gentle. And don't leave the sticky patches on too long. They might… itch. And I don’t like being poked. Is there anyone I can call? Just… in case?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Pavlovic. I promise to be as gentle as possible, and we won’t leave the patches on any longer than necessary. I’ll explain everything carefully before we do it. And yes, of course, you can call someone. Do you have a family member or friend you’d like me to contact?
PATIENT: No… not really. My daughter… she lives far away. And she’s… busy. I don’t want to bother her. It’s alright. I can manage. Just… let me know when you're going to… poke me. And if those patches itch, can I scratch them?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Pavlovic. You don't need to bother anyone if you don't want to. I will be sure to explain every step before we do anything, and I'll stay with you the whole time. And yes, you can definitely scratch the patches if they itch. We’ll use patches designed to be gentle and minimize irritation, but it’s alright to scratch them if you need to. Okay, let’s start with the chest X-ray. The technician is just down the hall, and I’ll accompany you. It will only take a few minutes. Then we’ll come back here and do the EKG. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… a few minutes. Just a few minutes. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And you’ll stay with me? That’s… good. My wife always said I needed someone to hold my hand. Let’s… get it over with. Lead the way, Doctor. But please… not too fast. I’m an old man, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Pavlovic. We’ll take it slow. I’ll stay with you every step of the way. Let’s go. The technician, Sarah, is expecting us. She’s very kind and will explain everything clearly.
