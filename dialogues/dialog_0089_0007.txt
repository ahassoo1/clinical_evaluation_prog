DOCTOR: Hi Lakiya, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. My back… it is painful. I want to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Let’s get this figured out. “Painful” can mean a lot of things. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It is a… a constant ache, mostly. Like a heavy weight is sitting on my lower back. It started a few weeks ago, after I was helping with the fence repairs on Old Man Hemlock’s property. I lifted a lot of posts.
DOCTOR: Alright, a constant ache, lower back, started after heavy lifting… that gives us a starting point. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Hmm. Right now… I would say a six. It is not unbearable, but it makes it difficult to… to bend over, or even stand for too long. It does not go away completely when I sit, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, a six, constant, worse with bending and standing, and doesn’t fully relieve with sitting. Does anything specifically make it worse – certain movements, times of day, activities?
PATIENT: Yes. Definitely when I’m twisting. Like, if I try to look over my shoulder while carrying something… or even just reaching for something on a high shelf. And in the mornings, it is much worse. It takes a while to loosen up.
DOCTOR: Okay, twisting and mornings are key. And does anything help the pain?
PATIENT: Warm water. A hot shower, or a warm compress. It doesn’t make it go away completely, but it eases it for a little while. And… resting, if I can manage it. Though resting doesn’t always help as much as I’d like.
DOCTOR: Alright, warm water and rest provide some relief. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your leg, or any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. The pain stays in my back. It does not go down my legs. My feet and legs feel… normal. No tingling or anything like that. Just the ache in my back. Is that… good? I don’t understand all of this.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Lakiya. It helps us rule things out. So, no radiating pain, no numbness or tingling. Have you had any trouble with your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Everything works as it should. I apologize if that is… a strange question. I just want to be certain I answer everything correctly. It is important, yes?
DOCTOR: It's a very important question, Lakiya, and you're doing great! No need to apologize at all. It's good you ask. Okay. And have you had any fever, unexplained weight loss, or any history of cancer?
PATIENT: No fever. No weight loss. And no, I have never been told I have cancer. My husband… he passed away five years ago from something else entirely. Lung trouble, it was. But I have never had any problems like that myself. I hope this is not taking too long, Doctor. I have things I need to get back to.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lakiya. We'll get through this as quickly as possible. I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. Okay, no history of cancer. Let’s talk about your medical history in general. Do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, arthritis, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just my Medicare, Doctor. I don’t have any of those things. I’ve always been… fairly healthy, for the most part. A little achy now and then, but nothing serious. Old age, I suppose. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no other medical conditions. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything. Not even aspirin. I prefer to just… deal with it, if I can. I don’t like taking pills, if you understand. They never seem to do much good anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I can eat anything, take anything… though, as I said, I don’t want to take anything. I've never had a reaction to anything. Is this all, Doctor? I really need to get back to work. The fences won't fix themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. So, to recap: lower back pain started a few weeks ago after lifting, constant ache, rated 6/10, worse with twisting and mornings, relieved somewhat by warm water and rest, no radiating pain, no numbness/tingling, normal bladder/bowel function, no fever/weight loss/cancer history, no other medical conditions, no medications, no allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just so I can get a better idea of what’s going on. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… acceptable. I suppose I can lie down. Just… try to be quick, if you please. This is not my favorite thing to do.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as quick as I can, Lakiya. I'm going to start by just feeling your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Then I'll have you do a few simple movements – bending forward, bending backward, and side to side – to see how those feel. Okay, does this hurt?
PATIENT: Yes. Right there. A little to the left of my spine. It is… a dull ache, but it is definitely worse when you press on it. Be careful, please. It is not… comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness there, mid-back, left side. And now, if you don't mind, can you gently bend forward, as far as is comfortable, and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… not good. It is very painful. I can barely touch my knees, let alone my toes. It feels like something is… pulling. Stop, please. That was… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, stop. That’s good. And now, can you bend backward, as far as comfortable?
PATIENT: That is… better. Still a little uncomfortable, but not as bad as bending forward. I can lean back a bit, but not very far. It feels… tight. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. And finally, can you try to twist to the left and then to the right, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh! No, that is very painful! Stop, please! It feels like something is… stuck. I can't do that. It hurts too much. Are we finished now?
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, stop. Yes, we’re finished with the exam. So, exam findings show tenderness to palpation mid-back, left side. Limited range of motion with bending forward and twisting, pain reported with those movements. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you likely have a muscle strain or sprain in your lower back. It's common after lifting something heavy, especially if you weren’t warmed up properly or used incorrect lifting technique. It's good that you don't have any radiating pain, numbness, or tingling, which would be more concerning.
PATIENT: A muscle strain? That… that is all? I suppose that is… good. What do I do about it? I have fences to fix, Doctor. I can't just lie around. Will it heal on its own? And will I need… pills? I really don't want pills.
DOCTOR: It’s good news it doesn’t sound like anything more serious. Most muscle strains and sprains do heal on their own with time and proper care. However, to help it heal faster and prevent it from getting worse, I recommend a few things. First, rest. I know you have fences to fix, but try to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities for the next few days. Second, ice. Apply an ice pack to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, for the first 24-48 hours. Then, you can switch to heat. Third, gentle stretching. Do some gentle stretches to keep your back muscles loose, but don't push yourself. As for pills… I’m not going to prescribe anything at this time. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help with the pain and inflammation, but those are your choice if you want them. They're not required.
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… yes. I have some of that at home. I suppose I can try that. And ice… and rest. I will try to rest, though it is difficult. Is there anything else? Any exercises I should be doing? Or anything I should avoid doing, besides lifting? I don’t want this to get worse.
DOCTOR: Good. Ibuprofen can help. As for exercises, I recommend gentle core strengthening exercises once the initial pain subsides. Things like pelvic tilts and abdominal bracing. I can give you a handout with some examples. And things to avoid… Avoid twisting movements, bending forward repeatedly, and prolonged sitting. Try to maintain good posture when you are sitting, and use proper lifting technique when you do need to lift something – bend your knees, keep your back straight, and keep the object close to your body. I'm going to print out an information sheet on lower back pain and exercises. I'm also going to give you a prescription for a physical therapy referral. A physical therapist can teach you proper exercises and stretching techniques to help prevent this from happening again. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. A physical therapy referral. And the information sheet. I will try to follow all of your instructions, Doctor. I really appreciate your help. This is… reassuring. Is there anything else I need to know before I leave? Or any warning signs I should be looking for? I don't want to end up back here again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. As for warning signs, if you experience any of the following, please seek medical attention immediately: severe pain that doesn't improve with rest or medication, numbness or tingling in your legs or feet, weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or fever. Those could be signs of a more serious problem. Otherwise, follow the instructions on the sheet, and don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment with you in two weeks to see how you’re doing. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks is fine. I will make a note of it. Thank you again, Doctor Roseburrough. You have been very helpful. I suppose this is all for now. I will go home and rest, and try to take care of my back. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lakiya. Please take it easy, and don't hesitate to call if you need anything. The nurse will escort you out. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
