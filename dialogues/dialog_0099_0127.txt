DOCTOR: Right. Gedalya Schaust, 25 years old. Well, let's get straight to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. It’s… been worrying me, to be honest. It started a few months ago, just feeling a bit weaker than usual, but it’s gotten more noticeable lately. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they droop, especially in the afternoon.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids, you say. A few months now. Hmm. And by weakness, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I can’t do things, if that makes sense. It's just… everything takes more effort. Like, carrying groceries feels harder than it used to, and even holding my head up for too long can be tiring. It's mostly in my arms and legs, I think. It’s hard to explain, it’s not a sudden thing, just… gradual. I don't know if that helps.
DOCTOR: Gradual, you say. That's… less concerning than a sudden onset, I suppose. Though still not ideal. And you've noticed it primarily in your limbs, carrying things, holding your head up. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No pain, no numbness, no tingling. I have been a bit more tired than usual, but I just figured that was… life, you know? I work pretty long hours. Oh! And sometimes… it’s hard to… swallow, maybe? Like, food feels like it’s getting stuck a little. It doesn't happen all the time, just sometimes with drier foods.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and difficulty swallowing… drier foods, specifically. Right. And how long have you been experiencing the swallowing difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s fairly recent, maybe the last month or so. It’s not severe, honestly. I can still eat, it just… feels a little uncomfortable sometimes. It’s hard to describe. It's not like choking, just… needing to concentrate a bit more to get the food down. Does that make any sense? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Schaust. Many patients struggle to articulate these subtleties. So, to clarify, weakness progressing over months, drooping eyelids, recent difficulty swallowing solids... Have you noticed any double vision, or blurry vision at all?
PATIENT: No, no double vision or blurry vision. My eyesight’s always been fine, I think. I haven't needed glasses since I was a kid, and even then it was just for reading. And no, nothing like that now. It’s just… the tiredness, the weakness, and the eyelids, and this new thing with swallowing. It's starting to worry me because it’s interfering with work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. Should I… lie down, or…?
DOCTOR: No need to lie down just yet. First, I'd like to check your reflexes, strength, and a few cranial nerves. Just relax your arms, please. And I'll need to examine your eyes, so I'll get close. Now, let's start with your reflexes. Just let your arms fall loose, and I'll tap a few spots.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Relaxed arms… here we go. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Reflexes are… somewhat diminished. Not entirely absent, but weaker than I'd expect for your age. Now, let's check your muscle strength. I'm going to ask you to resist as I push against your arms and legs. Please push back with equal force, when I say so. It's important to be honest. Squeeze my hands as hard as you can. Now, push against my palm… like you're trying to lift your arm against my resistance.
PATIENT: Okay. Squeezing… And pushing… It's a little harder than it looks, to be honest. I’m trying my best.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it is important to be accurate. Your strength is… noticeably reduced in several muscle groups, particularly in your arms and legs. Now, let's check your cranial nerves. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Follow my finger... up and down... left and right... Now, I’m going to shine a light in each of your eyes. This may be a little uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Up and down… left and right… That’s a bit bright, but… okay. I’m looking at the light. It feels… normal, I guess? I’m not sure what I’m looking for, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Your pupillary response is… sluggish. And your eye movements are not entirely smooth. Hmm. Based on this brief examination, and your reported symptoms… there are a few possibilities, though it’s far too early to make any definitive diagnosis. I suspect, however, we need to rule out a neurological cause. It's possible you have myasthenia gravis or a similar condition. Do you have any family history of muscle weakness or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Neurological… condition? Myasthenia… gravis? That sounds… serious. Uh… family history? Let me think. My mother had… arthritis, I think? And my grandfather… he had some kind of memory problems when he was older, but I don't know if that's… neurological? No one on either side of the family, that I know of, has had muscle weakness or anything like that. I mean, everyone gets a little weaker as they age, but not… like this. This is different. What does this mean?
DOCTOR: It means we need to run some tests. Specifically, I want a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and an acetylcholine receptor antibody test. That will help us determine if your symptoms are indicative of myasthenia gravis, or another autoimmune condition. Also, an electromyography to assess the electrical activity of your muscles. I will write you a referral to a neurologist. They are best equipped to interpret these results and provide a definitive diagnosis. And frankly, given your lack of insurance, you may need to seek care at a teaching hospital to make this affordable. Here. Take this to Dr. Evelyn Reed. She's excellent, if somewhat busy. And be prepared for a lengthy wait for the EMG. It's in high demand. In the meantime, avoid strenuous activity. And if you experience any difficulty breathing or swallowing, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Complete blood count… thyroid panel… acetylcholine… EMG… It’s a lot. And… a neurologist? Okay. I understand. No strenuous activity, go to the emergency room if I can’t breathe… No insurance… a teaching hospital… That's going to be… expensive, isn't it? Is there… anything else I should be doing? Anything I can do now to make things… better? I mean, before I see the neurologist and get all these tests done? And… what are the chances it’s not myasthenia gravis?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Schaust, I'm a family physician, not a miracle worker. I can order the tests, I can make the referral. But I can't guarantee a swift diagnosis or affordable treatment. As for what you can do now… rest, as I said. And frankly, managing your expectations. Autoimmune conditions can be complex, and the diagnostic process can take time. As for the likelihood of it not being myasthenia gravis… it’s impossible to say without the test results. There are other possibilities, but frankly, your symptoms are concerning enough to warrant a thorough investigation. I've given you the information you need. It’s up to you to schedule the appointments and follow through. Don't delay, Mr. Schaust. These conditions don't typically improve on their own. Any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you… I guess. It’s just… a lot to take in. I’ll… schedule the appointments. Thank you for… everything. .
