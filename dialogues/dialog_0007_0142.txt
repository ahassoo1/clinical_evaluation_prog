DOCTOR: Hi Jaxston, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Well, it’s…headaches, mostly. Bad ones. They come and go, and when they do come, they’re…rough. I get all sweaty and my heart races, too. Honestly, I don't really remember exactly when they started, just that they’ve been happening for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches. “Rough” is a good way to put it, I imagine. And you mentioned sweating and a racing heart with them – that’s helpful to know. When you say “for a while now,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that’s the thing… rough is right. And yeah, the heart thing is…unsettling. As for how long… honestly, a few months, maybe? Or longer? It’s all kinda blurry, to be honest with ya. I just know it's not a new thing, but it hasn't been years either, I don’t think. I wish I could be more specific. It feels like they’ve gotten worse lately, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months, potentially longer, and definitely increasing in severity. That’s still useful. Let's try to pinpoint some details. Can you describe the headache itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it? It’s… all over, kinda. Not just one spot. Like a really bad pressure, all around my head. Sometimes it feels like it’s squeezing. And it's intense. Like, I have to lie down and close my eyes, and even then it's hard to get comfortable. Does that make sense? I don't know…headaches are just…bad.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, "intense pressure all around," squeezing – that paints a good picture. And needing to lie down is significant. Do you notice anything that triggers these headaches?
PATIENT: Triggers… now that’s a good question. I haven’t really kept track, to be honest. I don’t think so, not that I’ve noticed. They just…happen. Sometimes when I’m stressed, maybe? But I'm usually pretty relaxed, so… I really couldn't say. It doesn't seem to be food or anything like that. I wish I could tell you something more useful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no clear triggers that you’ve identified, perhaps a link to stress, but not consistently. Let's talk about other symptoms. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: Nausea… sometimes. Not always, but yeah, occasionally I feel kinda sick to my stomach when one of these is coming on. I haven't actually thrown up with one, thankfully. But definitely queasy. And sometimes I get a bit sensitive to light, like, bright lights bother me more when I've got a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea and sensitivity to light. Good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your vision – blurry vision, seeing spots, anything like that?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, not really. Everything looks…normal, I think. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses, so… I just figured that was the prescription. I haven’t noticed anything different with the headaches, if that makes sense. Just the usual blurry-ness.
DOCTOR: Okay, usual blurry vision with glasses. Let's quickly go over your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Uh, not that I know of. I haven’t really been to the doctor much. I mean, nothing serious. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that's about it. No high blood pressure, no diabetes... I think. I really couldn’t tell ya, honestly. I don’t really keep track of that kinda stuff. Divorced life, you know? Things kinda slip your mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, otherwise no known medical conditions. Any family history of headaches, migraines, or neurological issues?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history... that's a tough one. My mom had headaches sometimes, I think. Nothing like this, though. More like tension headaches, I guess. My dad… he was pretty healthy, as far as I know. And I don't really talk to either of them much anymore. So, I couldn’t really tell ya about any serious neurological stuff, or anything like that. Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with tension headaches, otherwise no known family history. And that’s perfectly alright. Let’s talk about your current medications and any allergies you have. Are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications currently?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a regular headache. Not even regularly, just when needed. And no allergies, as far as I know. I can eat anything, no problems there. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. I really don't take any pills, to be honest. I try to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen, no known allergies. Alright. Before I do a quick physical exam, could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. Well, I work, you know? Production work, all over. It's not super stressful, mostly just…standing and doing things. I don’t really drink or smoke. I try to eat okay, but sometimes it's hard when you're on the go. I don't really have a lot of hobbies, to be honest. Just kinda…relax when I can. I'm divorced, so I don't have a lot of responsibilities. I guess that's it. Pretty boring, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, production work, non-smoker, occasional drinker, try to eat well, divorced. Let's do a quick exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll do a basic neurological exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do, Doc. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable or anything. I'm not really a fan of doctors, to be honest, but I appreciate you trying to figure this out. Let’s get it over with, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 135/85. Pulse is 78 and regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds normal. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. I lightly tap his knee with a reflex hammer. And I'm going to check your pupils and eye movements. I shine a penlight in his eyes. Any dizziness or blurry vision when I do this?
PATIENT: Uh, no dizziness or blurry vision. Just… bright lights, kinda. Like, a little sensitive, but I said that already, right? Reflexes… I don't know, is that normal? It feels kinda weird, like a little jolt. It’s not painful, just… strange. I'm not really used to this, to be honest. Everything seems a little… fast.
DOCTOR: Perfectly normal to feel a little strange with the reflexes. Everything feels fast because it is relatively quick. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. No obvious neurological deficits. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, I suspect tension headaches, potentially with some migraine features given the nausea and light sensitivity. However, given the new onset and increasing severity, and the fact that you haven’t been regularly seen by a doctor, I’d like to order a CT scan of your head just to rule out anything more serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Ugh. Sounds…serious. I mean, is it bad? I just want this headache to go away, not… get a scan and stuff. But, I guess if you think it’s necessary… alright. Just… please explain everything, okay? I don’t really understand all this medical stuff. And how much is that gonna cost? I don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern. A CT scan is a precaution – we want to rule out anything concerning like bleeding or a mass. It doesn't mean something is wrong, it just means we want to be thorough. It’s a quick scan, non-invasive, and will give us a clearer picture. As for cost, since you don’t have insurance, it can be expensive. I’ll have the billing department give you a detailed estimate. We can also explore options for financial assistance or a payment plan. It will likely be several hundred dollars, but I want to get this sorted for you and we'll work something out. While we wait for the scan, I recommend avoiding caffeine and staying well-hydrated. I’m also going to prescribe you a medication to help manage the headache pain. It's a mild muscle relaxant and pain reliever. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… a muscle relaxant sounds good, if it'll actually help. Several hundred dollars… ugh, that’s gonna hurt. But, I guess I don’t really have a choice, right? If you think it’s necessary, I'll do it. Please, just let the billing people know I really don't have much money. And can you explain the scan results to me like… I’m five? No medical jargon, please. I just want this to be over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll explain the scan results in plain language, I promise. No jargon, just a clear explanation of what we see. And I'll make sure the billing department knows your financial situation and explore all possible options. I’m also going to give you a referral to a neurologist for follow-up. They can help you manage these headaches long-term. Here’s the prescription and the referral information. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: A neurologist… great. Another doctor. Okay. Uh, no, I think that’s it. Just… please make sure they explain everything, too. And thank you, Doc. For… not laughing at me, I guess. And for trying to help. It's just a lot, you know? It’s hard to keep track of everything when… well, when things are messy. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaxston. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, and I’m here to help in any way I can. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get this sorted out. .
