DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor… Paraskevopoulos, is it? Yes, yes. It's… this cough. Been bothering me for a while now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Doesn't bring anything up, if you know what I mean. Just… scratchy. It's been… a long time, really. Hard to say how long. I just figured it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: A dry cough for an indeterminate amount of time. I understand. It’s good you’re finally getting it checked out. “Figuring it would go away on its own” is a common sentiment, but sometimes these things do require a bit of investigation. Now, when you say “a while now,” could you perhaps give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… a rough estimate… Let me think. My wife… she passed… oh, goodness, almost five years ago now. I think it started around then, maybe? Or a little after. It's all a bit… blurry. I was busy with… things. After she was gone. It just… sort of is, you know? I don't recall a specific moment it started. Just… always there, more or less.
DOCTOR: Approximately five years. And you’ve noticed no changes in the cough over that time – no worsening, no improvement, no triggers that you’ve identified?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s… pretty consistent, I suppose. Maybe a little worse when the air is dry. We used to have a humidifier, but… well, after my wife… I haven’t gotten around to setting it up again. It just sits in the basement. And no, nothing makes it happen, not that I’ve noticed. Just… there. Always a bit of a tickle in my throat. Sometimes when I lay down it’s a bit worse, but not much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. A persistent, dry cough for approximately five years, slightly exacerbated by dry air and when lying supine. Now, beyond the cough, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. My bones ache a bit, but I'm ninety years old! I figured that was just… getting old. And… I get tired easily. But again, that’s probably just… age. I don’t get short of breath, not really. Maybe a little when I’m walking up the stairs, but that's always been the case. I don’t have a fever or anything like that. No weight loss. Honestly, just the cough, and feeling old.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no fever, no weight loss, no shortness of breath. Bones aching and fatigue, which you attribute to age, and we’ve established the persistent cough. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Do you have a list of any conditions you've been diagnosed with, or medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… that’s a tough one. I saw a doctor regularly when my wife was still… well, when we were both younger. I think I had high blood pressure, at one point. But that was a long time ago. I don’t remember taking anything for it recently. I don’t have a list, no. And to be honest, I’ve avoided doctors as much as possible after… after she was gone. Just didn’t feel like dealing with it, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Avoiding medical care after a loss is not uncommon. We'll work with what we have, then. No current medications, and a history of hypertension in the past. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And… oh, yes. My wife… she had a hip replacement, and I was with her through all of that. But I haven’t had any surgeries myself, besides the appendix. That I recall, anyway. It's hard to remember everything from that long ago, you understand.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal in childhood, no other surgeries. Good. Now, let's briefly discuss your family history, if you don't mind. Were there any significant illnesses that ran in your family – heart disease, cancer, lung problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… My wife's side… her mother had something with her heart, I think. Died pretty young, actually. And her brother… he smoked his whole life, and… well, you can imagine. Lung problems, naturally. On my side… my father lived a long life, but he had… arthritis, I believe. And my mother… she just faded away, old age, mostly. Nothing specific. Not a lot of serious illness in either family, as far as I recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of heart disease on your wife’s side, lung problems due to smoking in her brother, and arthritis in your mother. Now, before we proceed to a physical examination, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anything. I remember being stung by a bee once, when I was a boy, but I didn’t have any trouble with it. I haven’t taken many medications, so I haven’t had much chance to be allergic to anything. No, I don't believe I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, if you’ll permit me, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Go ahead. I’ll do my best to be still. It's been a long time since anyone listened to my lungs.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath in for me… and out… Good. And again… deep breath… out… I’m hearing some mild wheezing, bilaterally. Not particularly alarming, but certainly present. Now, let's listen to your heart. Deep breath in… and out… Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. And your blood pressure is 140/90. A bit high, but not unexpected given your history. Open your mouth for me, please… Ah. Mild redness in the back of your throat, but no obvious signs of infection. Your tonsils are not enlarged. Overall, the examination is unremarkable, aside from the mild wheezing, slightly elevated blood pressure, and redness in your throat. I’m concerned about the duration of your cough and the wheezing. Given your age and the lack of a recent medical history, I think it would be prudent to order a chest X-ray and a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying infection or other problems. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… and blood work. Yes, that sounds… thorough. If that's what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust your judgement. I haven't had an X-ray since… well, probably never. I just want to get this cough sorted out, if possible. It's getting tiring, constantly clearing my throat. And high blood pressure… well, I figured that would be something I'd have to deal with eventually.
DOCTOR: Very good. I will order both a chest X-ray and a complete blood panel. The X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and check for any signs of pneumonia, bronchitis, or other abnormalities. The blood panel will help us assess your overall health and rule out any infection. The nurse will be in shortly to draw blood, and she’ll give you instructions on how to schedule the X-ray. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you an inhaler with a bronchodilator to help relieve the wheezing and make breathing easier. It's a relatively mild medication, but it should provide some symptomatic relief. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: An inhaler… to help me breathe easier? That sounds… good. Very good, actually. No, I don’t think I have any questions about it right now. Just… how do I use it? I haven't used one of those before. And… will it interact with anything? I don’t take any other medications, but I want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Certainly. This is a simple inhaler. You’ll shake it well, exhale completely, then place it in your mouth, forming a tight seal with your lips. As you begin to inhale slowly and deeply, you press down on the canister. Hold your breath for ten seconds. It may take a couple of tries to get it right. The nurse can demonstrate the proper technique before you leave. As for interactions, there are no known significant interactions with other medications, which is fortunate given that you are not currently taking any. However, it’s always best to inform any healthcare provider about all medications and inhalers you are using. Do you understand those instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Shake, exhale, seal, press, inhale, hold. It sounds… manageable. And no interactions. That's good to know. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly, Doctor. My wife… she used to handle all of this sort of thing. I'm not used to remembering these details on my own.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed in these circumstances. Please don’t hesitate to ask the nurse any questions you may have about the inhaler or anything else. We’re here to help. Once we have the results of the X-ray and blood work, we can discuss them and formulate a more comprehensive treatment plan. In the meantime, use the inhaler as directed, and if your cough worsens or you develop any new symptoms – such as fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything I was worried about. I appreciate your time, Doctor. And thank you for being so patient with an old man who doesn't remember much these days.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Mr. Pavlovic. And please, don’t apologize for your age or memory. It’s perfectly normal. We'll get to the bottom of this cough, and I’m confident we can improve your quality of life. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and provide further instructions. Please, take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you as well Doctor. I will. And thank you again.
