DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit of a…complicated matter, really. I’ve been experimenting with some rather… enthusiastic dietary approaches, shall we say? And I thought it best to have a professional opinion before I…well, before anything untoward occurs. I’m Jarvis Vantine, by the way. Though I suspect that’s on your chart.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see that, Mr. Vantine. It’s good you came in. “Enthusiastic dietary approaches,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s a polite way of putting it, I suppose. Let’s see… there was the all-grapefruit diet, a rather… pungent experience. Then, the cabbage soup regimen – a social disaster, if I may say so. And most recently, something involving only foods of a specific colour. I confess, my memory is rather good, which is perhaps part of the problem. I get carried away with the details, you see. It started with a documentary, naturally. One always leads to another.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're self-aware, Mr. Vantine. It sounds like you've been trying quite a few different things. And documentaries can be very persuasive. To help me understand what's going on now, could you tell me a little more about why you started these diets?
PATIENT: Ah, the motivations… A perfectly reasonable inquiry, Doctor. Well, it’s a confluence of factors, really. Age, primarily. One feels a certain… pressure to maintain appearances, you understand. And then there’s the desire to feel… vigorous. Though “vigorous” feels rather optimistic at my age. It began as a way to subtly adjust, to… refine. But, as I alluded to, it escalated. The documentaries, naturally, present rather compelling narratives. And then, there’s the sheer intellectual challenge of adhering to such… restrictive regimens. It’s a puzzle, of sorts. Though a rather uncomfortable one, at times.
DOCTOR: I see. So it wasn’t necessarily a response to a specific health concern?
PATIENT: No, not initially, Doctor. There wasn't a particular diagnosis or prompting from a physician. I’ve been remarkably healthy, all things considered. Regular check-ups, thankfully. This was… a self-imposed experiment, driven by a rather persistent curiosity, and, perhaps, a touch of vanity. Though I hesitate to admit the latter. It's only recently that I've begun to feel…slightly less robust, shall we say, and that prompted me to seek your counsel before I take things any further.
DOCTOR: That’s good that you came in now. Can you describe what you mean by “slightly less robust”?
PATIENT: Well, it's rather difficult to articulate, Doctor. It's not a specific ailment, you understand. More of a… generalized fatigue, perhaps? And a certain… lack of enthusiasm for my usual pursuits. I find myself tiring more easily, both physically and mentally. The animation work, which I’ve always found invigorating, is proving more… taxing. And, dare I say it, my appetite has diminished, even beyond what one might expect from these… dietary phases. It's a subtle decline, but noticeable to someone who is, shall we say, intimately acquainted with his own physicality.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when did you start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… It began, I believe, approximately six weeks ago. Coincidentally, or perhaps not, around the time I concluded the… monochrome diet. Yes, that was it. Everything had to be either entirely black or entirely white. Fascinating concept, visually, but remarkably restrictive. The fatigue was initially mild, easily dismissed. But it’s gradually worsened over the past month, coinciding with the diminishing appetite. It’s become rather… persistent, shall we say.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, actually. Now that you mention it, my… digestion has become somewhat irregular. Let’s say… unpredictable. And, a rather embarrassing admission, but my sleep patterns have been disrupted. I find myself waking frequently, often with a… a vague sense of unease. Not nightmares, precisely, but not entirely restful either. And, upon reflection, my… skin has lost some of its elasticity. A subtle change, but noticeable in the mirror, of course. It’s a constellation of minor discomforts, really, but collectively… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is… a salient point. I haven’t been rigorously tracking it, you understand, but I believe I’ve lost approximately… seven pounds over the past six weeks. It’s not a dramatic loss, but noticeable in my clothing, of course. And, given my… enthusiasm for these dietary approaches, it’s not entirely unexpected. However, it is concerning, given the other symptoms. I confess, the scale is rather unforgiving at my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. I’ve been remarkably fortunate in that regard. I have a mild case of arthritis in my left knee, which flares up occasionally, but it’s easily managed with over-the-counter remedies and a bit of sensible exercise. Beyond that… nothing significant. Regular check-ups, as I mentioned, and a clean bill of health each time. I attribute it to good genes and a moderately disciplined lifestyle, despite these… recent experiments.
DOCTOR: Good. Any past surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing of that nature, thankfully. I had my tonsils removed as a child – a rather unpleasant experience, as I recall – but that was… several decades ago. Beyond that, nothing requiring hospitalization or surgical intervention. I've been fortunate enough to avoid such inconveniences. I've always prided myself on maintaining a… robust constitution. Though, perhaps, that constitution is showing some signs of wear and tear.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, bless his soul, suffered from high blood pressure in his later years, managed with medication, of course. My mother, a remarkably resilient woman, succumbed to influenza in her seventies. Beyond that… nothing particularly concerning. No history of heart disease, cancer, or diabetes on either side of the family. My grandfather, on my mother’s side, lived to be ninety-two, a testament to good genes and a sensible lifestyle, I believe. It's a relatively unremarkable family history, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Remarkably, none. I can tolerate most foods without incident, which is perhaps why I’ve been so… adventurous with these dietary phases. A slight sensitivity to pollen during the spring months, but nothing requiring medication or significant lifestyle adjustments. It’s a blessing, truly. Though, perhaps, my lack of allergies has contributed to my… willingness to experiment.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. As I mentioned, I've been remarkably healthy. I manage the occasional arthritis flare-up with over-the-counter pain relievers, ibuprofen as needed, but nothing on a regular basis. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible, if I may say so. I believe in the power of a sensible lifestyle and a bit of… resilience. Though, perhaps, my resilience is beginning to wane.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Vantine, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It sounds like you've been through quite a lot recently with these diets. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A thorough examination is undoubtedly prudent. I confess, I’m rather curious to see what you discover. Please, proceed at your convenience. I shall endeavor to remain… still. Though, given my age, I can’t promise absolute compliance.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 135 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, though a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’ll just take a look in your ears, nose and throat. Ears and nose appear normal. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Palpating your abdomen now... Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Slightly decreased bowel sounds. And finally, I’ll check your reflexes. Reflexes are slightly diminished. Now, let's take a look at your weight and height. Weight is 148lbs, height is 187cm. That confirms the weight loss you mentioned. Mr. Vantine, your weight is down 7lbs in 6 weeks. Your heart murmur is also new.
PATIENT: A murmur, you say? That is… unsettling. I hadn’t noticed anything amiss, though, as you know, my self-awareness isn’t what it once was. And the weight loss, of course, is concerning, especially in conjunction with the other symptoms. I confess, Doctor, I’m beginning to suspect that my…enthusiasm may have exceeded my capabilities. What is your assessment, Doctor? Is it something grave?
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, it's good you came in. The weight loss and the new heart murmur are concerning. The diminished bowel sounds and reflexes, along with your fatigue and decreased appetite, point to a possible underlying issue. It’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation, but your symptoms could be indicative of several things, including malnutrition, a cardiac issue, or potentially even something more serious. Given your age and these findings, I want to order some blood work to check your nutritional status, kidney and liver function, and rule out any infections. I also want to get an EKG to assess your heart rhythm and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Blood work, an EKG, and a chest X-ray… a rather comprehensive assessment, Doctor. It sounds… thorough. And, given your assessment, undoubtedly prudent. Yes, absolutely. I am entirely agreeable to those tests. Anything that might shed light on this… situation is welcome. I confess, the prospect of "something more serious" is rather unnerving. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed at your convenience. And do let me know if there's anything I should do to prepare for these tests.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No special preparation is needed for the blood work, but for the EKG, we'll need you to lie still for a few minutes. The chest X-ray requires you to hold your breath briefly. The lab technician will give you detailed instructions. I'll also have my nurse schedule you for these tests today. In the meantime, I recommend stopping all fad diets immediately. Focus on eating a balanced diet with plenty of protein and nutrients. And please, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness – go to the emergency room immediately. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and we’ll discuss the next steps then. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds entirely acceptable. Ceasing the…enthusiastic dietary approaches is a relief, frankly. I confess, I was beginning to suspect they weren’t entirely sustainable. And I shall certainly heed your warning regarding new or worsening symptoms. I shall remain vigilant. I appreciate your thoroughness and your… frankness, Doctor. It’s reassuring to be under your care. Please, do let me know if there's anything else I should be aware of in the interim.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vantine. Just rest, eat well, and listen to your body. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your tests. She'll also give you a printed summary of our discussion and instructions for the tests. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been most attentive and thorough. I am grateful for your expertise and your…concern. I shall endeavor to follow your instructions diligently. And I shall await your assessment with…patient anticipation. Thank you once again, Doctor Finco.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vantine. Please take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
