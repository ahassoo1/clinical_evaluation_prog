DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this light sensitivity, really. It’s been getting worse lately. Everything seems just…too bright, you know? Even on cloudy days. It makes my eyes ache something awful.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Light sensitivity… and you say it’s been worsening recently. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. It started maybe… six months ago? Just a bit of squinting in the sun, nothing major. But now, even the lights inside… like, these fluorescent ones here… they bother me. And computer screens are really tough. Makes my head pound if I look at them too long. It’s just… uncomfortable. It’s a bit hard to explain, it’s not painful exactly, just… really irritating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's progressed over the last six months, starting with just some squinting and now affecting indoor lights and computer screens. You described it as irritating rather than painful… is that accurate?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s a good way to put it. “Irritating” is the best word. It's not like a sharp pain, more like… my eyes feel strained, tired. And sometimes, if it’s really bright, I get a bit of a headache behind my eyes. It's hard to focus, too, when the light is bothering me. Sorry, I’m not very good at explaining medical stuff. I just know what it feels like.
DOCTOR: You're explaining it perfectly well, Arbin. Don’t worry about using medical terms; I can sort that out. Strained, tired eyes, headache with bright light, and difficulty focusing… that gives me a good starting point. Now, has anything changed in your life around the time this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… around six months ago… well, that’s when my wife, Ama, passed away. It was quite sudden, a heart attack. Everything kind of blurred after that, to be honest. I was mostly… inside, dealing with things. Not much sun exposure then. Maybe that’s something? I don’t know if grief can cause something like this, but it was a pretty rough time.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry to hear about Ama, Arbin. That must have been incredibly difficult. It's certainly possible that stress and grief can manifest in physical ways. We'll explore all possibilities. Aside from the grief, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the light sensitivity?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It… it still feels raw, you know? As for other symptoms… let me see. My eyes feel dry sometimes, especially when I'm reading. And I think… maybe my vision’s a bit blurry when I wake up in the morning, but it usually clears up after a bit. Nothing major, just… not as sharp as it used to be. And I’ve been feeling a bit more tired than usual, but honestly, that could just be everything else. It's hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes, some morning blurriness, and increased fatigue… thank you. I see here you've had a few routine check-ups with Dr. Mensah. Anything in your past medical history that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Dr. Mensah… yes, a good doctor. Nothing really, not that I recall. I had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox… but nothing chronic, no serious illnesses. I’m pretty healthy, usually. I try to eat well, though I haven't been doing much cooking lately, to be honest. I take a multi-vitamin, just to be safe. My Medicare covers that, thankfully. I had a cataract in my left eye a few years back, but it was removed, and my vision was good after that. It wasn't related to this, though – that was a completely separate thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no chronic conditions, routine check-ups, a history of cataract removal that seems unrelated… and you take a multivitamin. Good. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Never had any problems with medications before. I can take most things without issue. Ama was the one with allergies, pollen mostly. I always felt lucky I didn't inherit that! She was always sneezing. Sorry, getting off track… no allergies from me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Arbin. It's perfectly natural. Okay, no allergies. Now, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any other medications besides the multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, just the multivitamin. That's it. And sometimes, if my head is really bothering me, I'll take a bit of paracetamol, just the over-the-counter kind. But not regularly, maybe once or twice a month if that. And I stopped taking that last month, actually, around the same time this light sensitivity started getting worse. I just thought I could try to deal with it without medication if possible. It's probably nothing, just a coincidence.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the multivitamin and occasional paracetamol, which you’ve recently stopped taking. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your eyes, if that's alright with you. It will involve shining a light in your eyes and asking you to follow my finger. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I'm just hoping we can figure out what’s going on. It's just… tiring, you know? Everything being so bright all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arbin. Please sit facing forward and look straight ahead. I’m going to shine a light in each eye, one at a time. It’s important to not stare directly into the light. Just relax and focus on something in the distance. Okay… Now, follow my finger. Up and down… left and right… good. And now the left… up and down… left and right. Okay… I’m seeing some mild redness in both eyes, and your pupils seem to be reacting normally to the light. Your vision is a bit blurry, but that could be due to the strain you’re experiencing. I'm also noticing dryness on the surface of your eyes. It's not severe, but it's something to be aware of. I would like to check your intraocular pressure to rule out any other possible causes. It's a quick and painless test. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. If it's quick and painless, I’m happy to go ahead. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It's been bothering me more and more lately. I hope it's nothing serious. It's just… with everything else that’s been going on… I don't need another thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Arbin. We'll take things one step at a time. This test measures the pressure inside your eyes. I'm going to gently touch a small probe to the surface of each eye. It will feel like a quick tap. Try to relax and blink normally. Okay… just a quick tap… good. And now the left… there we go. Okay… the pressure is within the normal range. That's good news. Based on the examination, your symptoms – light sensitivity, dry eyes, strain, and some blurriness – could be due to a few different things. It could be simple eye strain, possibly exacerbated by grief and emotional stress, or it could be a mild form of dry eye syndrome. It's also possible you're experiencing a migraine, even without a severe headache. Migraines can present with light sensitivity as a primary symptom. Given your recent history and the absence of any other concerning findings, I’m leaning towards eye strain and dry eye syndrome. However, to be on the safe side, I would like to prescribe some lubricating eye drops to see if that provides some relief. If your symptoms don't improve within a week, or if they worsen, I recommend scheduling an appointment with an ophthalmologist for a more thorough evaluation. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Lubricating eye drops, I can definitely try those. And scheduling an appointment with an ophthalmologist if it doesn’t get better. That makes sense. I’m just hoping I can get back to reading again. I haven't picked up a book in months, and I miss it. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any specific type of eye drops I should ask for, or anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: I’m glad to hear that. And I understand wanting to get back to reading. For the eye drops, I’m prescribing artificial tears, specifically one that's preservative-free. Preservatives can sometimes irritate the eyes further. You can find these over the counter at most pharmacies. Use them as needed, typically 4-6 times a day, or more frequently if your eyes feel particularly dry. In addition to the drops, try to take frequent breaks when reading or using a computer. The 20-20-20 rule can be helpful: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Also, ensure your room is adequately lit, but not overly bright. Avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight without sunglasses. And please, if you’re feeling overwhelmed or struggling with grief, don’t hesitate to reach out to a support group or counselor. Taking care of your emotional well-being is just as important as taking care of your physical health. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: That's all very helpful, thank you, Doctor. 20-20-20 rule… I’ll try to remember that. And I will keep the emotional well-being thing in mind. It’s been… a tough few months. I think that covers everything. No, I don't have any other questions right now. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. It was my pleasure. Remember, if your symptoms don't improve or worsen, please don't hesitate to schedule an appointment with an ophthalmologist. And take care of yourself. Have a good day, and take care.
