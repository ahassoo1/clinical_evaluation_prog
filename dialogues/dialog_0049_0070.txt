DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Nestingen, you say? Yes, yes. New doctor. I… moved here. From… somewhere. It’s all a bit blurry, to be honest. Just thought I should… check in. Medicare wants me to, you know. Social thing. Not feeling bad, exactly. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Right. "Old," as you say. Well, we all get there eventually. Medicare physicals are… standard. Still, it's good to be proactive. Perhaps you could elaborate a little?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What does that mean? Look, I do faces. Make them pretty. For… shows. Theater. I used to… travel a lot. But now I'm here. That’s enough elaborating for one day, I think. Are you going to poke me with things? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: "Do faces," you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Makeup. I am a makeup artist. The best, really. Used to work with… important people. Singers, actresses… though, names escape me these days. It's a very precise job, you know. Lots of blending. And contouring. Not like… what these young girls do now with all the glitter. Real makeup.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a professional makeup artist. And you’re here for a routine Medicare physical, despite… not feeling particularly unwell. Just to satisfy the requirements. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. Satisfy the… requirements. It’s a bother, really. Wasting my time. Though… I suppose it’s better than… what they would do if I didn’t come. Paperwork, I hate paperwork. Do you have a lot of paperwork?
DOCTOR: We have some standard forms, yes. But let’s focus on you for a moment. You mentioned not feeling particularly unwell. Are there any changes you’ve noticed, however small?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Let me think. Everything feels a bit… slower, I guess. Like an old car trying to start on a cold morning. And my back… sometimes aches. When I bend over. Which is… often. All this makeup, you know. It's not easy work. But aches are normal. Everyone gets aches.
DOCTOR: Slower… and back aches when bending. Any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiating? Like… sunshine? No, no sunshine. My legs are… legs. They get tired. From standing, mostly. And walking. A lot of walking, in the old days. Before… before things slowed down. Are we getting somewhere with this? I don't like sitting for long. It makes my… everything stiff.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fatigue in the legs with prolonged standing and stiffness with sitting. And this has been… gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual? Yes, I think so. Like… a slow leak in a tire. You don't notice it at first. Then suddenly… you’re stuck. That sounds right. Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? I do faces. I'm not good with… tire metaphors.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. Just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs… standard things. Can you stand for me, please?
PATIENT: Stand? Oh, wonderful. More standing. Fine. But be quick about it. My knees aren’t what they used to be. And please don't poke too much. Honestly, the indignity of it all…
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A bit elevated. Heart rate is regular, but slightly fast – 82. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally, but diminished at the bases. Posture is slightly stooped, and gait is a little slow and shuffling. Do you experience any dizziness when you stand up?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Sometimes. When I get up too fast. It’s… wobbly. Like jelly. Not all the time, though. Mostly just… a feeling of being off-balance. It’s nothing serious. I just… take my time. Old people do that, you know. We don't rush. Especially when getting up from chairs. It's a recipe for disaster, otherwise.
DOCTOR: Orthostatic symptoms – dizziness upon standing. We’ll need to check that more formally. Could you bend forward for me, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Bend? Oh, lovely. This is just what my back needed. Oof. Like an old tree creaking in the wind. There. I bent. Happy now? Don't expect miracles. I'm not a gymnast. And it hurts, you know. Just a little.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion, with reported pain upon flexion. Some muscle spasm noted. Tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine. Negative straight leg raise. Alright. I'm going to order some blood work, just to get a better picture of what's going on. And an X-ray of your lower back. That's all for the exam for now.
PATIENT: Blood work? X-rays? More poking and prodding. Wonderful. Fine. Do what you must. But if you find anything too terrible, please don’t tell me. I don't want to know. Just… fix it. If you can. And make it quick. I have things to do, you know. Faces to paint.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. I’ve ordered the blood work and X-ray. The lab is just down the hall – they'll take care of you. Once the results are back, we can discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting and taking over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen, as needed. And try to stay moving, even if it’s just a little bit each day. I'm also going to recommend a physical therapy evaluation. It may help strengthen your core and improve your balance. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Physical therapy? More poking, I assume? No, no questions. Just… when will this be over? And will I have to come back here for more of this? Honestly, this whole thing is a nuisance. Ibuprofen, you say? Fine. I’ll try it. But don’t expect miracles. And please, just tell me when I can leave.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back in a few days. The X-ray results might take a little longer. You will need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine if physical therapy is appropriate. The receptionist can help you with that. For now, try the ibuprofen and stay active. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe pain, weakness, or numbness – please seek medical attention immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Clear enough. Ibuprofen, stay active, don’t die. Got it. Honestly, all this… worrying. I’m an old man, not a broken vase. Just tell me where the receptionist is, and I’ll get this over with. The sooner I’m out of here, the better.
DOCTOR: The receptionist is right over there. She'll schedule your follow-up appointment and address any insurance questions you may have. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Szmyd. .
PATIENT: Patience? Hmph. Faces… always faces. That's all people care about. Not about aching backs and wobbly knees… .
