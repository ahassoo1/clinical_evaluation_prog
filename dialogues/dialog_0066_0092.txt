DOCTOR: Hi Oreste, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Doc... Condray, you say? Yes, yes. Well, it's this… breathing. Gets harder, you know? Like… like trying to suck air through a straw. And my mouth… feels like the desert. Eyes too. Dry as anything. I don't know why it's happening. It just... is. Been going on a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. Time… slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds quite uncomfortable. Trying to breathe through a straw is a good way to describe it. And the dryness – mouth and eyes – that's helpful to know. Okay, let me take a look at your chart here. Just to confirm, you're Oreste Guilds, and today is August 2nd, 2025?
PATIENT: Guilds, yes. That's right. August… the second? Seems about right. Days all blend together, really. I mostly just… keep things moving, you know? Traffic and all. Not much time for calendars. Though… I think I remember a birthday recently. Or was that last month? Oh dear. Don't mind me. Old man things.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t worry about it at all. It’s perfectly understandable. We can sort through things. So, this breathing difficulty and dryness... has it been getting worse gradually, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually… I think. Hard to say for sure. It’s not like one day I was fine and the next… poof. Just… more and more effort, you know? Like pushing a heavy cart uphill. And I gotta sip water constantly. Used to not need to do that. Back in the day… we didn’t bother with all this water drinking. Just… tough it out. Different times, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been a gradual worsening, requiring more effort to breathe and more frequent sips of water. And you've noticed a change from not needing to drink as much water previously. Have you had any cough with this, Oreste?
PATIENT: Cough? Hmm… sometimes. Not a big one. Just a little tickle. Mostly when I lie down, I think. Like something’s trying to get out, but… nothing really comes. A dry little cough. Not like a… a smoker’s cough, or anything. I never smoked. Bad habit. Always thought so.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry cough, mostly when lying down, and not a productive cough. Good to know. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, Oreste?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me see… They look… normal to me. Maybe a little… puffy? But I always had big ankles. Runs in the family, I think. My mother… she had big ankles too. And feet. Never could fit into nice shoes.
DOCTOR: I see a little bit of swelling, yes. It's subtle, but present. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, thinking about other symptoms... have you experienced any chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath even when you're resting?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. A little discomfort sometimes, like… a tightness. But not pain. And dizziness… not so much. I get a little lightheaded if I stand up too fast, but that’s just… old age, I figure. Shortness of breath… well, that's always there now, isn't it? Even when I'm sitting. Gets worse when I walk, of course. But it's… constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no chest pain, but some tightness. Lightheadedness with standing, and constant shortness of breath that worsens with activity. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of, like heart problems, lung disease, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that’s a question. Doc… I've been to a lot of doctors in my time. Traffic work, you know? Always getting banged up. But… what did they say? My memory… it’s like a sieve. Something about… high blood pressure, maybe? Years ago. Took some pills for a while. Stopped taking them. Didn’t seem to be doing much good, and I didn’t like all the side effects. As for… lung disease? Not that I know of. Never smoked!
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that was treated with medication, but you stopped taking it due to side effects. And no known lung disease. We’ll try to get a more complete picture, don't worry. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just… the occasional aspirin, you know? For my knees. Traffic work… gets hard on the joints. And I take a little vitamin D in the winter. The sun… doesn’t shine much here, does it? That’s about it. Nothing regular. I try not to load up on pills. Makes me feel… sluggish.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional aspirin for your knees and vitamin D in the winter. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’ve ever noticed. I eat everything. Cuban food, you know? We put everything in our food. Never had a reaction. And I haven’t been stung by a bee in… well, I don’t even remember! So, no. I don’t think so. No allergies. Lucky me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and oxygen levels, and take a look at your throat. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Do what you need to do, Doc. I’ve had doctors poke and prod me all my life. Just… try not to take too long, eh? Got things to do. Traffic doesn’t move itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, listening to your heart now… I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, but it’s not terribly concerning at this point. Now I’m listening to your lungs. Your breathing sounds are a bit diminished, with some faint crackling sounds in the lower lobes. That’s consistent with some fluid buildup. Your blood pressure is 150/90 on both arms, which is elevated. And your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. Your throat looks clear, but it’s a little dry. Okay, that gives me a little more information. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I suspect that you may be experiencing some congestive heart failure, which is when the heart isn’t able to pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. The fluid buildup in your lungs and the crackling sounds I heard support this. But we need to do some further testing to confirm this diagnosis. I would like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG, and possibly a blood test to check your kidney function and levels of certain hormones. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Congestive… what-now? Heart… failure? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Fluid in the lungs… that explains the breathing, I guess. Never had any chest pain though. Always thought… if your heart was failing, you’d feel it, you know? X-rays and… EKGs? Blood tests? Oh boy. Sounds like a lot of poking and prodding. Look, Doc… I appreciate you trying to figure this out. But I really need to get back to work. Traffic… it doesn't wait for anyone. Can't we just… give me something for the breathing? Some kind of… inhaler, maybe? I just need to be able to breathe while I'm directing traffic.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Oreste, and I apologize for the potentially alarming news. You’re right to question things. It’s true that chest pain isn't always present with heart failure, especially in the early stages. However, it’s important to rule out serious underlying conditions before simply treating the symptoms. While an inhaler might provide some temporary relief, it won’t address the root cause of your breathing difficulties. And, importantly, it could mask symptoms that are important for us to monitor. The tests I’m ordering – the chest X-ray, EKG, and blood tests – are relatively quick and painless, and they will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. We can schedule these tests at the clinic, and I’ll explain the results to you in detail as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I can prescribe a mild diuretic to help reduce some of the fluid buildup, which might ease your breathing a little. However, it’s crucial that you follow up with me as soon as you’ve had the tests, so we can determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Diuretic… that helps with the fluid, you say? That… sounds better than nothing. And you’ll explain everything, you promise? I don’t want to be poking around in hospitals all day. Traffic… I have a schedule to keep. Alright, Doc. Fine. Do your tests. Give me the water pill. But please… make it quick. And explain it to me… in plain English. None of that medical jargon. I’m just an old man trying to keep traffic moving.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Oreste. I promise to explain everything in plain English, and we'll move as quickly as possible. I understand your need to get back to work. Okay, I'm prescribing furosemide 20mg to be taken once daily in the morning. This will help your body get rid of excess fluid. Be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Also, watch out for dizziness or lightheadedness, and if you experience either, sit down or lie down immediately. Here’s the prescription. I’ll also have the clinic schedule you for a chest X-ray and EKG as soon as possible. Someone will call you with the appointment times. I strongly advise you to avoid strenuous activity until we get the test results, and if your symptoms worsen, please come back to the clinic immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Water pill… got it. No strenuous activity… alright. Traffic isn’t that strenuous, is it? Just a lot of pointing. Um… what if I get dizzy while I’m directing traffic? That’d be… bad. Very bad. And… what does this pill do exactly? You said it gets rid of water. But… where does the water go?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Oreste. It would be bad if you got dizzy while directing traffic. That’s why it’s so important to be cautious. If you feel dizzy at all, pull over immediately and sit down. Don’t try to push through it. As for the pill… furosemide works by telling your kidneys to remove extra water and salt from your body through your urine. So, the water goes out through your bladder – you’ll be urinating more frequently. It’s important to stay hydrated so you don’t become dehydrated. Think of it like… releasing pressure from a balloon. The excess fluid is the pressure, and the pill helps to release it. But you need to replenish the air – in this case, water – to maintain the right balance. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Release the pressure… alright. Like a balloon. I can understand that. More water… got it. Um… will this pill interact with my aspirin? I take that for my knees. And… is this something serious, Doc? Really serious? I don't want to… well, I don't want to be… incapacitated. Traffic… people depend on me.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Oreste. It’s good you’re thinking about potential interactions. Yes, there can be a slight interaction between furosemide and aspirin. Taking them together can increase the risk of stomach upset or bleeding. I recommend taking the aspirin at least two hours after taking the furosemide, and with food. If you experience any stomach pain, black stools, or any unusual bleeding, stop taking the aspirin immediately and contact me. As for whether it’s serious… it’s too early to say definitively until we have the results of the tests. However, the symptoms you’ve described – shortness of breath, swelling, fatigue – could indicate a more serious underlying heart condition. That’s why it’s so important to get a proper diagnosis. Right now, we’re taking a cautious approach. The diuretic will help manage your symptoms, but it’s not a cure. We need to find out what’s causing the problem so we can develop the right treatment plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Not a cure… just managing symptoms. That doesn’t sound good. Stomach upset… black stools… oh dear. I don’t need any extra problems. Alright, Doc. Two hours after the pill. No black stools. I’ll try to remember. But… if it is something serious… what happens then? Will I have to… stop directing traffic?
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions just yet, Oreste. We need to get the test results first. If it turns out to be a more serious heart condition, the treatment options will depend on the specific diagnosis. It could involve medication, lifestyle changes, or in some cases, a more invasive procedure. Whether you would have to stop directing traffic would depend on the severity of the condition and the treatment plan. We would discuss all of your options and work together to find a solution that works for you. We’ll do everything we can to help you maintain your quality of life. Right now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and seeing what they reveal. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… get the tests done. And… explain everything. In plain English. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate you… trying to figure this out. Traffic… it’s a lot of responsibility. Just… please, be quick.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Oreste. I’ll do my best. We’ll get those tests scheduled as quickly as possible, and I'll explain everything to you in plain English, step-by-step. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, Oreste, and try not to worry too much.
