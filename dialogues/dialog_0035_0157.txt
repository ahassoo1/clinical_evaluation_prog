DOCTOR: Good morning, Tasmia. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. It’s not like I feel sick.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s good you’re getting it checked out, even if you aren't feeling symptoms. High blood pressure often doesn't cause symptoms until it’s been going on for a while, and that’s why it's important to monitor it. The nurse did mention your blood pressure was elevated during your initial check. Can you tell me a little more about when you first found out about it, or when you were first told you had high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember the exact date. My husband makes all the doctor appointments, and he tells me what they say. He said something about it being high at my last check-up, maybe six months ago? I just… try not to dwell on things. It’s stressful enough as it is.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember the specifics. Six months ago is helpful to know. And I appreciate you being honest about trying not to dwell on things – that’s a common feeling. So, has your husband mentioned anything about you starting any medications for it at that time?
PATIENT: No. He would have made me take something if he had. He's very… proactive about these things. He said to just watch my salt intake, and that’s what I’ve been doing. Mostly. It’s hard with his mother cooking all the time. She loves salt.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no medications prescribed previously, and you’ve been trying to manage it with diet, focusing on salt intake. That’s good. And it sounds like that’s been a bit of a challenge with your mother-in-law's cooking. We can definitely talk about strategies to navigate that. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? What do you want to know? I work. I'm tall, so I stand a lot. And I don't eat a ton of junk food, even if my mother-in-law tries to feed it to me. I haven't been sick sick in years. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. It sounds like you're generally quite healthy. Just trying to get a full picture. Have you had any major medical problems in the past – things like diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. My family is strong. We don't get those things. My grandmother lived to be ninety-eight. Ninety-eight! She ate frybread every single day. So, no. Nothing like that. Just… this blood pressure thing. Which, frankly, I think the nurse was exaggerating.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know about your family history – a grandmother living to ninety-eight is wonderful. And I understand your skepticism about the blood pressure reading. However, it’s important we take it seriously. Let’s just do a quick check now to get our own baseline. It only takes a minute. Can you please sit comfortably with your back supported and your feet flat on the floor?
PATIENT: Fine. But don't be surprised if it's normal. I told you. All this worry over nothing. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay... 158 over 92. Hmm. And your pulse is 78 and regular. Alright, so that is elevated. It confirms the nurse’s reading. It’s higher than we’d like to see, even allowing for some normal variation. It’s important we investigate this a little further, even if you don't have symptoms. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’ve never had an allergy in my life. Honestly, I don’t understand why we’re even bothering with all this. I feel perfectly fine. Is this going to take much longer? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tasmia. But high blood pressure is often called a "silent killer" because it doesn't always feel bad, even when it's damaging your body. We want to prevent any long-term problems. Okay, no allergies, that’s good. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. My husband makes me take it. He says it's good for my energy levels. That's it. Don't waste your time writing that down. It's not important. I need to get back to work. We have a deadline.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just to be thorough, and because you mentioned being tall and standing a lot, have you ever experienced any dizziness, vision changes, or headaches?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Look, I appreciate you trying to do your job, but I’m perfectly healthy. I eat good food, I work hard, and I don't sit around complaining. This is a waste of my time. My husband is going to be furious if I’m late. Can we just… wrap this up?
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concerns about time. Given your blood pressure readings, and because it's important to rule out any underlying causes, I would like to order some basic blood work. It will check your kidney function, electrolytes, and cholesterol levels. And I’d also like to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. These are routine tests, and will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But I’m not paying for any of this. My insurance is the only thing covering this ridiculousness. And tell the nurse to hurry. I have a job to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood work now, and we’ll get the EKG done as well. The nurse will explain the process. I’ll review the results when they come back, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a referral to a cardiologist for a consultation, just to get another opinion. .
