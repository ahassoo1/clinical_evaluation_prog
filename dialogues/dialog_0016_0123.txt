DOCTOR: Hi Carla, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s really bothering me, especially at night. It’s just… constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant itching. That sounds really uncomfortable, especially when it's keeping you up at night. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it's all over, really. My arms, my legs, even my back. It doesn’t look bad, there’s no rash or anything, just… the itch. It started a few weeks ago, maybe a month? I thought it would go away on its own, you know? I tried some lotion, but that didn’t help much.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s been going on for about a month, all over your body – arms, legs, back – and there's no visible rash, just the itching itself. Lotion hasn't provided much relief. Okay. Just to get a better picture, would you describe the itch as more of a burning, stinging, or more of a deep, uncomfortable sensation?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s not really a burn, definitely not stinging. I’d say… a deep, uncomfortable sensation, yeah. Like right under the skin. It makes me want to scratch all the time, but scratching doesn’t really help, it just… feels good for a second, then it's back. You know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do know exactly what you mean – that temporary relief followed by more itching. A deep, uncomfortable sensation under the skin… okay. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… I haven’t really noticed anything specific. It seems to be just… always there. Maybe a little worse after I shower? The hot water feels good at first, but then afterwards, the itch comes back stronger. And I don't know if this matters, but I've been a little more stressed lately, with… well, things. But I don’t know if that’s connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's pretty consistent, maybe a little worse after showering, and you've been under a bit more stress recently. Stress can definitely play a role in skin issues. Now, let's talk a little more broadly. Have you had any other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no weight loss, no tiredness… just the itch. I haven’t noticed any changes in my… bowel habits, or anything like that. Just the itch, honestly. It’s just so annoying. And it’s keeping me up at night, which is just making everything worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no other symptoms – no fever, weight loss, fatigue, or changes in bowel habits. Just the persistent itching, and it’s impacting your sleep. Let me ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. And I had a hysterectomy a long time ago, but other than that, not much. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk every day when the weather is nice. I don’t really have any allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, well-controlled with medication, and a hysterectomy in the past. No known allergies. That’s good to know. And you mentioned walking regularly, which is excellent. What medications are you currently taking, if you remember?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the lisinopril for the blood pressure. I think that’s it. I used to take something for cholesterol, but the doctor took me off of it a few years ago, said my numbers were good enough. Nothing else, really. Just the lisinopril. I usually take it every morning with breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, just lisinopril for the blood pressure, taken daily. Good. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Has anyone in your family had skin problems, like eczema, psoriasis, or severe allergies?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother had dry skin, always complained about it, but I don’t think it was anything serious. My grandmother had some sort of rash when she was little, but I don't know what it was. Nobody really talked about medical things much in my family, you know? It wasn’t really a thing. I don't remember anyone having allergies, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had dry skin, and your grandmother had a rash as a child, but no known history of eczema, psoriasis, or severe allergies. I understand that medical history wasn't widely discussed in your family. And just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. Well, I’m divorced, been that way for a long time. I live alone, mostly. I have a daughter and a grandson, I see them pretty often. I don't smoke, never have. I used to drink a little wine with dinner, but I cut back on that a while ago. I don’t really travel much anymore, mostly just stay around here. And like I said, I walk when the weather's nice. Pretty simple life, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, divorced, live alone, close relationship with your daughter and grandson, no smoking, limited alcohol consumption, and you enjoy walking. That's good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll just take a look at your skin, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your overall health. It will just take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. I just want to get this itch figured out, it’s really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here, and I'll start with your skin. Okay. Your skin looks normal, no rash or anything obvious. Your heart and lungs sound good. I don’t see anything immediately concerning on the exam. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing something called pruritus – which is just the medical term for itching. There are many possible causes, from dry skin to stress, allergies, or even certain medications. Because the itching is all over and not related to a rash, it makes some of those causes more likely than others.
PATIENT: Oh, pruritus… that sounds fancy! So, it could be a lot of things? I was worried it was something serious. What do we do now, Doctor? Do we need to do any tests? I don’t really like tests if we don’t have to, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, "pruritus" is just the medical term. And you’re right, it can be a lot of things. That’s why it’s important to rule out any serious causes first. Given your history and the exam, I don’t think extensive testing is needed right away. But I do want to start with a few simple things. First, let's try a more emollient moisturizer, something fragrance-free, and apply it liberally several times a day, especially after showering. We can also try an oral antihistamine at night to see if it helps with the itching, especially while you sleep. I'd also like to check a complete blood count just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. That's a simple blood test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds reasonable. A better lotion and a pill at night… I can definitely try that. And a blood test… well, I don’t love them, but if you think it’s important, I guess I can do it. I just… I don’t really like needles. Is it a lot of blood? And will I have to fast or anything? I always forget those things.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about the blood test. It’s a very small amount of blood – just a few vials. And no, you don’t need to fast. You can eat and drink normally before the test. I’ll write you a prescription for a fragrance-free emollient lotion and an oral antihistamine. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll take care of the blood draw. Let’s try these things for two weeks and see if they help. If the itching doesn’t improve, or if it gets worse, we can consider other possibilities and maybe see a dermatologist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, two weeks. Lotion and a pill, then blood work. That sounds… manageable. I’m glad we’re not jumping to a lot of big tests right away. And I'll come back if it doesn't get better, or if it gets worse. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's just so frustrating when you itch all the time!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. I understand how frustrating constant itching can be. That's what I'm here for. Here are your prescriptions and the lab order. The lab should be able to take care of everything quickly. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And I look forward to seeing you again in two weeks to check on your progress. Have a good day, and I hope you find some relief soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I think that’s everything. I'll go get the blood work done now.
