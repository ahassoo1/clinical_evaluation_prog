DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… Alcorta, actually. Delano Alcorta. And frankly, it’s about my eyesight. It’s been… deteriorating, shall we say. It’s rather inconvenient, and I assure you, I’ve noticed. It’s not as if I haven’t.
DOCTOR: Alcorta, yes, apologies for that. And thank you for clarifying. Deteriorating eyesight... alright. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s difficult to describe, precisely. Things aren’t… sharp anymore. More blurry around the edges, I suppose. And it’s not a sudden thing. It’s been… gradual. Though I wouldn't claim to be an expert on the mechanics of vision, naturally. It just… is. It’s simply… frustrating. I used to be able to read the fine print on contracts without any trouble, and now... well, let’s just say it requires… effort.
DOCTOR: I understand. Gradual blurring, difficulty with fine print… that's helpful. And you're right, it's frustrating when something changes like that. Roughly, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It's been… at least six months, perhaps longer. I don’t make a habit of tracking these things, Doctor. I've been… occupied. It wasn't a dramatic event, you understand. Just a slow… dimming. Perhaps a year. It’s difficult to pinpoint precisely, really. Time tends to… blur, as it were. A rather unfortunate turn of phrase, considering the circumstances, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A very apt phrase, actually. A year… alright. Has the blurring been consistent, or has it gotten worse recently?
PATIENT: Worse recently, undoubtedly. It's… noticeable. I had to ask my nephew to read the disclaimer on a form just last week. A rather… humiliating experience, if I'm being frank. He’s a good boy, but… well, he doesn’t possess my attention to detail, you understand. It’s not something I’d normally require assistance with. And it’s not as if I’m completely unable to see, Doctor. It’s just… less precise. I find myself straining, you see. And the headaches are… becoming more frequent. A dull ache, mostly behind the eyes.
DOCTOR: Okay, worsening blurring, requiring assistance with reading, and headaches behind the eyes. That’s all important information. Are the headaches constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go, Doctor. Not a throbbing, debilitating pain, thankfully. More of a… pressure. A constant, low-grade annoyance. They tend to flare up when I’ve been… concentrating intently. Reading, reviewing documents – things of that nature. And if I stare at a screen for too long, it’s… exacerbated. Although, frankly, I try to avoid screens whenever possible. They’re rather… vulgar, in my opinion. It’s not as if I require constant entertainment. Though my nephew insists I learn to use this “internet” thing. A waste of time, if you ask me. But the headaches… they're certainly more frequent lately.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, pressure-type headaches, worsening with concentration and screen time. That paints a clearer picture. Have you noticed any other changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me consider. No… flashes of light, no… floaters, thankfully. Though my peripheral vision… it feels… diminished. Not a complete loss, mind you, but… less encompassing, shall we say? It’s rather difficult to explain. It’s as if I’m looking through a… slightly narrowed aperture. And colours don’t seem as… vibrant. A subtle difference, perhaps, but noticeable to someone with my… discerning eye. I used to appreciate the nuances of autumn foliage, for example. Now… it’s just… less. It’s all rather unsettling, frankly. It’s not as if I’m prone to exaggeration, Doctor. I simply have a keen awareness of my surroundings.
DOCTOR: Diminished peripheral vision and colors appearing less vibrant… thank you for being so detailed, Mr. Alcorta. It helps me a great deal. Now, let's go through some general health questions. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing of the sort. I’ve always prided myself on maintaining a… robust constitution. I’ve never been one for… excessive indulgence. A glass of red wine with dinner occasionally, but nothing… untoward. No medications, no chronic illnesses. My blood pressure is… normal, as far as I know. I haven't subjected myself to a physician’s scrutiny in… some time, frankly. I’ve always felt… preventative care is… overrated. If something is amiss, it will make itself known, you see. I’m not one for unnecessary probing. And my nephew… well, he's not exactly a bastion of medical expertise. Though he insists I need to be “proactive.” A rather… modern concept, in my opinion.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known medical conditions, good. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve always been… careful. I avoid unnecessary risks. A minor extraction as a child, perhaps, but nothing… substantial. No major operations, no hospital stays. I’ve always been fortunate enough to maintain… physical integrity. I’m not one for subjecting myself to the… indignity of a surgical procedure unless absolutely unavoidable. It’s not as if I’m prone to accidents, you see. I have a rather… deliberate approach to life. And my nephew… well, he’s never needed surgery, thankfully. Though he did sprain his ankle playing that… “football” game. A rather frivolous pursuit, in my opinion. But no, no surgeries for me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family history… a rather… complicated subject, Doctor. My mother… she had some… issues with her eyes, later in life. Cataracts, I believe. Nothing debilitating, but required… intervention, eventually. My father… he was… remarkably healthy, all things considered. Lived a long life, but… not particularly forthcoming about his ailments. My… ex-wife… well, I try not to dwell on that subject. She had… allergies. A constant, low-grade sniffle, mostly. And my nephew… he’s perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Though he does have a rather… alarming fondness for sugary beverages. But no major hereditary conditions, as far as I’m aware. It’s not as if my family is prone to… catastrophic illnesses, Doctor. Mostly just… minor inconveniences.
DOCTOR: Okay, cataracts in your mother, allergies in your ex-wife. That's helpful. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I am aware of. I’ve always been… cautious about what I ingest. I prefer… natural foods, whenever possible. I avoid… processed concoctions, mostly. And I’ve never subjected myself to a battery of allergy tests. It seems… unnecessary, frankly. I’ve never experienced a… dramatic reaction to anything. A slight discomfort occasionally, but nothing… life-threatening. And my nephew… he’s allergic to… cats, I believe. A rather… common affliction. But no, no allergies for me. I’ve always been… remarkably resilient, Doctor. It’s not as if I’m prone to… sensitivities.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Thank you for that thorough history. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination, if that's alright. I'll check your vision, eye pressure, and look inside your eyes with a light. It won't take long. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must confess, I have a… certain aversion to being… prodded and poked. But if it’s necessary for a proper diagnosis, I suppose I can… endure it. I trust you’ll be… gentle? And I do hope it won’t be too… invasive. I’ve always valued my personal space, you see. Proceed, then. But please, be… expeditious. I have… commitments, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Alcorta. I'll be as gentle and quick as possible. Let's start with your vision. Could you please stand about ten feet away and read the smallest line you can see on the chart?
PATIENT: Honestly, the font is rather… minuscule. And the lighting is… suboptimal. I can… barely make out… E, F, P, Z… though the Z is… questionable. It’s rather blurry, you see. It’s not as if my eyesight is… optimal, Doctor. As I previously mentioned. I require… assistance, obviously.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. That indicates some vision loss. Now, let's check your peripheral vision. Can you tell me when you first see my fingers in your peripheral vision on either side?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult. They seem… muted. I can perceive… something on the periphery, but it’s… indistinct. On the left… I believe I see a… faint blur. And on the right… perhaps a… shadow? They’re not as… prominent as they should be, Doctor. It’s as if I’m looking through a… narrow tunnel. I’m not entirely certain, you see. My peripheral vision is… diminished, as I previously indicated. It’s not as… encompassing as it once was. A rather… unsettling sensation, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to shine a light into your eyes to check your pupils and look at the back of your eyes. This won’t hurt, but it may be a little bright. Please just relax and look straight ahead. Okay. I see some mild clouding of the lens, which could be early cataracts. Your pupils are responsive to light, but there’s some slight narrowing of the blood vessels in the back of your eyes. Overall, your retinas appear healthy, but there's some evidence of mild optic nerve pallor. It’s not dramatic, but something we’ll want to monitor.
PATIENT: Clouding of the lens… optic nerve pallor… Frankly, Doctor, this is… disconcerting. It’s not as if I’m prone to… ailments. Clouding of the lens… is that… serious? And what of this… “pallor”? It sounds… ominous. Is this something that requires… immediate intervention? I assure you, I have… commitments, you understand. I cannot afford to be… incapacitated. Is there a… simple remedy? A potion, perhaps? Or a… dietary adjustment? I do strive to maintain a… healthy lifestyle.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Alcorta. It's natural to be worried when you hear these terms. The clouding of the lens is consistent with early cataracts, which are a very common age-related change. They develop slowly and usually don't cause significant vision loss for many years. We can monitor them with regular check-ups. The mild optic nerve pallor is a bit more concerning, and it could indicate a number of things, including elevated pressure inside the eye or reduced blood flow to the optic nerve. To determine the cause, I’d like to order a few tests: a visual field test to map your peripheral vision more precisely, an optical coherence tomography scan to get a detailed image of your optic nerve, and a measurement of your eye pressure. It’s possible these are simply minor changes, but we need to rule out anything more serious, like glaucoma. There isn’t a “potion” or dietary adjustment that will reverse these changes, unfortunately. But early detection and management can help slow down the progression and preserve your vision. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Glaucoma… A… rather alarming prospect. And these… tests… are they… invasive? Will they require… needles? I must confess, I have a… pronounced aversion to medical procedures. And how long will these… tests take? I have… commitments, you understand. Perhaps a condensed version is available? A… streamlined assessment? I’m not one for… protracted examinations. And what of the cost? I am… not currently insured, you see. It’s a… complicated situation. I do strive to be… prudent with my finances. I trust you’ll be as… expeditious as possible, Doctor. And that the results will be… conclusive. I do abhor… ambiguity.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Alcorta. Let me address them one by one. The visual field test is non-invasive. You'll simply look into a machine and indicate when you see lights flashing in your peripheral vision. It takes about 20-30 minutes per eye. The OCT scan is also non-invasive. A machine will scan your eye with a light beam to create detailed images. It takes about 10-15 minutes per eye. Neither test involves needles. Regarding the cost, I understand you are uninsured. Our clinic does offer a payment plan for patients without insurance, and we can discuss that with our billing department. I’ll also see if we have any financial assistance programs available. The total cost for these three tests is approximately $500, but we’ll work with you to make it affordable. As for a “streamlined assessment,” unfortunately, these tests are necessary to get a clear picture of what’s going on. We can’t make an accurate diagnosis without them. I assure you, I’ll do everything I can to make the process as quick and comfortable as possible. And I will explain the results to you in detail, with clear and concise language, so you can make informed decisions about your care. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: $500… Very well, Doctor. Though I must confess, it’s a… substantial sum. A payment plan is… acceptable, I suppose. And I trust your billing department is… accommodating? I do abhor… unnecessary paperwork. And I insist upon a… detailed explanation of the results. No medical jargon, you understand. I require… clarity. Very well, then. Schedule these… tests. But please, be as… expeditious as possible. And inform me of the… precise time and location. I have… commitments, you understand. And do ensure the… equipment is properly sanitized. I have… standards, you see. And I trust you’ll handle my… personal information with… discretion? It’s a… complicated situation. Proceed, then. But please, be… thorough. I do abhor… incompetence.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your concerns and I assure you, we’ll handle everything with the utmost care and discretion. I’ll have the scheduling department contact you within the next hour to arrange the tests. They’ll be able to discuss the payment plan in detail and answer any questions you have about the cost. The tests will be performed here at the clinic, and all equipment is thoroughly sanitized after each use. I’ll personally review the results with you as soon as they’re available, and I’ll explain everything in plain language, with no medical jargon. I want you to feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is… sufficient, for the moment. Ensure your scheduling department is… prompt. I do abhor… delays. And please, be… thorough. I trust you are… competent. Very well, then. I shall await their… contact. Proceed with… diligence, Doctor. And do ensure a… positive outcome. I have… commitments, you understand. Good day, Doctor.
