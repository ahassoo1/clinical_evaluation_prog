DOCTOR: Hi Kahrin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hi Doctor. Just the results, please. I’m pretty busy, so if we could just get straight to it, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Let’s get right to it then. I have your results here from the bloodwork we took last week. Before I go through them, just to be thorough, can you remind me what specifically prompted the bloodwork?
PATIENT: Oh, um… honestly? It was part of a work thing. New job, they just wanted everyone to get checked. It wasn't anything I asked for, specifically. I don’t really know what they were even looking for, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So, the results are generally within normal limits. Your complete blood count, metabolic panel, and lipid panel are all looking good. There’s one thing that’s slightly elevated – your Vitamin D level is a bit low. It’s not drastically low, but it’s something we should address. Do you have any symptoms that might be related to that – things like fatigue, bone pain, or muscle weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… fatigue, yeah, I guess. But honestly, who doesn't feel tired these days? I work pretty long hours. Bone pain… no, not really. Muscle weakness… sometimes, but I just figured that was from carrying stuff around at work. Logistics, you know? Lots of lifting. Is it… is it a big deal?
DOCTOR: It’s good you brought that up – distinguishing between what’s normal for you and what might be related to the Vitamin D is important. It’s not usually a serious problem, but low Vitamin D can contribute to fatigue, and long-term, it can affect bone health. Given your long hours and physical work, it's plausible that’s contributing to the fatigue as well. To be on the safe side, I recommend a simple course of Vitamin D supplementation. We can start with a daily dose of 2000 IU for a few months and then recheck your levels. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. 2000 IU… sounds fine. Is that… a pill? Because if it’s one of those huge ones, I might have trouble with it. I’m not great at swallowing pills. Can you get it as a liquid or something? And does it interact with anything? I drink a lot of coffee, just warning you.
DOCTOR: Good questions! Yes, it comes as a pill, but it's a fairly small one. We can definitely look into a liquid form if you prefer – it’s no problem at all. Let me check our formulary to see what liquid options we have available. As for coffee, Vitamin D doesn’t directly interact with caffeine, so you’re good there. However, coffee can interfere with calcium absorption, and Vitamin D helps with calcium absorption, so just be mindful of spacing them out a bit. Try to avoid drinking coffee right before or after taking the supplement. Let me just see what liquid options we have… We have a chewable tablet, or a liquid drop. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Hmm… a drop sounds easiest, honestly. Less to swallow. That'd be great. So, how long do I need to take it for? And, uh, how much does all this cost? I don’t have insurance, so… I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, liquid drops it is. You'll take it daily for about three months, and then we’ll recheck your Vitamin D level to see if it’s improved. Let me see… the liquid drops are about $15 a bottle, and one bottle should last you a month. So roughly $45 total. We also have a discount program for patients without insurance, let me check if you qualify… Yes, you do! With the discount, it'll be closer to $30 total. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: $30… yeah, that’s… manageable. Okay. So three months of drops, $30 total, check my levels again after that. Anything else I need to do? I really do have to get going soon, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Just to recap, you'll take the Vitamin D drops daily, and we'll recheck your levels in three months. No other changes needed. The nurse will print out a summary of our discussion and instructions for you, as well as a prescription for the drops. She can also schedule your follow-up appointment to recheck your levels. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you. Seriously. I appreciate you not making me sit here all day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kahrin. I understand your time is valuable. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the meantime. .
