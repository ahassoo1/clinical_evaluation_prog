DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor Pitmon. It’s… well, it’s difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been experiencing a bit of unsteadiness. A feeling of being off balance, you see. It’s been happening for… some time now, I believe. Though, to be truthful, my recollection isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: Unsteadiness, you say. And you’ve noticed this for “some time now,” but aren't quite sure how long?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. It’s frustrating, I assure you. Dates… they slip away. It feels like months, perhaps? Or longer. It’s hard to pinpoint. It's not constant, thankfully. Comes and goes. But when it does happen… it’s unsettling. I work with… machinery, you see. Rotary drills. Precision is rather important in my line of work.
DOCTOR: Right. Machinery… rotary drills. Important work. And you're concerned about maintaining your balance while operating them. I understand. So, it’s intermittent… comes and goes. Can you describe what it feels like when you’re unsteady?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s not dizziness, exactly. Not a spinning sensation. More like… a weakness, perhaps? A feeling that my feet aren't quite… anchored. As though the ground is shifting beneath me, though I know it isn't. It’s difficult to explain. It’s not painful, just… worrying. And occasionally, a little disorienting. I have to concentrate to keep myself upright, you see. It's… tiring.
DOCTOR: Not a spinning sensation, but a feeling of weakness, like your feet aren't anchored, and requiring concentration to stay upright. Alright. And has this affected your ability to work?
PATIENT: Yes… It has. Not consistently, thankfully. But there have been… close calls, you see. Moments where I’ve had to pause, to regain my footing. I’m very careful, of course. I wouldn’t want to endanger myself, or anyone else. My supervisor has noticed, I believe. He hasn’t said anything, but I’ve felt his gaze… watching me. It’s a bit unnerving. I try to compensate, to be extra cautious, but… it’s difficult to mask entirely.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it's impacting your work, and you're self-conscious about it. Have you noticed anything that brings on these episodes?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question, Doctor. I wish I knew. There doesn’t seem to be a pattern, at least not one I've been able to identify. Sometimes it happens after a long shift, when I’m fatigued, perhaps? But other times it occurs when I’m feeling quite rested. Standing for long periods… possibly? But I do stand for long periods at work, and it doesn’t happen every time. It’s… frustratingly unpredictable, you see. I’ve been trying to pay closer attention, to identify any triggers, but… no luck so far.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable, you say. Alright. Let’s move on to some other questions, then. Have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, or ringing in your ears recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No headaches, not that I recall. And my vision seems… normal. Perhaps a little strained after a long day, but nothing unusual. And no ringing in my ears, either. No, I haven’t experienced any of those symptoms. I… I wish there was something specific, you see. Something concrete to explain this. But it’s just… this unsteadiness. It’s very isolating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had any falls as a result of this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: …Yes. One. Just the one, thankfully. It was… a few weeks ago, I believe. At home. I was reaching for something on a high shelf, and… lost my balance. It wasn’t a serious fall, thankfully. Just a bit of bruising. I was shaken, of course. But I didn’t seek medical attention. I thought it was just clumsiness, a momentary lapse in concentration. But now… now I’m not so sure. It worries me, you see.
DOCTOR: A fall… Okay. And have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s… a difficult question. I wouldn’t say consistent weakness. But… sometimes, after a long shift, my legs feel… heavy. Sore, perhaps? It’s not a debilitating weakness, not at all. But it’s not the same as simply being tired. It’s… a different kind of fatigue. Hard to explain, you see. And occasionally, my grip feels… less secure. But again, it’s intermittent. I work with heavy machinery, so some soreness is to be expected, of course. But I do wonder… if it’s more than just that.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a brief physical exam. Can you stand for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. Though, please excuse me if I… wobble a little. I’ll try my best to remain steady.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just stand normally for a moment. Can you close your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes… I can close my eyes. It feels… unsettling to be off balance without being able to see.
DOCTOR: Okay, you can open your eyes now. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax your arms. Reflexes are… a little diminished. And now, let's check your coordination. Can you touch your finger to my finger, and then touch your nose?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. It feels… awkward. I'm not usually this clumsy. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s okay. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 128/76. Pulse is 72. Now, let me check your ears. Ears appear normal. Based on what you've told me, and the brief exam, I suspect this could be related to a few things. Given your fall, the diminished reflexes, and the coordination issues, we need to rule out some possibilities. We'll start with some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, especially B12, and to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also want to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and an MRI… Yes, that sounds… sensible. I appreciate you taking this seriously, Doctor. It’s been quite unsettling, not knowing the cause. Vitamin deficiencies… an MRI… Yes. I trust your judgment. It's… a relief to have a plan. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Alright. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could put you at risk of falling, or that require a lot of concentration and coordination. Be especially careful when standing for long periods, and avoid any heavy lifting. If you experience any new symptoms, such as headaches, vision changes, or weakness, please contact the office immediately. We'll schedule the blood work and MRI as soon as possible. I'll have my nurse give you the paperwork and instructions. And I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist for a second opinion, just to be thorough. Does that all sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very thorough. Avoiding activities, contacting you if symptoms worsen, neurologist referral… Yes, I understand. Thank you. I… I appreciate your patience. It’s difficult to explain these things, you see. And… it’s frightening, not knowing what’s happening. But I feel… better now, having a plan. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. It's my job to help, and I understand it can be frightening when you don't know what's going on. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and we’ll see you soon. .
