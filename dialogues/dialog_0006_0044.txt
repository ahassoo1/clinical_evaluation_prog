DOCTOR: Alright, Calin, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Gorga. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, to be honest, I’m here because I need to see if I qualify for some help at home. I was told this is where I start to figure that out – for home health or hospice, if needed. I’m just… a bit unsure about the whole process, really.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Home health, hospice… a lot of folks get those mixed up. Okay. Let's start with why you think you might need that kind of help. What's been going on?
PATIENT: Well… it’s my mother. She’s been getting weaker, you see. She’s 87, and she’s always been so independent, but lately… things are just getting harder for her. She’s having trouble with… everything, really. Getting out of bed, cooking, even just remembering things. It's worrying me quite a bit. I’m trying to help, but I work, and… well, it’s a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, 87. And this has been… how long now?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? It was small things at first, just forgetting where she put her glasses or needing a little help with the TV remote. But it's gotten steadily worse over the last three months, I’d say. It’s… noticeable. It's not like a sudden thing, just a gradual decline. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yeah, gradual decline is common. Okay. And what about… physically?
PATIENT: Well, she's gotten very weak in her legs. She used to love her garden, but she can’t even walk to it now without help. She uses a walker, but she still feels unsteady. And she tires very easily. Even simple things like getting dressed… it takes her a long time and she gets breathless doing it. I worry about her falling, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has she… seen a doctor about this weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, she has. She saw Dr. Ramirez, her regular doctor, about a month ago. He did some tests, and he said it’s… well, he said it's likely age-related frailty, and maybe some mild cognitive impairment. He suggested some physical therapy, but it’s… hard for her to get motivated, you know? And I don't have the time to take her every day. He mentioned looking into home health, which is why I’m here. Do you need the name of her doctor’s office?
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright for now. Dr. Ramirez… good. Okay, so frailty and some cognitive issues. Has she been evaluated specifically for dementia or Alzheimer’s?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I… I don’t think so. Dr. Ramirez didn’t mention anything about that specifically. He just said her memory was a little fuzzy sometimes, but he didn’t do any formal testing for dementia. I suppose I could ask, but… she doesn’t really like going to the doctor if she can avoid it. She gets very anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. And is she on any medications currently?
PATIENT: Yes, she is. Let me see… she takes something for her blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And she has something for her cholesterol, too – Atorvastatin. And… oh, yes, she also takes a baby aspirin every day. She’s been on those for years. I think that’s it. I can get you a complete list from Dr. Ramirez’s office if you need it.
DOCTOR: That would be helpful, actually. A complete list would be great. Okay. And any allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I know of, honestly. She's never really had any serious allergic reactions. She gets a little itchy sometimes when she's in the garden, but I think that’s just from the plants. No known drug allergies or anything like that. I’ve never heard her mention anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about her living situation?
PATIENT: She lives in her own home. She’s been there for over 50 years. It’s a small bungalow, very well-kept. I live about 20 minutes away, and I try to visit as often as I can. She’s very independent, as I said, and she’s always been fiercely proud of keeping her house in order. It's... it’s her safe space, you know? It’s just getting harder for her to manage everything now. I’m worried about her falling or something happening when she’s alone.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, independent living, but increasingly difficult. And you're concerned about falls and safety. Alright. Before we talk about home health specifically, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I understand. That makes sense. Anything to help figure out what she needs. Please, go ahead. I’ll just sit here and… try not to fidget too much. I’m a bit nervous myself, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just have her sit here, and we'll start with her blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll just listen to her heart and lungs. And I’ll take a quick look at her reflexes and check her balance. Nothing too invasive, just a quick assessment. Blood pressure first. Could you just extend your arm?
