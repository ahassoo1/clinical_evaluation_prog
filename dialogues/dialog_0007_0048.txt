DOCTOR: Hi Colt, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Though, I’ve seen better chairs, if you don’t mind me saying. It’s these…episodes, I suppose you’d call them. I get confused. Not all the time, mind you. But enough to be…troublesome. My wife, she worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, troublesome episodes of confusion. I understand. Can you tell me a bit more about these episodes?
PATIENT: More about them? What is there to tell? I just…get lost in things. Like, I’ll be in the middle of something – fixing a tile, usually – and then…where was I? What was I doing? It's not like I forget everything, you understand. I remember dates, numbers…important things. It’s just…the flow of what I’m currently doing gets…interrupted. Like a broken radio signal. It’s frustrating, to say the least. Especially when I’ve got a deadline.
DOCTOR: Right, a disruption in your current train of thought, more than a complete memory loss. And it seems to happen most often when you’re actively engaged in a task, like fixing a tile?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Though it’s not always tile, you know. Sometimes it’s just…thinking about something. Planning what I need to get at the store. But mostly the work. My wife says it’s because I push myself too hard. Women always think they know best. But I’ve been setting tile for forty years, Doctor. I know my limits. Or I thought I did.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Colt. It's helpful to get a sense of when these episodes occur and what you're doing. Just to be thorough, and to get a clearer picture, could you describe what it feels like when this happens?
PATIENT: Feels like…a fog, I suppose. Not a bad fog, not scary. Just…thick. Like someone turned down the lights in my head. Everything slows down. I know I should be doing something, know what I should be doing, but the steps…they just don’t line up. It’s like trying to read a book with blurry letters. Frustrating, as I said. And then, usually, it clears up. After a minute, maybe two. But it's enough to throw off my whole day. It's embarrassing, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, a "fog" that slows things down, makes it difficult to follow your train of thought, and lasts a minute or two. That’s very helpful. Now, has this been happening for a long time, or is it something new?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not new. It's been creeping up on me, I’d say, for…maybe six months now? At first, it was just a little bit. I’d misplace a tool, forget what I was saying mid-sentence. Annoying, but nothing major. But lately…it’s been happening more often, and it lasts longer. My wife, she’s the one who insisted I come see someone. Said I wasn’t myself. Women. They notice everything. But she’s right, I suppose. It is getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually worsening over the past six months. And it's impacting your daily activities more noticeably now. Have you noticed any other changes along with this – any trouble with your vision, speech, or coordination?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Vision’s fine. Always been 20/20, if a little tired at the end of the day. Speech is clear enough, I think. Nobody’s ever complained. And my coordination…well, I still manage to set a perfect tile, don’t I? Though sometimes my hands ache a bit, but that's just old age, I reckon. Forty years of kneeling on concrete will do that to a man. It's just this…confusion. That’s what bothers me. Not falling down or forgetting my name, you understand? Just…losing my place.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no other neurological symptoms – no changes in vision, speech, or coordination, just the episodes of confusion. And it doesn’t seem to be associated with physical weakness or difficulty moving. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, now. Let me think. I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back, but they said it was just a flutter. Nothing to worry about. Fixed it with some pills, I think. And the doctor always tells me to watch my cholesterol, but honestly, I don’t pay much attention to that. I eat what I like, mostly. My wife tries to get me to eat healthier, but…well, you know how it is. I also had my gallbladder taken out, ages ago. Other than that…I’ve been pretty lucky, actually. Strong constitution, I always say. Though these episodes...they don't feel very lucky.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of a heart flutter that was treated with medication, gallbladder removal, and generally good health otherwise. Do you remember what medication you took for the heart flutter?
PATIENT: Hmm... now that's a good question. I was younger then, didn't pay as much attention to the details. I remember little white pills, that’s about it. The doctor at the time, Dr. Lim, he was a good man. He just said take these every day, and I did. For a while, anyway. Then he moved away, and I just…stopped taking them. Everything felt fine, so I figured I didn't need them anymore. Probably should have followed up, but…well, life gets in the way, doesn’t it? I remember he gave me a leaflet, though, listing all the side effects. I threw that away. Didn’t need to worry about those, I thought.
DOCTOR: Okay. You were prescribed medication for a heart flutter some time ago but stopped taking it when you no longer saw Dr. Lim. And you don’t recall the name of the medication. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure pills. Small orange ones. The doctor prescribed those a few years back. Said my numbers were a little high. I take one every morning with my coffee. And…sometimes, my wife makes me take a multivitamin. She says I need it, to keep my strength up. But I forget sometimes, honestly. I'm not one for all those pills and powders. Give me a good meal and a hard day’s work, and I'm right as rain.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, you take a blood pressure medication and occasionally a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, touch anything, breathe anything. I've lived a long life, Doctor, and I’ve been lucky enough to not have a single allergy bother me. My wife is the one with the sensitivities, always checking labels, worried about gluten and dairy and…well, you name it. But me? I’m a pretty simple man. Tough as nails, I like to think. Though these episodes…they're making me feel anything but tough.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, stroke, dementia, or Alzheimer’s?
PATIENT: Hmm...that's a tough one. My mother, she had a weak heart, I think. She passed away when I was young, before she was sixty. And my father, he just…slowed down as he got older. Didn’t really know what was wrong with him, just lost his sharpness. Never really talked about it much. My sister, she’s still alive, lives in Phnom Penh, she’s always been healthy as a horse. No real medical problems in the family, that I know of. We didn’t really keep track of those things. Just dealt with whatever came along. We were too busy surviving. It wasn’t like it is today, with doctors and tests and…well, all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of a mother with heart problems and a father who experienced cognitive decline with age. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, eh? Well, I work. A lot. Tile setting is hard work, Doctor. It keeps me busy, keeps me moving. I’m on my feet all day, lifting, bending, squatting. I eat pretty much what I want, like I said – not always the healthiest, I’ll admit. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a beer with dinner now and then. And I definitely don’t smoke. Never have. Never will. I get enough sleep, usually. Though sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking about deadlines or…well, just things. Mostly, I just try to keep busy. Can’t stand being idle. Makes me feel useless. My wife tries to get me to relax more, but it’s just not in my nature. I've always been a worker. Always will be. It's what I do.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, you're a very active tile setter, you eat a fairly unrestricted diet, you drink alcohol occasionally, and you don't smoke. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing – and then listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also take a quick look at your neurological function – your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. I’ve had doctors poke and prod at me enough times in my life. Though, truthfully, I don't see what good it’ll do. It’s not like you can see the confusion, can you? It's not a broken bone or a bad heart. It’s just…a fog. But, go ahead. Get it over with. Let’s see what you find. Just don't expect miracles.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiratory rate is 16 and regular. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Coordination is intact with finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. No nystagmus noted. Overall, the neurological examination is unremarkable. Everything appears normal on the initial exam. Given your symptoms and the results of the physical, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your confusion. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? What for? You just said everything was normal. Seems like a waste of time and money, if you ask me. But, fine. Do your tests. I suppose it can’t hurt. Though I doubt you’ll find anything. It’s just this…fog. A little bit of confusion. Not something you can see in a blood sample. But, go ahead. Get it over with. Just don't expect miracles. And I hope it doesn't take too long. I’ve got work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Colt. It’s true that blood tests won’t directly show “confusion,” but they can help us rule out possibilities like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or electrolyte imbalances that can sometimes cause cognitive changes. I’m going to order a Complete Blood Count , a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel , a Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone test, and a Vitamin B12 level. These tests should give us a good starting point. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn't take long. They’ll draw some blood and the results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I’d like to ask you one more question. Have you experienced any falls or injuries recently?
PATIENT: Falls? No. Never fallen. Too proud for that, I suppose. Always been steady on my feet. And injuries…well, I’ve had a few bumps and bruises over the years, working with tile. But nothing serious. A scraped knee here, a sore back there. Nothing that a good night’s sleep didn’t fix. I’m a strong man, Doctor. I don’t fall. I build things. I don’t break them. So, no. No falls. No injuries. Just this…fog. And frankly, I’m getting tired of talking about it. Can I go now? I’ve got a deadline to meet.
DOCTOR: Alright, no falls or injuries. Okay, Colt, it sounds like you've been quite clear about your symptoms and concerns. We’ve covered a lot today. So, to summarize: You're experiencing episodes of confusion, described as a "fog" that disrupts your train of thought, primarily when you're actively working. This has been gradually worsening over the past six months. The physical exam was normal, and we've ordered some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We will call you with the results of your bloodwork. We should have those in about 3 business days. If they are normal, we can consider further testing, such as a CT scan of your brain or referral to a neurologist. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding tasks that require a high degree of concentration when you feel these episodes coming on. I also suggest having a family member or friend with you if you’re working on projects where safety is a concern. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: A CT scan? A neurologist? Now you’re just trying to scare an old man. I told you, it’s just a little bit of confusion. Nothing serious. I don’t need tests or scans or specialists. I need to get back to work. No. I don't have any questions. I’ve wasted enough time here already. Just…call me if anything important comes up. And please, don't expect miracles. It’s just a fog. A little bit of confusion. And frankly, I don't need all this fuss. Now, if you’ll excuse me…I’ve got work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Colt. I assure you, I'm not trying to scare you. I simply want to ensure we're thoroughly investigating all possible causes for your symptoms. We will contact you as soon as the results are available, and we can discuss the next steps at that time. If your symptoms worsen or you experience any new concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Thank you for coming in today. I wish you all the best, and I hope you're able to get back to work safely.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you. Just…don't expect miracles. .
