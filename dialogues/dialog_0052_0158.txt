DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I barely remember what it is I need. Something about a letter… for a pet, I think? My ex-husband… he’s always making things difficult. It’s probably something to do with that. I just… need the paperwork, I suppose. Is that what you do here? Paperwork?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed. We do provide documentation for various medical needs, and sometimes that involves paperwork related to supporting documents for other matters. To clarify, is this documentation related to the health of a pet, perhaps for travel or other legal requirements involving your ex-husband?
PATIENT: Legal requirements... ugh, don't even get me started. He wants to take the dog with him when he… when he moves. Somewhere hot, I think. Said something about needing proof the dog is healthy enough to travel. Honestly, I don't even know why he wants the dog. It's a perfectly good animal, but… men. I just need a letter saying it's okay, I guess. A simple letter. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, your ex-husband requires a health certificate for your dog to travel with him. That’s certainly something we can assist with. To prepare that certificate accurately, I'll need some information about the dog. Could you tell me the dog's name, breed, and age?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens, the details… Honestly, I try not to think about it too much. His name is… Winston, I think. Or is it Wilson? Something with a 'W'. He’s a big dog. A golden retriever, definitely. They’re fluffy. Age… hmm. He was a puppy when we got him… maybe five years old now? Give or take a year. I really haven't kept track. He's healthy though, very healthy. Runs around like a maniac, honestly. A bit of a pest, but a healthy pest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Winston – or Wilson, as you said – a five-year-old Golden Retriever. That’s helpful, thank you. It’s perfectly alright if you don't know the exact details, we can work with an estimate. To ensure the certificate is complete, I will need to perform a physical exam on Winston. This will allow me to verify his overall health and confirm he is fit for travel. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam… ugh. That means bringing him here? Honestly, he’s a handful. Sheds everywhere, jumps on people… But I suppose it has to be done. As long as it doesn’t take all day. I have… things. But yes, alright. A physical exam. When can we do it? I hope he doesn’t completely disrupt your practice. He’s a bit of a… character.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can absolutely accommodate Winston. We’re used to a variety of patients here, and we’ll do our best to make the exam as smooth as possible. How about we schedule it for this afternoon, say at 2:00 PM?
PATIENT: 2:00 PM… hmm. That should work, I think. As long as I can remember. Write it down for me, would you? I’m terrible with dates. 2:00 PM this afternoon. And… is there anything I need to bring? Besides the… furry menace? Anything special? I really don’t want this to be a disaster.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here is a card with the appointment details. For Winston, if you have any previous veterinary records, please bring those along. Otherwise, just bring Winston, and perhaps a leash and collar. Do you know if Winston is currently on any medications or has any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… I don't think so. He scratches sometimes, but I just figured it was normal dog stuff. Medications… no, I don't think he’s on anything. We’ve never had to give him pills or anything. He's usually pretty good about eating whatever I put down. I really haven’t paid much attention, honestly. My ex-husband usually handled all of that. He was… the 'dog person,' I suppose. Is that important? Should I be asking him? This is all so complicated.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like your ex-husband was primarily responsible for Winston’s medical care. We can proceed without that information for now, but if anything comes to mind later, please don’t hesitate to let me know. Just to confirm, no known allergies or current medications. Wonderful. Now, while we wait for Winston's appointment, is there anything else going on with your health that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no. I'm fine. Perfectly fine. Just a bit… stressed, I suppose. Dealing with him is always… an experience. But my health? No. Nothing at all. Really. I'm a very… resilient person. Don't bother worrying about me. Just get the letter done so I can be rid of this whole situation. That's all I need. Paperwork. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wrye. I understand. We will focus on getting the health certificate for Winston completed as quickly and efficiently as possible. In the meantime, if you happen to remember any details about Winston’s past health or vaccinations, please don't hesitate to share them during the exam. Otherwise, we'll see you at 2:00 PM this afternoon. Is there anything else I can assist you with before then?
PATIENT: No, no, I think that's everything. Just… 2:00 PM. I’ll try not to forget. And… thank you. For being patient with me, and with the… dog. Honestly, I appreciate it. I just want this all over with. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wrye. I understand completely. We’ll do our best to make this a smooth process. I'll see you this afternoon. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Have a good day. .
