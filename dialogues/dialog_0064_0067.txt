DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. Smetak, you said? Yes, yes. Well, it's this… pain. When I breathe deep. It’s been… a little while now, I think. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. It’s perfectly alright if the timing isn’t precise. We’ll figure it out. Pain when you breathe deep… can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it… it’s not a sharp pain, not like when I fell off the ladder a few years back. More like… a dull ache? Right here, in my chest. It gets worse when I try to take a big breath, you know? Like I can’t fill my lungs all the way.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, worse with deep breaths… alright. And is this pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. It’s… worse when I’ve been doing something. Like, moving boxes for my grandson, or… working in the garden. But when I’m sitting, resting… it’s not so bad. Sometimes I don’t even notice it.
DOCTOR: So, it's related to activity, and improves with rest. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I get… tired easier now, I suppose. But I'm an old man, so… Maybe that’s just getting old. No… cough or anything like that. Sometimes… a little short of breath, but that could be the heat, too. It’s been a hot summer.
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me everything, even what seems small. Fatigue and shortness of breath are important things to mention. Now, have you had any problems with swelling in your legs or feet recently?
PATIENT: Swelling… Now that you mention it… maybe a little. Not much. I just thought it was the heat, too. My feet always puff up a bit in the summer. But… maybe it’s a little more than usual. Not a lot, mind you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a better picture, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, like heart problems, lung issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh boy… let me think. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a long time ago, the doctor gave me some pills for it. I stopped taking them after a while, though. Didn't like feeling… foggy. And… I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s not what you’re asking about, is it? Honestly, I don't remember much else. Things get… jumbled.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Ruocco. We'll do our best to piece things together. High blood pressure… that's good to know. Do you remember what the name of the medication was?
PATIENT: No, no I don’t. Small white pill, I think. I just remember not liking how it made me feel. I just stopped taking it. My wife… she used to keep track of all that. But she’s… gone now. It’s all a bit blurry, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall specifics. We can look through your records. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis. The doctor gave it to me a few years back. It’s… a brown pill. I take one every day, helps with the stiffness in my hands. And… sometimes I take a vitamin D, when I remember. My grandson tells me I should.
DOCTOR: Alright, a medication for arthritis and occasional Vitamin D. Do you happen to know the name of the arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Umm… let me see… It starts with a “N”… No, wait… it’s… Naproxen! Yes, that’s it. Naproxen. I take one in the morning.
DOCTOR: Naproxen, good. Now, Mr. Ruocco, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. My wife used to say I had a cast iron stomach. Never had a reaction to any medicine, not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, Mr. Ruocco, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listening to your lungs and heart, and checking your blood pressure. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… don’t take too long, if you don’t mind. I have to get back and… well, there’s things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I’ll be as quick as possible. If you could just sit here, I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Okay, taking a deep breath… and another one… His heart sounds… a little muffled, but regular rhythm. Lungs… some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes, with slight wheezing on expiration. Blood pressure is… 145 over 88. A little elevated. And I do notice some mild pitting edema in his ankles. Alright, Mr. Ruocco. Everything seems to be… within reasonable limits, but we do need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Investigate further…? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it something bad? I just want to get back to… things.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean anything bad, Mr. Ruocco. “Investigate further” simply means we need to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The diminished breath sounds, the slight wheezing, and the elevated blood pressure and edema… they could be related to a number of things. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a blood test. The chest X-ray will help us look at your lungs, and the blood test will check your overall health and rule out any infections or other problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… blood test… Oh, dear. More things. Well… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I don’t like going to the hospital. Always a wait, and… it reminds me of my wife. But… if you think it's important, do what you have to do. Just… try to make it quick, please.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. I will do my best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I’ll write you a requisition for the chest X-ray and blood test. You can go to the hospital whenever it’s convenient for you. They’ll call me with the results. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a medication to help manage your blood pressure. It's a low dose to start, and we’ll monitor it closely. While we wait for the results, it's also important to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your legs, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room… That sounds… serious. But alright. I’ll try to remember. Worsening shortness of breath… chest pain… swelling. Medication for blood pressure… Thank you, Doctor. I hope it helps. I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll do our best to get you feeling better. This medication should help, and we'll adjust the dosage as needed. Here's a sheet with instructions on how to take it, and what to watch out for. Also, it’s important to maintain a healthy diet and get regular, gentle exercise, if possible. And if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. So, to recap: Chest X-ray and blood tests, blood pressure medication, monitor your symptoms, and call the office with any questions. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… try to make it quick, alright? I have things to do. Thank you for your help.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll do our best. And please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Here's the number for the office. Get well soon, Mr. Ruocco. And take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
