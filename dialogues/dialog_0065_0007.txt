DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My back… it is painful. I work with the fences, you see. It has been hurting for some time now, and it is not getting better. I would like to know what is causing this, and if it can be fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Painful back” – and you mentioned you work with fences. That gives me a starting point. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It is a… a dull ache, mostly. But when I bend, or lift something heavy… then it is a sharp pain. It goes right down my leg sometimes, too. Not all the time, but it does. It is worse at the end of the day, after I have been working.
DOCTOR: Alright. A dull ache with sharp exacerbations when bending or lifting, radiating pain down the leg… and worse at the end of the day. That sounds… typical, frankly. But we need to be thorough. When you say “down the leg,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: It is… down the back of my leg. From my hip, all the way to my foot, almost. Not always the whole way, sometimes just to my knee. And it feels… numb, a little. Like it is not fully awake, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Radiating pain down the posterior aspect of the left leg, to the foot at times, associated with numbness.” Yes, that is… useful. Do you notice anything that improves the pain?
PATIENT: When I sit down, it feels a little better. And… when I put ice on it. But not for long. It comes back. Sitting does not fix it, but it makes it easier to bear, for a little while. I do not know if that helps.
DOCTOR: It does. Sitting and ice providing temporary relief… okay. And has this pain been gradual, or did it start suddenly after a specific injury?
PATIENT: It was… gradual. It started small, just a little ache after work. Then it got worse, little by little. I did not fall or anything. Just… working. Lifting the posts for the fence, stretching the wire… the usual things. It has been maybe six months now, getting worse.
DOCTOR: Six months of gradual onset… that’s important. Let's move onto some other questions. Do you have any other medical problems – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I had a bad flu last winter, but… that is all. I am usually healthy. I have Medicare, so they check me every year. They did not find anything. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, they said. But this… this is more than that.
DOCTOR: Right. Medicare annual checkups… noted. And no diagnosed medical conditions. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No. I do not take anything. I prefer not to, if I can help it. I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but that is all. The doctor said my levels were low, so I take one pill a day. But that is not for the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D supplement seasonally. Good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or serious injuries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Nothing serious. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, climbing a tree. But it healed fine. And I had my tonsils out, when I was young. But nothing else. No surgeries. No bad accidents. Just the usual bumps and bruises from working.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant surgical history. And finally, does anyone in your family – parents, siblings – have similar back problems, or arthritis, or anything like that?
PATIENT: My mother… she had bad arthritis in her hands. Very bad. She could not even make a fist anymore. And my brother… he hurt his back lifting something heavy, years ago. He went to a chiropractor for it. It helped him, he said. But I do not know what was wrong with him. Just… his back.
DOCTOR: Okay. Family history of arthritis and a brother with back pain… noted. Now, I'm going to need to do a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That is fine. I understand. I want to know what is causing this pain. I just want it fixed, if that is possible. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie down on your back on the examination table for me. I'm going to start by palpating your spine to check for tenderness and muscle spasm. Then I'll check your range of motion and do some neurological tests. It might be a little uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything causes sharp pain. Okay, can you tell me if this is tender?
PATIENT: Yes. Right there… that is sore. And a little to the left… that hurts too. It is not a sharp pain, just… a deep ache. Like a bruise, almost. When you push on it… it makes my leg tingle a little. Not bad, just… a tingling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness noted over the lumbar spine, with some radicular symptoms – the tingling you’re feeling in the leg. Now, I’m going to have you bend forward, and try to touch your toes. I know it might be difficult. Let me know where you feel the pain.
PATIENT: Oh… that hurts. Down my leg, mostly. And in my back, of course. It is worse when I go further. I cannot touch my toes. Not anymore. It feels like something is pulling, down my leg. It is not a sharp pain, but it is… unpleasant. It is hard to explain. I stop bending when it gets too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. Limited range of motion, with radicular pain exacerbated with forward flexion. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs straight and relaxed. Now, I am going to test your strength. Can you lift your right leg straight up while I provide resistance?
PATIENT: It is… hard. It is weaker than it should be, I think. It feels… heavy. I can lift it, but not very high. And it hurts a little, when I try to push against you. It is mostly in my leg, that I feel it. Not so much in my back, when I lift it. It is a strange feeling. I am trying, Doctor. It just… does not want to go up very high.
DOCTOR: Alright. Decreased strength with right leg extension. Now, I will check sensation. I am going to lightly touch your leg in different spots, and tell me when you feel it.
PATIENT: Okay. I will tell you when I feel it. Yes, I feel that. And that… and that… oh, that one… I do not feel much there. It is… numb. Not completely, but… less feeling than the rest of my leg. It is hard to explain. It is like… a dullness. Like my foot is asleep, but not as bad. It is on the outside of my leg, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Decreased sensation on the lateral aspect of the right leg. Based on the physical exam and your history, Ms. Reihner, it appears you likely have lumbar radiculopathy – a pinched nerve in your lower back. The tenderness, limited range of motion, weakness, and sensory changes all support this. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I would like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will allow us to visualize the nerves and discs and identify the source of the compression. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes. That sounds… good. If it will tell us what is wrong, then yes, please. I just want to know what is causing this pain. And if there is something that can be done to fix it. A pinched nerve… is that serious? Will I need surgery? I do not want surgery, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's not jump to surgery just yet. A pinched nerve is quite common, and many cases can be managed with conservative treatment – physical therapy, pain medication, and sometimes injections. The MRI will help us determine the severity of the compression and guide our treatment plan. Most people do not require surgery. Surgery is typically reserved for cases where there is significant nerve damage or if conservative treatment fails. I will explain all of your options in detail once we have the results of the MRI. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, as MRI scans sometimes require it?
PATIENT: No. I do not have any allergies. I have never had an MRI before, so I do not know about contrast dye. But no, I do not think so. I have not been told I am allergic to anything. My doctor always asks, and I would know if I was, I think. Is the dye… bad? Will it make me sick? I get nervous easily, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. The contrast dye is generally very safe, but it’s important to ask. Some people experience a mild flushing sensation during the scan, but serious reactions are rare. We will discuss the risks and benefits in more detail before the scan. The radiology technician will also ask you about allergies before proceeding. I will write you a referral for an MRI at the imaging center down the street. They take most insurance plans, including Medicare. Once you have the scan, you’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that is all. Just the MRI, then come back and talk about it. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything. I am still nervous, but… a little less so. I will schedule the MRI tomorrow, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Reihner. I understand your nervousness, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have in the future. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
