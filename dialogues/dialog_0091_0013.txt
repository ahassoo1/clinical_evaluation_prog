DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Well, it's…trouble getting things going, you could say. When I gotta go, it takes a long time. And sometimes, it…doesn’t go all the way, even when I push. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, maybe a month. It's getting…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Hilber. I understand this can be a sensitive topic, and I appreciate you being so open. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about this difficulty?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, it just takes a long time to start. I sit there, and sit there...sometimes for a good five, ten minutes. And then, even when it does start, it feels…weak. Like it doesn't push everything out, you know? I have to…strain a bit. It’s not painful, exactly, but it's…worrying. I’ve been drinking plenty of water, like I always do, but it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s taking longer to initiate a bowel movement, and when you do go, it feels incomplete, requiring straining. And this has been happening for approximately a month, despite adequate hydration. Do you notice any blood in your stool, or around the rectal area?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no blood. Not that I’ve seen, anyway. Everything looks…normal, color-wise. Just…hard to get it all out, and takes a long time. I'm sorry, I don't know much about...well, about this. I just know it’s not right.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Hilber. You don’t need to be an expert in this, that’s what I’m here for. And it's good to hear you haven’t noticed any bleeding. Now, let's talk about your overall bowel habits. On a typical day, before this started, how many bowel movements would you usually have?
PATIENT: Usually…one, maybe two. Every day, pretty regular. I eat a good breakfast, lots of fish if we got it. Never had trouble before. This is new. It's just…different now. Makes me tired, too, straining like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a typical pattern of one to two bowel movements daily, and this change in pattern has developed recently. The fatigue you’re experiencing could certainly be related to the straining. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: My appetite’s been…okay, I guess. Not much different. But I have lost a little weight. My wife… well, my late wife, she always kept track of these things. I haven't been weighin' myself like she did. But my clothes feel a little looser, if that makes sense. Not a lot, but…noticeable.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing weight without intending to is something we should investigate. I’m sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Hilber. Now, thinking about your medical history, do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It's been a few years now. As for medical things… I got a little bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a while back. I take a pill for it, every mornin'. And my knees, they bother me sometimes, old age, I reckon. But that’s about it. Nothing else serious, that I know of. I get my checkups when I can, but it’s hard to get to town sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand it can be difficult to travel. So, you have a history of hypertension, managed with medication, and some knee pain. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… It's a little white pill. I think… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, that's it. Small pill, take it with my breakfast. Been taking it for maybe…five years now? Six? I’m not good with rememberin’ names, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. Lisinopril is helpful information. And no need to apologize about the names, we have your records to verify. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. When I was a young man, I broke my arm fallin’ off a roof. They fixed it up at the hospital in Anchorage. Other than that… no, nothin’ serious. Nothing since then. Just the usual colds and flus, like everyone gets.
DOCTOR: Alright, a fractured arm repaired in Anchorage as a young man, and otherwise no significant surgical history. Now, concerning your family, do you have any family members with a history of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or any other digestive issues?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother… she had some trouble with her stomach, when she got older. Always complainin' about pain. But I don’t know what it was, exactly. No one talked about much back then. My father… he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life. As far as I know, no one had…colon cancer, like you said. Mostly heart trouble in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, some gastrointestinal complaints in your mother, but no known history of colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. Do you currently use any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the pill for my blood pressure. I don’t really believe in all those vitamins and supplements. Seems like a waste of money, mostly. I try to eat good, that’s what my wife always said. Fresh fish, berries when they’re in season. That’s enough for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any trouble with that. I can eat anything, pretty much. My wife, she was allergic to shellfish. But I don’t have any problems with food or medicine. Nothing I know of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I'll also perform a digital rectal exam to assess your rectal tone and check for any abnormalities. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Well… a rectal exam? I ain’t had one of those before. It sounds…uncomfortable. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, I suppose I can do it. I trust your judgement. Just…let me know what you’re doin’, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. I understand your hesitation, and I’ll explain everything as I go. I’ll minimize any discomfort as much as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope to check for any unusual sounds. Please lie back on the examination table. Normal bowel sounds present, no bruits or murmurs detected. Now, I'm going to ask you to bend over, or lie on your side, and I will perform the digital rectal exam. It will only take a moment. I will let you know when I’m finished. Mr. Hilber, the rectal tone is normal. I do feel a small area of tenderness upon palpation in the anterior rectal wall, but no obvious masses or hemorrhoids are present. Stool is a dark brown color, with no visible blood.
PATIENT: Okay… that wasn’t as bad as I thought, but still not pleasant. What did you find, Doctor? That tenderness… is that bad? Is it somethin’ serious? I’m gettin’ a little worried now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hilber. The tenderness is mild, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it warrants further investigation. Given your symptoms – the difficulty initiating bowel movements, the sensation of incomplete evacuation, the recent weight loss, and this tenderness – I suspect we may be dealing with a few possibilities. It could be a case of constipation, but given the weight loss and tenderness, we need to rule out other potential causes such as diverticulitis, or even early signs of a colorectal issue. To help clarify things, I’d like to order a few tests. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of inflammation or anemia. I’d also like to order a stool test to rule out any infection or blood in the stool, even though you haven't seen any visible blood. And finally, I recommend a colonoscopy to visualize the colon and rule out any polyps, masses, or other abnormalities. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? That sounds…intense. What exactly does that involve, Doctor? And what about the cost? I’m on Medicare, but I don’t want to get a big bill I can’t afford. I’m gettin’ a little overwhelmed now, with all these tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Hilber, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel overwhelmed. A colonoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It’s usually performed with sedation, so you’ll be comfortable and likely won’t remember much of the procedure. It allows us to directly examine the lining of your colon for any abnormalities, and we can even remove polyps if we find any. Regarding cost, Medicare typically covers colonoscopies for screening purposes, especially for individuals over the age of 50. There may be some co-pays or deductibles depending on your specific plan, but our billing department can assist you with verifying your coverage and estimating your out-of-pocket costs. They can also work with you to develop a payment plan if needed. I want to assure you that this is a precautionary measure. It’s the best way to get a definitive diagnosis and rule out anything serious. Would you like me to have our scheduling department contact you to arrange a colonoscopy appointment?
PATIENT: Alright… if it’s covered by Medicare, and you think it’s the best way to find out what’s goin’ on, then I guess I can do it. I don’t want this hangin’ over my head. Yes, please have them contact me. But I’d like to know when they’re callin’, so I can be prepared. And maybe explain the process a little more, so I know what to expect. I get nervous easily, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. I completely understand your nervousness, and I’m happy to provide more information and ensure you feel as comfortable as possible. I’ll have the scheduling department contact you within the next two business days. They will explain the preparation process, which involves a special diet and bowel cleansing solution the day before the procedure. It’s not the most pleasant part, but it’s essential for a clear visualization of the colon. During the colonoscopy itself, you’ll be monitored by a team of medical professionals, including myself. We’ll start with sedation to ensure your comfort. The procedure typically takes about 30 to 60 minutes. Afterward, you’ll spend some time in the recovery area until the sedation wears off. We will discuss the results with you immediately after the procedure. If any polyps are found, they will be sent to a lab for analysis. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend increasing your fluid intake, eating a high-fiber diet, and engaging in regular physical activity. We can also discuss a stool softener if needed. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers it for now. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit. I’ll wait for the scheduling department to call. Just…try to call during the daytime, if you can. I don’t like answerin’ the phone late at night.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. I’ll make a note in your chart to request that the scheduling department contact you during daytime hours. We're committed to providing you with the best possible care, and we’ll be here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or experience any worsening symptoms before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. Take care, Mr. Hilber.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
