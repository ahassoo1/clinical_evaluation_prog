DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s good to meet you as well. Honestly, it’s a bit of a blur, trying to remember exactly why I scheduled this appointment. Something about my ears…and getting dizzy? My daughter, Lani, she was the one who made the appointment, really. She was worried. I’ve been having…episodes, she called them.
DOCTOR: Episodes, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, episodes. That sounds right. It’s like… everything spins, and I can’t really hear well when it happens. It doesn't last long, thankfully, but it’s… unsettling. And my mum…she used to get something similar, I think. Though, it was a long time ago. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. It’s all a bit foggy.
DOCTOR: Right. Foggy. And how frequently would you say these episodes occur, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. Not very often, thankfully. Maybe…once or twice a month? It's hard to say for sure. Sometimes it feels like longer between them, sometimes not. I don't really keep track, if that makes sense. It just…happens. It's usually in the mornings, I think. Or maybe evenings? Ugh, I'm sorry, I'm not being very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Mayhugh. We will get to the bottom of this. Do you notice anything specifically that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers? Hmm… No, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t seem to be connected to anything I’m doing. I’ve tried to think about it, but… nothing. I eat the same things, go about my day the same way… Sometimes it happens when I’m just sitting and reading, other times when I’m out and about. It’s just… random, I suppose. I do spend a fair bit of time at the club, though… the gambling club. But I can’t imagine that would be it, could it?
DOCTOR: A gambling club?
PATIENT: Yes, the Hibiscus Club. It's… well, it’s a place where people go to play the machines, have a bit of fun. I work there, actually. Part-time, you know? Mostly just checking IDs and making sure things run smoothly. Not much excitement, really. Though, it can get a bit noisy… lots of beeping and flashing lights. Do you think that could be it? The noise? I hadn’t really thought about it before…
DOCTOR: The noise and flashing lights could contribute, certainly. But let’s move on. Aside from the dizziness and hearing difficulty during these episodes, do you experience any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes I feel a little nauseous, a bit shaky, during the episodes, but it doesn't last long. And… oh, yes! A fullness in my ear, like there’s something blocked. It's hard to explain. And maybe a little headache sometimes, but I get headaches anyway, you know? Old age, probably. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what’s connected to what anymore. It all just feels…muddled. Is it alright if my daughter comes in? She’s very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: We can certainly have your daughter join us. But first, let's try to be as thorough as possible. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing between episodes?
PATIENT: Changes… between episodes? Oh dear. That’s a good question. I suppose… it's a little quieter than it used to be, overall. Not dramatically, but I find myself asking people to repeat things more often. It could just be getting older, like I said. My husband used to complain about my hearing, but… well, he’s gone now. It’s been five years. I just assumed it was a normal part of getting old. I really don’t know, Doctor. Everything feels so confusing.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any ringing in your ears, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Ringing? Now that you mention it… yes, sometimes. It's not constant, and it’s not very loud. Just a faint… buzzing, I suppose. It comes and goes. Mostly when things are quiet, like when I’m trying to sleep. It doesn’t bother me too much, usually. I just…ignore it. It’s always been there, I think. Or maybe it started recently? Oh, honestly, Doctor, my memory is just… terrible. I apologize for being so unhelpful. Perhaps my daughter really should come in?
DOCTOR: We’ll see. Before your daughter joins us, let’s review your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had high blood pressure, years ago. The doctor put me on medication, but I haven’t taken it in a while. I didn’t like the side effects, and I felt okay, so I just…stopped. Don't tell anyone I said that! And I had a bad fall last year, broke my wrist. That’s about it, I think. Nothing major. Oh! And arthritis, in my hands. It flares up sometimes, makes it hard to grip things. But other than that, I’ve been…relatively healthy, I suppose. I try to stay active, you know? Gardening mostly. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Gardening and stopping your blood pressure medication are both relevant. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies... Hmm. Not that I know of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything in the past. Well… I got a rash once, from a bug bite, but that wasn't an allergy, was it? And I can't eat mangoes, they give me a funny tummy. But that's just… a sensitivity, I think. Nothing serious. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good at remembering these things. It’s like my brain is full of cotton wool. Perhaps if Lani was here, she could tell you more accurately. She's very organized, my daughter.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Let's move on to past surgeries. Have you had any surgical procedures in your life?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries... Let me see. Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. That was a long time ago, of course. And I had a hysterectomy… goodness, must be forty years ago now? That’s about it, I think. Nothing else. I’ve always been a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to hospitals, so I avoid them if I can. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel a bit flustered. All these questions… Perhaps if my daughter could join us? She’s much better at remembering these details.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Mayhugh. Let’s have your daughter join us then. Perhaps she can provide some additional information. I’ll have a nurse bring her in. In the meantime, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Though, I warn you, I might not be very helpful. My memory is just… unreliable, you see. But please, do examine me. I’m sure whatever you find will be helpful. I just hope my daughter can fill in the gaps. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you trying to figure this out.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat on the examination table. I'll begin with your ears. This may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A little uncomfortable is… acceptable, I suppose. I do hope it doesn't take too long. My daughter should be here soon, shouldn't she? I just feel so… fuzzy-headed, you know? It's hard to concentrate when I can't remember things properly. Please be gentle, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There appears to be some cerumen buildup in the ear canal, obscuring the view. And the tympanic membrane appears slightly… dull. Cerumen impaction, right ear. Mild tympanic membrane dullness, right ear. Now, let's examine the left ear.
PATIENT: Oh… dull? Is that… bad? I do sometimes feel a bit blocked, like there’s something in my ear. But I just assumed it was…old age. Is there anything you can do about it, Doctor? I mean, about the buildup and the… dullness? And what about the dizziness? Is that connected to all of this? I'm starting to feel a bit anxious now.
DOCTOR: The cerumen impaction is quite common, Ms. Mayhugh. It can certainly contribute to a feeling of fullness and potentially affect your hearing. The mild tympanic membrane dullness is… less definitive. It could be related to the buildup, or it could indicate a slight fluid collection. As for the dizziness, it’s difficult to say definitively whether it’s connected at this stage. We’ll need to perform a few further tests to get a clearer picture. I’d like to schedule you for an audiometry test – a hearing test – and possibly a tympanometry to assess the function of your middle ear. And I’d recommend a thorough neurological examination to rule out any other potential causes for the dizziness. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Oh… tests… More tests? Goodness. It all sounds very… complicated. A neurological examination? Is that… serious? I just wanted to know why I keep getting dizzy and can’t hear properly! But… if you think it’s necessary… I suppose so. Though, I do get anxious about hospitals and tests, you know. Is there anything I can do to prepare? And… will my daughter be able to come with me? She’s much better at understanding these things than I am.
DOCTOR: A neurological examination is simply a routine assessment of your nervous system, Ms. Mayhugh. It's a precautionary measure, nothing to be alarmed about. And yes, your daughter is welcome to accompany you to all appointments. We can schedule the audiometry test for next week, and I’ll arrange a referral for the neurological examination. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a ceruminolytic – an earwax removal solution – to soften the buildup. Use it as directed for a week, and then we'll reassess. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies... No, not that I know of. I haven't had any reactions to anything in the past. Well... I got a rash once from a bug bite, but that wasn’t an allergy, was it? And I can't eat mangoes, they give me a funny tummy. But that’s just… a sensitivity, I think. Nothing serious. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good at remembering these things. It’s like my brain is full of cotton wool. I really wish my daughter was here. She would definitely remember something I’ve forgotten. Is it alright if we just schedule the tests, and she can help me with the medication details?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Mayhugh. I'll have the nurse schedule the audiometry test and the referral for the neurological examination. We’ll also provide you with the prescription for the ceruminolytic, and your daughter can assist with the details. I'll leave you to rest now. The nurse will be in shortly to discuss the next steps. Do you have any further questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time… and your patience. I know I haven’t been very helpful. Perhaps my daughter will be able to fill in the gaps. Yes, she's very organized. Thank you again. I think I just need to rest now. .
