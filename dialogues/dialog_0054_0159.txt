DOCTOR: Good morning, Elijiah. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, it’s kinda… embarrassing, honestly. I just have trouble gettin’ up out of a chair sometimes. Not always, but enough to be a pain. It’s been happenin’ for a couple weeks now, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: No need to be embarrassed at all, Elijiah. These things happen, and we’ll figure it out together. “Trouble getting up” – could you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not like… pain, exactly. More like… a weakness. Like my legs just don’t wanna go when I try to stand. I kinda have to… push with my arms, you know? And sometimes I feel a little wobbly when I do get up. It's mostly when I’ve been sittin’ for a while. Like, a good long sit. Not like, just a quick rest. It’s hard to explain, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness and a feeling of needing to use your arms to push off, particularly after sitting for a prolonged period, and some wobbliness when you stand. That helps. When you say "prolonged period," about how long are we talking?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Probably… half an hour or more. If I'm just watchin' TV or somethin', and really settled in. Sometimes longer, if I’m workin’ on somethin’. Out on the rigs, sometimes I’m sittin’ for hours at a stretch, waitin’ on things. Not ideal, I know. But that kinda stuff happens. It’s just… gettin’ harder to deal with. Especially gettin’ older, I guess. Though I ain't that old. Twenty-six. But still… feels like it sometimes.
DOCTOR: Twenty-six is certainly not old! It’s good you’re bringing this up now. So, the difficulty is more pronounced after longer periods of sitting, especially when you're stationary for work. Are you experiencing this difficulty in all chairs, or does it seem worse in certain types?
PATIENT: Good question. I hadn’t really thought about it, but… I think it’s worse in softer chairs. Like, real plush ones. The ones at the diner, mostly. The ones at work are kinda hard plastic, and I don’t have as much trouble gettin’ up outta those. And the chair at home… it's a pretty solid wood one. It’s not as bad in those either. So, yeah. Softer chairs, definitely worse. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. That's a helpful detail. And just to clarify, you mentioned the diner and work – is this happening primarily when you’re at those locations, or is it consistent regardless of where you are, but just worse with the softer chairs?
PATIENT: It’s… kinda both, I think. It happens at home sometimes too, but like I said, not as bad. So it's always a little harder when I'm in a softer chair, but I can have trouble even gettin' up from my own chair sometimes. Not every time, just… sometimes. It's kinda random, I guess. It's just been gettin' more frequent lately, that's the main thing. And worryin' me a bit. It feels… weird.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it's more frequent overall, and consistently worse in softer chairs, but can happen in other chairs occasionally. It sounds frustrating, and it’s good you’re paying attention to it. Before we move on, could you tell me about any other symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Well... nothin' really. No pain, like I said. No numb legs or anything like that. No dizziness when I get up. Just the weakness. And the wobbliness. I've been feelin' a little tired lately, now that I think about it. But I work long hours, so I figured it was just that. Nothin' major. Everything else feels normal, I guess. I can walk fine, climb stairs, all that. It's just this chair thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, numbness, or dizziness. Fatigue, but you attribute that to work, which is understandable. Normal walking and stair climbing. That’s helpful information. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Nah. Nothin’ diagnosed, anyway. I had a bad flu a few years back, but that’s it. Never been to the doctor much, honestly. Out on the rigs, you kinda take care of yourself. Patch yourself up, you know? I ain’t one for complainin’ or spendin’ money on doctors unless it's somethin' serious. Lost my wife a couple years back, and… well, things kinda changed after that. Just haven’t really prioritized my health, I guess. Not proud of it, but there it is.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Elijiah. I understand that life can throw challenges our way, and it’s common for health to take a backseat sometimes. It’s good you’re addressing this now. So, no past medical diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell outta a tree, but it healed up just fine on its own. Nothing else. I stay pretty healthy, I think. Just… this chair thing is worryin’ me. It just feels… off. And I don't want it gettin’ worse. That’s why I finally came in.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That's good to know. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mom had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandpa... he had somethin' with his joints. Arthritis, maybe? It was a long time ago, I don't remember exactly. My wife's side of the family was pretty healthy, as far as I know. She used to nag me about checkin’ up, so I figure they were all pretty good. But honestly, I don't know much about it. We didn’t talk about family history much. Not a big thing in either family, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal grandmother with high blood pressure, and a possible family history of arthritis. That's helpful. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work on oil rigs, like I said. Long hours, lots of physical labor sometimes, but also a lot of sittin’ and waitin’. I drink a little beer after work, sometimes more on weekends. I don’t smoke. I eat pretty much whatever’s available - usually diner food or sandwiches. I don't really exercise much, not intentionally anyway. Walkin' around the rig is about it. It ain't exactly a healthy life, I know. I try to get enough sleep, but it’s hard when you’re on shift. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Elijiah. It sounds like a demanding job with long hours and limited opportunities for regular exercise. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin'. I don’t take nothin’. Never really seen the point. I figure if I'm feelin' okay, there's no need to start messin' with things. I've seen some of the guys on the rig take stuff for aches and pains, but I avoid that kinda thing. I just tough it out, usually. I've always been pretty good at that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Elijiah, thank you for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a good understanding of your overall health and what's been going on. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just to check your strength, reflexes, and range of motion. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Sounds good. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what's goin' on, you know? Hopefully, it ain't nothin' serious. I got work to get back to, but I'll make time. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Great. First, could you please stand on the table for me?
PATIENT: Alright... standin’ on the table. This is kinda awkward, Doc. You sure this is necessary? Never had a doctor ask me to do this before. But okay, I’m standin’ here. What do you want me to do?
DOCTOR: I understand it’s not the most comfortable, Elijiah, but it helps me assess your balance and strength. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes. Just for a moment, to see how easily you can maintain your balance. Don’t worry, I’ll be right here to steady you if needed. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay... eyes closed. Feels… kinda wobbly already, Doc. You sure about this? I ain't too good with balance, even when I can see. Just let me know if I’m swayin’ too much, alright? I don’t want to fall and break somethin’. This table looks kinda hard.
DOCTOR: You’re doing fine, Elijiah. Just try to relax. I’m right here. You’re swaying slightly, more than I'd like to see. Okay, let’s open your eyes now. That’s good. Now, can you try to stand on one leg for me?
PATIENT: Stand on one leg... okay. Woah! Okay, that’s… not good, Doc. I'm losin' my balance fast. This ain’t gonna end well. I think I’m gonna fall. Seriously. Just… let me get down. This is a bad idea.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, that’s enough. You're right, let’s get you down. It’s good you recognized that wasn't safe. . Okay, Elijiah, based on that quick assessment, your balance is definitely impaired, and you have some weakness. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes and some strength in your legs. Can you sit down on the table please?
PATIENT: Okay... sittin' down. Much better. So, you think I'm weak and unbalanced? That don’t sound good, Doc. What could be wrong? Is it somethin' serious? I gotta get back to work, you know. I can’t afford to be laid up. Just tell me what you think, alright? No sugarcoatin’ it.
DOCTOR: . Alright, let’s take a look. I'm going to check your reflexes in your knees and ankles. Just relax your legs. It won't hurt, it's just a little tap. Okay, that response is a little diminished. Now, let's try the other side. . Okay, both reflexes are a little weaker than I’d expect. Now I’m going to ask you to push your feet against my hand. Just push as hard as you can. I’m going to resist your pushing, so try to push with all your strength. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay... pushin' against your hand. This is… harder than it looks, Doc. I’m pushin’ as hard as I can, but you're… pretty strong. It feels like I don't have much power in my legs. Is this bad? What's happenin'?
DOCTOR: Okay, Elijiah, thank you. Based on what I’ve seen so far – the diminished reflexes and the weakness in your legs – something is definitely going on. It's too early to say exactly what it is, but I want to be thorough. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I recommend we run some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and any underlying medical conditions. And I’d like to get an MRI of your spine, just to rule out any nerve compression or other structural issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an MRI... that sounds serious, Doc. And expensive. I don’t have insurance, you know. I haven’t been feelin’ great lately, but I figured it was just work stress. Is it somethin’ really bad? Could it be… paralyzin’? I gotta get back to work, Doc. I got bills to pay. What's the worst-case scenario here? And how much is all this gonna cost?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Elijiah, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be worried. Let's address those one by one. The tests are necessary to figure out what is going on. We need information to guide treatment. While it’s too early to say definitively, the symptoms you're describing could be caused by a vitamin deficiency, a nerve issue, or, less commonly, a problem with your spine. Regarding your question about paralysis: It's unlikely to be causing paralysis right now, but we need to rule out anything serious. That's why we are doing these tests. We are being thorough to avoid any potential complications. As for the cost, I know being uninsured can be a huge burden. Let me see what resources are available to help. Our billing department can explore payment plans and potential financial assistance programs. I'll also see if there are any charitable organizations that might be able to help cover the costs of the MRI. I’m committed to finding a solution that works for you. The first step is to get these tests done, and then we can discuss the results and come up with a treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… payment plans and assistance programs… that’s somethin’, at least. I appreciate you lookin’ into that, Doc. I really do. It’s just… all this is a lot. I haven’t been to a doctor in years. I’m just scared, I guess. Alright… let’s do the tests. Blood tests and the MRI. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s wrong. But please, promise me you’ll explain everything clearly, okay? No fancy medical terms. Just… tell me what’s goin’ on in plain English. And help me with the cost, please. I don’t know what I’d do without a job. So, what do we do first? Blood tests? Where do I go?
DOCTOR: I promise, Elijiah. I'll explain everything in plain English, step-by-step. No jargon, I assure you. And I'll do everything I can to help with the cost. Yes, let’s start with the blood tests. I'm going to write you a lab requisition. It's a form that tells the lab what tests to perform. You'll take this form to the lab, and they'll draw a sample of your blood. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They'll need your identification, and they'll bill you directly. Once the results are back, they will notify me. I’ll also have my nurse, Sarah, schedule you for the MRI. She'll call you after we finish here to discuss the logistics and to get your consent. It's a bit noisy, so you'll be given earplugs. Here’s the requisition. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or the MRI right now?
PATIENT: Room 203, right. And Sarah will call me about the MRI… okay. What should I expect at the lab? Do I need to fast or anything? And the MRI… is it… painful? I've heard stories about those machines, bein’ really loud and stuff. It kinda freaks me out, Doc. I’m claustrophobic, a little bit. I don’t do well in small spaces. Just… tell me what to expect, okay? No sugarcoatin’ it. I need to be prepared. And what if I can't afford all this? I'm gettin' really worried now, Doc. Really worried.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Elijiah. Let’s address them one by one. For the blood tests, you do need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. They will need a blood sample of around 10 milliliters. It’s a routine procedure, and it shouldn’t take longer than 15-20 minutes. Regarding the MRI: It’s not painful, but it is loud. You'll be lying inside a large tube-shaped machine, and it makes a series of knocking and humming noises. That's why they give you earplugs. You'll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes while the machine scans your spine. You mentioned being claustrophobic, and that’s important. We can definitely discuss options to help with that. We can request a wider bore MRI machine – a larger opening – and you can bring a friend or family member with you for support, if you feel comfortable. We can also prescribe a mild anti-anxiety medication if needed to help you relax. We want to make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. Now, about the cost: As I said, we’ll explore all available options. My billing department can apply for financial assistance programs and negotiate payment plans. We can also see if there are any charity organizations that might be able to help. Don’t worry, we won't proceed with any tests without first discussing the cost and ensuring you have a clear understanding. I want to work with you on this, not add to your stress. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… 8-hour fast. Wider bore MRI. Anti-anxiety medication… It’s a lot to take in, Doc. I appreciate you explainin’ it all, really. I think… I think that’s it for now. I guess I’ll go get somethin’ to eat before I have to fast. And I’ll wait for Sarah to call about the MRI. Thank you, Doc. You’ve been really helpful. I’m still scared, but I feel a little better knowin’ what to expect. I really appreciate you lookin’ into the cost stuff. It means a lot. I guess… I’ll see you again when the results are back?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Elijiah. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Remember, we’re in this together, and we'll figure it out. Yes, I’ll see you again when the results are back. I will contact you directly once I have them, and we'll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. My team is here to support you. And please, try to get some rest and focus on taking care of yourself. It was a pleasure meeting you, Elijiah. .
