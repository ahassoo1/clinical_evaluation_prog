DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Genard. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…something down there. A little…leakage, you could say. Not good, not good at all. I don't know what's causing it, but it's been happening for a few days now. It’s…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: "Down there," hmm?
PATIENT: Well, you know…down there. Where things…are. It’s a…discharge, that's what the girl at the front desk said to call it. I don't usually have…this problem. It's just…weird. And a little smelly, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Right. A discharge. And it's new, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, new! Very new. I…hmm. Maybe a week? A week and a few days. Time gets away from me, you know? I haven't…been with anyone for a long time, so it’s not like it’s from that. It just…started. I don't understand it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mrs. Genard, these things happen. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. Have you noticed any pain, burning, or itching along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, exactly. More…a little sore. Like when you sit too long, you know? And itchy sometimes, yes. Especially at night. It keeps me up. But it’s not…awful. Just annoying. I put some powder on it, but that doesn't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Powder, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, baby powder. My granddaughter told me to. She’s a smart girl, but she doesn't know everything! It helped a little the first time, but now it’s just…sticky. Maybe it made it worse? I don't know. Things just aren't like they used to be, you know? Everything’s so complicated now.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, baby powder isn't always the best solution for these things. Let's move on. Have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? What do you mean? Does it hurt when I go? No, not really. It's just… I have to go more often, maybe. Now that you mention it. Especially at night, like with the itching. I thought it was just because I drink a lot of tea, but maybe it's something else?
DOCTOR: Increased frequency, and especially at night. Alright. And what about any fever, chills, or any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. I check myself, you know? I’m not stupid. Chills…no, it’s been hot! Too hot! And my tummy…no, my tummy feels fine. A little gassy sometimes, but that’s just the tea again. Honestly, Doctor, I just want it to stop leaking. It’s embarrassing!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. It sounds like we need to take a look and see what’s going on. I'm going to need to do a quick pelvic exam. It won’t be comfortable, but it will give us a much better idea of the cause of the discharge. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: A…exam? Down there? Oh dear. Well, I don't like the sound of that, but I guess if you have to… It’s just…private, you know? I haven’t…had anyone look at that in a long, long time. But if it’s going to stop the leaking, then…okay. But be quick, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your concerns. It will be as quick and thorough as possible. I need you to lie down on the examination table, and we’ll get started. I’ll explain everything as I go. Nurse will be right in to help. Just…try to relax.
PATIENT: Relax? Easier said than done, Doctor! I'm a nervous wreck already. But…okay. Just…tell me if it’s going to hurt. Don't just do things without warning. And try not to look too closely, if you don't mind. It’s…shameful, having to show all this to a stranger.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Genard. I will be as gentle as possible and explain everything. Please lie back and we’ll begin. Nurse, if you would please assist.
