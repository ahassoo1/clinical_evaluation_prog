DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it's probably nothing, but my husband insisted. It's my… well, my stool. It’s been black. Dark as coal, really. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis, every day. Been taking them for years. He read something about it being… serious. Men and their worrying! But here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that your husband encouraged you to come in; it’s always best to investigate changes like that. Black, tarry stools can indicate a number of things, and it’s wise to rule out anything concerning. You mentioned the pain pills – are these NSAIDs, or something else?
PATIENT: NSAIDs, I think. Naproxen, is that right? The little orange ones. I get them from the pharmacy, refill every month. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to the names, just that they help my joints. I’ve been taking them for… goodness, probably fifteen years now, maybe more. They're the only thing that really works. Are you saying they’re causing this? Because if that’s it, I don’t want to stop taking them!
DOCTOR: Fifteen years is a significant duration. Naproxen can cause gastrointestinal irritation, and bleeding is a potential side effect, which could manifest as dark stools. However, it’s not the only possibility, and we need to investigate further to determine the cause definitively. Before we jump to conclusions about the Naproxen, let's go through a bit more of your medical history. Do you have any other medical problems, Ms. Hatchard?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. I knew this would be a waste of time. Look, I’m a practical woman. I fix engines, not worry about every little ache and pain. But alright, alright. Arthritis, obviously. High blood pressure, but it's managed with a pill. Had my gallbladder out years ago, don't remember much about it. And… that’s really it. I'm a healthy woman for my age, you know. I don't sit around complaining.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Ms. Hatchard. It’s helpful to have a clear picture. And I assure you, we are not simply looking for aches and pains. It’s simply prudent to be thorough. You mentioned having your gallbladder removed – do you recall approximately when that was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… it must have been… sometime in the nineties? Early nineties, I suppose. Nineteen… ninety-two? Ninety-three? Something like that. I was still working at the garage then, very busy. It was a quick recovery, thankfully. Didn’t stop me from getting back to work. I don't remember any complications. Just a bit sore for a week or so.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the Naproxen and whatever you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see... well, there's that little white pill for my water retention. Doctor gave it to me a few years back, said my ankles were swelling. Can't remember the name, either. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take one of those over-the-counter ones... you know, the ones with diphenhydramine? But that’s it, really. Just the basics. I'm not one for a lot of fancy medicines.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Hatchard, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your bowel habits. Have you noticed any changes in the frequency of your bowel movements recently?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. You're asking me about that now? This is ridiculous. Well, no, not really. It's been… pretty regular, all things considered. I go, you know, when I need to. Not more, not less. Maybe a little harder than usual, now that you mention it. But I eat a sensible diet, mostly. Not one of those people who lives on junk food.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Hatchard, but these details are important. Any change, even a slight one, can be indicative of an underlying issue. You mentioned the stool being harder than usual. Have you noticed any blood with the stool, aside from the black color?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel rather foolish being asked all of this. It’s just stool! Black stool, a little hard, that’s it. No, no blood! I would know if there was blood. I'm not an idiot. Just because I fix engines doesn’t mean I’m oblivious to my own body. It’s the pills, I tell you. It has to be the pills. Can we just get a prescription for something to help with the stomach and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, with all due respect, dismissing potential causes without proper investigation is not in your best interest. While the Naproxen could be contributing, we need to rule out other possibilities, such as internal bleeding, which can be serious. I’m going to perform a brief physical examination, including checking your abdomen and a rectal exam. This will allow me to assess your condition more thoroughly. If you are uncomfortable with any part of the exam, please let me know. Do you consent to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. A rectal exam? Really? Now you're just being… Well, I suppose if you insist. But I'm telling you, it's a waste of time. Fine, do your exam. But don’t come back telling me I have something dreadful. I'm a strong woman, Doctor. I've dealt with worse. Just get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie on your back on the examination table, and bend your knees. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. This will help me assess any bowel sounds and identify any areas of tenderness. “Abdomen is soft, non-distended. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, but slightly diminished. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. Palpation elicits mild discomfort in the lower left quadrant. No masses palpated." "Now, I will need to perform a digital rectal exam to assess for any abnormalities. Please inform me if you experience any pain or discomfort." "Rectal vault is clear. Stool is dark, tarry, and heme-positive. No palpable masses or tenderness noted. Internal sphincter tone is normal."
PATIENT: Well? What did you find? Don't tell me it's something awful. Honestly, all this poking and prodding… it's just humiliating. Is it the pills? I knew it was the pills! Can we just get something for my stomach now? I have things to do, you know. My husband needs help in the garage.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, the examination confirms your stool is indeed dark and heme-positive, meaning there is blood present. While the Naproxen is a likely contributor, given its known side effects and the length of time you've been taking it, the presence of blood requires further investigation to rule out other potential causes, such as a gastrointestinal bleed. We need to order some laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, iron studies, and a stool occult blood test to quantify the amount of blood. I also recommend an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy to visualize your digestive tract and identify the source of the bleeding. These procedures are the most definitive way to determine the cause of your symptoms. I understand this may be concerning, but it is crucial that we take a thorough approach to ensure your health and well-being. I will arrange a referral to a gastroenterologist who can perform these procedures. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? A colonoscopy? Are you serious? I am not having a camera stuck up there! I knew this was a waste of time. I told you it was the pills. I am perfectly fine. Look, I'm a practical woman, Doctor. I fix engines. I don't need you poking around inside me looking for problems that aren't there. Just give me something for my stomach, and I'll be on my way. I'm not going through with any of those… procedures. Absolutely not. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, I understand your reluctance, but I must strongly advise against refusing these investigations. Ignoring the source of the bleeding could have serious consequences. I am obligated to prioritize your health, and that requires a comprehensive evaluation. While I respect your autonomy, I cannot in good conscience simply prescribe medication without knowing the underlying cause. I will document your refusal of the recommended tests. Should your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any dizziness, weakness, or rectal bleeding, please seek immediate medical attention. Have a good day, Ms. Hatchard. .
