DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, if you wouldn't mind, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… this cough. Been botherin’ me for a while now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Not much else, I don't think. It just… is. Hard to say how long, exactly. Time gets away from an old man, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, time does have a way of doing that. A “while now” isn’t terribly helpful, sir. Can you recall when you first noticed this cough?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It wasn’t this summer, that I’m sure of. Maybe… last fall? Or winter? I was spendin’ more time inside then, keepin’ warm. My wife, she… she always liked to keep the house cozy. It started then, I reckon. Maybe. It's all a bit blurry, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. So, approximately six to nine months. And has anything changed about the cough?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… Not that I’ve noticed, really. It’s just… there. Sometimes it’s worse when I lie down, I think. Makes it hard to sleep. But mostly… just a dry tickle in my throat. Doesn't bring anything up, if you know what I mean. Like this.
DOCTOR: No productive cough, alright. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, I get a little tired, maybe? But I’m ninety years old, Doctor. I am tired! Hard to say what’s the cough and what's just… me. I don’t have a fever, I don’t think. And no… shortness of breath, not that I've noticed. My appetite’s been alright, too. Still enjoy my rice, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she didn’t approve. Said it was a foolish habit. She was a strong woman, my wife. Very strong. Didn’t let me get away with much.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, Mr. Pavlovic?
PATIENT: Allergies… that’s a good question. I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything the doctor gave me before. Though… I don't go to the doctor much. I did have a rash once, when I was a boy. But that was from poison ivy, I think. Not a medicine. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, poison ivy doesn’t count. And are you currently taking any medications, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not really. Just some… vitamins, now and then. For my joints, you know? But nothing regularly. Just when they bother me. Nothing the doctor told me to take, that’s for sure. A little bit of ginger tea sometimes, if my stomach’s upset. But that's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a listen to your lungs, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… Alright. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, although there is some diminished breath sound at the bases. Heart sounds are regular. No murmurs noted. Now, open your mouth… say "ah." Throat appears mildly erythematous, but no exudates or significant lesions noted.
PATIENT: Mildly… what now? My throat? Oh. Is something wrong, Doctor? It just feels a little… scratchy, I suppose. Like I said, this cough's been botherin' me for a while. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It’s likely a mild upper respiratory irritation, possibly viral. Given your age, and the duration, we should rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a basic blood panel. The lab requisition and X-ray order will be sent electronically to the radiology department. They will contact you to schedule an appointment.
PATIENT: Oh. An X-ray… and blood work? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? I haven’t had an X-ray in… well, I can’t even remember. Is it going to hurt? And… how much will all this cost? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Pavlovic. Routine. We need a baseline to ensure there are no underlying complications. As for cost… I’m not privy to the exact billing details. The billing department will contact you directly. I recommend you inquire about a payment plan. Until we have the results, I suggest you rest, stay hydrated, and avoid close contact with others. I’m also going to prescribe you a cough suppressant to help manage your symptoms. It’s just to make you more comfortable. Come back in one week to review the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A week… alright. I suppose so. A cough suppressant… that’s good. Something to help me sleep would be nice. And… you said stay hydrated? That’s good advice, I always liked water. Is… is it likely to be something serious, Doctor? You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to, but… it would be good to know. Even just a little bit.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pavlovic, it is highly improbable that it is anything serious. Given your age, there is a higher risk of complications with any illness, which is why we are proceeding with these tests. However, I assure you, it is most likely a simple viral infection. Worrying will only exacerbate your symptoms. Come back in one week. I have patients waiting. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… no, I suppose not. A simple infection… that’s good to hear. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very thorough. Even if I don’t understand everything. I’ll… I’ll see you next week then. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Pavlovic. .
