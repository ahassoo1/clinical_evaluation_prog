DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… the hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been almost two days now, and it’s really starting to get on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Two days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, started sometime yesterday morning, I think. Hard to say exactly when, you know? I was busy getting things ready for the weekend at the resort. But definitely over 48 hours now. It’s… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Exhausting is a good way to put it. And you were saying you were busy at a resort?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I manage the entertainment there – the pool parties, the live music, things like that. Lots of running around, making sure everyone is having a good time. Which is hard to do when hic you can’t stop… well, you know. hic It’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. People keep looking at me.
DOCTOR: I see. So, these hiccups began while you were actively working, dealing with… a rather public role. Tell me, Ms. Redeye, are they constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go, but mostly come. It’s like… a few minutes of peace, then hic BAM, another ten or fifteen hiccups in a row. Then maybe a little break, then it starts all over again. It’s very unpredictable. It’s not like the regular kind where it stops after a little water or something. I’ve tried everything.
DOCTOR: “Everything,” you say?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Water, holding my breath, spoonfuls of sugar… my niece told me to breathe into a paper bag, but that just made me feel silly. And a bit dizzy. hic I even asked old Manzoor if he had any of his… herbal remedies, but he said this wasn’t a problem for those. hic He mostly deals with stomach troubles, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, those are… folk remedies, shall we say. Let’s get a bit more detailed. Have you noticed anything that specifically triggers these hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I was eating pretty normally yesterday. Maybe a little stressed, but that’s just part of the job, you know? hic Lots of people to please. And it was hot, very hot, running around in the sun. But I drink plenty of water. hic I can’t really pinpoint anything. It just started.
DOCTOR: And you said “eating pretty normally.” Can you describe a typical meal for me?
PATIENT: Well, yesterday for lunch I had… a chicken sandwich, I think. And some chips. Nothing fancy. hic And a Diet Coke. Dinner was a bit bigger - koshari, my favorite! hic From that little place down by the market. It’s a lot of pasta and rice and lentils… and fried onions, of course. hic Everything was normal. I didn’t eat anything weird, I promise!
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to stay away from those if I can. I prefer to… deal with things naturally, you know? hic Just vitamins sometimes, but I haven’t taken those in a few weeks. hic Just the usual, nothing for any specific condition.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Redeye. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps palpate your abdomen. Just to rule out anything obvious. If you’ll please have a seat.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. hic Whatever you think is best, Doctor. hic I just want them to stop!
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender… no masses detected. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72. Everything appears… normal. This is rather perplexing. Do you have any history of acid reflux, or heartburn?
PATIENT: Heartburn… sometimes, yes. Not terribly often. hic Usually just after a big meal, like with the koshari. hic A little bit of a burning sensation, but I usually just take a sip of water and it goes away. It's not a regular thing, though. hic Not enough to bother me, really. I thought it was just… the food.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, Ms. Redeye?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. I don’t like the smell of it. hic My mother always said it was terrible for you, and she was right about most things. hic No, definitely not a smoker.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Redeye, given your history and the lack of any concerning findings on examination, it’s likely these hiccups are… idiopathic. That is to say, we don’t know the cause. They can sometimes be triggered by stress, or eating too quickly, or even… excitement. hic It's usually self-limiting, meaning they should resolve on their own. However… given the duration – almost two days now – and the fact that they're causing you distress, I’d like to order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. Just to rule out any underlying electrolyte imbalances or other… possibilities. hic It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it's best to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible, Doctor. hic If it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes, please. hic I just want them to stop, like you said. It’s just… exhausting. hic Will it take long? And is it expensive? I don’t have… insurance, you see. hic
DOCTOR: The tests themselves shouldn't take long – just a simple blood draw. As for the cost… unfortunately, I'm not certain of the exact amount. The lab handles the billing directly. Given your lack of insurance, you may want to inquire about a cash discount or payment plan. I can write a note requesting the lowest possible rate. It will likely be… in the range of sixty to eighty dollars, perhaps. It’s not ideal, I realize, but it’s a relatively inexpensive way to rule out… more serious causes. I’ll also recommend avoiding carbonated beverages, spicy foods, and eating large meals for the next few days. And try to relax, Ms. Redeye. Stress can certainly exacerbate the problem. If the hiccups persist for more than another 48 hours, or if you develop any other symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or vomiting – you should seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Sixty to eighty dollars… I can probably manage that. hic I’ll avoid the fizzy drinks and spicy food, and try to… relax. Easier said than done, with the resort being so busy, but I’ll try. hic And I’ll come back if they don’t stop, or if anything else happens. hic Thank you, Doctor Paulino. You’ve been very helpful. hic Where do I go to get the blood drawn?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, second door on the right. They're open until five o'clock this evening. Tell them Dr. Paulino sent you. I have other patients waiting, Ms. Redeye. I trust you understand. If the hiccups do not resolve and you require further evaluation, schedule a follow-up appointment with my office. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s everything. hic Thank you again. hic I’ll go get the blood drawn now.
DOCTOR: Idiopathic hiccups… really?
