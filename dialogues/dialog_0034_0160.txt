DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? It's about this… weakness, I suppose. And this craving. It’s ridiculous, really. I feel like such a fool even saying it. It's just… dirt. I want to eat dirt. Not all the time, but enough to be bothersome. And I'm just so tired all the time. It's getting worse, and frankly, I haven’t got time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite concerning, and you're not a fool for seeking help at all. Weakness and fatigue, along with this… craving for dirt, are definitely things we need to investigate. It’s good you came in. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can’t do things, you understand. I still go to work, I still manage the house. But everything takes so much effort now. It’s like… wading through mud. And it doesn’t get better with rest. I used to be able to garden all day, now I’m pooped after ten minutes. It’s embarrassing, really. I'm a physical therapist aide, I should be helping people, not needing a nap!
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s not a complete inability to function, but a significant increase in effort required for daily activities, and it’s not relieved by rest. That’s very helpful information. And you mentioned being a physical therapy aide – that certainly requires a lot of energy. Could you describe where you feel the weakness most?
PATIENT: Everywhere, honestly. It’s not like one particular muscle. It’s just… all over. But if I had to pick… my legs, I suppose. They feel heavy. And my arms get tired easily when I'm helping patients. It’s like they’re filled with lead. Honestly, I just feel… depleted. Is that the right word?
DOCTOR: “Depleted” is a very good word, Ms. Hardenburgh. That describes it well. Generalized weakness, particularly noticeable in your legs and arms, is what you’re experiencing. And it's been progressively worsening, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. It didn’t start like this, you know? It was just a little tired after work. Now… now it’s all the time. And the dirt eating… that started maybe a month ago? It's not like I’m going out and digging up the garden! It's just… I find myself picking at it, especially when I'm stressed. And I know it's weird.
DOCTOR: It’s not weird at all to be honest about what’s bothering you, Ms. Hardenburgh. And it’s good you’re able to share these details with me. The fact that this started gradually and is associated with stress is important information. This craving for dirt – is it a particular type of dirt, or just any?
PATIENT: Oh, any. Honestly! It’s just… earthy. The red clay behind the shed is good. The stuff under the rose bushes. I don’t… I don’t analyze it, you know? It just… smells right, I suppose. And it feels… soothing, for a few minutes, anyway. Then I feel silly and guilty. And still tired.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s the earthy smell and sensation that’s appealing, and it provides temporary relief, but doesn’t address the underlying fatigue. This craving, along with the weakness and fatigue, could be related to a few different things. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask you some more questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. First, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, you know? High blood pressure, years ago, but it’s been under control with diet. And I had a bad bout of the flu a few winters back, but I recovered. Nothing else springs to mind. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. I certainly haven't been to a doctor in ages.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Controlled high blood pressure is important information, and it's helpful to hear you generally consider yourself healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always avoided them if possible. Too risky, in my opinion. My mother had a bad experience with a hip replacement, and I just… never wanted to go there. I prefer to tough things out.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. Avoiding surgery when possible is a reasonable preference. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, occasionally. And I take ibuprofen when my arthritis flares up, which is… fairly often, these days. That’s about it. I try to avoid medication as much as possible. I don’t like feeling… drugged up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. And you prefer to avoid medications when possible. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That’s a tough one. My mother had… well, she just seemed to fade away, you know? Some kind of weakness. The doctors never really figured it out. My father had heart trouble, but he smoked like a chimney, so that's hardly surprising. Nothing else that I can think of. My siblings are all… relatively healthy, as far as I know. We don’t keep in close touch.
DOCTOR: I see. A mother with unexplained weakness and a father with heart trouble due to smoking. That’s helpful information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. And smoking? Absolutely not. My father smoked enough for all of us. And recreational drugs? Don’t be ridiculous. I’m a perfectly respectable woman. I spend my time gardening, reading, and going to church.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Hardenburgh. That’s very good to know. And it sounds like you have a fulfilling lifestyle. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I can eat anything, thankfully. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty lucky, all things considered. Honestly, I just want to feel normal again. This tiredness is… debilitating. And the dirt eating is just embarrassing. Is there anything you can do?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I assure you we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Given your symptoms – the fatigue, weakness, and the unusual craving for dirt – along with your history, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. One concern, and it’s important to rule this out, is iron deficiency anemia, which can sometimes cause a craving for non-food items like dirt – a condition called pica. To help me assess this, I’d like to do a physical exam and order some blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… ugh. I hate needles. But… if it will help, I suppose. I just… I don’t want to be stuck here all day. I have things to do. And I’m not insured, so… how much will this cost?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, and I assure you we’ll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. We'll also try to keep the visit as efficient as we can. As for the cost, I realize you mentioned not having insurance. Let me explain the charges and we can discuss options for affordable payment plans or potential assistance programs. The blood tests will be primarily to check your iron levels, as well as a complete blood count to look for other potential causes of fatigue and weakness. The basic panel should be around $150, and we can discuss any additional tests if needed. Now, let’s start with the physical exam. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: $150… honestly. That’s a lot of money. But… alright. Let’s get it over with. I just want to feel better. And I really don't want to spend the rest of my days eating dirt.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. Your weight is 107 pounds and your height is 169 centimeters. That gives us a BMI of… 37.6, which indicates you are in the obese range. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Obese?! What are you talking about? I’m a tiny woman! I haven’t gained an ounce in years! This is ridiculous. I may be tired, but I’m not fat. This is just… insulting.
DOCTOR: Oh, my deepest apologies, Ms. Hardenburgh. You are absolutely right to question me. I made a significant error in my calculation. I was using an outdated conversion chart and miscalculated your BMI. I sincerely apologize for causing offense. Your weight and height are perfectly normal, and I was wrong to suggest otherwise. It seems I was rushing and didn't double-check my work. Let's disregard that information entirely. I’m very sorry. Now, let's proceed with listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out…
PATIENT: Fine. Just… be careful. And double-check your numbers this time, alright?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Could you please extend your arms like this?
PATIENT: Honestly, this is all very… impersonal. You’re just poking and prodding. I thought you were going to do something about the dirt eating, not check my reflexes.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to feel that way, Ms. Hardenburgh. I apologize for making you feel like just another examination. It’s important to me that you feel heard and respected. These physical exam components are necessary to get a comprehensive picture of what might be causing your symptoms. Checking your reflexes and strength helps me identify any potential neurological issues that could contribute to your weakness. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits. Now, could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that good enough? I’m not exactly known for my strength these days. It’s all this tiredness, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you. Yes, that’s helpful. Your grip strength is slightly weaker than expected, which supports what you’ve been telling me about your fatigue and weakness. Now, I’d like to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is slightly elevated. We should monitor that. Now, one last thing… Could you please open your mouth and say “ah”?
PATIENT: There. Anything interesting? I brush my teeth twice a day, you know.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks normal. No redness or swelling. Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and the findings of the physical exam – fatigue, weakness, craving for dirt, slightly diminished reflexes, weak grip strength, and elevated blood pressure – I'm concerned about a few possibilities. The most important thing to rule out is iron deficiency anemia, which can cause pica – the craving for non-food items like dirt. We also need to investigate the cause of your fatigue and elevated blood pressure. To do this, I’m going to order some blood tests. These will include a complete blood count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel. Would you like me to explain these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests. I suppose it’s necessary. Explain them, then. But make it quick. I have things to do, you know. And I really don't want to be here all day. Just… tell me what they’re looking for, and how long it will take.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The complete blood count will give us a general overview of your blood cells – red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can help us identify anemia, infection, or other blood disorders. Iron studies will measure the levels of iron in your blood, which will help us determine if you have iron deficiency. Finally, the basic metabolic panel will check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. The tests will take about 10 minutes to draw the blood, and the results should be back in 2-3 business days. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Alright. 10 minutes, you say? And 2-3 days for results. Fine. Let’s get it over with. Just… please be quick. And don’t poke me too much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please have a seat here, and I’ll get the phlebotomist to come in and draw your blood. She’s very experienced and will take excellent care of you. Just relax, and we’ll get through this quickly. Then we can focus on finding out what’s causing your symptoms and getting you back to feeling like yourself. Is there anything else I can do for you while we wait?
PATIENT: No. Just… hurry. And try not to make me feel like a science experiment.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. I’ll be right back with the phlebotomist. Thank you for your patience, Ms. Hardenburgh.
