DOCTOR: Hi Nixon, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rosanova. It's August 2nd, and I see you're 18. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Rosanova. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m here because my left leg is… well, it’s gotten quite swollen. I also have a heart thing, if that matters. The doctor back home told me it was… a fast heartbeat, but I don't rightly remember the name of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, good to meet you too. Swelling in your left leg and a fast heartbeat – let’s definitely get to the bottom of both of those. We’ll take it one step at a time. First, let’s focus on the leg. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… that would be… about a week ago, I think. It started small, just a little puffiness around my ankle, but it's gotten bigger each day. It's mostly in my lower leg, but it goes up a bit towards my knee now. It doesn’t hurt much, just feels… heavy, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, heavy is a good way to describe it. And has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: I don’t think so. I’ve been trying to keep it up, you know, not sitting for too long. But it seems to get worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on my feet teaching. I haven't changed anything else about what I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, teaching… that means you’re on your feet for extended periods. And it's progressively worsening, more noticeable at the end of the day. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the leg along with the swelling?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s just… bigger. And maybe a little bit discoloured, but it's hard to tell, I have… fair skin, you see. I haven’t noticed it getting hot or anything. It just feels… different from my other leg.
DOCTOR: Alright, fair skin can make it harder to spot colour changes. So, swelling, progressively worsening, more noticeable at the end of the day, heavier feeling, no redness or warmth. Let’s move on to this “fast heartbeat” your doctor mentioned. Can you describe what you feel when your heart races?
PATIENT: Well, it feels like it’s… fluttering, almost. Like a bird trapped in my chest. And sometimes it feels like it's beating too fast, just… really quick. It doesn't always happen, and it doesn't last long, usually. It just… comes and goes. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Nixon. Fluttering, a racing sensation, comes and goes… Okay. Does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Not that I’ve noticed, no. It seems to happen randomly. Sometimes when I'm walking, sometimes when I'm sitting. It's very… unpredictable, really. I haven't changed my diet or anything. I don't drink much coffee, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable, no clear triggers, doesn't seem related to caffeine intake. And about how often would you say this happens in a typical week?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. Maybe… three or four times? It’s not every day, thankfully. Some weeks it happens more, some weeks not at all. It's hard to keep track, to be honest. I’ve been hoping it would just go away.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, so intermittent episodes of a fast, fluttering heartbeat, roughly three or four times a week, sometimes more, sometimes less. To get a better understanding, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll check your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your leg. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I do hope it won’t take too long, I have a lesson to prepare later. But I understand you need to do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll be as efficient as possible. First, let's have you lie down on the exam table. Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular rhythm, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, let's take a look at your leg. I’m gently pressing here… any pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s… a bit tender, but not painful, if that makes sense. It’s more uncomfortable than anything. And it feels warmer than my other leg, now that you mention it. It’s hard to tell, but I think it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness and warmth to the left leg, which is consistent with what we’re discussing. I'm also noting some mild pitting edema - that means if I press on the skin, it leaves a temporary indentation. Do you see that little dip that remains for a moment?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I see it. It’s… a bit worrying to see that, to be honest. I haven’t noticed that before, but now that you’ve pointed it out… yes, it’s definitely there. Is that… bad? I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be a bother. I just… get anxious about these things.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Nixon, it’s perfectly normal to be anxious. Pitting edema can indicate fluid retention, which could be related to several things. Given your symptoms – the swelling, warmth, and intermittent episodes of a fast heartbeat – I'd like to order a few tests to help us figure out what's going on. Would you be okay with a blood test to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and thyroid levels?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… prudent. If it will help you understand what’s happening, I’m happy to have a blood test. I’d rather know than… worry about it. Is it a lot of blood? I don’t like needles, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: It's not a lot, Nixon, just a few vials. And we can try to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I’ll write the order for the lab now. Here's the requisition. You can take this to the lab just down the hall. They’ll draw the blood samples. Once the results are back – usually within 24-48 hours – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your left leg whenever possible and avoiding prolonged standing. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Elevating my leg… that makes sense. And avoiding standing… I’ll try my best, although it’s hard with the teaching. Thank you, Doctor Rosanova. You’ve been very… reassuring. I’ll go to the lab now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I'm glad I could help. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I will see you soon, then.
