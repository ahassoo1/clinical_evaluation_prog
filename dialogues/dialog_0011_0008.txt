DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… right. It’s… my ear. Feels blocked, mostly. Full, you know? Not painful, exactly. Just… there. Honestly, I can't really say how long. Things… blur a bit these days.
DOCTOR: I see. A feeling of fullness in your ear, not particularly painful, but noticeable. And you’re unsure of how long it’s been occurring, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds about right. A while. Maybe a few weeks? Hard to say. I’ve been busy with the farm, and… well, things slip my mind. It’s not a sharp pain, like an infection, thankfully. More like… cotton wool, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. A sensation of cotton wool is a helpful description. And you haven’t noticed any discharge, bleeding, or any change in your hearing besides the fullness?
PATIENT: No, no discharge or bleeding. Hearing… hmm. I suppose things are a bit muffled, yeah. Not drastically, but… I ask my wife to repeat herself sometimes. Or, used to, anyway. It’s just… a normal part of getting older, I figured.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're bringing it to my attention, regardless of what you initially thought. Changes in hearing, even gradual ones, are worth investigating. Now, have you experienced any dizziness, ringing in your ears, or any pain in your jaw or neck along with this fullness?
PATIENT: Dizziness… not really. Maybe a little unsteady sometimes, but I put that down to… well, everything. Ringing… no, can't say I've noticed. And no, no pain in my jaw or neck. Just the ear. It’s just… annoying, mostly. Especially when I'm trying to talk to people.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold, the flu, or a sinus infection?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that you mention it… I think I had a bit of a sniffle a few weeks back. Nothing major, just a bit of a cough and a runny nose. Didn't last long, though. Just one of those summer colds, I figured. It didn’t feel connected to this, though. Honestly, I forget half the things I get sick with.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for ear issues to follow a mild upper respiratory infection. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. The doctor always said I was as strong as an ox. Bit of arthritis in my knees, but that's just age, isn’t it? And… my wife handled all the paperwork, so I'm not entirely sure what's what. I do have private insurance, though, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. The arthritis is good to know. And yes, having private insurance is helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgery or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, I don't think so. Not that I remember. Maybe when I was a boy, for my tonsils, but it was a long time ago. Honestly, it’s all a bit blurry. I’ve been lucky, mostly. Always worked hard, kept my head down. Didn't have much time for doctors or hospitals, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. And regarding your family history, are there any conditions that run in your family, such as hearing loss, ear infections, or any other significant medical issues?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a tough one. My wife… she kept track of all that. She passed a few years back, and… things got a bit muddled after that. My father was a strong man, worked the land his whole life. No real health problems that I can recall. Maybe some deafness in his old age, but that was just from shouting at the cows, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. That's perfectly alright. It’s difficult to recall family history under those circumstances. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Right… I run a small farm, mostly vegetables and some livestock. It’s… a lot of work. I live alone now, like I said. My wife… she did most of the socializing. I haven’t really got many hobbies, just… keeping the farm going. Been doing it my whole life. Do you need to know about… smoking or drinking? I don’t really do either.
DOCTOR: No, that's fine, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Just wanted to get a general sense of your lifestyle. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I eat pretty much anything. And I haven't taken much in the way of medicine, honestly. A bit of aspirin for my knees now and then, but that's it. My wife always said I was too stubborn to get sick. Is that… all the questions then, Doctor? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. That was very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your ears to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Get it over with quickly, if you wouldn't mind. I have things to do on the farm, you see. Not that it matters, really.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m going to gently insert this instrument into your ear to look at your eardrum. It doesn’t usually cause any discomfort, but please let me know if you feel any pain or pressure. Alright, I’m looking now… There appears to be some cerumen – earwax – present, but nothing significant obstructing the canal. The eardrum appears intact, but slightly… dull. Now the right ear… similar findings. Some cerumen, intact eardrum, but also appears slightly dull. I don't see any signs of infection or fluid buildup. I’m also going to perform a quick tuning fork test. This helps us assess how sound is conducted through your ear. Can you tell me when you can no longer hear the sound?
PATIENT: Right… I hear it, yes. Faint, but I hear it. Still hearing it… uh… now it’s… getting fainter. Yes, I think that's it. Just gone now. Is something wrong, Doctor? It doesn't feel right, poking around in there.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. The results of the tuning fork test suggest some mild conductive hearing loss – meaning there may be a slight blockage preventing sound from traveling efficiently through your ear canal. Given your symptoms, and the findings on examination, I suspect that the most likely cause of your fullness and muffled hearing is a build-up of earwax. It's a common problem, especially with age. I recommend we attempt to remove the earwax. I can perform an ear irrigation, which involves gently flushing your ear canal with warm water. Would you like to proceed with that today?
PATIENT: Irrigation… sounds… wet. Is there anything else I can do? I don't particularly like things going in my ears. Honestly, if it's just a bit of wax, maybe it'll clear up on its own? Is it something serious, Doctor? I need to get back to the farm, you see. The vegetables won't harvest themselves.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned. While earwax often clears on its own, it can sometimes become impacted and require removal. It's unlikely to be serious in your case, but prolonged impaction can cause discomfort and even temporary hearing loss. There are earwax softening drops you can use at home, but they can take several days to work, and aren’t always effective. The irrigation is the quickest and most reliable method, and I assure you I'll be as gentle as possible. We can also discuss referral to an audiologist if you’d prefer, though that will require an appointment and a potentially longer wait time. Before we proceed, just to be absolutely sure, have you ever had any problems with your eardrum, like a rupture or an infection that required surgery?
PATIENT: Rupture? No, never. I told you, I’ve been lucky. No surgeries, no ruptures, nothing like that. My wife… she always looked after those things. Look, if it's quick, I suppose I can tolerate a bit of… flushing. But gentle, Doctor. Very gentle. And no poking!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Very gentle, and no poking, I assure you. I’m going to warm this water to body temperature and gently flush it into your ear canal. It may feel a little strange, and you may hear some bubbling sounds. If you feel any pain or discomfort, please let me know immediately, and I will stop. Alright, let's take a look… Much better. The ear canals are now clear of wax. The eardrums still appear slightly dull, but that could be due to natural variations. Your hearing should improve over the next few days. I recommend avoiding getting water in your ears for a few days, just to allow things to settle. I’m going to write you a prescription for some over-the-counter ear drops to help prevent future wax buildup. If your symptoms don't improve within a week, or if you experience any pain, drainage, or dizziness, please schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Right… well, that wasn't as bad as I thought. Still not my favourite thing, but… manageable. Drops, you say? Alright. No, I don’t think so. Just… try not to get water in my ears. I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must get back to the farm. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m glad it wasn’t too unpleasant. Here’s the prescription for the ear drops, and a brief summary of the aftercare instructions. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. And do take care of yourself. The farm can wait, your health is the priority. Have a good day, and a good harvest.
