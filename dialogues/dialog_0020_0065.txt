DOCTOR: Good morning, Reneisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been gaining weight, and I haven’t changed anything about my diet or exercise. It’s… concerning, and I wanted to have it checked out. It’s been happening for about three months now, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight gain over the past three months. And you haven’t noticed any changes to your eating habits or activity level?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I eat… much the same as always. Perhaps a little more tired, if anything, but nothing drastic. My husband would say I’m always tired, but that’s just him. I still go to work, of course, and I still do the cleaning at home. It’s just… the scale keeps going up. It’s very peculiar.
DOCTOR: Alright. And about how much weight would you say you’ve gained over these three months, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I weigh myself every Saturday. It’s… about fifteen pounds, I would say. Perhaps a little more. It’s… embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve never had trouble with my weight before.
DOCTOR: Okay, fifteen pounds over three months. I understand it can be concerning when things change unexpectedly. And you said you've noticed increased fatigue as well?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Not debilitating, mind you. Just… I feel more sluggish at the end of the day. And I seem to need more sleep. It could just be the summer heat, honestly. But combined with the weight gain… it feels like something is amiss. Is there anything specific you need to know about my work? It's fairly physical, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Reneisha. Yes, the physical demands of your job are relevant. Could you tell me a little more about what your work entails?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as an orderly at the hospital, mostly on the surgical floor. It's a lot of lifting and moving patients, making beds, assisting with meals... general upkeep, really. It requires quite a bit of walking and being on my feet for most of my shift. I’ve been doing it for… twelve years now. It’s always been manageable, until recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, twelve years as an orderly. That’s significant physical activity. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to perform your job duties?
PATIENT: Not… a dramatic change, no. But I do find myself getting winded more easily, especially towards the end of a long shift. And my back… it aches a little more than usual. I always attributed it to the work itself, but perhaps it’s related to this weight gain. It’s difficult to say, truly. I don’t want to sound like I’m complaining. I like my job.
DOCTOR: No, you're not complaining at all, Reneisha. It's important to share all of these details. Okay, so increased fatigue, weight gain, back pain, and some shortness of breath with exertion. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… Now that you mention it… I have been feeling a little colder than usual, even during warm days. My husband keeps turning up the thermostat. And… my skin feels a bit drier. I thought it was just the air conditioning. No other… noticeable changes, I don’t believe. Is that… concerning? I'm rather worried now, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, feeling colder than usual and dry skin, in addition to the other symptoms you've described. It's good you're sharing all of this with me. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a rather nasty bout of the flu when I was twenty, but that was it. Nothing chronic. I’ve always been quite healthy, truthfully. No allergies, either. I have all my vaccinations, of course. My husband is always reminding me to go to the doctor for check-ups, but I usually only go when I absolutely have to. He worries too much, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical conditions or allergies, and up to date on vaccinations. That's helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I've been very fortunate in that regard. My grandmother had her gallbladder removed when she was older, but that's the closest I've come to surgery. Nothing personally, thankfully. I do get rather anxious around hospitals, if you can imagine. It's ironic, considering where I work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And no significant family history of medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… My father had high blood pressure when he was older, and my mother… she had arthritis in her knees. But nothing… serious, really. No heart problems, no cancer, nothing like that. They both lived to be quite old, actually. So, I suppose I come from a fairly healthy family, all things considered. It’s just… this weight gain is very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. A cup of chamomile tea usually does the trick for most ailments. My husband keeps trying to convince me to take a multivitamin, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. I eat a fairly balanced diet, I think. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And what about smoking or alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I only have a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. Perhaps once or twice a month. My husband enjoys a beer now and then, but he’s not a heavy drinker either. We both try to live a fairly healthy lifestyle, all things considered. It’s just… this weight gain is so puzzling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol. Reneisha, it sounds like you’ve been experiencing a number of changes over the past few months – weight gain, fatigue, back pain, feeling colder, and dry skin. Given these symptoms, and the fact that they've been going on for three months, I’d like to do a physical exam and order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it's necessary, I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, do whatever you deem appropriate. I just want to know what’s causing this. I'm… eager to get to the bottom of it. What sort of blood tests are you thinking of? And what will the physical exam involve? I do get rather… squeamish, easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We’ll take things slowly and I'll explain everything as we go. The blood tests will check your thyroid function, your blood sugar levels, and a complete blood count to look for any signs of infection or anemia. We’ll also check your kidney and liver function. As for the physical exam, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your thyroid gland in your neck. I’ll also take a look at your skin and check your reflexes. It shouldn’t be too uncomfortable, and I’ll be sure to explain each step before I do it. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds manageable. Thyroid function, blood sugar, complete blood count… And checking my heart, lungs, and reflexes. It’s… a lot, but if you’re going to explain everything, I suppose I can handle it. I do appreciate you being thorough, Doctor. And… explaining everything beforehand. It puts my mind at ease a little. Shall we… begin then?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll take it one step at a time. First, let’s check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Could you please sit back and relax for a moment?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I'll try my best to remain still. Do I need to do anything specific? Like, should I keep my arm straight, or…?
DOCTOR: No, just relax your arm and keep it still. Don’t talk while I’m taking the reading, if you don't mind. Just breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 135/85. Pulse is 78 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Lungs sound clear, heart sounds regular.
PATIENT: Is everything… alright so far? I do tend to worry, you see. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds good so far, Reneisha. No unusual sounds in your lungs or heart. Now, I’m going to palpate your thyroid gland. It’s just feeling your neck to check for any enlargement or tenderness. It may feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules or tenderness.
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? Is that… bad? What does that mean, exactly? I've never had my thyroid checked before. Is it something serious? Should we be concerned?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Reneisha. A slightly enlarged thyroid can be caused by a number of things, including iodine deficiency, inflammation, or even stress. It doesn’t automatically mean there’s a problem. However, because it is enlarged, I want to run some blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels and see if everything is functioning properly. That’s why I mentioned the tests earlier. These tests will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. We'll also look at your TSH levels. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: So, it doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong, just that we need to investigate further? TSH levels… yes. What exactly are TSH levels? And what would abnormal levels indicate? I always feel foolish asking so many questions, but I want to understand everything. Is it a difficult test? Will it be painful?
DOCTOR: You're not foolish for asking questions at all, Reneisha. It's important to understand what's going on with your health. TSH stands for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone. It's produced by a gland in your brain and tells your thyroid how much hormone to make. Abnormal levels can indicate that your thyroid is either overactive or underactive – that's what we're trying to determine with the blood tests. The test itself is very simple. It just involves a small blood sample taken from your arm – just like we’re doing now, really. It shouldn't be painful at all, just a quick pinch. We'll also check your T4 and T3 levels. Do you feel comfortable proceeding with the blood tests?
PATIENT: Yes, I suppose so. If it’s just a simple blood test, then I don’t see why not. The sooner we know what’s going on, the better. T4 and T3 levels… alright. So, just a standard blood draw, then? And it will give you a clearer picture of my thyroid function? I do hope it’s nothing serious. Where do we go from here?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Just a standard blood draw. And yes, it will give us a much clearer picture of your thyroid function, along with your hormone levels. Okay, let's go ahead and get that blood drawn. I’ll write the orders for the lab tests now, and then the nurse will come in and take the sample. While we’re waiting, do you have any other concerns or questions I can address?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I believe you’ve answered all my questions, Doctor. Just… thank you for being so patient and explaining everything so thoroughly. It really puts my mind at ease. I do appreciate it. I’m… eager to get the results, but I understand it will take some time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. It's my job to make you feel comfortable and informed. The results should be back in about three to five business days. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or rapid heartbeat – please contact the clinic immediately. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now. "Nurse, could you please come in and draw some labs for Reneisha Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Difficulty breathing, chest pain, rapid heartbeat… I’ll keep those in mind. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I do hope everything turns out alright. .
