DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t really have time for a lot of chit-chat, Doc. It's this… swelling. My stomach, mostly. Feels like I’m gonna pop, you know? Just bloated. It’s been… a while, I guess. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're feeling bloated and experiencing swelling in your abdomen, and you'd like to get to the bottom of it quickly. I can definitely appreciate that. When you say “a while,” can you give me a rough estimate – are we talking days, weeks, months?
PATIENT: Ugh, months, probably. Maybe longer? It comes and goes. It's not like, painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. And makes my clothes fit weird. I just want it gone. I don't remember exactly when it started, alright? I got a lot on my mind. Is that gonna help fix it or what?
DOCTOR: Alright, months of intermittent abdominal swelling, more uncomfortable than painful. I understand you’re frustrated with tracking it, and we'll do our best to figure it out. It is helpful to get a timeframe, but we can work with "months" for now. To get a better understanding, could you describe the swelling a bit more?
PATIENT: Look, it just… gets bigger. My stomach puffs out. Like I ate way too much, even when I haven’t. It feels… tight. Hard, sometimes. Like a balloon. Then it goes down a bit, then comes back. It's not constant, see? That’s the annoying part. It's just… unpredictable. Honestly, I just want to know if it’s serious. Is it gonna kill me? Because if it's not, I got work to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent swelling, feeling tight and sometimes hard, like a balloon. I understand your concern about it being serious, and we’ll definitely address that. It’s good that it’s not constant. Let’s try to narrow things down a bit. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger the swelling?
PATIENT: Trigger? I dunno. I eat… normal stuff. I work, I sleep, I eat. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to that kinda thing. Maybe… after big meals? But I work a hard job, I need to eat. I don't sit around analyzing what makes my stomach big, Doc. Is this gonna take all day? I got a job site to get back to.
DOCTOR: I understand you're busy, Mr. Kristofik, and I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. No need to analyze anything, just tell me what you recall. So, potentially related to large meals… anything else?
PATIENT: Look, maybe… sometimes after I drink a lot of water? I gotta stay hydrated, it’s hot out there. I dunno. It’s not like I’m noticing a pattern, alright? It just… happens. I'm not a scientist. Is it something I ate? Is it something in the water? I don't know. This is frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially related to large meals and high water intake. We’ll keep those in mind. It's understandable that this is frustrating. Let's move on to some other quick questions, just to rule things out. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel… what now? Look, I go to the bathroom when I gotta go, alright? Everything’s… normal. I don’t sit there counting… you know. Is this really necessary? I told you I'm bloated. Why are you asking about that?
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions seem unrelated, Mr. Kristofik. It's just important to rule out other possibilities. Changes in bowel habits can sometimes be connected to abdominal swelling. Okay, no changes in bowel habits. Have you noticed any weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Doc, I work construction. I'm always dirty, sweaty, either building something or lifting something. I probably weigh the same as I always do. Maybe a little less when it's real hot. I haven't been tracking my weight, you know? I got things to do. Is this going anywhere? I got a deadline.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant weight changes. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, we are getting somewhere. I’m just trying to gather enough information to determine the best course of action. One quick question. Any nausea, vomiting, or fever?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I haven't thrown up in… I don't even remember. I get a little hot when I'm working, but that's the sun. No fever, no… the other thing. I feel fine, except for the stomach thing. Honestly, I'm starting to think this is nothing. Just a bit of gas or something. Can we just… rule that out and be done? I got a site to manage.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea, vomiting, or fever. That's helpful. To be thorough, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and feel it gently. It’ll just take a minute. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. And be gentle, alright? I’ve got work to do later. Don’t go poking around too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m listening now… and feeling… Your abdomen is slightly distended, as you described. It’s tender to the touch in the lower quadrants, but no guarding or rigidity. I don’t feel any masses. Sounds are normal. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it could be a few things. Gas, as you mentioned, is certainly a possibility. However, given the intermittent nature and the tenderness, we should rule out other possibilities. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. I take some ibuprofen sometimes when my back aches from work. That’s about it. And no, I don't think I'm allergic. I've been taking it for years. Look, can we just get a pill or something? I don't need a whole investigation. I'm a busy man, Doc. I got a job to do. A real job. Not sitting around taking notes all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, occasional ibuprofen use. I understand you'd prefer a quick solution, but given the ongoing discomfort, I recommend a blood test to rule out any underlying conditions, like inflammatory bowel disease or pancreatic issues. It’s a routine test, and it'll give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. A blood test? Seriously? Look, I hate needles. Fine. But just the one. And make it quick. I got stuff to do. And tell me what you're looking for, alright? I don't want some vague explanation. What exactly are you checking for? I need to know if this is serious, or if I'm wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, just one blood test. I understand your aversion to needles, and we’ll make it as quick as possible. We'll be checking a complete blood count to look for signs of infection or inflammation, as well as liver and pancreatic enzyme levels to rule out any issues with those organs. We'll also check an inflammatory marker called C-reactive protein. I’ll write up the order now. The lab is just down the hall. Once the results are back – typically a couple of days – we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding overly processed foods and carbonated beverages, and staying hydrated. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Fine. Hydrate, no junk food. Got it. Look, just… tell me when the results are in. I don't want to have to call and bother you. Can you just… call me? My number is 555-123-4567. And just… don't keep me waiting. I got a deadline, alright? A real deadline. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I’ve noted your number – 555-123-4567 – and I will personally call you as soon as the results are in. We'll get this sorted out quickly. Here’s the requisition form for the lab. They’re just down the hall. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms before I call.
