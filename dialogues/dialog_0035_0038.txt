DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe I’m here to discuss… plans for the future, should something… unforeseen happen. I was advised to get some paperwork sorted, an Advance Directive, or a POLST form, I think it was called? Honestly, the details are a little… hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. Many people find that paperwork confusing. An Advance Directive and POLST form are both good ideas to have, especially when planning for the future. Let's clarify what each one is and see which one best suits your needs. First, can you tell me a bit about why you were advised to get these forms?
PATIENT: That… is a good question. I truly don't recall specifically who suggested it, or the exact circumstances. It feels like… a conversation with a friend, perhaps? Or maybe a financial advisor? I was going through a… difficult patch, a few months ago. It involved some… changes. I apologize for my vagueness. My memory isn't what it used to be. They mentioned… peace of mind, I believe. And not burdening anyone.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. It’s common to be a little hazy on details when you’re going through a stressful time. “Peace of mind” and “not burdening anyone” are excellent reasons to consider these forms. Let's start with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… illnesses? I don’t believe so. Nothing… major. I had my tonsils removed as a child, I think. And… a broken wrist, years ago. A silly fall. Beyond that… I’ve been quite fortunate, generally. I try to eat well, and get enough exercise. I do recall a bout of… influenza, a few winters back. But nothing that required… hospitalization, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils removed, broken wrist, and influenza. That’s good to know. And no chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or asthma?
PATIENT: No… I don’t believe so. I’ve never been told I have any of those conditions. I have… occasional headaches, but nothing debilitating. And… sometimes my back aches, after I’ve been standing for too long. My work… it requires a lot of precise movements, and I tend to hold myself in awkward positions. But I wouldn’t call it a condition, exactly. Just… the wear and tear of the profession, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional headaches and back pain related to your work. We can note that. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. No, not regularly. I occasionally take ibuprofen for the headaches, when they’re particularly bad. And… I used to take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, but I haven't been taking it lately. I… I seem to have misplaced the bottle. It's a recurring theme, I'm afraid. Losing things.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for headaches and occasional Vitamin D. No allergies to medications that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I recall. I’m… not particularly sensitive, generally. I remember being stung by a bee as a child, and having a bit of swelling, but that wasn't a medication, of course. I apologize again for my lack of… precision. It's frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Evann. It’s helpful to know these things. So, no known medication allergies. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult. My parents… they both passed away several years ago. And I… wasn’t particularly close to my extended family. I don’t really know. I believe my mother had… high blood pressure, perhaps? And my father… I think he had some issues with his heart, later in life. But beyond that… I’m afraid I can’t offer much detail. It’s not something we discussed, honestly. I wish I could be more helpful. It's a bit of a blank, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history. Knowing anything at all is helpful. High blood pressure and heart issues in your parents, we’ll note that. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, on special occasions. And… recreational drugs? Goodness, no. My work requires a steady hand and a clear mind. And… frankly, I simply don’t have the temperament for it. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book, or a long walk in the countryside. I'm a rather… practical person, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no recreational drugs. That's good to know. Finally, do you have any advance directives or a POLST form in place currently?
PATIENT: That’s… the reason I’m here, isn’t it? No, I don’t. I thought I might have started one, a few years ago, during that… difficult time. But I can’t seem to recall finishing it. Or even where I would have put it, if I did. It's all a bit hazy, I’m afraid. That’s why I made this appointment. I want to be prepared, you see. To make sure my wishes are… respected, should something happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no current advance directives or POLST form. That’s perfectly alright, that’s what we’re here to discuss today. It sounds like you’re thinking ahead, which is excellent. Alright, Evann, based on what you’ve told me, it seems like an advance directive would be a good starting point for you. It allows you to specify your wishes regarding medical treatment, and appoint someone to make decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to do so yourself. Would you like me to explain the different components of an advance directive, and what it involves?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… most helpful. I admit, the terminology is a bit overwhelming. And I want to be sure I understand everything before… committing to anything. I want to make sure it’s… comprehensive. And that it accurately reflects my wishes. Perhaps we could start with… the appointing of someone? That seems like the most important part.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Appointing a healthcare proxy – or agent – is a crucial first step. This person will be responsible for making medical decisions on your behalf if you're unable to do so yourself. It's important to choose someone you trust implicitly, someone who understands your values and wishes, and who can advocate for you even when it's difficult. Do you have anyone in mind for this role?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question. I… I don’t have any close family, as I mentioned. And… my friends are lovely, but… I’m not sure if they’re equipped to handle something like that. There’s… a colleague. A fellow etcher, named Dimitri. He’s… very reliable. And intelligent. We’ve worked together for years. He’s… seen me at my best, and my worst. I suppose… he would be the most logical choice. Do you think… that would be sufficient?
DOCTOR: Dimitri sounds like a very reasonable choice, Evann. It's important that it's someone you trust and who understands your wishes. Knowing a colleague for years and seeing you at your best and worst is a good foundation. Do you have his contact information?
PATIENT: I believe so. Let me see… Ah, here we are. Dimitri Volkov… His number is… 555-123-4567. And his address is… 14 Oak Street, Meadowbrook. I hope that’s sufficient. I'm a bit disorganized, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: This is perfect, thank you. So, we’ll list Dimitri Volkov as your healthcare proxy. He’ll be the person we contact if you’re unable to make decisions for yourself. Now, the next step is to think about what kind of decisions you want him to make on your behalf. Do you have any specific preferences regarding life-sustaining treatment, such as mechanical ventilation or artificial nutrition?
PATIENT: That… is a very difficult question. I’ve never really… considered it. I suppose… I’ve always believed in… a natural progression. That life should run its course. I wouldn’t want to be… kept alive artificially, if there was no hope of recovery. Prolonging suffering… seems… pointless. But… at the same time, I don’t want to… give up easily. It’s… a difficult balance. Perhaps… I’m not ready to make a definitive decision on that matter yet. Is it… necessary to decide everything at once?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. You are not required to make any decisions you’re not comfortable with. It’s common to feel conflicted about these matters. We can start with more general statements, and leave the specifics open for now. For example, we could state that you do not wish to receive life-sustaining treatment if you have a terminal illness with no reasonable hope of recovery. And that you want your proxy to prioritize your comfort and quality of life. Does that sound like a reasonable approach?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds much better. Prioritizing comfort and quality of life… that resonates with me. And… not wanting to be kept alive artificially without hope… that feels right. I suppose… I trust Dimitri to make the right decisions, based on those principles. He’s… a very level-headed and compassionate person. Perhaps… we can revisit the specifics later, if I feel more comfortable. If that's alright.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can certainly revisit this later. Let’s document that you prioritize comfort and quality of life, and do not wish to receive life-sustaining treatment if you have a terminal illness with no reasonable hope of recovery. Dimitri Volkov is your designated healthcare proxy and will make decisions based on those principles. Now, are there any other specific wishes you’d like to include in your advance directive?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Oh! Yes. I would… I would like to request that my artwork be preserved. I’ve spent my life creating etchings and engravings. They’re… very important to me. I don’t have any family to inherit them, so… I would like to donate them to a museum, if possible. Or… to a local art school. Somewhere they can be appreciated. Is that something we can include?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's a wonderful request, and a very important one. We can definitely include a provision specifying your wishes regarding the preservation and donation of your artwork. Do you have a specific museum or art school in mind?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, the Meadowbrook Museum of Art is quite close. They have a small collection of contemporary prints. Or… the County Art School. They have a very good reputation, and they often showcase the work of local artists. Perhaps… I’ll leave it open-ended, and let Dimitri decide which institution would be the most appropriate? I don't want to be too prescriptive. I trust his judgment. It's probably better if he chooses based on their current needs and resources.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll document that you wish your artwork to be donated to either the Meadowbrook Museum of Art or the County Art School, and that Dimitri Volkov is authorized to make the final decision based on their current needs and resources. Alright, Evann, I think we've covered the essential components of your advance directive. Would you like me to print a copy for you to review?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. I'd like to read it over carefully, just to make sure everything is accurate. And… I suppose I should sign it, if everything is to my liking? It's… a bit overwhelming, to think about all of this. But… I feel much better having taken steps to prepare. Thank you, Doctor Alzoubi. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Here you are. Please take your time reviewing it. And yes, once you’re satisfied, you’ll need to sign and date it. You’ll also need to have two witnesses present who are not your healthcare proxy or beneficiaries of your will. I’m glad I could help, Evann. It’s a big step, and it's good you’re taking it. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m alright for now. I'll read it over at home, and… if I have any questions, I’ll give you a call. Thank you again, Doctor Alzoubi. You’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate your patience and understanding. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. Take your time, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions at all. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day.
