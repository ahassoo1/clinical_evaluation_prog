DOCTOR: Hi Candice, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, it’s simply a formality, really. My husband insisted. New to the area, you understand. Medicare requires these… visits. Honestly, I haven't the slightest idea why I'm here. Just filling out paperwork, I presume?
DOCTOR: I understand. It is good to get established with a primary care doctor when you move, even if everything’s going well. And Medicare does have some initial preventative visit requirements, you're right. But I still want to make sure we check in and see how you’re doing overall. It's not just about fulfilling requirements. So, let's start with a little bit about you. Are you having any health concerns at all?
PATIENT: Concerns? At my age, doctor, everything is a concern. Honestly, it’s just… getting old. Joints ache, memory isn't what it used to be – hardly news, I’m sure. But I assure you, I’m not here to waste your time with trivial complaints. Is there a form I need to sign confirming I’m… adequately old?
DOCTOR: There’s absolutely no form for that, Candice! And it’s never a waste of my time to hear what’s going on with you. Even “generalized age-related complaints” can point to things we should address to help you feel your best. Let's try to be a bit more specific. When did you start noticing these aches and pains?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, I couldn't possibly tell you. Years ago, I should imagine. Decades, even. It’s a gradual process, you understand. Like dust accumulating. I haven't kept a meticulous record of my decline, if that's what you expect. I lead a quiet life. Mostly at home. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. I just want to get a general sense of things. Okay, so aches for a long time… do those aches limit your ability to do things you enjoy?
PATIENT: Enjoy? Doctor, my "enjoyments" are considerably curtailed these days. I used to garden, but bending is… difficult. And walking any distance is simply out of the question. It's not a matter of pain, necessarily. It’s… inconvenient. And truthfully, I haven't the energy for it anymore. It’s all rather tedious, really. Can we simply confirm I’m adequately checked and be done with it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candice. It sounds like this has been building up for a while. Just a couple more questions, then we can do a quick physical exam, if you’re agreeable, and see what’s going on. Have you noticed any swelling in your joints?
PATIENT: Swelling? Good heavens, no. I bathe regularly, doctor. I would notice if I were… swollen. Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather… unnecessary. Are you implying something? I assure you, I'm perfectly capable of basic hygiene. Let's just get this over with, shall we? The examination, if you insist. But I expect it to be brief.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. It's just standard procedure to rule out different possibilities. Alright, let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your joints – just to see how they’re moving. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Very well. But do be quick about it. I have… engagements. Though, admittedly, they don't require much exertion. Just… please be gentle. I'm not as resilient as I used to be. And absolutely no prodding.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Another deep breath… and out. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm just going to gently check your joints. I’ll start with your hands. Can you open and close your fists for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Satisfied? It's not a particularly graceful movement, I assure you. I haven't the strength I once did. Though, frankly, I never did have particularly delicate hands. Always working, you see. Gardening, mostly. Before… well, before I stopped. Do hurry along. I'm starting to feel rather… exposed.
DOCTOR: I see. Just checking your range of motion and looking for any tenderness. Everything seems relatively normal, but I do notice a little stiffness. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m just going to check your knees and ankles. Can you bend your knees for me, as much as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no further! That’s quite enough, doctor. It’s… uncomfortable. And frankly, I find this whole exercise rather undignified. Are you certain you’ve gathered sufficient information? I’m an elderly woman, not a… a laboratory specimen. Let’s just skip the ankles. They’re probably no better. I’d like to sit down, if you don’t mind. This standing is becoming quite… taxing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. You're absolutely right to tell me when you're uncomfortable. My apologies. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Based on what you've told me, and what I’ve observed, it sounds like you're experiencing some age-related joint stiffness and decreased mobility, likely osteoarthritis. This is very common, especially with gardening and other activities you've enjoyed. We can certainly manage this. I’d like to discuss some options with you. Would you be open to trying some gentle exercises and potentially some over-the-counter pain relief?
PATIENT: Exercises? Pain relief? Doctor, I've tried all that. It’s… ineffective. Honestly, I’m not one for fuss. I simply wanted to fulfill the requirement, as I said. Are there any forms I need to sign confirming this… encounter? I have a luncheon to attend, and I really must be going. Perhaps a referral to a specialist who can… expedite this process? I'm not interested in endless treatments and therapies. Just a confirmation, please. That's all I ask. And a quick exit.
DOCTOR: I understand, Candice. We can absolutely focus on documentation for Medicare. I will note that we’ve discussed age-related joint stiffness and that you’re not interested in pursuing active treatment at this time. I can provide you with a summary of our visit, and I’m happy to write a referral to a rheumatologist if you’d like, just for a second opinion, even if you don’t plan on following up. It can be good to have it on file. Before you go, are you having any difficulty with everyday tasks like dressing or bathing?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Do you take me for an invalid? I am perfectly capable of managing my own affairs, thank you very much. Honestly, the questions you’re asking are quite…impertinent. I believe I’ve indulged you quite enough. Just the summary, please. And the quickest possible exit. I assure you, my time is valuable, even if yours isn't. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. Here is the summary of our visit. I have also included the referral information for a rheumatologist, should you change your mind. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions in the future. And, Candice, if you ever do find that your daily activities are becoming more difficult, please reach out. We’re here to help, even if it’s just to discuss options. Have a pleasant day, and enjoy your luncheon.
