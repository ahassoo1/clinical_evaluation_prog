DOCTOR: Hi Lamark, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. Just need a check-up for… well, a sports team tryout. Gotta make sure I’m okay to go for it, you know? Don’t wanna pull anything before I even start.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s smart to get checked out beforehand! A pre-participation physical is a great idea. So, tell me a bit more about the tryout. What sport is it for, and what kind of activities will be involved?
PATIENT: It’s… Mongolian wrestling. Not a ton of running, thankfully. Mostly grappling, throws, strength stuff… you know, the usual. It’s pretty intense though, even if it doesn’t look it. It's more about endurance and technique than just being big.
DOCTOR: Right, Mongolian wrestling! I’ve read a little about it, sounds like a really demanding sport. Okay, so endurance and technique-focused. Have you been training regularly for this tryout?
PATIENT: Yeah, for a couple months now. I used to wrestle a lot when I was younger, but… life got in the way. Trying to get back into shape. It's going alright, I guess. I feel okay, but I want to be sure everything's still working like it should. You know, old man stuff.
DOCTOR: “Old man stuff” is a good way to put it! It’s always good to be cautious when getting back into physical activity after a break. So, have you noticed any pain, injuries, or limitations while training?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. A little soreness here and there, like you’d expect. My knees get a bit creaky sometimes, but that’s just… age, I think. Nothing I can’t work through. No twists, pulls, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. “Creaky knees” are common, we can definitely take a look at those. Now, let's go through some basics. Do you have any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. To be honest. Always felt alright. This tryout is making me think I should probably start going again.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, and it's very responsible of you to get checked out now. It's good you're prioritizing your health. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Nah, never had surgery. No hospital stays either. Broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was it. Still feels a little funny sometimes when it gets cold. But nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Uh… my dad had some heart trouble when he got older, I think. But he lived to be pretty old, so it wasn't too bad. My mom was always pretty healthy. That’s all I can really remember off the top of my head. We didn't really talk about health stuff much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Knowing about your dad's heart trouble is good to have. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had allergies. I can eat anything, take anything… as far as I know. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to that sort of thing. Sorry if that’s not helpful.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly fine. It is helpful to know! And are you currently taking any medications – prescriptions, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing. I don't take anything. I try to eat well, get enough sleep... mostly. I really just need to make sure I’m not gonna collapse during the tryout, you know? That would be embarrassing.
DOCTOR: That's understandable! We definitely want to avoid that. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your joints. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, sounds good. Whatever you need to do. Let’s get it over with, eh? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just hop up there, and we’ll get started. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Knees have some crepitus with range of motion, but no acute tenderness or swelling. Full range of motion, although slightly limited. Pulses are 2+ bilaterally in all extremities. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. Ears and throat appear normal.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that… bad? The blood pressure thing? I told you I probably needed to go to the doctor more often.
DOCTOR: It’s not bad, but it's a little higher than ideal. 140/90 puts you in Stage 1 hypertension. It doesn't mean you need to panic, but it's something we should monitor. It could be a number of things – stress, diet, lack of exercise, even just being nervous during the exam. We can recheck it today, and if it’s consistently high, we might want to do some further testing. For now, let’s talk about some lifestyle changes that can help lower your blood pressure. Have you been getting regular exercise?
PATIENT: Nah, not really regular. I walk sometimes. Mostly just… puttering around. I used to be pretty active, but like I said, life got in the way. Work, you know? Is this gonna take much longer? I’ve got stuff to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, well, even small changes can make a big difference. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Walking is a great start! Also, let's talk about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Uh… Breakfast is usually just coffee. Sometimes toast. Lunch is… whatever I can grab, usually something quick. Sandwich, maybe. Dinner, my daughter usually cooks something when she comes over. I don’t really pay attention to what I eat, to be honest. It’s not like I’m a big eater. Look, Doctor, can we just wrap this up? I just need to know if I’m okay to wrestle, not get a lecture on my diet.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lamark. I'm not trying to lecture you, but knowing your overall health is important, especially before starting a physically demanding activity. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, you likely are okay to participate in the wrestling tryout, but with some precautions. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend monitoring it at home for a week. If it consistently stays above 140/90, we should investigate further. Also, try to increase your physical activity gradually, and focus on a healthier diet, even if it's just small changes. Are you comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Monitor the blood pressure. Gradual activity. I can do that. Just… where do I get a blood pressure thingy? And what numbers are too high, exactly? I gotta get going soon.
DOCTOR: You can get a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies – Walgreens, CVS, that sort of thing. They’re fairly inexpensive. As for numbers, consistently over 140/90 is what we want to keep an eye on. Ideally, we want it below 130/80, but for now, staying below 140/90 is the goal. Here's a link to a reputable website with information on managing high blood pressure, including diet and exercise recommendations. I’ll also print out a summary of our discussion for you to take home. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that’s it. Just… thanks, Doctor. I gotta get going. Gotta get back to… well, it doesn't matter. Thanks again. Maybe I'll see you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lamark. Please do keep an eye on your blood pressure, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And good luck with the tryout! .
