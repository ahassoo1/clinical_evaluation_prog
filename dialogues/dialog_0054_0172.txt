DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Yes, well, I suppose I’m here for a… social visit, as the paperwork indicated. New to the area, you understand. Really, I haven’t the time for lengthy explanations. Just seeing if everything is… adequate.
DOCTOR: I understand, Candice. A general check-up to establish care is perfectly fine. We want to make sure everything is adequate, as you say. To get started, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Overall health… that's a broad question, isn't it? I’ve lived a long life, if that's what you're getting at. I really don't keep track of these things. I have Medicare, if that is relevant. And a husband, of course. Is there a form I can fill out? This is terribly inefficient.
DOCTOR: Of course. Medicare is helpful information, thank you. And yes, we do have forms, but it's often easier to just chat for a few minutes. It helps me get a better picture of things. We'll get to the paperwork eventually. Perhaps we could start with any current issues you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Issues? Well, I get tired, naturally. I'm seventy-nine years old! And my knees… don’t function as they once did. Honestly, what doesn’t ache at this age? I fail to see what this has to do with anything. Is this going to take much longer? I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: I understand, Candice. Fatigue and knee pain are common concerns at any age, and certainly more frequent as we get older. We want to figure out what's contributing to them and how we can best manage them. Just to get a little more detail, could you describe the knee pain?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… pain. Sharp sometimes, dull others. It's in both of them, if that's what you’re asking. I suppose it's worse when I walk, and especially going up and down stairs. Really, it's quite obvious. I shouldn't have to spell this out. Is this doctor trained, or did you simply hire anyone off the street?
DOCTOR: I assure you, Candice, I am fully trained and licensed. I apologize if I'm asking seemingly obvious questions; it's important for me to gather a complete picture of your health. Okay, so the pain is in both knees, worsened with walking and stairs. Does it ever feel warm to the touch, or is there any swelling?
PATIENT: Warm? Swelling? I haven't the faintest idea! Do I look like I spend my days examining my knees? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I suppose they might be a little puffy sometimes, but that could be from standing too long. I haven't a medical degree, doctor. I expect you to use your own judgement. This is quite frustrating. I really must be going.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candice. It’s not necessary to be a medical expert. Let’s try a different approach. Have you noticed any locking, clicking, or giving-way sensation in your knees?
PATIENT: Locking, clicking… really? You want me to diagnose myself now? I’m a dispatcher, not an orthopedic surgeon! No, I haven't noticed anything of the sort. They just… hurt. Is there anything else I need to endure before I can leave? I’m losing precious time. And frankly, I’m beginning to feel quite faint. This whole experience is terribly inefficient. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Let’s pause there. It sounds like you’re understandably frustrated, and perhaps not feeling well. I want to make sure we address your concerns efficiently. To quickly get a better sense of things, would you mind if I just take a quick look at your knees and maybe check your blood pressure?
