DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Paguioto, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Nathaiel Paguioto. But please, call me Nathaiel. It’s nice to meet you, Dr. Burlingham.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, Nathaiel. Well, let’s not waste time on pleasantries. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Sorry. It's for a vaccination, I think. Medicare sent a notice… something about needing a booster? I wasn’t quite sure which one, to be honest. They just said to come in for it.
DOCTOR: Medicare… honestly. They send everyone running around for everything. Let me pull up your record here… Hmm. Yes, it seems you are due for an updated COVID booster. And a flu shot, actually. You haven’t had one this season, have you?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. I completely forgot about the flu shot, to be honest. I've been meaning to get both, but things have been… busy. So, both today then? Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Well, if you insist on making this more complicated than it needs to be. Yes, we can do both today. It's perfectly safe. Though I do wish people would be more proactive with their health. Now, before we proceed, any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, I don’t think so. Not to medications, anyway. I’m a little sensitive to dust, but that’s it, really. Nothing that would stop me from getting a shot, I don't think. And no, I haven’t had any reactions to vaccines before, as far as I can remember.
DOCTOR: "Reports no known allergies." Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. Just a daily multivitamin, that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, though. Just something I picked up at the store. It's for… well, you know, just to make sure I’m getting enough vitamins. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Honestly, people and their supplements… No, a multivitamin isn’t usually relevant. But I have to ask. Alright. Let’s have a quick listen to your heart and lungs, just to be sure everything sounds normal before we proceed. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I get a little nervous with doctors, so please, take your time.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Heart rate is a little elevated, but likely just anxiety. Lungs are clear, thank goodness. Blood pressure is… rather high, actually. 145 over 90. Have you been monitoring that at all?
PATIENT: Oh, wow. No, I haven’t. I don't have a blood pressure monitor at home. Is that… bad? I haven’t been feeling sick or anything, just a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But I just thought that was from being busy. Is 145 over 90 really high?
DOCTOR: It's… elevated. We’ll need to keep an eye on that. It's not an emergency right now, but it does require attention. We’ll check it again at the end of the visit, and if it’s still high, we’ll discuss some lifestyle changes and possibly medication. Now, let’s get these vaccinations done, and then we can revisit this blood pressure situation. Roll up your sleeve, please.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I'm not a big fan of needles, if you don't mind. Is it going to hurt much? And which one are we doing first, the flu shot or the… COVID booster, was it?
DOCTOR: Just a little pinch. Honestly, people make such a fuss. It's far less painful than the things your body fights off naturally. COVID booster first, then the flu. All done. Now, just sit quietly for fifteen minutes, and I’ll check on you. We need to make sure you don't have a reaction. And we will need to recheck that blood pressure. Don't go wandering off.
PATIENT: Okay, fifteen minutes, right. It does sting a little, but I’m sure it’s nothing. This waiting is the worst part, isn’t it? I always worry something will go wrong. I hope my blood pressure isn't too high… Is there anything I should be feeling for, or watching out for, while I wait? Just to be safe?
DOCTOR: Just a little dizziness, trouble breathing, hives… the usual. But you'll be fine. Most people are just dramatic. I'll be back in a few minutes to recheck your blood pressure. Try to relax. Honestly, the anxiety probably isn't helping it.
PATIENT: Right… dizziness, trouble breathing… great. Okay, focus on the pictures… that nice landscape… and the… the plant over there. Just relax, Nathaiel. Just relax. This is… not very fun. I really should probably start monitoring my blood pressure at home… if I can even figure out how. .
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s see what we’ve got now. Hmm. Still elevated. 150 over 95. We're going to have to talk about this. You need to make some lifestyle changes, and possibly consider medication. Do you exercise regularly?
