DOCTOR: Bula! Hello Mackenzi, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Um… well, I’m here for a clearance, I believe. For… surgery. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. My husband… he arranged everything. He passed a few months ago, and I’m… trying to get things sorted. It has to do with… some things I’d like to have done, cosmetically.
DOCTOR: Oh, I am so very sorry to hear about your husband. That must be incredibly difficult, and it’s completely understandable if things feel a bit overwhelming right now. We’ll take things at your pace, okay?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you to say. It is… a lot. And yes, please, at your pace is wonderful. I don’t… recall all the specifics about the surgery itself, only that I expressed interest in it before… everything happened. Perhaps you have some information in your records?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's see… it looks like you had a consultation with Dr. Reynolds about possible breast augmentation and a tummy tuck back in February. The notes indicate you were interested due to changes after pregnancy. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: February… Yes, I… I think so. I did have a baby, years ago now. It’s… coming back in fragments. Breast augmentation and a tummy tuck… yes, that sounds like something I would have considered. I wasn’t very happy with how my body changed, if I’m being honest. But the details… they’re just… gone. Do you need me to… remember everything for this to work? I apologize, I feel very inefficient.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly normal to have gaps in your memory, especially given everything you've been through. We can absolutely proceed without a detailed recollection of the original consultation. We'll just need to go through some standard pre-operative assessments to ensure you’re a good candidate and to discuss potential risks and benefits. First, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly in… well, a long time. My husband always handled those things. I think I’m generally healthy. I walk a bit, I eat reasonably well… nothing major that I know of. I had a fairly uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, if that’s relevant. No history of serious illness in my family, either, as far as I remember. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No major medical history is a good starting point. Let’s quickly run through some of the standard questions, just to be thorough. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Apart from the birth of my son, which was a Cesarean section… no. No other surgeries, not that I recall. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, perhaps? But that was a very long time ago, and I don’t remember much about it. I’m afraid my memory is truly dreadful. Is it alright if my primary care physician sends over my records? Perhaps they’ll be more comprehensive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that's a great idea! Having your primary care records would be very helpful. Do you happen to know who your primary care doctor is, and what practice they're with?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s… difficult. My husband chose all our doctors. I… vaguely remember a name. Dr. Alvarez? Or maybe… Ramirez? The practice was… near the mall, I think. A fairly large building. I’m so sorry, I really wish I could be more helpful. This is terribly embarrassing. I feel like I’m wasting your time.
DOCTOR: You’re not wasting my time at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly understandable to be uncertain about these things, especially with everything you've been through. We can try to track down the records another way if you’re unsure. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Not currently. I haven’t needed anything regularly for… well, years. Occasionally, I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, nothing ongoing. I don't take any vitamins or supplements, either. I wasn't much of a pill-taker, even before… everything. Is that… satisfactory? I feel so inadequate at remembering these things. Perhaps I should just reschedule when I’ve had a chance to speak to someone who knows my medical history better.
DOCTOR: You are doing just fine, Mackenzi. Truly. We’ll gather all the information we need, one way or another. No need to reschedule. Okay, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. No food allergies, no skin sensitivities… I’m generally quite resilient, actually. My husband used to joke that I could eat anything. I’ve never needed an EpiPen or anything like that. I’m… remarkably un-allergic, if that’s a thing. Perhaps that’s a good sign? Does that information help? I'm just trying to provide what I can, though it is, admittedly, very little.
DOCTOR: It is helpful! No known allergies is good. Now, just a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… no. Not anymore. My husband… he didn't approve. We… both used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but we stopped years ago. And no, I’ve never used recreational drugs. Never had any interest in them, to be honest. We lived a very… quiet life. A very controlled life, perhaps. Does that answer your question? I’m… I’m not sure if it’s relevant, but I feel compelled to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for your honesty, Mackenzi. It’s helpful for me to have a complete picture. Okay, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s talk a little bit about your reason for seeking surgery now. You mentioned expressing interest before, but what’s motivating you to proceed at this time?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to explain. Before, it was about… aesthetics, I suppose. I wasn’t happy with my body after my son was born. I wanted to feel… better about myself. But now… now it’s different. It’s about… reclaiming something. Something that I wanted, before… before everything changed. It feels like… a small way to take control of my life again, to honor my own desires. It feels silly, to be honest. But after everything, after losing him… I just want to feel like… me again. I don’t know if that makes sense. I feel very lost, and this feels like… a step forward, however small. A step for me.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mackenzi. It’s not silly at all. It's very brave of you to identify what you need to move forward, and wanting to reclaim a part of yourself is a perfectly valid and understandable motivation. It’s completely normal to want to feel like yourself again after a loss. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and then do a brief examination of the areas we'll be working on to assess the tissue and skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I… I’m ready. I suppose. I just… please be gentle. I’m a little… fragile, at the moment. I appreciate you being so kind. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mackenzi. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to examine your breasts and the area around your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Skin is smooth, no masses palpated. Some mild laxity noted, consistent with previous pregnancy. Moderate laxity of abdominal skin, some stretch marks present. Overall, good skin elasticity.
PATIENT: It's… a little tender, there. But not painful, exactly. Just… sensitive. The stretch marks… yes, they’ve been there for years. I haven’t really… looked at them in a long time. It’s… strange, being examined like this. It feels… vulnerable. But I trust you, Doctor. I just… please, don’t hesitate to tell me if you need me to adjust my position, or if something doesn’t feel right. This is all… very new.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mackenzi. I appreciate you letting me know. We'll take things at your pace. I’m just noting the mild tenderness and the presence of stretch marks. It’s all very typical. Okay, that’s all for now. Everything looks good, overall. Based on my examination and what you’ve told me, you appear to be a suitable candidate for the procedures you’re interested in. However, to be completely thorough, I would like to order some routine bloodwork to check your overall health and ensure there are no underlying conditions that could affect the surgery. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s wonderful. Bloodwork sounds… sensible. Absolutely, please. Whatever is necessary to ensure everything goes smoothly. I just want to… do this safely. And correctly. I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. You’ve put me at ease. Do you have a lab in mind? And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m… eager to move forward, but I understand that things take time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. We use the lab just across the street, at Brightwell Medical. They’re very efficient. The results usually take about 3-5 business days. Once I have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results, answer any further questions you may have, and finalize the surgical plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfect, Doctor. Brightwell Medical, just across the street… 3-5 business days… Yes, that’s ideal. Thank you. Truly. I feel… hopeful, for the first time in a long time. I suppose… I should go and get the bloodwork done? And then just… wait?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Here’s the requisition form. Just take this to Brightwell, and they’ll take care of everything. You can schedule the appointment when you go, or just walk in – they usually don’t have long wait times. Once you have the results, you can either call the office to schedule a follow-up, or you can bring the results with you if you happen to be passing by. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been incredibly thorough and patient. I truly appreciate it. I suppose… I’ll just… see you in a few days, then? Thank you again, Doctor Kimm. You've been a great help. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and have a good day.
