DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Frankly, I don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s… a bit embarrassing, really. It’s a problem in my mouth. A white coating. It’s not… pleasant. I assume you’ve seen this before.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, many things can cause a white coating in the mouth. It’s good you came in to get it checked. To help me figure out what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why it's happening. It just… appeared. A few days ago, maybe. It’s mostly on my tongue, and it’s… difficult to eat. It feels a bit rough. I’ve been using mouthwash, the strong kind, but it doesn't seem to be doing much good. I keep my hygiene quite well, you understand. It's probably nothing serious, but my wife insisted I come. Women always worry about these things.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said it's mostly on your tongue?
PATIENT: Yes, primarily. Though there is some… on the insides of my cheeks, but it’s much less noticeable there. It's mostly the tongue that bothers me. It feels… coated, like I haven't brushed properly, but I assure you, I have. It’s just… unpleasant. And making it hard to taste my coffee, which is a tragedy, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? No, not that I've noticed. I haven't been feeling ill, no fever, no pain… just this… coating. Perhaps a little… fatigue, but I work long hours, so that's hardly unusual. It’s just this white stuff, Doctor. Is it contagious? My wife is quite close to me, you understand.
DOCTOR: Contagious is unlikely, but we need to determine the cause before we can say for certain. Now, have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet? No. I eat the same things, more or less. Steak, potatoes, coffee… a bit of fruit when my wife buys it. I haven't been experimenting with any… exotic foods, if that’s what you’re implying. I’m a practical man, Doctor, not a gourmand. What is causing this? Is it… serious? I have commitments, you understand. A business to run. I don’t have time for illnesses.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I understand you're busy. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses? Not particularly. I had the flu, perhaps, a few times. Nothing that required a hospital stay, certainly. I’ve always been a strong man, resilient. No chronic conditions, no allergies… I'm quite healthy, all things considered. I don’t take any medication, either. I prefer to avoid pills, if possible. It's probably just… a temporary thing. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t understand why I had to come here for this. Is a simple mouthwash not enough? My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Good question… my father was… a robust man. Lived to a good age, though he did enjoy his whiskey. My mother… she had some aches and pains, as older women often do. Nothing… specific. No history of… mouth problems, if that’s what you mean. They were practical people, my parents. Not ones for fussing over ailments. It’s probably nothing hereditary, I assure you. This is all rather… unnecessary, frankly. Can’t you just look at it and tell me what it is? I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. Let’s have a look. Please open wide and say “Ah.” I need to examine your mouth more closely. And please, try to relax. This will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure this is going to be very helpful. It’s just a white coating. A bit unsightly, perhaps, but hardly a medical emergency. Hurry it along, if you please. I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there is a fairly extensive white coating on your tongue and buccal mucosa. It appears somewhat… adherent. No obvious lesions or ulcers. Your gums appear healthy, though slightly inflamed. Interestingly, I do notice some fissuring on your tongue. Have you been experiencing any burning sensation, or difficulty with chewing?
PATIENT: Burning sensation? No, not exactly. A bit… rough, as I said. And it is difficult to eat, particularly anything spicy. My wife made a curry last week, and it was… unpleasant. It just felt… irritated. And the taste was… muted. I assumed it was the curry, to be honest. And, frankly, I don't enjoy spicy food anyway. Is this related to whatever this… white stuff is? I hope it’s nothing serious. My meeting is quite important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and my examination, it could be a few things. Oral thrush is a possibility, though you don’t present with many of the typical symptoms. Geographic tongue could explain the fissuring, but the coating is unusual in that case. It's also possible it could be a form of oral lichen planus, though that typically presents with more inflammation. Given your history, I'd like to rule out a few things. I'm going to order a fungal culture to check for thrush. And I think it would be best to do a biopsy of a small area of the coating on your tongue just to be safe. It will help us confirm a diagnosis.
PATIENT: A biopsy? Absolutely not. A biopsy sounds… invasive. And I haven’t the time for such procedures. A fungal culture, perhaps, if it’s quick. But a biopsy is out of the question. I assure you, Doctor, I’m perfectly healthy. This is all a waste of my time and, frankly, unnecessary fuss. I’d rather simply try a stronger mouthwash. Perhaps with some… antiseptic properties. Is that not sufficient? I have a business to run, you understand. I can’t be lying around waiting for test results. This is… preposterous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I understand your concerns about your time. However, a biopsy is a relatively simple procedure and is the best way to determine the cause of this coating and rule out anything serious. Without a definitive diagnosis, we can’t properly address this issue. While a stronger mouthwash might provide temporary relief, it won’t resolve the underlying cause. It could also mask symptoms and delay a proper diagnosis. I strongly recommend the biopsy. If you are still hesitant, I can refer you to a specialist, an oral pathologist, who can discuss your options in more detail. However, I cannot proceed with simply prescribing a stronger mouthwash without further investigation. It would be irresponsible.
PATIENT: Irresponsible? You are being irresponsible, Doctor, wasting my valuable time with unnecessary procedures! I’ve made my decision. I will not have a biopsy. And I certainly won’t be wasting any more time with specialists. I will simply… try a stronger mouthwash. If it doesn't improve, I'll manage it myself. I’ve dealt with minor ailments before. Good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I must document your refusal of recommended diagnostic testing. Please be aware that without a diagnosis, this condition could worsen, and I cannot be held responsible for any complications that may arise. If you experience any significant changes – increased pain, difficulty swallowing, or spreading of the coating – please seek immediate medical attention. I wish you well. .
