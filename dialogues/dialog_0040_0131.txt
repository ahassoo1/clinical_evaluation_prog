DOCTOR: Right. Mykeisha Sladen, 36. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Osga. Well, it's my blood pressure. It's been a bit high lately, and my sister told me I should really get it checked out. She worries about me, you know? It's not bad bad, but it's higher than I'd like.
DOCTOR: "A bit high," you say. Right. And how high is "a bit high," exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I don’t really know the numbers, to be honest. I checked it at the pharmacy a couple of times, when I was getting my usual stuff, and the machine beeped red both times. The pharmacist said I should see a doctor, which is why I'm here. I don’t really understand all those numbers anyway. Is red bad?
DOCTOR: Red is generally not a good sign, no. Look, we need actual numbers. Pharmacy machines aren't exactly precise. Do you have any idea when you last checked it, or what the reading was even approximately?
PATIENT: Let me think… the last time was probably… oh, about two weeks ago, maybe a little less? At the corner pharmacy, you know, the one by Mr. Henderson’s bakery? It was… um… I think it said something like 150 over… 90? Or was it 100? Honestly, I was more focused on getting my allergy medicine. I just remember the red light and the pharmacist looking concerned. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful with the numbers.
DOCTOR: 150 over 90... Alright. And have you been experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I haven't been feeling sick, not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work a lot. I do a bit of everything – cleaning houses, helping out at the community centre… so, tired is kinda normal. My head's been a bit achey too, now that you mention it, but I just thought it was from being in the sun. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Headache can be. Alright, well, let’s just do a quick exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Should I, um… should I change into a gown or anything?
DOCTOR: No, no gown necessary. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take a look in your ears. Just sit back and relax, if you can.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds easy enough. I always get a little nervous at the doctor's, even for a check-up. It's silly, I know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. Pulse is a bit elevated at 88, and your breathing sounds a little… congested. Blood pressure reading is 148 over 92. As expected. Not a crisis, but certainly something we need to address. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies, not that I know of. I take a little something for my hayfever sometimes, but that's it. Just the usual over-the-counter stuff. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything ever, thankfully. Does that high blood pressure mean I have to take pills? Because I really don’t like taking pills.
DOCTOR: We’ll see. Don’t jump to conclusions. Before we even think about medication, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise… well, not really, not regularly. I'm on my feet all day at work, running around cleaning and helping people, does that count? It’s physical, but it’s not like going to the gym or anything. I used to enjoy dancing, but I haven’t had the time lately. Everything’s just been so busy.
DOCTOR: Running around isn’t exercise. Alright. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Oh, my diet... that's probably not the best, to be honest. I grab a lot of quick things, you know? Sandwiches, sometimes takeout... I try to eat fruit when I can, but it's hard to always have healthy stuff on hand. My sister is always telling me I need to eat more vegetables, she's a bit of a health nut. I do like a good macaroni pie, though. That's kinda a staple around here.
DOCTOR: Macaroni pie. Right. Well, it's not surprising your blood pressure is a little elevated. Look, I’m going to recommend some lifestyle changes. More fruits and vegetables, less takeout. And try to incorporate some actual exercise into your routine, even if it's just a brisk walk a few times a week. We'll recheck your blood pressure in a month. If it hasn’t improved, then we’ll talk about medication. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. More fruit, less takeout, and… try to walk more. My sister is going to be so pleased she was right. It’s just… hard to find the time. But I'll try, I promise. A month, huh? So I don't have to take pills right away?
DOCTOR: Not yet. We'll monitor. I’ll give you a handout with some dietary recommendations. Any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Thank you, Doctor Osga. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I'll try my best to stick to the plan. Maybe I'll even join a dancing class… if I can find the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. See you in a month. Next! .
