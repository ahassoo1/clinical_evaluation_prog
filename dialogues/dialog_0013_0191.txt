DOCTOR: Hi Tierney, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I asked to come in for an HIV test. It’s… a bit embarrassing to say, but I thought it was best to be sure, you understand?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Tierney. There's absolutely no shame in wanting to get tested, and you're doing the right thing. It's very responsible of you. Can you tell me a little bit about why you're wanting to get tested now?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, my husband and I, we… we weren’t always so careful, if you catch my drift. It was a long time ago, but it’s been on my mind lately. And with everything going around… I just want peace of mind, really. It’s better to know, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Tierney. It is always better to know. And you're right to be proactive. Okay, so this was a concern related to unprotected sex in the past. About how long ago are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It would have been… almost ten years ago now, I suppose. Perhaps a little more. We’ve been very careful since, truly. It’s just… it started bothering me again recently. Silly, perhaps, after all this time.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Tierney. Ten years ago is definitely within the window where testing is important. Just to be thorough, have you had any other testing for sexually transmitted infections since then?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. We… we didn't really talk about it much, if I'm honest. It was a difficult time, and we just… moved past it. I know that probably wasn’t very sensible, but… that’s the truth of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being honest with me, Tierney. It's helpful to know the full picture. Now, aside from that past risk, have you had any recent illnesses, any new symptoms – anything at all that’s been concerning you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I’ve been quite well, thankfully. A bit of a cold now and then, but nothing serious. I’m a fairly healthy woman, I believe. I do try to eat well, and I walk most days. Just… this worry, you see.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear you’re generally healthy, Tierney. Walking is excellent! Okay, so no recent illnesses or new symptoms. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anything regularly. Perhaps an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s all. I prefer to avoid medication if I can, honestly. I find a good rest usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. My husband has a bit of a dust allergy, but I don't.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Alright, Tierney, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. My mother had high blood pressure, but I seem to have avoided it so far. I get my blood pressure checked at the pharmacy occasionally, and it’s always been normal. I’m quite fortunate, truly. I try to stay active, as I said, and eat a healthy diet.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Tierney. Staying active and eating well makes a big difference. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… oh, I had my tonsils out when I was a child, many, many years ago. And I was briefly hospitalized when I gave birth to my son, but that was without complications, thankfully. Other than that, no. Nothing major, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and hospitalization for childbirth. And how about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's a bit… complicated. My mother's side, there's been a lot of… heart trouble. And diabetes, yes, quite a bit of that too. My father's side, I don’t know much about, to be honest. He wasn't around much when I was growing up, and we didn’t speak often. It’s… not a subject we discussed. I know it’s not very helpful, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Tierney. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing what you do know is what’s important. So, heart trouble and diabetes on your mother’s side. Now, before we proceed with the HIV test, I just want to confirm that you understand what the test involves, and we can discuss the results and next steps. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. I believe I understand. It’s a blood test, correct? And it will show if I have… the virus. I do understand the implications, of course. And I’m prepared to discuss the results, whatever they may be. I just… want to know.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It's a simple blood test. We'll send it to the lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them thoroughly. Before we do that, though, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. I suppose that’s to be expected, isn’t it? A physical exam. Very well. Just… please be gentle. My bones aren't what they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Tierney. I will be very gentle. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. We can take things at your pace. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will try to relax. It’s just… I always get a bit nervous around doctors, if I’m honest. It brings back… memories. But I'm doing this for peace of mind, aren’t I? Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. We can monitor that over time. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm just going to listen to a few more spots. Your ears look clear, and your throat is normal. No signs of any infection. Everything sounds and looks good, Tierney. No immediate concerns there. Now, I will order the HIV test. It will be a simple blood draw done by our phlebotomist. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve explained everything so clearly. I appreciate that. I suppose… I just hope everything is alright. But I'm prepared for whatever the result may be. Let’s just get the test done, shall we? I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tierney. I’ll have the phlebotomist come in to draw your blood. It will only take a few minutes. We will call you as soon as the results are in, usually within three to five business days. In the meantime, if you experience any new or concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We're here for you. Do you need a work note or anything like that for missing time for the test?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very thoughtful of you, Doctor. No, thank you. I’m retired, so I don’t have to worry about work. I just need to… wait for the results. And try not to worry too much, I suppose. Thank you again for being so kind and understanding. It’s been a great relief to finally get this done.
