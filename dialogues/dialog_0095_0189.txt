DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my… well, my business. Something’s not right, and frankly, I don’t appreciate having to come to doctors. Never had much luck with you lot. But my daughter insisted. Said I needed to get it checked. It's… blood. In my stool. Not a little bit, either. It’s… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Blood in the stool is concerning, and it's good you’re getting it checked out, even if you weren't initially keen. Your daughter is right to encourage you to come in. Now, can you tell me a bit more about this blood?
PATIENT: More about it? What more is there to say? It's red. It comes out with… everything else. I suppose it's mostly with it, not on it, if that makes any difference to you. And it's not just a drop, mind you. It's… noticeable. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but it's getting harder. I haven't changed anything in my diet, so I don't know why it's happening. Everything I eat is sensible, you know. Not like these youngsters with their… processed foods.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's mixed in with the stool, not just on the surface, and it's a significant amount. And you haven’t noticed any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Like I said, I eat properly. Roast chicken, vegetables, the occasional bit of fish. Nothing fancy, but it’s good food. Not one of those fad diets, you understand. I've been eating the same way for… well, decades. And I haven’t been feeling sick or anything, just… tired, but I’m 88 years old! Tiredness comes with the territory. It's the blood that's worrying me. It's just... not normal.
DOCTOR: Right, no other symptoms besides the tiredness and the blood in the stool. And the tiredness is fairly constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, I suppose. It’s not like a sudden thing. It’s just… always there. A bit of a drag, really. I don’t have the energy I used to, but then again, who does at my age? I used to fly those big planes, you know. That took energy. Now… well, I mostly sit. It's probably just old age, but this blood… it’s unsettling. It’s not something one expects.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when did you first notice the blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It was… about a week ago, maybe a bit longer. I didn't think much of it at first, figured it was something I ate. But then it kept happening. Every… well, almost every time I go to the bathroom. That’s when I told my daughter. She gets very worked up about these things. Always has. A bit of a hypochondriac, if you ask me. But she means well, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a week ago, happening almost every time you have a bowel movement. Now, has there been any change in your usual bowel habits besides the blood?
PATIENT: Change? What do you mean, change? I go to the bathroom when I need to, same as always. Perhaps it’s a bit… looser than usual, but I attributed that to the weather. It’s been awfully humid, you know. Everything feels damp. I don’t sit and analyze my… output, if you don't mind. It's just… a normal part of life. I just noticed the blood. That's all. Frankly, I’d like to get this sorted and go home. It’s a perfectly good day for flying. Even if I can’t do it anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so looser stools, possibly related to the humidity, and the primary concern is the blood. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any abdominal pain or cramping with the bowel movements?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A bit of discomfort, perhaps, but nothing you’d call pain. Old age is uncomfortable, you know. Everything aches. I’m not one for complaining. It’s a bit of a nuisance, this whole business, really. I’ve had tougher landings than this. And I’ve certainly felt worse after a bad turbulence. So, no, no pain. Just… blood. And a daughter who worries too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, just blood and a worried daughter. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more general questions about your health, if that’s alright. Have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? Well, I've lived for 88 years. I've had the usual bumps and scrapes. Pneumonia when I was a boy, a broken wrist falling off a horse… Nothing serious. A bit of arthritis, naturally. And my eyesight isn't what it used to be, hence the glasses. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was a long time ago and didn’t cause any trouble since. I never had much patience for doctors, so I never really bothered to get things checked properly. Didn't see the point. Now you’re asking about my past… it all feels rather pointless.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pneumonia as a child, a broken wrist, arthritis, gallbladder removal many years ago. No other major medical issues that you recall?
PATIENT: No. Nothing that I consider ‘major’. A few colds, a touch of the flu now and then… the usual ailments. I wasn't one for lingering in doctors’ offices. Waste of time, if you ask me. I preferred being in the air. It’s a bit different when you’re responsible for the lives of hundreds of people, you see. That focuses the mind. This… this is just a nuisance. A bothersome little problem. I don’t understand why it’s taking so long. Are you going to ask me about my childhood next?
DOCTOR: No, no childhood stories needed, Mr. Rowbottom. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I don’t believe in all those pills. Waste of money, and full of who-knows-what. I might take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's it. I prefer to let things run their course naturally. My daughter keeps trying to get me to take something for my arthritis, but I refuse. I’d rather deal with a bit of stiffness than fill my body with chemicals. I've lived this long without them, so I see no reason to start now. Honestly, are you almost finished? This is getting rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional aspirin. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I might have gotten a bit of a rash from poison ivy when I was a boy, but that wasn’t an allergy, just… a nuisance. And I can’t stand shellfish, but that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. My daughter always asks about allergies, too. She worries about everything. No, I don’t have any allergies. I'm a fairly robust individual, all things considered. Now, can we please get to the bottom of this blood situation? I'm starting to feel quite faint just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking a stool sample. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Honestly. More poking and prodding. Fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect any miracles. As I said, I’ve lived a long life, and my body has seen better days. And as for the stool sample… well, that’s just humiliating. But if it gets me out of here faster, so be it. Just… try to be quick about it. And please, don’t ask me any embarrassing questions. I’ve answered enough of them already.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll be as quick and respectful as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but some diminished breath sounds at the bases. Abdomen is soft, but mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Now, we'll need to collect a stool sample. I'll give you the necessary supplies and instructions. It’s important to get a good sample for testing.
PATIENT: Instructions. More instructions. Honestly. Well, get it over with. I suppose I haven't got much choice. A 'good sample,' you say? What constitutes a 'good sample'? This is just… undignified. Give me the container and tell me what I need to do. And please, try not to make eye contact. This is already embarrassing enough. Honestly. A man’s dignity… completely disregarded.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Rowbottom. The instructions are quite straightforward. It’s important to collect a small amount—about a walnut-sized sample—and avoid getting any urine in the container. There's a lid to screw on tightly, and you can leave it with the nurse on your way out. She'll send it to the lab for analysis. And, of course, I will respect your privacy. I’ll give you a moment. Let me know if you have any questions.
PATIENT: A walnut-sized sample… Honestly. You people think of everything. Right. Well. Don’t bother me unless it's absolutely necessary. I’ll just… go and attend to this unpleasant task. And don’t expect me to be cheerful about it. This whole experience has been thoroughly disagreeable. .
DOCTOR: Okay. History suggests possible lower GI bleed, but etiology unknown. Physical exam reveals mild tenderness in LLQ. Murmur noted on auscultation – investigate if persistent. Stool sample sent to lab for occult blood, ova and parasites, and C. difficile toxin. I’ll be right here when you get back, Mr. Rowbottom.
