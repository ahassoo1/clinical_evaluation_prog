DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 70 years of age. Thank you for coming in today. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 70, that's right. I need a card… for driving, I think? A commercial driver one. I do some logging work, you see, and they want me to have this special card now. It's all very new to me, honestly. I hope I'm in the right place.
DOCTOR: A commercial driver’s license medical examination… Yes, I see. While I am an Internal Medicine physician, I can perform the required Department of Transportation physical. However, it’s not precisely what I typically handle. But we can proceed. To begin, are you currently experiencing any health problems that might affect your ability to drive safely?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I was worried I was at the wrong doctor's office! No, not really. Nothing major. My knees ache a bit, especially after a long day in the cab, but I take some things for that. And sometimes my back… well, you know, getting older. But nothing that stops me from working. I can still get in and out of the truck just fine. Does that make sense? I just want to be sure I can still do my job.
DOCTOR: “Age-related,” you say. Yes, well, that is to be expected. And you’re managing the pain with medication, you mentioned?
PATIENT: Yes, just some over-the-counter things, mostly. Ibuprofen when it’s really bad. And sometimes a cream… you know, the kind you rub on? Nothing a doctor prescribed, I haven’t really needed a prescription for anything in years. I try to stay active, that helps, too. Don’t want to get too stiff. Is that something I need to tell you about specifically for this card? I just want to get this over with if that’s alright. I have a delivery schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: It is important for me to have a complete picture of your medical history, Ms. Sciarotta, even if you believe it's minor. It’s a requirement of the examination, and frankly, for your safety and the safety of others on the road. Do you have any other medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright. You’re right, of course. Safety first. Let me think… Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, but I haven’t been diagnosed with it myself. I had my cholesterol checked a few years ago, and it was a little high, but the doctor said to just watch my diet. No heart problems, thankfully. And no diabetes. I don’t think so, anyway. I had a physical a while back, but I can't remember everything they told me. Would my old doctor be able to send you something? If that would help speed things up.
DOCTOR: That would be helpful, yes, if you can provide your previous physician’s information. However, we still need to proceed with the required examination. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen when my knees bother me, like I said. And… oh, yes. I take a multivitamin every morning. My daughter keeps telling me I should. And sometimes, if I'm feeling run down, I’ll take some vitamin C. That's it, really. Nothing fancy. Honestly, I try to eat a healthy diet. Lots of fish, you know? My husband used to be a fisherman. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. My daughter always asks me that, too. She worries a lot. I've eaten everything, tried everything. No problems. I’m pretty sturdy, I think. Though maybe not as sturdy as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sciarotta. Let's proceed with the physical examination. It will involve checking your vision, hearing, blood pressure, pulse, and a basic neurological assessment. We will also need a urine sample. Are you able to provide that at this time?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Vision, hearing, blood pressure… all good. I think. I wear glasses, you see, so my vision isn’t perfect, but I get them checked regularly. And a urine sample? Of course. Where do you want me to… do that? I hope I don’t need to run all over town. I really do have that delivery schedule.
DOCTOR: The restroom is just over there. There are collection cups provided. Please just bring the sample back to me when you are finished. We can start with your vision. Please follow my gaze as I move this card…
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A quick trip to the restroom. I'll be right back. Hopefully, this won't take too long. I've got things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, if you’ll please have a seat… I'll start with your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Here you go. Everything alright? I didn’t have any trouble. Go ahead, Doctor. Let’s get this over with. I really appreciate you fitting me in. This whole commercial driver thing is a bit of a hassle.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 148/92. Your pulse is 78 and regular. That blood pressure is slightly elevated, Ms. Sciarotta. We’ll need to monitor that. Now, let's check your vision. Please read the letters on this chart, starting with the top line. Cover one eye at a time.
PATIENT: Alright. Slightly elevated? Hmm. That’s not good, is it? I haven’t had it checked in a while, to be honest. Okay, let me see. “E… F… P… Z…” “Okay, that’s a little blurry. Let me try the next line…”
DOCTOR: With the correction, your vision is 20/30 in your right eye and 20/40 in your left. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths.
PATIENT: Alright. 20/30 and 20/40… that’s not terrible, is it? I do need new glasses, I suppose. Just let me know if you hear anything weird. I try to keep myself in shape, you know? Walking every day, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and range of motion. Please relax your arms and legs.
PATIENT: Alright, good. Glad to hear it. Reflexes and range of motion… I used to be quite the dancer, you know? A long time ago, of course. I probably haven’t got much range of motion left. But go ahead, Doctor. Let's get this done.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Your range of motion is slightly limited in both knees, which is consistent with your reported pain. Now, finally, a brief neurological exam. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, do not move your head.
PATIENT: Alright, that’s good to hear. Limited range of motion… well, what can you expect? Just let me know if it gets too tiring. This is a bit… strange. I haven’t had a neurological exam since… well, I don't even remember.
DOCTOR: Your cranial nerves appear intact. Your coordination is within normal limits. Alright, Ms. Sciarotta, that completes the physical examination. Now, based on my findings, and taking into account your slightly elevated blood pressure and limited range of motion in your knees, I recommend… We need to get a complete blood panel to rule out any underlying issues, and I recommend you follow up with your primary care physician regarding your blood pressure. I also suggest physical therapy to help improve your knee range of motion and strength. As for the commercial driver’s medical certification, I’m going to need to see those blood test results before I can make a final determination.
PATIENT: Oh. Blood tests… more appointments… This is becoming quite a hassle. So you can’t just… sign off on it right now? I really do need to get back on the road. Is there anything I can do? Maybe take some extra blood pressure medication? I just... I have a schedule to keep. What about the physical therapy? Could I start that right away? Perhaps if I show you I’m making an effort…
DOCTOR: Ms. Sciarotta, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your eagerness to return to work. However, I have a professional and ethical obligation to ensure your safety, and the safety of others on the road. Simply taking more medication isn’t a sufficient solution. We need to understand why your blood pressure is elevated before I can clear you for commercial driving. I strongly recommend getting the blood tests scheduled as soon as possible. As for physical therapy, yes, you can certainly begin that now. It would be beneficial for your knees regardless, and demonstrates initiative. However, it will not override the need for the blood tests and a thorough evaluation of your blood pressure. I will give you a lab order, and a referral to a physical therapy clinic. Once you have the lab results, please bring them to your primary care physician and schedule a follow-up appointment. Once they’ve reviewed the results, and provided me with a report, we can revisit the medical certification. I understand this isn’t ideal, but it’s the responsible course of action. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. I… I guess not. Just… where do I go for the blood tests? And which physical therapy clinic do you recommend? This is going to be a lot of running around. I just… thank you, Doctor. For being thorough, I suppose. Even if it is a hassle.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Sciarotta. I understand it’s frustrating. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, just a few blocks from here. As for physical therapy, I recommend Active Motion Rehabilitation – they have excellent therapists and a good reputation. Here’s their contact information. If you have any questions along the way, or if your primary care physician has any concerns, please don't hesitate to contact my office. We're here to help. I wish you all the best, Ms. Sciarotta. And please, prioritize your health. It’s the most important thing.
PATIENT: .
