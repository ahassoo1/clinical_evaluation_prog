DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… feeling full really quick when I eat. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me. Don't seem to get much out of my food these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re experiencing early fullness and not feeling satisfied after eating. That’s certainly something we should look into. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn't matter what I eat, really. A little bit of soup, a few bites of a sandwich… even just a small plate of fish and rice… I feel stuffed after only a few mouthfuls. It’s not like I’m eating a huge meal, you know? And it happens pretty much every time. It's just… strange.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s not related to a specific food and happens consistently, even with small portions. That is unusual. About how long has this been going on for, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, maybe three, four months ago? At first, I just thought I wasn’t as hungry as usual, but it's gotten worse. Now it's like my stomach is telling me to stop after just a tiny bit. It’s hard to explain. It's not painful, just… full. Really full, really fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months. And no pain associated with it, just the sensation of fullness. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any other changes along with this, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have lost a little weight. Not a lot, but my wife's been saying my pants are a bit looser. I figured I was just getting old, you know? But maybe that’s connected. I haven’t been trying to lose weight, that’s for sure. Eating less and feeling full so quickly… it makes sense, I guess.
DOCTOR: Yes, unintentional weight loss along with early fullness is something we definitely need to investigate further. About how much weight would you estimate you’ve lost over these past three to four months?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. Maybe… five, ten pounds? Something like that. It’s not like I’ve dropped a huge amount, but enough for my wife to notice, and she notices everything. She’s a good woman, always looking after me. I suppose I just figured it was part of getting old, things slowing down.
DOCTOR: Okay, five to ten pounds. And it's good your wife is observant. We'll want to look into this more thoroughly. Before we move on to a physical examination, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it's been managed with some pills. Nothing else major. I get a little arthritis in my knees, but that's just part of getting old too, I reckon. I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last few years, honestly. I try to stay active, get out for walks when the weather's good, and generally take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, managed hypertension and some arthritis. That's good to know. And it’s positive you stay active. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see... I have them here somewhere. It’s Lisinopril, I think. Ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for… oh, maybe five years now? It seems to keep things pretty steady. My wife makes sure I don’t forget, bless her. She’s got a chart on the fridge with everything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 10mg daily. And it sounds like your wife is a wonderful support. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything. My wife sometimes worries about me trying new things, but I've always had a strong stomach. Used to eat all sorts of berries when I was a kid, out in the bush. Never bothered me none.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family had any significant medical conditions, like stomach cancer, or any issues with difficulty swallowing or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mother… she had some trouble with her digestion when she got older, but it wasn't anything specific, just… old age, I guess. My father was healthy as an ox until the day he died. No cancer, no nothing. As for the rest of my family… it’s hard to say. We don’t see each other much these days, and we don’t talk about health problems much either. It's just… not something we do. Mostly, I don’t know. I wish I did, but… it’s not something I’ve ever asked about, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited information on family history. That’s alright, we can still proceed. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and just do a general assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I haven’t had a proper check-up in ages, so it’s probably a good thing.
DOCTOR: <stage>I put on my stethoscope and begin by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a little slow, but regular. Lungs sound clear. Now I'll gently palpate your abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness anywhere when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright. Doesn’t hurt a bit. A little pressure, but nothing unusual. I’ve always had a bit of a sensitive stomach, but no pain, no nothing. Just… feels normal, I guess. A little bit of rumbling, maybe, but that’s probably just my lunch.
DOCTOR: Okay. No tenderness to palpation, just some normal bowel sounds. I'm also going to check your reflexes and your strength in your arms and legs. Everything seems normal so far. I'm noting your weight is currently 54 kilograms, which is a decrease from previous records. Now, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your diet. Can you describe what a typical day of eating looks like for you?
PATIENT: Well, breakfast is usually just a bit of toast and a cup of tea. Nothing fancy. Lunch is usually some fish, maybe salmon or halibut, with a bit of rice or potatoes. My wife makes it for me, bless her heart. And dinner… depends. Sometimes soup, sometimes a bit of chicken and vegetables. I try to eat healthy, you know? Not much for sweets, either. I used to have a bit of a sweet tooth when I was younger, but I’ve outgrown that. I don't eat a huge amount, that's for sure. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fairly healthy diet, consisting of fish, vegetables, and toast, but in relatively small portions. Do you have any difficulty swallowing, or any sensation of food getting stuck in your throat when you eat?
PATIENT: No, no trouble swallowing at all. Everything goes down just fine. Never had any problems with that. It’s not like the food is difficult to chew or anything. Just… after a few mouthfuls, I feel full. That’s all. It’s a strange feeling, hard to explain. Not uncomfortable, just… full. Really full, really fast. It’s like my stomach is telling me to stop, even though I haven't eaten much.
DOCTOR: Okay. No difficulty swallowing. Given your symptoms – early fullness, unintentional weight loss, and a consistent sensation of being full after only a small amount of food – and the fact that your diet is relatively healthy, I'm concerned about the possibility of an underlying issue. While it could be something relatively benign, we need to investigate further. I'd like to order some blood work to check your complete blood count, liver function, and kidney function. I'm also going to order a stool test to rule out any infections. Additionally, I think it would be helpful to get an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This will allow us to directly examine the lining of your digestive tract and rule out any structural abnormalities or inflammation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute. Blood work, stool test… endoscopy? That sounds… serious. What exactly are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something bad? I just thought it was old age, you know? I didn’t think it was anything to worry about. An endoscopy sounds… unpleasant. Is it really necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Obarr, and I apologize if this sounds alarming. It’s better to be thorough and rule out anything serious. The blood work and stool test are relatively simple and will give us a broad overview of your overall health. The endoscopy is the most invasive part, but it's the best way to directly visualize your digestive tract. We're looking for a few things. The early fullness and weight loss can be caused by several things, including things like gastritis, ulcers, or even, in rare cases, stomach cancer. The endoscopy allows us to rule those possibilities out. We're also looking for any signs of inflammation or structural abnormalities. While it’s possible it’s nothing serious, it's important to investigate further to get a clear diagnosis. The endoscopy is performed under sedation, so you won't feel any discomfort during the procedure. It's a relatively quick procedure, and you'll be monitored closely throughout. I understand your hesitation, but I strongly recommend we proceed with these tests to ensure we're not missing anything. Would you like me to explain the endoscopy procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. You’re right. Better to know, I suppose. My wife always says I put things off too long. And you’re right about her, she’d have my hide if I didn’t get this checked out properly. So… the endoscopy. You said it’s under sedation? What does that involve? And… what if you do find something? What are the options then? I've never had anything like this done before, and I’m a bit… nervous, to say the least.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness completely, Mr. Obarr. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about a procedure you’ve never had before. Let’s talk about the endoscopy. You’ll be asked not to eat or drink anything for six to eight hours before the procedure. When you arrive, an IV will be inserted into your arm. This is how we’ll administer the sedation – a medication that will make you feel relaxed and sleepy during the procedure. You won’t be fully unconscious, but you’ll likely be drowsy and won't remember much afterwards. A thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end – the endoscope – will be gently inserted through your mouth and into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The camera allows us to visualize the lining of your digestive tract. We can also take biopsies – small tissue samples – if we see anything that looks abnormal. The whole procedure typically takes about 20-30 minutes. After the procedure, you’ll be monitored in the recovery room until the sedation wears off. You’ll likely feel a little sore in your throat, and you might experience some bloating or gas. You won’t be able to drive for the rest of the day. As for what if we do find something… it depends on the findings. If we find gastritis or an ulcer, we can usually treat it with medication. If we find something more serious, like a polyp or cancer, we’ll discuss the best course of action, which might involve further testing, surgery, or other treatments. We’ll go over all the options with you in detail and answer any questions you have. I want to reassure you that we’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable and provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any specific concerns about the procedure that I can address?
PATIENT: Okay… that… that sounds a bit less scary than I thought. The sedation is good. Not remembering it is definitely a plus. And knowing you can take biopsies… that’s good, knowing you can actually see what’s going on. I guess my biggest concern is… well, what if it is something bad? What if it’s cancer? I’ve lost a few friends to cancer over the years, and… well, it’s a frightening thought. And… how long does it take to get the results of the biopsies? Will I have to wait a long time? That’s always the worst part, the waiting.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Obarr, and it’s understandable to be worried about the possibility of cancer. While it’s important to be realistic, it’s also important to remember that many people with digestive symptoms don’t have cancer. We’ll do everything we can to rule it out or, if it is present, to catch it early when treatment is most effective. The good news is that if we do find anything concerning, we have excellent treatments available. We work closely with oncologists and surgeons to provide the best possible care. We’ll discuss all your options with you in detail and help you make informed decisions. As for the biopsy results, it typically takes about 5-7 business days to get them back from the lab. We'll notify you as soon as they’re available. I know the waiting can be difficult, but we’ll do everything we can to expedite the process. We’ll also provide you with resources and support to help you cope with the anxiety during the waiting period. I want to reassure you that you’re not alone in this. We’re here to support you every step of the way. For now, let’s focus on getting the endoscopy scheduled. Would you like me to have my assistant contact you to discuss scheduling options?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. That would be good. Getting it scheduled is probably the best thing to do. Rip the band-aid off, as they say. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… you’ve explained everything very clearly, and you’ve made me feel a lot less anxious. I still don't like the idea of it, but I feel better knowing what to expect. And… thank you for being so understanding. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad I could help ease your anxiety. It’s perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about medical procedures, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have along the way. My assistant will contact you shortly to discuss scheduling options. In the meantime, if you have any concerns or questions, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. I’ll also write down some information about preparing for the endoscopy and what to expect afterwards for you to take home. We’ll take excellent care of you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time and your patience. I suppose I'll see you… after the endoscopy. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. We’ll be in touch soon. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you after the procedure.
