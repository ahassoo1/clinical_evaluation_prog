DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s hard to explain exactly. I just don't seem to be able to eat much these days. I get full really quick, even if it's not a big meal. It’s been going on for a bit now, maybe a month or so. Not sure, time gets away from me these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. A month or so of feeling full quickly… and is this with all types of food, or is it more noticeable with certain things?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think it's pretty much everything, yeah. Doesn't seem to matter if it’s fish, soup, bannock… even just a little bit feels like a whole feast. Used to be able to put away a good plate, you know? My wife makes a lovely halibut chowder, and I can barely finish a bowl now. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Obarr. It’s definitely good you brought this to my attention. And it’s concerning when a change in appetite affects something you enjoy, like your wife’s chowder. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. Not really, not that I can recall. Maybe a bit tired sometimes, but I’m eighty-eight, Doctor! That comes with the territory, right? No pain or anything like that. And I haven't lost any weight, as far as I know. My wife says I look the same, and she'd tell me if I was shrinking!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you haven’t noticed any pain or unintentional weight loss, and your wife’s observation is valuable. Being tired at eighty-eight is pretty common, but we should still consider it as part of the picture. Just to get a clearer idea, could you describe a typical day of eating for you now?
PATIENT: Well… let’s see. I usually have a bit of toast and tea in the morning. Not a big breakfast, never have been much of a breakfast person. Lunch is usually a sandwich, maybe some soup if my wife made it. And for dinner… honestly, I pick at whatever she makes. A little bit of fish and rice, maybe some vegetables. I try to eat something, but it just doesn’t stay with me, you know? I don’t feel hungry, and I get full so fast. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Obarr. It sounds like you’re eating relatively normally, just in smaller portions and feeling full very quickly. Now, I’d like to ask a little about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Nothing serious. I had a bit of trouble with my knees when I was younger, arthritis, I think. But it’s just old age, really. I've never been to the hospital for anything major, never had any operations. My wife does the worrying about those things, if there’s anything to worry about. She keeps all the records, I don't bother with them.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Just arthritis in the knees. And your wife manages the medical records, that's helpful. Let me quickly check the system to see if we have anything on file for you. … Okay, it looks like we have a few notes from previous check-ups, mostly regarding blood pressure monitoring. Nothing significant reported. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Ah, family. My mother… she lived to be ninety-two, very healthy woman. My father… he had some trouble with his heart when he was older. And my brother… he had diabetes, I think. But that’s about it, really. We weren’t a family that talked much about illnesses. Just sort of… dealt with things as they came.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. A healthy mother, a father with heart issues, and a brother with diabetes. We'll keep those in mind. Now, I'm going to ask about some habits. Do you smoke or drink alcohol, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life. My wife wouldn't allow it! And I used to enjoy a bit of beer with dinner, back in the day. But I haven't had a drink in… oh, maybe ten years now? My doctor at the time told me to cut back, so I did. Mostly drink tea these days. Lots of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, and you used to drink a bit of beer but stopped ten years ago. Mostly tea now. Good. One last thing before we move on to a quick examination. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees now and then, when they’re acting up. It’s just… ibuprofen, I think. Nothing fancy. And sometimes a little vitamin D in the winter, my wife gives it to me. She says I don’t get enough sun. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for your knees occasionally, and vitamin D in the winter. Thank you for letting me know. Alright, Mr. Obarr, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and just get a general sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or unusual sounds. Your lungs are clear, breathing evenly. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or uncomfortable. … No tenderness or masses that I can feel. Your abdomen is soft. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little bit slower than usual, but that's not uncommon at your age. Now, let me just take your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 72. A little bit elevated, but not overly concerning. Okay, Mr. Obarr, everything seems relatively normal on the physical exam. But given your symptoms of early fullness, and your age, I think it's important to investigate a little further. We need to rule out anything serious. I think we should start with some blood tests, and I'd like to order a stool test as well. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it puts my mind at ease, I'm happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. Blood tests and… a stool test? Oh, well. Can’t be helped, I suppose. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The stool test is just to check for any hidden blood or signs of infection. It's a pretty straightforward process; the clinic staff will give you instructions on how to collect the sample. For the blood tests, we’ll be checking your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and a few other things to get a better picture of your overall health. I’ll write up the orders now, and the lab technician will come and draw the blood. I’m also going to have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week, once we have the results back. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. A week is good. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It’s good to know someone is paying attention. Just let me know when they're coming for the blood, and I'll be ready. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I'm glad we're getting this checked out. I'll have the nurse come in shortly with the paperwork for the tests and to schedule your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, try to continue eating small, frequent meals, even if you don’t feel very hungry. And if you experience any new symptoms, such as weight loss, nausea, vomiting, or severe abdominal pain, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Doctor. Small meals, and call if things get worse. I can manage that. I’m just glad I came in. Thank you again for listening. I think I'll just sit here for a moment until the nurse arrives.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It was my pleasure. Please, take your time. I’ll be just around the corner if you need anything.
