DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s a little thing, really. Not a big problem. I just… I thought maybe you could write me one of those cards. You know, a “Get Well” card. Or… something encouraging. My niece, she thinks I should come see a doctor. She worries too much, that one. But a card would… quiet her down, maybe.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re not experiencing any specific medical symptoms that are bothering you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, no. Nothing like that. I’m… fine. Mostly. Just a little… low spirits, maybe? It’s the summer heat, I think. And my niece… always making a fuss. She read something on the internet, you know how they are. But I don’t need medicine, Doctor. Just… a card. A nice, cheerful card would do wonders.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, sometimes low spirits can be connected to underlying things, even if it’s not a serious illness. And it's always good to rule things out. Just to be thorough, would you mind if I ask you a few questions about how you've been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Hmph. Well, I get up, I eat, I… operate the boilers. That’s what I do. Been doing it for thirty years, you know. Good, steady work. And I sleep. Enough, anyway. What kind of questions? I don’t have time for a whole… examination. My niece insisted I come, but she doesn’t understand how important my work is.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kammer. And I assure you, I won’t take up too much of your time. These are just a few simple questions to get a better picture of your overall health. It’s not an examination, just a conversation. Let’s start with… have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? No. I eat. I like a good roast chicken, myself. And rice and beans. My ex-wife made a good arroz con gandules, but… well, that’s another story. No, my appetite is fine. Always has been. I need my strength for the boilers, you know. Heavy work. Very important work.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And how about your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… yes. I sleep alright. Not as good as when I was younger, of course. But who sleeps good when you get to be my age? A few aches and pains, you know. But I manage. I wake up early, get to work. Can't be sleeping all day. Boilers don't run themselves, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I could stand to lose a little weight. My ex-wife always said so. But no, I haven't lost any weight. I'm a solid man. Always have been. Strong. You need to be strong for this job, you understand? It's not like pushing papers in an office.
DOCTOR: Okay. Sometimes changes in mood can be related to things other than physical health. Have you been feeling more sad or hopeless than usual lately?
PATIENT: Hopeless? Now that's a strong word, Doctor. I don't get "hopeless." I got work. Good, steady work. That's what keeps a man going. I wouldn’t say I'm happy, exactly. My divorce… that wasn’t a pleasant experience. And my niece… always fussing. But hopeless? No. I get the job done. That's what matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how often do you get to see friends or family, besides your niece?
PATIENT: Friends? Not much anymore. Most of them… retired, moved away. We used to go fishing, play dominoes. But things change, you know? It's hard to find the time with the boilers. Very demanding job, requires a lot of attention. And my ex-wife… well, let’s just say we don’t socialize. It’s just me and the work, mostly. Keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your work is very important to you, and that’s admirable. But sometimes, when people are feeling down, it can be helpful to have someone to talk to. Have you ever felt like you needed to talk to someone about how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Talk to someone? About… feelings? Hmph. No. Never. A man doesn’t… air his dirty laundry. You keep things to yourself. Deal with it. My father always said, “Strong men don’t complain.” And I am a strong man. Besides, who would I talk to? My ex-wife? She’d just… criticize. And my niece… she just worries too much. No, Doctor. I manage. I always have.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I appreciate your honesty. Sometimes, even strong people need a little support. I'm noticing you seem to be carrying a lot on your shoulders. And it's okay to ask for help. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any changes in your energy levels lately?
PATIENT: Energy levels? Well, I get tired, of course. It’s a physical job, operating those boilers. Long hours. But I push through it. You have to. The boilers don't run themselves. Besides, tiredness comes with age. It’s natural. I don’t need… special help. I just need… a card, Doctor. That’s all. A nice, cheerful card would do wonders for my niece’s worrying. It's really about her, you know? She means well.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand. And I respect your desire to avoid unnecessary medical interventions. However, sometimes a lack of energy can also be a sign of something else, like a vitamin deficiency. Would you mind if I ordered a simple blood test, just to rule out anything like that?
PATIENT: A blood test? For a… vitamin? Hmph. Now you’re just trying to find something wrong with me. I told you, I’m fine. I eat good food. Roast chicken, rice and beans… you know. I don’t need a blood test. I need a card, Doctor. A “Get Well” card. Or maybe one that says… “Proud of your hard work.” That would quiet my niece down. She's a good girl, but… she worries too much. And a blood test isn’t going to fix that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your reluctance, and I apologize if I’m making you feel pressured. I’m not trying to find something wrong with you. I’m simply trying to understand how you’re feeling and ensure you’re taking care of yourself. And I can absolutely write you a card. I'm happy to write a card that says whatever you'd like. However, I am a doctor, and I'm concerned about your overall well-being. It sounds like you've been carrying a lot on your shoulders, and you may be experiencing some low spirits. I can write the card, but I strongly recommend we consider discussing some additional support, perhaps with a therapist or counselor, just to ensure you have someone to talk to. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A… therapist? Now you’re talking nonsense, Doctor. I don’t need a therapist. I need a card! A nice, cheerful card. With maybe a picture of a boiler on it? No. No therapists. That's for… weak people. I am a strong man. I operate boilers. I get the job done. I don’t need someone to… analyze my feelings. Just write the card, Doctor. That’s all I’m asking. A card. And maybe, just maybe, that’ll quiet my niece down.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. I understand. I will absolutely write you a card. What would you like it to say?
PATIENT: Good. Thank you, Doctor. That’s all I ask. Hmm… let me think. Write… “Proud of my hard work.” And maybe… “Boilers are my life.” No, that's too much. Just “Proud of my hard work.” And… “Don’t worry, I’m fine.” Yes. “Proud of my hard work. Don’t worry, I’m fine.” That’ll do. That’ll quiet my niece down for sure. And… could you maybe use a picture of a nice, shiny boiler on it? If you have one. A big, strong boiler.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. “Proud of my hard work. Don’t worry, I’m fine.” And I will see what I can do about a picture of a boiler. It will take me a few minutes to write it out and find an image. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That's all. Just the card. Thank you. You've been… very patient with me. I appreciate that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have boilers to operate. Important work, you know. Very important.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kammer. It was nice meeting you. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you ever need anything. I’ll have the card ready for you before you leave. And remember, taking care of yourself is just as important as operating those boilers. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
