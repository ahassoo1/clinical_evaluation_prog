DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. My name is Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about this… procedure. My daughter, bless her heart, she thinks I need it. Says it’ll make me look… better. I told her I’m perfectly fine as I am, but she insisted on scheduling this whole thing. Said I need a “clearance” from a doctor. Honestly, a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I see. So, this is primarily a consultation to satisfy your daughter's concerns regarding a… cosmetic procedure, is that correct?
PATIENT: Correct. A face lift, can you believe it? At my age! It's ridiculous. I’ve lived eighty-one years with this face, it’s earned its wrinkles. But she’s very… determined. She worries about everything. Always has. Now, are we going to get this over with, or what? I have a perfectly good afternoon planned.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. While I understand your… reluctance, it is my professional responsibility to ensure you are a suitable candidate for any procedure, elective or otherwise. Even a facelift carries inherent risks, and it's important to rule out any underlying conditions that might complicate things. To begin, could you briefly tell me about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? What’s to tell? I get up, I eat, I… exist. I used to be strong, a terrazzo worker for fifty years, you know. Hard work. But that was a lifetime ago. Now I mostly just… sit. No major illnesses, if that's what you're getting at. A bit of arthritis in the hands, but who doesn't these days? I have private insurance, a good plan. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Your insurance is helpful for documentation, thank you. And yes, I understand you've generally been healthy. However, “generally healthy” isn't quite sufficient for a medical clearance, Mr. Orwin. It's important to be thorough. Let’s start with a bit more detail. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, lung disease?
PATIENT: Hmph. Now you're asking me things I haven't thought about in decades. High blood pressure... the doctor mentioned something once, a long time ago, but he said it was nothing to worry about, just watch the salt. Diabetes? No, never. Heart problems... I've felt my heart beat for eighty-one years, if that counts. Lung disease? I worked with dust all day for fifty years laying terrazzo, so maybe. But I never smoked a day in my life! Honestly, are you writing all this down? Seems a bit excessive for a little face lift.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Orwin, thoroughness is paramount. Even seemingly minor procedures can present complications if underlying conditions are not addressed. To clarify: you said a doctor mentioned high blood pressure. Do you recall when this was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When? Probably… twenty years ago? Maybe more. It was a routine check-up, nothing serious. He said I should watch my diet, get a bit more exercise. I was still working then, too busy to worry about diet and exercise! I don't take any medication for it. Never have. And frankly, I feel fine. Always have. Now, is this going to take all day? I told my daughter I’d be back by two.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with respect, simply feeling fine is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation. Twenty years ago is significant. And untreated high blood pressure, even mild, can pose risks during any surgery. Do you recall the name of the doctor who mentioned it, or perhaps where you had that check-up?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. It was a local doctor, back in… Minneapolis. Before I moved here. Small practice, you know. Everything was different then. Doctors made house calls, things weren’t so… complicated. I’ve changed doctors so many times over the years, I can’t recall all their names. I just… went to whoever was convenient. And really, I haven't seen a doctor regularly since I retired. Why bother? I’m eighty-one years old! Is this really necessary? I'm starting to regret coming in here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, it is becoming clear that a complete medical history is… difficult to obtain. While I understand your frustration, I cannot, in good conscience, provide a clearance for surgery without a reasonable understanding of your overall health. Given the uncertainty surrounding your blood pressure history, and the fact you haven’t seen a doctor regularly, I recommend a few basic tests before proceeding. Specifically, I’d like to check your blood pressure today, perform an EKG to assess your heart function, and order a basic blood panel to evaluate your kidney function and overall health. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Hmph. Tests. Of course. More wasted time. Fine. Do what you have to do. But if it keeps me from getting back by two, your daughter is hearing about this. And don't expect me to come back for any follow-ups. Get it over with. Just... try to be quick about it. I have a perfectly good afternoon planned.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to take your vitals and draw some blood. We'll get the EKG done here in the exam room. Please try to relax. It will only take a few moments. I’ll need you to remove your shirt for the EKG, Mr. Orwin.
PATIENT: .
