DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. Now, Mrs. Chilla, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit of a delicate matter, really. My husband, he’s been insisting I get some… paperwork sorted. Something about what happens if… well, if I can’t speak for myself. He calls it an “advance directive” or a “POLST form.” Honestly, I find it rather morbid to be discussing such things, but he’s quite insistent. I suppose I just need to understand what exactly is involved, and if it’s absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, your husband is… prudent. It is rather sensible, though admittedly unpleasant to contemplate. It's a matter of legal documentation, ensuring your wishes are known should you become incapacitated. A POLST form, specifically – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – outlines your preferences for medical interventions. Frankly, it saves a great deal of… complication later on. Though, at your age, it's… unusual to be thinking about these things already. But, if your husband feels strongly... We can certainly discuss it. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Unusual? I assure you, Doctor, I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I walk every morning, I eat a balanced diet… and I’m perfectly aware of my own mortality, thank you very much. As for medical conditions… nothing significant. A touch of arthritis in my knees, perhaps, but nothing that requires… constant attention. I’ve never been one to bother doctors unnecessarily. It’s usually just aches and pains that come with… well, living. Is this form very… complicated? I haven't the patience for endless bureaucracy.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, noted. And I assure you, Mrs. Chilla, I wasn’t implying… It’s simply that most patients your age don’t prioritize such… arrangements. The form itself isn’t excessively complicated, though it does require you to make some difficult decisions regarding potential life-sustaining treatments – ventilation, resuscitation, feeding tubes, that sort of thing. It's not about 'bothering' doctors, it’s about ensuring your autonomy. Now, to get a clearer picture, let’s start with a brief review of your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Heavens, no. I’ve always prided myself on my robust health. A touch of flu as a child, perhaps, but nothing that required a doctor’s intervention beyond a cup of tea and a good rest. My mother always said fresh air and a positive attitude were the best medicine, and I’ve always lived by that philosophy. Honestly, I find this whole line of questioning rather… unnecessary. If I were prone to illness, wouldn't I already be under a doctor's care? This form… is it absolutely required for me to fill it out? My husband is a worrier, you see, and I’d prefer to avoid causing him undue stress if it’s truly not needed.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Chilla, with all due respect, preventative measures are always advisable. It’s not merely about being prone to illness; it’s about preparedness. While I appreciate your… robust health, unforeseen circumstances do occur. It's about eliminating ambiguity for your family. And yes, it is not legally required, but highly recommended. To proceed, could you please tell me about any surgeries you may have had?
PATIENT: Surgeries?! Doctor, are you implying I look like someone who has undergone surgical procedures? Honestly! I’ve led a very… natural life. No cosmetic enhancements, no elective procedures, absolutely nothing of the sort. This is becoming rather… ridiculous. My husband mentioned something about… a form outlining my wishes regarding… end-of-life care. I was hoping for a simple explanation of what exactly is involved, not a detailed interrogation of my medical history! It's beginning to feel like you're trying to convince me I’m ill! Is there a simpler way to explain this, or perhaps someone else in the practice who is more… sensitive to my concerns?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Chilla, I assure you, I am not attempting to imply anything. However, it is my professional obligation to gather pertinent information. This form involves decisions about life-sustaining treatment – ventilation, CPR, feeding – and understanding your medical background is crucial. Now, regarding family history – have any of your immediate family members experienced serious illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer?
PATIENT: My family? Honestly, Doctor, are you now questioning the genetic integrity of my lineage? My mother lived to a respectable age, perfectly healthy until the very end. My father, a robust and active man, passed peacefully in his sleep. No heart disease, no strokes, no… cancers. A perfectly healthy family, thank you very much. This is… quite frankly, insulting. I came here for a simple form, not a character assessment of my ancestors! Perhaps you misunderstand. I’m not seeking medical treatment; I simply wish to appease my husband. Is there not a standard form I can simply sign without undergoing this… inquisition? Surely, there is a simplified version for healthy individuals?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Chilla, I understand your frustration. However, a standardized form without any consideration of your medical history would be… irresponsible. And while you may consider yourself “healthy,” unforeseen events do occur. Now, one final question – do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, are you serious? I haven't taken a pill in decades! I believe in the natural healing power of the body, not these… synthetic concoctions. Perhaps a cup of chamomile tea on occasion, but that’s hardly a medication! I am a perfectly healthy woman, as I have repeatedly stated. This entire process is utterly ridiculous. I’m beginning to suspect your intention is to exhaust me into agreeing to something I don’t understand, and frankly, don’t want to do. I think I’ll just… reschedule. Perhaps with another doctor. Someone who is a little more… receptive to my concerns. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Chilla. As you wish. Perhaps another physician will be more amenable to your… preferences. .
