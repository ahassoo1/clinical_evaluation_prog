DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor…Voytek, yes? Hmm. Well, I just moved here. New place, you know? Need to find a doctor. Medicare said I should come. Social thing, I think. Not feeling bad, really. Just…new.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. A “social thing” check-up is good. It's important to establish care when you relocate. So, even though you're not feeling unwell, we'll do a general assessment to get a baseline of your health. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you moved here?
PATIENT: Moved? Oh…that was…a long time ago now. From…Brooklyn. Yes, Brooklyn. My ex-wife…she wanted to be closer to…her sister. I just…went. Didn’t really have a choice, you understand. Not a happy time. Still not happy, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Relocating can be stressful, even under the best of circumstances. We don’t need to dwell on the reasons why if you’re not comfortable, but it’s helpful to know these things can impact your overall health. Let’s focus on you today. You mentioned you're not feeling bad, but could you describe your general health?
PATIENT: General health… I work. A lot. Makeup, you know? For the theatre. Big productions. Keeps me busy. I eat…sometimes. When I remember. Not a big eater. Always been thin. My first wife…always saying I need to eat more. She made good food, though. Pierogies, mostly. I…miss those. Is that what you want to know? If I eat?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. It sounds like you have a demanding job, and it’s good that you're staying busy. And yes, knowing about your eating habits is important. Not eating regularly can affect your health. So, you said you eat "sometimes," and generally are a thin build. On a typical day, what do you usually eat, even if it’s just a little bit?
PATIENT: Oh, it changes. Depends on the show. Sometimes just coffee. Black. Very strong. If I’m lucky, maybe a sandwich. From a deli. Ham and cheese. Rye bread. But not always. Sometimes it’s…nothing. I forget to eat, you know? It’s not important. The actors, they need feeding. I just make them pretty.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you prioritize taking care of others, which is admirable, but it's very important to make sure you’re taking care of yourself too. Regularly skipping meals can lead to a lot of problems. Let’s do a quick check of your vitals just to get a baseline, and then we can talk a little more about your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Vitals? What are vitals? Like…important numbers? I don’t like needles. Do you need to take blood? Because I really don’t… I'm fine, really. Just a little tired. Everyone gets tired.
DOCTOR: No needles today, Mr. Szmyd. Vitals are just basic measurements – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and height and weight. It's a quick and painless way to get a sense of your overall health. We won't be doing any blood work today unless something comes up during the exam that suggests we need to. It’s standard procedure when establishing care with a new patient. Let’s start with your height and weight, and then we can check your blood pressure. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Height…I haven’t been measured in years. Probably shrunk. Everyone shrinks when they get old. And weight…don't make a fuss about the weight, okay? I'm…small. Always have been. Do it quickly, please. I have a show tonight.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. We'll be quick. If you'll just step on the scale, and then we'll measure your height. Okay, so your height is 160 centimeters, and your weight is 58 kilograms. That’s…within a normal range for someone of your stature. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Can you sit here for a moment?
PATIENT: Kilograms…centimeters…so much measuring. Always measuring. My mother used to measure everything. The curtains, the potatoes, me. It was awful. And normal? What’s normal? Everyone is different, you know. Just…get it over with. My show starts soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Szmyd. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s slightly elevated, but not cause for immediate alarm. We can discuss lifestyle changes to help manage that. Now, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? I don't remember. It was a long time ago. Lots of doctors. My first wife, she took me to all the doctors. Always worried about something. I think…maybe high blood pressure? She said something about it. But I felt fine. Still feel fine. I take no pills. Never liked them. Too many side effects, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, possible history of high blood pressure, but currently taking no medications. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…hmm. Let me think. My tonsils, maybe? When I was a boy. Very painful. And…my appendix? I think so. Yes, the appendix. It burst, or something. They cut it out. It was a long time ago. Brooklyn hospital. Not a very nice place, I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and appendectomy in the past. Good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members – your parents, siblings, or children – have any significant medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family? Oh, that's a long story. My mother…she was always sick. Something with her lungs, I think. Always coughing. Spent a lot of time in bed. My father…he worked in a factory. Died young. Heart, I think. Something with the heart. My sister…she moved to Florida. Don’t see her. Never liked her much. Everyone gets sick, eventually. It's the way of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal history of lung issues, paternal history of heart disease. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. A lot. I make up actors. They’re very demanding. It’s stressful. I drink coffee. Black. Very strong. I don’t smoke. Never liked it. And…that’s it, really. Not a very exciting life, you know? Just…work. And coffee.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a demanding job, high coffee intake, and no smoking. That gives me a good picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart, lungs, and overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam? What does that involve? Do you need to…look in my ears? I don’t like anyone touching my ears. And I really need to get to the theatre. The show starts soon. They’ll be waiting for me. Is it going to take long?
DOCTOR: It won't take long, Mr. Szmyd. It's a basic exam – I'll listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, check your blood pressure again, and take a look in your ears, if you’re comfortable with that. We can skip the ear exam if you prefer. It helps me get a complete picture of your health. It should only take a few minutes. If you’d like, you can sit up here.
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick, please. And don’t poke too much. I bruise easily. My mother always said I had delicate skin. And don’t listen too long, either. It makes me nervous. Just…get it over with. The show…they’ll be furious if I'm late.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. It might feel a little cold. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. No murmurs auscultated. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but breathing is slightly shallow. No wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi auscultated. Pulses are present and equal bilaterally, but slightly weak. Blood pressure is 135/85, slightly elevated. Everything else appears within normal limits, but your breathing is a bit shallow and your pulse is weak. Do you ever feel short of breath, or experience palpitations?
PATIENT: Short of breath? Sometimes. When I run for the bus. Or when I’m carrying heavy makeup cases. They’re very heavy, you know. Palpitations…maybe? My heart beats fast sometimes. When I drink too much coffee. Or when I'm nervous. Which is…often. It's nothing. Everyone feels a little nervous. Don’t worry about it. Just…get me to the theatre. The curtain rises in an hour.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on your exam and history, it sounds like you may be experiencing some mild anxiety and possibly slightly elevated blood pressure. Your breathing being shallow could be related to that as well. I recommend we monitor your blood pressure over the next few weeks. We can schedule a follow-up appointment, and I can give you some tips on managing stress and anxiety. We should also consider some lifestyle modifications. Do you have any history of panic attacks or chest pain?
PATIENT: Panic attacks…I don’t know. I get…flustered sometimes. When things go wrong. The actors are late, or the makeup is missing, or the stage manager is yelling. It’s a stressful job, you know? Chest pain…no. Not really. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes. From the coffee. But nothing serious. It's just…life. A lot of stress. I’ll be fine. Just need to get to work. The show must go on, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history and the exam findings, I'm not overly concerned about a serious cardiac event at this moment, but we should still address your blood pressure and stress levels. I recommend a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check your blood pressure again and discuss strategies for managing stress. I'll also give you a handout on deep breathing exercises. In the meantime, try to limit your caffeine intake and get regular sleep when you can. I’m also going to order a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol levels and rule out any other underlying conditions. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Blood panel? More tests? Two weeks? This is taking too long. I have a show, you know! Cholesterol…what does that even mean? Look, I appreciate what you’re doing, but I really need to go. Just…give me something for the stress. A pill, maybe? Something small? And skip the blood tests if you can. I hate needles. The curtain goes up soon!
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. I won't push you to do any tests you're uncomfortable with right now. I can write you a prescription for a low-dose anti-anxiety medication, but I strongly advise that you use it sparingly and only as needed. It’s important to address the underlying causes of your stress, not just mask the symptoms. I'll also give you that handout on deep breathing exercises and some resources for stress management. Here's the prescription. Take as directed. I'll see you in two weeks. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe anxiety before then, please go to the emergency room immediately. Now, go enjoy your show. Break a leg!
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. I suppose. But I really need to go. The actors are waiting. And the stage manager…well, you don’t want to meet the stage manager. .
