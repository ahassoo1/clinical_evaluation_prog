DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, I’ve been getting… flushed. That’s what my friend said I should come see about. My face gets red, you know? And sometimes my neck. It just… happens. Not all the time, but enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe. Flushing can certainly be bothersome. And it’s good you’re getting it checked out. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when this flushing occurs?
PATIENT: Hmm… when does it happen? That’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Sometimes when I eat… spicy food, maybe? But not always. And sometimes… just when I’m talking to people. Not strangers, usually. More… people I know. It’s… embarrassing, to be honest. I don’t know why it happens. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Withycombe. It’s helpful to know it seems to be triggered by different things – sometimes food, sometimes social situations. Could you describe what the flushing feels like as it’s happening?
PATIENT: Well, it doesn’t hurt, exactly. It just… gets warm. Really warm. And then my face gets red. Like… very red. And I feel… I don’t know… like everyone is looking at me. It happens pretty fast, usually. Not slow. Just… poof. Red face. Then it goes away after a little while. Maybe ten, fifteen minutes? It’s not painful, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that so clearly. It sounds quite uncomfortable, even if it isn’t painful. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask you some questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… let me think. Not really. I had the flu a few times, of course. And I broke my arm when I was a boy, but that healed. My wife… she had some problems with her heart, but that was… a long time ago. I don’t really have any… conditions, no. Nothing the doctor ever told me about, anyway. I’m pretty healthy, usually. Except for this flushing, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been lucky, I guess. Never needed anything taken out or put in. Just the broken arm, and they put a cast on it. That’s it. No surgeries. I don’t like hospitals much, to be honest. Makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to know you haven’t had any surgeries. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No medications. Not any. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. I try to stay away from them. My wife… she had to take a lot, towards the end. It wasn’t good. So, no, I don’t take anything regularly. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache, if it’s really bad. But that’s it. Very rarely.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe. That’s helpful to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. And I haven’t ever had a problem with… pollen, or dust, or anything like that. I don’t have any allergies that I know of. My wife… she was allergic to cats, but I’m fine with them. She wouldn’t let me have one, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… that’s a tough one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had problems with his stomach. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t really know much about it. My wife’s family… they had some heart problems, I think. Lots of heart problems. But other than that… not really. Not that I know of. It’s hard to remember, you know? It was a big family. Lots of people.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's understandable. Knowing a little is still helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… what do you mean? I mean, I live alone now, since my wife passed. I try to eat healthy. I walk a little bit every day, if the weather is nice. I like to read. I watch TV sometimes. I don’t drink much alcohol. I used to, a little bit, with my wife, but not anymore. I don’t smoke. I try to keep busy, you know? Just… a quiet life. Not much excitement.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good sense of things. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I don’t mind. Just… don’t take too long, okay? I have an appointment later. Not important, but… still. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could please sit on the examination table, we'll get started. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look at your skin. I do notice some mild redness on your cheeks and neck. No rashes or other skin changes. It's difficult to assess the flushing without it actively happening, but your skin appears otherwise normal.
PATIENT: Okay. 140/90… is that bad? My wife… she always had low blood pressure. She had to watch her salt. I don’t add much salt to my food. And you see redness? Even now? I thought it was gone. It comes and goes, you know? Like a wave. Sometimes it’s very red, sometimes you can’t see it at all. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re aware of your blood pressure, and that you’re mindful of your salt intake. 140/90 is considered Stage 1 hypertension, so it’s something we should monitor. It doesn’t necessarily mean we need to start medication immediately, but it does warrant further investigation and lifestyle adjustments. As for the redness, it's subtle but present. The fact that it comes and goes is important information. Given your description of the flushing and the slightly elevated blood pressure, several possibilities come to mind. It could be rosacea, which often causes facial redness and flushing. It could also be related to the blood pressure, or something called vasomotor flushing. Occasionally, it can be a sign of other, less common conditions. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will help us rule out any underlying medical issues and assess your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… okay. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like needles, but… if it will help. What kind of tests? And what does… vasomotor flushing mean? Is that something serious? I just want to know what’s going on. It’s just… embarrassing, you know? To get red in the face like that. Especially when I’m talking to people. My friend said I should come see a doctor, but I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it. Is it something I need to worry about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Withycombe. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel embarrassed, and you’re not alone in experiencing this. And you’re right to want to get to the bottom of it. The blood tests I’m thinking of are fairly standard. We’ll check your complete blood count, kidney function, liver function, thyroid levels, and a few other things. It's a routine panel to get a baseline understanding of your health. Vasomotor flushing refers to a sudden sensation of warmth, redness, and sometimes sweating, usually caused by changes in blood vessels near the skin's surface. It can be triggered by various factors, like stress, temperature changes, or certain medications. It's not usually a sign of a serious condition in itself, but it's important to rule out other potential causes. In your case, the fact that it seems to be triggered by social situations suggests it could be related to anxiety or stress, but we need to rule out any underlying medical conditions first. That’s why the blood tests are important. To be clear, I'm not saying it is something serious, but we need to investigate to be sure. We want to rule out anything that could require more specific treatment. Would you like me to go over the details of the blood tests with you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Tell me about the tests. What exactly will they be looking for? And… how much does it cost? I don’t have insurance, you see. It’s just me now, and… things are tight. I don’t want to get a big bill I can’t pay. Tell me everything, Doctor. I need to know what I’m getting into.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Withycombe. I understand your financial concerns completely, and I’ll be as transparent as possible. The blood tests I'm ordering are a comprehensive metabolic panel , a complete blood count , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a lipid panel. CMP checks your kidney and liver function, electrolyte balance, and blood sugar levels. This helps us identify any underlying organ problems. CBC counts the different types of cells in your blood. It can detect signs of infection, anemia, or other blood disorders. TSH checks your thyroid function. An underactive or overactive thyroid can sometimes cause flushing. Lipid panel measures your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. High cholesterol can contribute to heart disease. These tests will be drawn from a vein in your arm. It's a relatively quick procedure, and usually doesn't cause much discomfort. Regarding the cost, since you don't have insurance, the out-of-pocket cost for these tests will be approximately $250 to $300. We can potentially explore options for financial assistance or a payment plan if needed. I will also see if there is a lower cost lab option nearby. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. I can then explain what they mean and develop a treatment plan if necessary. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: $300… that’s… a lot. But I guess I need to know, right? I don’t want it to be something serious. Okay, let’s do the tests. But can you really try to find a cheaper place? And… could you give me a written list of what they’re looking for? Just so I know what to expect? And… the payment plan? How would that work? I just want to be prepared. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Withycombe. I completely understand. It’s good to be prepared, and I want to make this as easy as possible for you. I will absolutely look into lower-cost lab options in the area. I have a few in mind, and I'll call them today to get accurate pricing. I'll let you know what I find as soon as possible. I can also provide you with a written list detailing each test and what it's looking for. I’ll print that out for you before you leave today. It explains everything in plain language, so you'll know exactly what to expect. Regarding the payment plan, we can offer a flexible payment option where you can pay the $300 in installments over a few months. We can discuss a schedule that works best for your budget. We typically require a small down payment, and then you can pay the remaining balance in equal monthly installments. Let me write down the lab request forms now, and I’ll include a detailed explanation of each test. I’ll also make a note to check on the cost and payment plan options for you. We can discuss all of this in more detail before you leave. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I just… I worry a lot. My wife… she always took care of things. It’s hard doing it on my own now. But I’m glad I came. Let’s get the tests done, and hopefully, it’s nothing serious. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It’s perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. Please don’t hesitate to ask questions at any time. We’ll get these tests done, and we’ll take it one step at a time. Here are the lab request forms, along with the detailed explanation of each test. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. She will also provide you with instructions on how to prepare for the tests. I'll also check on those lower-cost lab options and the payment plan for you and will get back to you as soon as possible. Please, take care. And remember, you’re not alone in this. We’ll figure it out together. If you feel any worsening symptoms before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office.
PATIENT: .
