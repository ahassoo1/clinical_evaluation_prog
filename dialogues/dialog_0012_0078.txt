DOCTOR: Hi Aeisha, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rudi Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Dr. Yoshino. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a…jumpstart, as I wrote. I haven't been feeling my best, and it’s been going on for a little while now. I suppose I'm looking for a way to get back to feeling like myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, “stuck” and needing a “jumpstart” – I can definitely work with that. It’s good you're coming in to address it. “A little while now” is pretty vague though – could you tell me a bit more about when you first started noticing things weren't quite right?
PATIENT: Hmm…that is a good question. It didn’t happen overnight, that's for sure. I would say… maybe six months ago? Around February, perhaps. It started with just feeling tired, more tired than usual, even after a full night’s sleep. And then little things started…adding up. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, you understand. It wasn't one big thing, but a collection of small ones.
DOCTOR: I do understand, that’s very common. It rarely is one big thing. Tiredness for six months… okay. And you said “little things started adding up.” Can you give me some examples of those little things?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well… my appetite isn't what it used to be. I don’t really crave much anymore, and when I do eat, I don't feel satisfied. And… I’ve been having trouble concentrating. My work requires a lot of focus, you see – shaping the clay, getting the details just right – and I find myself distracted easily. It's…frustrating. Oh, and I seem to be a bit more…irritable than usual. My husband has noticed, thankfully he's very patient.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, and increased irritability… all starting around February. That gives me a better picture. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms along with these things?
PATIENT: Physical… hmm. Not really any pain, no. But… sometimes my muscles feel a little achy, especially in my shoulders and back. I thought it was just from working with the clay, you know, the repetitive motions. And… I've been feeling a bit… cold lately. Not sick-cold, just… colder than everyone else, even when the weather is warm. My hands get chilly quite easily. I didn’t think much of it at first, but it’s been happening more and more.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle aches and feeling cold more easily. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I've been quite healthy, thankfully. I do have Medicare, as you can see from my paperwork, mostly for preventative care. I had a bit of trouble with high blood pressure a few years back, but it's been well-controlled with diet and exercise. Otherwise… just the usual aches and pains that come with age, I suppose. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension is good to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, no surgeries. Never had any need for them, thankfully. Just the usual childhood illnesses, nothing major. I’ve always been a bit… resilient, I think. Though lately, I don’t feel very resilient. That’s why I’m here, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mother had diabetes, type 2, later in life. And my father… he had heart problems. He passed away when I was quite young, actually. As for siblings, I have a brother, but we haven’t spoken in years. Not relevant, I suppose. I don't know if any of that is helpful.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, thank you. Diabetes and heart problems are good things to know. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, not currently. As I mentioned, I've been managing my blood pressure with diet and exercise. No need for anything else, thankfully. I prefer to avoid medication if I can. Perhaps we can keep it that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. That's good. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, I don’t believe so. No known allergies. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. Sometimes a little bit of a stuffy nose during pollen season, but nothing serious enough to require medication. I can eat anything, thankfully!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s great. Alright, Aeisha, thank you for answering all those questions. It gives me a good starting point. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and maybe a quick look in your ears and throat. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Dr. Yoshino. Please, go ahead. I’m ready whenever you are. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Pulses are 2+ and regular in all extremities. Now, I'm going to quickly check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Finally, I’ll quickly look in your ears and throat. Ears are clear. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Everything seems within normal limits on initial examination. Now, I’m going to order some routine blood work. It’ll give us a better picture of what’s going on internally. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid levels, Vitamin D, and a basic metabolic panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Dr. Yoshino. Blood work seems… sensible. I appreciate you being so thorough. Vitamin D… I haven’t really thought about that. I work indoors a lot, so that might be something. When should I expect the results? And will you explain them to me when I come back?
DOCTOR: Yes, working indoors can definitely contribute to Vitamin D deficiency. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll have the nurse contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re available. At that appointment, we’ll go over the results together in detail, and discuss potential next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Dr. Yoshino. Thank you. 3-5 business days… I can certainly wait that long. And I will definitely contact the clinic if anything changes. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and doing such a thorough examination. It’s a relief to know we’re getting to the bottom of things.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aeisha. I’m glad I could help. It's always best to be proactive about your health. We'll figure out what's going on, and get you feeling like yourself again. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Dr. Yoshino. You’ve covered everything beautifully. I suppose… just the wait now. But I feel much better knowing we have a plan. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Well, you have a good day, Aeisha. And please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. The nurse will be in touch to schedule your follow-up appointment.
