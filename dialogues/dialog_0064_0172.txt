DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m here. Some sort of… social call, I believe my husband mentioned. New to the area, you see. Dreadful lot of paperwork to get settled, simply dreadful. I do hope this won't take long.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Candice. It is a lot to get settled in a new place. And sometimes appointments get made for us, it seems. No worries at all if you're not sure. Perhaps we can start with a general check-up, just to see how you're doing overall?
PATIENT: A… check-up? Well. I suppose that’s sensible. Though I assure you, Doctor, I’ve been perfectly fine for seventy-nine years. Never had much trouble, really. Though my bones do creak a bit these days. Is this covered by… Medicare, do you think? I wouldn't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover a wellness check-up, absolutely. We'll verify everything with your insurance, don't you worry. And it's good you mention the creaking bones – that's helpful information. It’s common for joints to feel a bit stiff as we get older. Just to be thorough, and to get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about those creaks?
PATIENT: Thoroughness is all well and good, Doctor, but honestly, I barely recall. It’s… when I move, I suppose. Getting out of a chair. Walking. Nothing debilitating, you understand. Just… older person things. My husband keeps fussing, naturally. He fusses about everything. Is this going to involve… poking and prodding? I really dislike being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Husbands do fuss, don’t they?
PATIENT: They certainly do. An endless preoccupation with… well, everything. Honestly, I think he enjoys worrying more than he enjoys anything else. A perfectly good man, mind you, but… a worrier. Now, about this visit… if it’s just a formality, I'd be grateful if we could expedite things. I have a luncheon planned.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. We can certainly try to be efficient. But just to make sure everything is alright, I'd like to ask a few questions, and perhaps do a quick physical exam. It won't be much poking and prodding, I promise. Let’s start with your overall health. Have you been feeling any pain anywhere recently, besides the creaking in your joints?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. Not… consciously. I mean, one aches a bit after gardening, naturally. And my back sometimes twinges when I bend over. But that's just… age. I haven't had a serious illness in decades. A cold now and then, but nothing a good cup of tea couldn't cure. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect my husband is simply being overly cautious. He reads too many pamphlets. Would you like me to list all the pamphlets he's made me aware of? It would be a lengthy undertaking.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright, Candice, no need for the pamphlet list. It’s good to hear you’ve been generally well. Just to clarify, the gardening ache and back twinge – are they constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, come and go, most definitely. Not a persistent, debilitating ache, you understand. More of a… reminder that I've spent the morning weeding. And bending. I do enjoy my garden, you see. My husband insists I take it easy, but one must have some hobbies. Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to feel quite interrogated. Is this standard procedure? It feels rather… invasive.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels invasive, Candice. I assure you, I'm not trying to interrogate you. It's simply my job to gather as much information as possible to ensure your health. Sometimes even seemingly minor aches can be important clues. Now, about those hobbies... that’s wonderful! Activity is good. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in your joints when they ache?
PATIENT: Redness? Swelling? I hadn’t the faintest idea. I don’t examine my joints, Doctor. Really. I simply… use them. Honestly, this is becoming rather tiresome. I suppose a little swelling is possible. After a particularly strenuous weeding session, perhaps. But nothing alarming. My husband would have noticed if anything was truly “alarming.” He notices everything, you see. Everything. Perhaps you should speak to him directly? He has a very detailed record of my… ailments.
DOCTOR: That might be helpful, Candice. I appreciate the suggestion. We can certainly talk to him. Just one more question before we move on. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Good heavens, no. I haven't the time for chest pain. Luncheon, you see. And one simply doesn't have chest pain while attending a luncheon. Shortness of breath… occasionally, when climbing the stairs. But that's simply… age. And a rather steep staircase. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to suspect you’re looking for something wrong. Is that it? Because I assure you, I’m perfectly fine. A little creaky, perhaps, but perfectly fine. Can we please expedite this process? It's really quite unnecessary. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. I understand. We can certainly keep this brief. Perhaps a quick physical exam would be helpful – just to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your joints. It won't take long. Would that be acceptable?
