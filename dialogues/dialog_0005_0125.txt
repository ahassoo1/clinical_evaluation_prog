DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I just… I wanted to get tested for HIV. It’s… a precaution, really. My wife and I, we’re both pretty careful, but you never know, right? Better safe than sorry. I figured it was a good idea to just get it checked.
DOCTOR: Right. A precaution. Good. It’s always wise to be proactive with your health. Just to be clear, are you experiencing any symptoms that led you to specifically want to get tested now, or is this just a routine check as you said?
PATIENT: No symptoms, nothing like that. Honestly? A coworker… a new coworker… was talking about getting tested regularly, and it just made me think. He’s… well, he’s not the brightest, but even he was getting tested. I thought, if he is, maybe I should too. Don’t want to be… careless, you know? It’s just sensible. Really. I don’t go around doing… risky things.
DOCTOR: Sensible. Alright. So, you're saying this is purely due to a conversation with a coworker?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. Look, I don’t need to explain my life choices to you, right? It just… prompted me. A reminder, if you will. I'm a responsible husband. We take precautions. It's not like I'm… running around. It’s just a check-up. Honestly, it feels a bit silly, but my wife thinks it’s a good idea too, and she’s usually right about these things. She worries, you know? So here I am. Are we going to do the test or… what? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. We can proceed with the testing. However, I do ask some standard questions before any test. It's part of my job, and helps me understand your overall health profile. It’s not a personal inquiry, it’s procedure. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, regardless of how long ago?
PATIENT: Look, really? You have to ask that? It’s… embarrassing. And frankly, none of your business. My wife and I have been married for ten years, and we’ve been very careful. But fine, if you must know, a long time ago… before my wife… there was one instance. A very brief thing, years ago. It was… dealt with. I saw a doctor, got it sorted. It was nothing serious. But why are you even asking about things from that long ago? It’s completely irrelevant. It was before I was responsible. Honestly.
DOCTOR: It’s relevant, Mr. Belan, because some infections can have long-term effects or affect test accuracy. Knowing your full medical history is essential. So, what infection was it, and do you recall the date or approximate year you were treated?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It was… chlamydia. Okay? Happy now? And I… let me think. It was… around 2012, maybe 2013. I was in college. It was a stupid mistake, alright? A one-time thing. And I got it treated immediately. Everything was cleared up. I don't understand why we're dissecting my past like I committed a crime. It was years ago! And I'm here now being proactive. Can we please just get this over with? I’m starting to feel uncomfortable. Honestly, it feels like you're judging me.
DOCTOR: I am not judging you, Mr. Belan. I am gathering information. Chlamydia is important to know, as it can, in rare cases, impact HIV testing results. Do you recall if you were ever re-tested after the initial treatment to confirm it was completely cleared?
PATIENT: Yes! Of course I was! Look, I told you, I went to the university health clinic. They made me come back. I had to get a second test. They confirmed it was gone. They sent me a letter. I remember. Everything was clear. Are you implying I didn’t get proper medical care? I went to a doctor, I followed their instructions. It was a university clinic! They are very thorough. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’m wasting my time here. Do you need anything else from my distant past, or can we finally move on to the actual test? I have a business meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Let me just confirm a few things in your electronic record… Yes, I see a record of treatment at the university health clinic in 2013 for chlamydia. However, there’s no mention of a follow-up test to confirm clearance. That is… concerning. It's standard procedure. Do you recall which doctor you saw there?
PATIENT: What? No, I don’t remember the doctor’s name! It was ten years ago! There were lots of doctors there! It was a clinic, alright? A revolving door of medical students. They just treated me and sent me on my way. I remember getting the medication, getting better, and that was it! Honestly, you’re making a big deal out of nothing. I told you I got treated. Why are you questioning my memory? It was a stressful time, I was a student, I didn't keep detailed records of my medical appointments. Are you suggesting I lied? Honestly, this is insulting. I came here voluntarily to get tested, and you're treating me like I'm… what? A liar? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I am not suggesting you are lying. However, accurate medical history is crucial. Since we cannot definitively confirm complete clearance of the chlamydia infection, I recommend a repeat chlamydia test before proceeding with HIV testing. It’s a simple procedure, and will ensure the most accurate results. Additionally, given the lack of records, I would suggest consulting with your primary care physician to review your past medical history, if you have one. If you’d prefer, I can provide a referral. Otherwise, we can postpone the HIV test until these concerns are addressed. I understand you have a meeting, but I will not compromise on providing accurate care. It's what I'm required to do.
