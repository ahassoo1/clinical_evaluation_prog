DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it's been... a bit of a rough patch, to be honest. I mostly just feel sick to my stomach a lot, and I don't get hungry like I used to. Even a little bit of food feels like too much. It's been going on for... well, I can't rightly say how long. A while, I think. It's just… wearing me down.
DOCTOR: "A while," right. Well, that's… helpful. Okay. And is this nausea constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be difficult. It's just… things don't stick in my head these days. Let me see… it's not all the time, no. More often in the mornings, I think. And sometimes after I eat, even if it's just a small plate. It doesn’t feel like… regular sick, you know? Not like a bug. It's just… a queasy feeling.
DOCTOR: Right. Not a bug. Well, many things can cause that. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the nausea?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… other things… Well, I’ve been feeling more tired than usual, I suppose. Just… worn out. And… I don’t know if this matters, but I seem to be losing weight. Not trying to, of course! My clothes just feel a little looser. But other than that… not really. It’s hard to say. My mind isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Losing weight unintentionally is always something we need to look into. And fatigue, okay. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That's… a personal question, isn’t it? Well… they’re a bit… irregular, I suppose. Sometimes I have trouble, and sometimes… well, you know. It hasn't been too bad, but it’s different than it used to be. I don’t know if that’s related to… everything else, though. I’m just an old woman, Doctor. Things change.
DOCTOR: “Old woman” or not, we still need to figure out what's going on. Irregular bowel habits… alright. And any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not that I’ve noticed. I… I always check, you know, just to be sure. No blood, no. That would be awful. I mostly just worry it’s something serious, and… well, I don’t have anyone to really talk to about these things anymore. My husband, bless his soul, he’s been gone five years now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get a bit of your medical history. Do you have any significant medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe… thirty years? And I've always had a bit of trouble with my arthritis, mostly in my hands. It flares up sometimes, makes it hard to get around. And… Oh! I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered. That’s about it, I think. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. Until… well, until now. And I was diagnosed with cancer… a while back. But that was… It's all a bit fuzzy now, honestly.
DOCTOR: You were diagnosed with cancer?
PATIENT: Yes… that’s right. I… I think it was… lung cancer? But it was small. They said it was early stage. That was… a few years ago. I had some treatment… radiation, I think. But I don’t remember all the details. It's been a long time, and like I said, my memory… it isn’t what it used to be. It was supposed to be… cured. Or at least, under control.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s pull up your records… see what the details were. Okay, here we are. Stage 1 lung cancer, treated with radiation in 2020. Reported as resolved at that time. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just the arthritis medicine, mostly. It’s… naproxen, I think? And sometimes, when my arthritis is really bad, the doctor gives me something stronger. But other than that, no. Nothing regular. I try to stay away from pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. I used to help my grandmother with her herbs, and we used all sorts of things. Never had a reaction. Wait… I did get a rash once, years ago, after using a new laundry detergent. But that wasn’t a medicine. And it went away as soon as I stopped using it. So, no, not really any allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your history of lung cancer, even though it was treated, and your current symptoms… nausea, fatigue, weight loss, changes in bowel habits… I think we need to get some tests done. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your chest and abdomen. It’s just to be thorough. We need to rule things out.
PATIENT: Oh, my. Tests… That sounds… serious. But you’re right, of course. We need to know what’s going on. A CT scan… will that be painful? I don’t like being closed in. And blood work… I always bruise so easily. I just… I hope it’s nothing too bad. I’m an old woman, Doctor. I just want to be comfortable.
DOCTOR: The CT scan won’t be painful, Raymonde. You’ll just lie on a table, and the machine will take pictures. It’s a bit noisy, and you will have to lie still for a few minutes. As for the blood work, we’ll be careful. The phlebotomist is very good. We'll apply pressure afterwards to minimize bruising. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do everything we can to make it as comfortable as possible. The results will take a few days. I'll have the nurse schedule those tests for you. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… reassuring to hear. Not painful… good. And a good nurse… that means a lot. Well… how long will it take to get the results? And… if it is something bad… what then? I don't want to be a bother. I just… I've had a good life. I don't want to spend it in and out of hospitals.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within three to five business days. And frankly, Raymonde, you're worrying prematurely. We haven't even seen anything yet. If, if, something is found, we'll discuss your options. We have many treatments available, even for someone your age. But let's not borrow trouble. We'll take it one step at a time. The nurse will call you to schedule the tests. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh… No… I suppose not. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for not… making me feel like a bother. I’ll wait for the nurse’s call, then.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Raymonde.
