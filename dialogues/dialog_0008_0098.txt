DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Demondre is fine. Uh, well, to be honest… I just kinda wanted to check things out. Never really been to a doctor before, not for me. Just thought I should, you know? See if everything’s okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, Demondre. That’s smart of you to come in for a check-up. It's good to establish a baseline. “Check things out” is a bit vague, though. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms, or is this purely preventative?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really symptoms, no. Everything feels alright, I guess. Just… I work on ships, right? Lots of heavy lifting, being around the engine… kinda dirty work. And my ex-wife… she always worried about me. Said I should see someone. I don’t even know what to ask about, if that makes sense. Like, what should I be worried about?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Demondre. It’s common to not know where to start. Working on ships with heavy lifting and engine exposure does bring some specific concerns. We can cover a lot of ground. Let's start with your general health. Any trouble breathing, chest pain, or persistent cough?
PATIENT: No, sir, nothing like that. I get a little winded sometimes, but that's just from the lifting, I think. Like after hauling ropes all day. Nothing that a little rest doesn't fix. No chest pain, no cough. I do get… kinda tired sometimes, but again, the work. Long days, you know? Is that somethin' I should be talkin' about? The tiredness?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness is definitely worth talking about, especially given your work schedule. When you say tired, is it just muscle fatigue, or are you feeling unusually exhausted even after rest?
PATIENT: It's... more than just sore muscles, I think. Like, I can sleep eight hours, wake up, and still feel kinda… drained. Not sick drained, just… heavy. Like carryin' a weight all the time, even when I ain't liftin' nothin'. It's been goin' on for a few months now, maybe longer. I just figured it was the job.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information, Demondre. Prolonged fatigue, even with adequate sleep, is something we need to investigate further. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had nothin' diagnosed, nothin' like that. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell outta a tree, but that healed up fine. Other than that… I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I haven't really been to the doctor like I said, so there ain't much to talk about, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior diagnoses is good to know. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery either. Just the arm when I was little, and they just set it in a cast. Didn't need nothin' cut open or nothin'. This is kinda strange, talkin' about all this. I usually just… ignore stuff and hope it goes away.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Demondre. It’s good you're addressing it now. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mama, she had high blood pressure, I think. She was always gettin' headaches. And my grandpa, on my dad’s side… he had somethin' with his lungs, I think. He smoked a lot. Other than that… not really that I know of. My family don’t really talk about that kinda stuff much. Mostly just… life stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension in your mother and a lung condition in your grandfather. That’s helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My grandpa’s lungs kinda scared me off that one. I’ll have a beer sometimes with the guys after work, but nothin’ crazy. And definitely no drugs. Never been my thing. I mostly just try to get some rest when I can and eat when I can. It ain't always the healthiest food on a ship, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. One last few quick questions, then I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I've never had a reaction to anything, not that I remember. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes from bug bites, but that's about it. A physical exam sounds… good. Never had one of those either. What's involved?
DOCTOR: It's quite simple, Demondre. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, look in your ears and throat, and feel your abdomen. Just a routine check-up. It shouldn’t take long. First, let's start with your height and weight.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds alright. I'm pretty tall, if you haven't noticed. Used to bump my head on doorways a lot when I was a kid.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that. 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. Okay, Demondre, if you could just step over here, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Alright. Never been one for doctors, but I gotta say, you're makin' it pretty easy. Not scary at all. Go ahead when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from your activity level and being in here. Lungs sound clear, but I do hear some slight crackling on the lower lobes, which could be nothing, but we will keep an eye on it. Blood pressure is 135/85, slightly elevated. Now, I'm just going to take a look in your ears and throat. Everything looks clear in your ears and throat. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Okay. Ow, there. That kinda hurts. Right… about there. Not a bad pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It's been like that for a little while, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is a bit tender. It’s on your lower right quadrant. Do you feel any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no nausea or vomiting. Just that ache. It doesn't really bother me all the time, mostly just when I press on it. Or sometimes when I lift somethin' really heavy. I thought it was just a pulled muscle, to be honest. I do a lot of liftin', like I said. Is that somethin' bad?
DOCTOR: It could be a muscle strain, yes. But given the tenderness and your fatigue, it's worth investigating further. I want to order some blood work to check your liver function, kidney function, and rule out any infection. Also, I'm going to order a CT scan of your abdomen to get a better look at what’s going on there. It's likely nothing serious, but it's best to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and a… CT scan? That sounds… serious. Is it somethin' really wrong? I just came in for a check-up, not for… all this. But… if you think it's best, then yeah, I guess so. I don't want nothin' bad happenin'. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Demondre. It is a lot, and I apologize for that. But it's always better to be safe than sorry, especially given your symptoms and the tenderness you’re experiencing. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, it just allows us to rule things out and get a clear picture of what’s happening. Okay, I'll have the nurse draw some blood for the lab work. Then, we’ll schedule you for a CT scan at the imaging center down the street. It's a quick scan, shouldn't take more than 20 minutes. In the meantime, try to avoid any heavy lifting and take it easy. I’ll also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist, just in case we need a specialist's opinion. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A… gastroenterologist? That sounds fancy. This is a lot to take in. How long will it take to get the results back? And… will it cost a lot of money? I just got Medicare, I don't know how all this works. I really didn't expect all this from a check-up.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Demondre. It's a lot to process. A gastroenterologist specializes in the digestive system. We're just covering all bases. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. The CT scan results will take a little longer, maybe 2-3 business days, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. Regarding the cost, you have Medicare, which should cover a significant portion of the expenses. However, there may be some co-pays or deductibles. Our billing department can provide you with a detailed estimate of your out-of-pocket costs. I'll have the nurse give you their contact information. Do you want me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe explain the tests a little bit. Just so I know what's goin' on. I don't wanna be walkin' into somethin' blind. What exactly will they be lookin' for with the blood work? And what does a CT scan even do? I appreciate you explainin' all this, Doctor. It kinda makes me feel better, knowin' what's happenin'.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The blood work will give us a snapshot of your overall health and help us rule out any infections or problems with your liver and kidneys. We'll be looking at things like your white blood cell count to see if there’s an infection, and your liver enzymes to see if there's any inflammation. The CT scan is like a detailed X-ray. It takes images of your abdomen to help us see your organs – your liver, kidneys, intestines, and appendix – and identify any abnormalities, like inflammation, blockages, or growths. It doesn't hurt, you just lie on a table while the machine takes pictures. It does involve some radiation exposure, but it’s a minimal amount. Given the tenderness you described, we want to rule out things like appendicitis, diverticulitis, or a kidney stone. It's most likely something less serious, but it’s always best to be thorough. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that makes a little more sense. Appendicitis, diverticulitis… those sound scary. So basically, they're just checkin' to see if somethin' is really wrong, even though I probably just pulled a muscle. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Like, do I need to fast or anything? And how long will it take to get the results back after I have them done? I got work, I gotta know if I need to take time off.
DOCTOR: Exactly. You're right. We're being cautious and ruling things out. It’s likely a muscle strain, but we want to be sure. For the blood work, you don’t need to fast, but please drink plenty of water beforehand. For the CT scan, you may be asked to drink a contrast dye to help improve the images. The technician will explain that in detail when you arrive. The lab results should be back within 24-48 hours, and the CT scan results within 2-3 business days. Once we have the results, we’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We can also work with your employer if you need a medical note for time off. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Demondre?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now. You explained everything really well, Doctor. I appreciate it. I guess I'll go get the blood work done and then schedule the CT scan. Hopefully, it's just a pulled muscle. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Demondre. And you're right to hope for the best. We'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be right in to assist you with the blood work request and scheduling information. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and try to rest. .
