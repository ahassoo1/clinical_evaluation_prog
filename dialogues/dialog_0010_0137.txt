DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is okay if I call you Doctor? My name is Lindra. I am here… for the home. For the… senior place? My daughter, she say I need paper from you, yes? To show them I am… good for live there.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lindra, “Doctor” is perfectly fine. And yes, I understand. Your daughter is right, we need to complete some paperwork to verify your medical status for the senior living facility. It’s a standard procedure. We want to make sure you’re healthy and able to live there safely and comfortably. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you're considering a move to a senior living community?
PATIENT: Ah, good. Okay. My house… is too much now. Big garden, many stairs. My husband… he passed last year. It’s just me now, and… hard to keep up. My daughter, she worry. She say it’s safer place, yes? With people around. I think… she is right. It just… big change.
DOCTOR: That sounds very reasonable, Lindra. It's perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about a big change like that, especially after losing your husband. It's good of your daughter to be proactive and looking out for your well-being. To help me complete the necessary forms, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your health. We'll go through your medical history, current medications, and do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… okay. I take some pills. For the… the water in my knees. And… something for my blood. Not sure what name. My daughter, she give me pills every morning. I forget easy. Is okay if she come with me next time?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lindra. It's perfectly fine, and often helpful, for your daughter to accompany you to future appointments. It sounds like she provides wonderful support. Okay, let's start with those medications. You mentioned pills for your knees and something for your blood. Do you know roughly how long you’ve been taking these medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… the knee pills… maybe five years? Since the fall in the garden. The blood pills… not so long. Maybe two years? Three? I not sure, Doctor. Everything is… blurry sometimes. I try to remember, but… it’s hard.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Lindra. Don't worry about being exact. We can look up your medication list in our system. Do you happen to know the name of the pharmacy you use?
PATIENT: Hmm… the pharmacy… is… the one on Main Street? Next to the bakery? Is… is a small one? I always see Mrs. Rodriguez there. She is very nice. I don’t know the name… sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Lindra. I think I found it – “Miller’s Pharmacy” on Main Street?
PATIENT: Yes! That is it. Miller’s. Mrs. Rodriguez… she always help me. She know my name, and she check my pills good.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I see here you’re currently taking… let me read this off to you to confirm. You have Meloxicam 15mg daily for osteoarthritis – that’s the knee pain medication – and Lisinopril 20mg daily for high blood pressure, that’s the blood medication. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sound right. Meloxicam… for my knees. And… Lisinopril… for my blood. You remember more than me, Doctor! My daughter, she always say I forget things. Is… is normal, yes? For old people?
DOCTOR: It is perfectly normal, Lindra. Memory can change as we get older. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. And don’t worry, that’s why I’m here – to help keep track of things and make sure you’re doing well. Now, aside from knee pain and high blood pressure, have you been experiencing any other health problems lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes I feel… dizzy. Not all the time. But when I stand up too fast. And… my hands, they shake a little. Not bad, just… a little. My daughter say I should tell the doctor, so… I am telling you.
DOCTOR: Thank you for telling me, Lindra. It’s very important that you share these things with me. The dizziness when you stand up and the shaking hands are things we need to look into a little further. How often would you say you experience the dizziness?
PATIENT: Hmm… not every day. Maybe… two or three times a week? When I get up from the chair, or when I bend down to pick something up. It goes away quick, but… it scare me a little. I hold onto the table, yes? To not fall.
DOCTOR: That’s good that you’re being cautious and holding onto something. That’s smart. And it's good you’re aware of it. Do you feel any other symptoms with the dizziness?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my heart… it beat fast when I dizzy. Like… like it is running. And… sometimes I see… black spots. Not all the time. But when I dizzy, yes? Black spots in my eyes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lindra. The fast heartbeat and black spots are important details. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is okay. I trust you. You remember everything, yes? My daughter, she forget things all the time! What you need to do?
DOCTOR: I do my best, Lindra. I'll check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam – just to check your reflexes and balance. It won't take long. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Now, I'm just going to use my stethoscope to listen… [I perform a brief auscultation of Lindra’s heart and lungs, verbalizing the findings as I go] Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/85. That's a little elevated, but not unexpected. Now, let’s check your reflexes. [I perform a quick neurological exam.] Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Balance seems a little unsteady, but within normal limits for your age. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can walk. [I stand up slowly, using the chair for support. I take a few steps forward, slowly and deliberately, watching my feet. My gait is a little slow and unsteady, but I maintain my balance.] Is okay? I feel… a little dizzy when I walk.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lindra, that’s good. You’re doing well. I noticed a slight unsteadiness when walking, and you mentioned feeling a little dizzy. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, I think we need to investigate this further. There are a few possibilities, including low blood pressure when standing up , a possible inner ear problem affecting your balance, or even just a side effect of one of your medications. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests… EKG… is okay. I trust you. My daughter, she always say… I forget what she say! But she want me to be safe, yes? So I do whatever you say.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you, Lindra, and that's exactly the right attitude. Your daughter sounds like she cares about you very much. Okay, I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and set up the EKG for you now. Then, we’ll review the results in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, and standing up slowly from sitting or lying down. To be on the safe side, I also recommend that you avoid driving until we know what’s causing the dizziness. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. No driving… is okay. My daughter, she always drive me anyway. She say I am too old to drive. Plenty of water… yes. I drink tea. Is okay? Or should I drink… just water?
DOCTOR: Tea is perfectly fine, Lindra, but try to balance it with water. Water is important for staying hydrated. Try to drink at least eight glasses of water a day. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and perform the EKG. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… you explain everything good. You remember everything, yes? I forget so easy. Just… thank you. You very kind. And tell Mrs. Rodriguez I say hello. She is very nice lady.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindra. I'll be sure to tell Mrs. Rodriguez hello. And don’t worry about forgetting things – that’s perfectly normal. I’m here to help, and we’ll figure this out together. The nurse should be in any moment now. Just relax, and we'll take things one step at a time.
