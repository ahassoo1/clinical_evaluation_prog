DOCTOR: Hi Venus, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Maskal. It is nice to meet you as well. I… well, I have been noticing some things. Problems with my memory, mostly. It is… concerning, and my blood pressure has been quite high, you see. I thought it best to have it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Memory problems and high blood pressure – those are definitely things we want to look into. Let's start with the memory issues. Can you tell me a little more about what you've been noticing?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is… difficult to explain precisely. Small things, mostly. I might go into a room and forget why I went there. Or I will be speaking and… the word will simply vanish. Not all the time, thankfully. But it is happening more frequently, and it frightens me, Doctor. I remember details very clearly, dates and names, things like that. But everyday… happenings seem to slip away. It is as though a piece is missing.
DOCTOR: I see. So it's more with recent events and recalling things as they happen, rather than long-term memories?
PATIENT: Precisely! You understand perfectly. Long ago, I can recall events with… almost painful clarity. Dates, names, places… all intact. But yesterday? Last week? Sometimes… a blur. It is most frustrating, Doctor. I used to manage many properties, you see. Details were everything. And now… now I find myself writing everything down, constantly. It is unlike me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And you mentioned your blood pressure has been high. Do you know what your readings have been, if you've checked it at home, or have you had it checked recently at a pharmacy or another doctor's office?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. My neighbor, she is a retired nurse, she lets me use her machine. It has been… inconsistent, but often quite high. Just last week, it was 160 over 95, I believe. And the week before, 150 over 88. I have not seen another doctor in some time, no. My husband… he handled those matters. It has been… difficult since he passed.
DOCTOR: I understand. Those are definitely elevated readings, and consistent with what you're describing. And I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. Losing a partner is incredibly difficult, and it’s understandable that things may have slipped through the cracks. Now, to get a better picture of things, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if that’s alright. We’ll go through some of your medical history, just to be thorough. Have you had any other health problems in the past, like diabetes, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: No, no diabetes. My husband… he had some heart trouble later in life, but I myself have been… quite healthy, generally. No stroke. I had a difficult birth with my son, many years ago, and needed a blood transfusion, but nothing else serious. I do have… some arthritis in my hands, it gets worse with the weather. And a touch of rheumatism. But overall… robust. I always considered myself robust.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. A difficult birth and the transfusion are worth noting, and the arthritis and rheumatism, too. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Yes. Appendicitis, when I was quite young, perhaps twenty years old. And a hysterectomy, many years later. That was… necessary, Doctor. Other than those two… no. No other surgeries. I always avoided them if possible. I do not care for hospitals.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she lived to be eighty-five. She had… some heart issues near the end, similar to my husband, I think. My father… he passed away when I was young, from pneumonia. He smoked, you see. A bad habit. I have one brother, Dimitri, he lives in Moscow. I have not seen him in many years. He is… a difficult man. As for other… illnesses in the family… not that I am aware of. My mother’s sister had some… trouble with her nerves, I believe. She was always forgetful, but I never knew the details.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your current medications?
PATIENT: Just this, Doctor. For my arthritis. Ibuprofen, usually. And sometimes, a muscle relaxant when the rheumatism is bad. That is all. I do not like taking pills. I find they make me… sluggish. I rarely take them unless absolutely necessary. Here.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Ibuprofen and cyclobenzaprine. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never. I have always been very fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, take anything… or could, at least. Before all of this. This memory trouble… it is what worries me most. The pills… those are a small matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and do a brief neurological exam just to assess your reflexes and cognitive function. It's pretty standard. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. If you think it is necessary. I… I do not enjoy being examined, but I want to understand what is happening. I trust your judgment. Please… be gentle, if you would. My joints are not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. 158 over 92. Still elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Her heart rate is a bit fast, but regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Reflexes are normal. Finally, I'm going to do a very brief cognitive assessment. I'll ask you a few simple questions, just to assess your memory and orientation. Can you tell me what today’s date is?
PATIENT: Today… let me see… It is… August 2nd. Yes. August 2nd, 2025. I… I believe that is correct. It took me a moment, I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Venus. That's perfectly alright. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: We are… in your office, Doctor. At the clinic. Courtnee Maskal’s clinic… the urban clinic, you said? Yes. It is… a very nice office, very clean. I remember everything you told me. It is just… recalling it takes a little longer these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. And finally, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Please, go ahead. I will do my best. I find I concentrate better if you say them slowly.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to ask you to draw a clock, showing ten minutes after eleven. I just want to get an idea of your visual-spatial skills. Here is a piece of paper and a pen. Take your time.
PATIENT: Here. It is… not my best work. My hands are not as steady as they used to be. But I have tried my best.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venus. Okay, that was helpful. Based on what you've told me, the physical exam findings, and the brief cognitive assessment, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. Your elevated blood pressure is certainly concerning, and needs to be managed. Your memory issues and the slight difficulty with the clock drawing could be due to a number of things – stress, anxiety, medication side effects, or possibly early signs of cognitive impairment. It’s too early to say definitively. I'm going to order some blood work to check your overall health, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. I also want to rule out any other underlying causes for your memory problems. In the meantime, I recommend we start with some lifestyle changes to help lower your blood pressure – a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, and stress reduction techniques. We can discuss those in more detail. Would you be open to a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation of your memory issues?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Blood work is… reasonable. And a neurologist… if you think it is necessary, then yes. I trust your judgment. Lifestyle changes… I can try. It has been difficult since my husband passed, but I can certainly try. Is the blood work… painful? And when can I expect the results?
DOCTOR: The blood work is not painful, Venus. It's just a small needle prick, and it's usually very quick. It may be a little uncomfortable for a moment, but nothing serious. We can get the blood drawn here at the clinic. The results usually take about a week to come back. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a low-dose blood pressure medication to help get things under control. It's important to start slowly and see how you tolerate it. And I'll give you some information about healthy eating and exercise. I’ll also have my nurse schedule you for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the blood work results and the neurologist referral. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. A prescription… and information about eating… and exercise. Yes. And a follow-up appointment. I appreciate your thoroughness. It is… reassuring to know that you are taking this seriously. Perhaps if my blood pressure is lower, my memory will improve as well. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: That's a good thought, Venus. Lowering your blood pressure can definitely have a positive impact on your cognitive function. As for anything else, it's important to stay mentally active. Continue to engage in activities you enjoy – reading, puzzles, socializing. Staying connected with others is also very important for your overall well-being. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – severe headaches, dizziness, confusion, weakness – please contact us immediately. We're going to work together on this. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll have my nurse come in and go over the instructions and schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have covered everything very thoroughly. Thank you. I… I feel much better knowing that we have a plan. You are a very kind and competent doctor. .
DOCTOR: It's my pleasure, Venus. I'm glad I could help. We'll get this sorted out together. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in two weeks. .
