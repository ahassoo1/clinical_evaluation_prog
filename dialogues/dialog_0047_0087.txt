DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. That’s what the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details. Medicare sent something… or told me to come. It's all a bit fuzzy, you know? Just want to get it over with if we can.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we can certainly try to get it over with, but I need some information from you first. “Just lab work” isn’t terribly helpful, unfortunately. Do you happen to know which lab work was requested?
PATIENT: Ugh, see? This is what I mean. Honestly, no. Something about… my blood, I think? And maybe… checking something else? It was a form, a long form, and I filled it out… a while ago. I really don't recall. Is there a list somewhere? Maybe on the computer? I'm terrible with remembering these things. It's just… been a lot of years, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. Let’s see what Medicare has on file for you. taps at the keyboard Ah, here we are. It appears you’re due for your annual wellness exam, which includes a comprehensive metabolic panel – that’s the blood work you mentioned – a lipid panel to check your cholesterol, and a complete blood count. They also requested a PSA test – that’s prostate-specific antigen, to screen for prostate cancer. Does any of that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Prostate… cancer? Oh dear. No, that doesn't sound familiar at all. Look, I just turned seventy-three, Doctor. Things… slip my mind. Is that… is that something I need to do? I haven't had anything about that before. I just thought it was a routine check-up. Honestly, if it’s not urgent, can we maybe skip that one? It sounds… unpleasant. I'm not feeling sick, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, with all due respect, that's not really how preventative medicine works. Screening tests are done before you feel sick, precisely to catch things early. Prostate cancer is very common in men your age, and early detection significantly improves the chances of successful treatment. Skipping it simply isn’t advisable. We’ll do the PSA test – it’s just a blood draw, it's not unpleasant. It's important. Now, let’s focus on getting through this. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. Not to anything… major. I used to get a bit of a rash from poison ivy when I was a boy, but that was… ages ago. I don’t think I've had a reaction to anything in years. No, I don’t think so. Just the usual aches and pains, getting old, you know? Is it alright if we just… get this over with? I’ve got things to do this afternoon. I promised my neighbor I'd help him with his… something. I forget what. But it's important.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known drug allergies, then. And you said no other significant medical problems?
PATIENT: No, no. Nothing that I’ve been told about, anyway. Just… tired a lot, if that counts. But I figure that’s just age. And… my knees bother me when it rains. But that's not a medical problem, is it? I used to work around power plants, you see. A lot of standing. Not so much anymore. I'm retired now. Can we just get to the blood draw? This is… a bit stressful, honestly.
DOCTOR: Very well. So, retired, some knee pain, general fatigue... We'll proceed with the blood work as planned. To clarify, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… oh! Yes. A little blue pill for… well, you know. For… keeping things regular. And sometimes, if my knees are really bad, I take ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. That’s it, I think. Just the blue pill and the ibuprofen when I need it. Honestly, that's about all I can keep track of these days. Is this… almost over? I’m really not good with this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a medication for benign prostatic hyperplasia—the little blue pill—and ibuprofen as needed. Do you know the dosage of either of those?
PATIENT: Dosage? Oh dear. No. No, I really don't. The little blue pill...I just take one when… well, when I need it. And the ibuprofen… two, I think? Or maybe three? I just read the bottle. Honestly, I don't pay much attention. It helps with the pain, that's all I know. Look, is it possible to just… do the blood work? I really don’t remember details like dosages. It's just… frustrating trying to recall everything. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, with all due respect, it is important that I have accurate information. Not knowing medication dosages is… concerning. I'm going to need to ask you to either contact your pharmacy to get that information for me, or schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss this further. Until I have that information, I'm hesitant to proceed. It is a matter of your safety. Now, do you have any family history of significant medical problems – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. This is becoming a whole thing, isn't it? Okay, okay, let me think. My father… he had… something with his heart. A blockage, I think. He smoked a lot, you see. And my mother… she had diabetes. Towards the end, anyway. And my brother… he had cancer, a long time ago. Lung cancer, I believe. It wasn’t good. He… passed away. But that was… years ago. Look, I’m getting a bit flustered now. Can we please just do the blood work? I’ll try to remember about the dosages later, I promise. I really will. It’s just… a lot to take in. I don't want to cause any trouble. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to proceed with the blood work under the understanding that you will follow up with your pharmacy to provide accurate medication dosages. And I will have the nurse schedule you for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and this information further. Do you understand?
