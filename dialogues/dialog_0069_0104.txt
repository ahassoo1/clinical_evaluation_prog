DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes. Well, it’s my throat. It… hurts. Been hurting for a bit now. I don't have time for this, really. Just need something quick, if you please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re busy and we’ll try to be as efficient as possible. But it’s important to get a good understanding of what’s going on, even for something that seems straightforward. When you say “a bit now,” how long exactly has your throat been hurting?
PATIENT: Honestly? I… don’t rightly remember. A few days, maybe? It all feels the same lately. I work long hours, you see. Separating and filtering… it’s important work. Not everyone can do it. It's… difficult to keep track of things when you're busy.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Tammie. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate. It’s completely understandable that it’s hard to keep track of everything when you’re working long hours. So, a few days… and would you say the pain has been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Mostly when I swallow. And… when it's dusty at work. Which is often. It's a… factory, you know? Dust is to be expected. Not a pleasant feeling, I assure you. Just want something to stop the aching.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain is worse when you swallow and with dust exposure. Does it feel like a scratchy pain, a sharp pain, or something else?
PATIENT: It’s… rough. Like sandpaper, almost. And dry. Very dry. I drink plenty of water, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Honestly, Doctor, I don't have time to describe every little ache. Are you going to give me something or…? It’s a waste of a good morning, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie, and I want to assure you I'm trying to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. Knowing exactly how it feels helps me determine the best course of action. But let's try this: besides the sandpaper feeling and dryness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I feel… tired. Always tired. But that's the work. And… I haven’t much of an appetite. Food just doesn't taste right these days. It’s probably just the stress, to be frank. I’ve always been a strong woman. Don’t need coddling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness and a decreased appetite along with the throat pain. Have you had a fever, chills, or any body aches?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I haven’t taken my temperature. Chills… not really. I mean, it gets cold in the factory sometimes, but that’s just the air conditioning. Body aches… sometimes my back hurts from standing all day, but that’s just… age. And work. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I’ve got things to do. Really important things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. No fever, chills, or significant body aches. You mentioned the pain is worse with swallowing and dust exposure, and you’re also experiencing tiredness and a decreased appetite. Before we consider treatment, I'd like to take a quick look at your throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Quickly, please. I don't enjoy having people poke around. And be gentle. I have important work to do, you know. This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please open wide and say "Ah." Okay. Your throat is a bit red and your tonsils are slightly swollen. No obvious signs of anything serious right now. I'm also going to quickly feel your neck for any swollen lymph nodes. A few tender lymph nodes here, but nothing too concerning. Now, have you been around anyone who has been sick recently—a cold, the flu, or strep throat perhaps?
PATIENT: Sick people? The factory is full of sick people, Doctor. Always someone coughing and sneezing. It's unavoidable. Honestly, I try to avoid them, but it’s difficult. They just… keep coming to work. It’s the only way they can afford things, I suppose. I haven’t been close to anyone, if that’s what you mean. I keep to myself. It's better that way. More efficient.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve been around people with cold-like symptoms at work. Given your symptoms—sore throat, tiredness, decreased appetite—and the examination findings, it sounds most likely like you have a viral pharyngitis—a common sore throat caused by a virus. However, because you're around sick people frequently, and to rule out something like strep throat, I'd like to do a quick strep test. It’s a simple swab, and it will give us a definitive answer. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Another swab? Really? Must you poke and prod so much? Fine. But make it quick. And don't make me cough. I haven't the time for a coughing fit. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to think I should have just stayed home and suffered. At least then I wouldn’t be wasting my valuable time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie, and I apologize for the inconvenience. It’s just a quick precaution to be sure. It will only take a moment. Alright, the sample is collected. It will take about five to ten minutes for the results to come back. While we wait, can you tell me about any allergies you have to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. I don't think so. I haven't taken anything in years. I prefer to just tough things out. Medications… they just make you feel worse, if you ask me. Waste of money. And time. I’m a strong woman. I don’t need… coddling. Just let me know when you’ve finished poking around. I have things to do, you know. Important things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. While we wait for the strep test results, are you currently taking any vitamins, supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Vitamins? Supplements? No. I eat what I can, when I can. Don't have time for fancy things like that. Factory work doesn't leave much room for… self-care. It’s about getting the job done, not… pampering myself. Just hurry up with the results, Doctor. My time is valuable. Really valuable.
DOCTOR: Okay, good news. The strep test came back negative, so it doesn't appear to be strep throat. That means it's most likely a viral pharyngitis, as we suspected. Since it's a virus, antibiotics won't help. The treatment is supportive—rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to manage the pain and fever, if you develop one. I recommend you drink plenty of water, get as much rest as possible, and avoid close contact with others to prevent spreading any potential illness. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Rest? Fluids? You expect me to rest? I have a schedule to keep, Doctor! People are relying on me. And avoid close contact? Impossible. I work in a factory! Look, just give me something for the pain. Something strong. And tell me I can go back to work. That's all I need. I don't have time for a detailed recovery plan. Honestly, this has been a complete waste of time. A complete and utter waste. Just... the pain. Something for the pain, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your commitment to your work, Tammie. However, going back to work while you’re still contagious could potentially spread the illness to your colleagues, and continuing to push yourself when you're unwell could prolong your recovery. But, since you're insistent on returning to work, I can recommend an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, taken as directed on the package. Those should help manage the pain and any potential fever. I strongly advise you to try and get as much rest as possible when you're not working, drink plenty of fluids, and practice good hand hygiene to minimize the risk of spreading anything. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? No. I’m a strong woman. Always have been. Never been sick for long in my life. Just… tired. Always tired. But that's the work. Look, just write down the name of the pain reliever. And tell me I'm good to go. I have important things to do. Really important things. Honestly, this entire morning has been… a nuisance. A complete and utter nuisance. Just the name. And I’ll be going now. Thank you. Or… not. It hardly matters, does it?
DOCTOR: Alright, here you go. Ibuprofen or Acetaminophen – follow the package directions. I strongly encourage you to listen to your body, Tammie. If your symptoms worsen or you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or any other concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention immediately. Take care, and please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. .
