DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… my… sinuses? They… they feel bad. Like… full of water, maybe? I don't… I don't really know what is wrong. It has been… a little while now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. "Sinuses feel bad," full sensation, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, full. And… a little pain, sometimes. Not… a bad pain, but… bothersome. It’s hard to… explain. It feels like pressure, mostly. Behind my eyes, a little. I… I work outside, you know? Maybe… dust? I don't remember when it started, exactly. A few weeks, maybe?
DOCTOR: A few weeks of fullness and pressure, potentially related to your work environment… that’s helpful. To clarify, is the pressure constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Um… it comes and goes, I think. Some days are… better. Other days… like today, it is worse. When I… when I bend over, it feels… more full. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I am not good with… words.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Boham. No need to apologize at all. The fact that it worsens when bending over is certainly a clue. And you mentioned working outside – what type of work do you do, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes. I… I work with the drills. The big… rotary drills. For the… oil. It’s… noisy. And dusty, sometimes. I am a… operator? I think that’s the right word. It's… hard work, but… it is a job. My husband, he says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: An oil rig operator – thank you for clarifying. That does give me a better understanding of potential exposures. And your husband is right to encourage you to address this. Let’s try to pinpoint the specifics a bit more. Aside from the pressure and fullness, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… my nose feels… stopped up. Like it’s hard to breathe through it. And… I have been… more tired, maybe? It’s hard to tell. I work long hours. Oh! And… a little bit of a cough, sometimes. Not a bad cough, just… a tickle in my throat. I don't think it is… important.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nasal congestion, increased fatigue, and a mild cough in addition to the sinus pressure. Those are all potentially related. Have you had a fever, or chills at any point?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don't think so. I… I haven’t checked. Not that I remember. Chills… maybe a little cold sometimes, but it is… August. It is hot outside. I… I don't think it was a chill. Just… normal cold from the air conditioner, maybe? I am not sure. I don’t usually get sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: Smell? Um… no. I… I smell the food my husband cooks, that’s for sure! He makes very good tamales. Taste… I think so. Everything tastes… normal. I don’t think… I haven’t noticed anything different. Is that… bad? I worry I am… forgetting things.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Boham, that is not bad at all. It's good that you haven't noticed any changes in your smell or taste. And it’s perfectly normal to worry about forgetting things; we all do it from time to time. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as asthma, allergies, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh. Medical history… Um… no, not that I know of. I went to the doctor when I was little, but… nothing bad. I don’t have asthma, I don't think. Allergies… maybe to dust? But not… bad allergies. My husband has allergies, very bad ones. I… I don’t take any medicine, usually. Just… sometimes for a headache. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No chronic medical conditions, possible dust sensitivity, occasional headache medication… That’s helpful. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I… I don’t like hospitals. Not a good place, I think. And… no, I haven’t been in the hospital. Not ever. Just… the normal check-ups when I was a little girl. That’s all. I… I try to stay healthy. My husband worries about me working outside, but… it is a good job. We need the money.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives have a history of allergies, asthma, sinus problems, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother, she had… problems with her stomach, I think. She went to the doctor a lot. And my father… he had a strong cough sometimes, but he smoked a lot. I don’t think it was… anything serious. My husband’s mother, she has… diabetes. Very bad. She has to take medicine every day. That’s all I can remember right now. I… I don’t talk about it much. It makes my husband sad.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Boham. History of gastrointestinal issues in your mother, cough in your father, and diabetes in your husband’s mother… that's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I eat everything my husband cooks! He puts a lot of spices in it, but… I like it. I haven’t ever had a… reaction to anything. Except… maybe to bee stings when I was a little girl. But that was a long time ago. I don’t get stung anymore. I… I stay away from the bees. Is that important? I… I am sorry, I am not very good at remembering.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Boham, you're doing just fine. The bee sting is good to know, but it sounds like it was a long time ago. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache. Like… ibuprofen? When it is very bad. But not every day. Just… when I need it. My husband says I should relax more, and I won’t get so many headaches. He is probably right. I… I try to rest when I can. But it is hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough history. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing sinus pressure, fullness, and a mild cough for a few weeks, potentially related to your work environment. Given your symptoms and history, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… good. I want to feel better. A physical… exam? Okay. Whatever you think is best. I… I trust you. Just… please be gentle. My husband will be worried if I am sick for too long. He works hard too.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Boham. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel around your sinuses to check for tenderness. There’s some tenderness over your frontal and maxillary sinuses. Finally, I’m going to look inside your nose to check for any inflammation or blockage. I see some mild swelling and redness inside your nasal passages. No significant blockage at this time.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That… didn’t hurt too bad. Swelling? And redness? Is that… bad? My husband says I should wear a mask when I am at work, because of the dust. Maybe… that is the problem? I… I don't want to take too much time off work, though. We need the money.
DOCTOR: The swelling and redness suggest some inflammation, which is consistent with sinusitis, or an inflammation of the sinuses. Your husband is absolutely right – wearing a mask at work is an excellent idea to protect yourself from dust and other irritants. It's likely that the dust is contributing to your symptoms. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings, I believe you’re experiencing acute sinusitis, likely triggered by environmental factors. While it's not a serious condition, it can be quite uncomfortable. It's good that you haven't had a fever or experienced any severe symptoms. Here’s what I recommend. I want to start with conservative management. We can try saline nasal rinses two to three times a day to help clear out the nasal passages and reduce inflammation. Over-the-counter decongestants, like pseudoephedrine, can also help relieve nasal congestion. However, please be aware that these can raise your blood pressure, so if you have any history of hypertension or heart problems, please let me know. I will avoid prescribing antibiotics at this time as most cases of acute sinusitis are viral. Would you be comfortable trying this approach for the next week?
PATIENT: Saline… nasal rinses? And… decongestants? Okay. I can try that. My husband can help me with the rinses, I think. He is good at that kind of thing. But… decongestants? I don't know… I don't have… hypertension, I don’t think. But my father… he had a bad heart. Should I… be worried about that? I… I don’t want to make things worse. I… I just want to feel better. I… I trust you, Doctor. But… what if it doesn't get better?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Boham, and it’s important that we address your concerns. Given your father’s history of heart problems, I recommend starting with the saline nasal rinses and avoiding the decongestants for now. We can monitor your symptoms closely and see if those are enough to provide relief. If your symptoms don't improve within a week, or if they worsen despite the nasal rinses, then we can discuss other options, including further evaluation, like a CT scan of your sinuses, and potentially a referral to an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist. I also want to emphasize the importance of staying well-hydrated and getting plenty of rest. And please, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or a high fever, seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound like a reasonable plan to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds good. No decongestants for now. Just the… rinses. And rest. And water. I can do that. My husband will help me. And if it gets worse… I will come back. Or… go to the hospital? I… I don’t like hospitals, but… I will do what I need to do. Thank you, Doctor. I feel… a little better just talking about it. You are very… kind. Is there anything else… I should know?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Boham. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. And you are absolutely right to prioritize your health. For now, no, there isn’t anything else specific you need to know. Just focus on the rinses, rest, and hydration. I’ll document our plan in your chart, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll give you a printed handout with instructions for the nasal rinses. Do you have any further questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is everything. Thank you again. You were very… patient with me. I… I worry a lot. But I feel… better prepared now. And my husband will be glad to hear we don’t need the decongestants. He worries about my heart too. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Boham. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Remember, I'm here if you need anything. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
