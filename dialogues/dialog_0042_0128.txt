DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… It’s my joints, mostly. They get so stiff in the mornings. It's a bother, really. Not awful, just… old. I guess. I don't really remember when it started, to be honest. It's just… been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness in the mornings. That's a common complaint, certainly. And you feel it mostly in your joints?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. My… knees, I think. And my hands, sometimes. It's hard to get going, you know? Like I need to… oil the hinges. That sounds silly, doesn’t it? But that’s what it feels like. It gets a little better as the day goes on, but… it's always there, a little bit. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Lilliana. "Oiling the hinges" is a very descriptive way to put it, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It helps me understand what you're experiencing. So, it sounds like the stiffness is worse in the morning and eases up throughout the day. Does anything specifically make it worse – certain activities, weather changes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific things? Oh dear. That’s a good question. I don’t really… pay attention to those things, I suppose. I do a bit of gardening, when the weather is nice. That might bother it a little. And… cold weather, probably. It just feels… tighter. But I can't say for sure. I'm not very good at remembering details, you see. My husband used to keep track of all that for me. It's been… a while since he's been around.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don't have precise details. We’ll work with what you do remember. Gardening, and colder weather seem to be factors. And besides those, would you say the pain is constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. It's not… always there, a sharp pain. It's more like… a dull ache, most of the time. Some mornings it's harder than others to get moving. And then… it's just there, in the background. I don’t really feel it unless I try to do something that… bends the joints, I guess. Does that make sense? I feel silly trying to explain all this.
DOCTOR: No, not at all silly, Lilliana. You’re explaining it perfectly. A dull ache that comes and goes, worse with movement… that gives me a good starting point. Now, have you noticed any swelling or redness in those joints – your knees and hands, specifically?
PATIENT: Swelling… redness… Hmm. I haven’t really looked, to be honest. I don’t… pay attention to those things. I just try to get on with the day, you know? I'm not sure. I suppose I could check when I get home… but I don't think so. No, I haven't noticed any swelling or redness. I’m… not very observant, I guess. It's probably just my old bones.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lilliana. Don't worry about being observant; that’s what I’m here for. We'll do a quick physical exam now, if you don’t mind, just to get a better look at those joints and see if we can identify any swelling or tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. A physical exam sounds good. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just… please be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be. I’m a little worried it might be… nothing, really. Just old age catching up with me. But I appreciate you looking, nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilliana. I will be very gentle. We’ll take our time. And it’s always best to rule things out and understand what’s going on, even if it is just age-related wear and tear. Okay, if you could just sit here on the exam table for me. I’m going to start by gently examining your knees. Can you point to where you feel the most discomfort in either knee?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me see… The discomfort… it’s mostly right here, on the front of my right knee. And a little bit here, on the inside of the left one. Not as bad, though. It’s hard to say exactly. It's… a general ache, really. But those are the spots that bother me most when I try to bend them.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just let me know if anything feels particularly sore as I press here. And how does that feel compared to the other side?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a little tender, yes. That’s the spot. It’s not a sharp pain, but… I can feel it. And it’s definitely more uncomfortable than the other side. The left one doesn’t bother me nearly as much. It's just… a dull ache, if that makes sense. The right one is… more noticeable. I hope it’s not something terrible. I’m a bit worried, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Lilliana. We’ll get to the bottom of it. And as I’m feeling your left knee, it does feel slightly less tender than the right, as you mentioned. There's a little bit of crepitus when I bend it, do you notice that at all when you move it?
PATIENT: Crepitus? Oh dear, what is that? Is that bad? I… I think I feel a little popping sometimes when I bend it. But I thought that was just… old age. I don't know. I’ve always had a little clicking in my joints. I’m not sure if that’s what you mean. It doesn't really hurt, just… a little noise. Is that bad? I'm terribly sorry, I don't understand all these medical terms.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Lilliana. That's what I'm here for – to explain things. Crepitus just refers to that clicking or popping sound you’re experiencing. It can be normal, especially as we get older, but it’s good to check it out. Now, let's move on to your hands. Do you have any pain or stiffness in your hands that limits your ability to do everyday tasks, like opening jars or buttoning your clothes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my hands… They aren’t what they used to be, that’s for sure. Buttoning my clothes is a little tricky sometimes, especially the small buttons. And opening jars… my grandson usually does that for me. It’s just… stiff, you know? And sometimes a little sore. Not terrible, but… noticeable. It's worse in the mornings, of course, like everything else. I used to love to knit, but I haven’t been able to do much of that lately. It’s too painful. It makes me sad, really. I miss my knitting.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's frustrating when your hobbies become difficult. I see a little bit of swelling in the knuckles of your right hand, and your range of motion is slightly limited. Does this hand feel more affected than the other one?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my right hand is definitely worse. It’s harder to bend them, and it feels a little… achy. The left one isn't as bad, but it's starting to feel a bit stiff too. It’s probably just old age, you know. I used to have such strong hands. I could do anything with them. But now… they just aren't the same. I don't want to complain, but it's just… frustrating. And a little bit scary, to be honest. What if I can't do anything anymore? I worry about that.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Lilliana. It’s not silly to feel that way at all. And it's good that you're sharing this with me. Based on the physical exam, it does appear you have some swelling and limited range of motion in both your hands, more pronounced in the right. The stiffness and aching, particularly in the mornings, are also consistent with a few different possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out certain inflammatory conditions, like rheumatoid arthritis. It's a relatively simple test, and will give us a lot of information. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work… Oh dear. I don't really like needles. But… if it will help, I suppose. I want to know what's going on. I just… I hope it's not something terrible. Is rheumatoid arthritis… bad? My neighbor had that, and she was in a lot of pain. I just want to be able to do my knitting again, you know? And I don’t want to be a burden to my grandson. If you think it's necessary, I'll do it. Just… please be gentle. And explain everything to me, okay? I get confused easily.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilliana. We'll take it one step at a time. And yes, I will explain everything. I understand your worry about rheumatoid arthritis, and it’s good you’re aware of it. It can be a serious condition, but early diagnosis and treatment can make a huge difference. And it’s not always as severe as you might think. The blood work will help us determine if inflammation is present and, if so, what’s causing it. It’s a standard test, and the nurse is very good at making it as comfortable as possible. We can also discuss pain management options while we wait for the results. Would you like me to write you a requisition for the blood work now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A requisition, you say? That sounds… official. I trust your judgement, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary, let’s do it. And… could you also write down the name of the nurse, just in case I forget? I'm terrible with names, you know. And maybe… a little explanation of what the blood work is for? Just to remind me. I’m just… a little anxious, I suppose. It's silly, isn't it? But I worry about bad news. And I really miss my knitting.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Lilliana. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. I completely understand. Here you go. “Nurse Eleni Vasiliou. Blood work to check for inflammation. Results usually available in 3-5 business days.” I’ve also included the lab’s address and phone number. Nurse Eleni will be happy to answer any questions you have. While we wait for the results, let's focus on some simple things you can do to manage your symptoms. Would you be open to discussing some gentle exercises and over-the-counter pain relief options?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. Nurse Eleni… I’ll try to remember that. Gentle exercises… I don’t know. My joints are so stiff, I’m afraid I’ll hurt myself. But… I suppose it's worth a try. And over-the-counter pain relief… I have some ibuprofen, I think. But it doesn’t seem to do much good. Perhaps you could recommend something else? I just want to be able to get through the day without feeling so achy. And… maybe knit a little scarf for my grandson.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Ibuprofen can be helpful for some, but there are other options we can explore. For gentle exercises, we can start with very simple range-of-motion movements – things like slowly bending and straightening your fingers and knees a few times a day. We can also look into some warm compresses to help loosen up the joints. Let me write you a recommendation for a topical cream with capsaicin, which can help with joint pain. It works by temporarily reducing pain signals. And I’ll also give you a handout with some simple exercises you can try. While we wait for the blood work results, we can see how these measures work for you. If they’re not effective, we can discuss other options, including a referral to a rheumatologist for further evaluation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good, Doctor. A rheumatologist… Is that someone else I have to see? Oh dear. But I suppose if it will help, I’ll do whatever it takes. Topical cream… and exercises. I’ll try my best. It's just… I get so discouraged sometimes. My joints are so stiff, and I feel so old. But… I appreciate you trying to help. And… thank you for explaining everything so patiently. I know I ask a lot of questions. Do you think… do you think I’ll be able to knit again? Even just a small scarf? That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Lilliana, you ask excellent questions, and I’m happy to answer them. It's important to be informed. And yes, I absolutely believe you can knit again. It may take some time and effort, and we'll need to manage your pain and stiffness, but I don't see any reason why you shouldn’t be able to enjoy that hobby again. A rheumatologist is a specialist in joint conditions. We don’t need to see one right away; let’s see how you respond to the topical cream and exercises first. If you’re not improving, then we can discuss a referral. Here’s a handout with the exercises, and the prescription for the cream. Remember, take things slow and listen to your body. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I’m here to help you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions for me today, before we wrap things up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I appreciate it more than you know. I’ll try my best to follow your instructions. And… I’ll call if I have any questions. Thank you again, Doctor Vodzak. You’ve given me a little bit of hope. And… I’m going to try to knit a small square. Just to see if I can.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Lilliana. A small square is a perfect place to start. Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. It was a pleasure meeting you today. Please don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. And I wish you all the best with your knitting! Have a good day, Lilliana.
