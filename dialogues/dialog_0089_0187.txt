DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Just… chest pain. And my heart… feels funny. Like it’s going too fast sometimes. Blood pressure is high, they said at the pharmacy. I don't like it. Get on with it, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're experiencing chest pain and a feeling of a fast heartbeat, and you were told your blood pressure was elevated. We'll get right to it. To start, can you tell me a little more about this chest pain?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to say? It hurts. Here. <points vaguely to his chest> Sometimes it’s a dull ache, sometimes it feels… tight. Like someone is squeezing. It comes and goes. Doesn't happen all the time. Mostly when I… walk fast, maybe? Or get upset. Don’t have time for details, doctor. Is it bad? Just tell me if it’s bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache or tightness, brought on by walking or stress. That’s helpful. It could be a number of things, Mr. Sobkowicz, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. It's definitely something we need to investigate. When you say it comes and goes, roughly how long does an episode of the pain usually last?
PATIENT: Last? A few minutes, maybe. Five, ten? Not long. I don’t sit around timing it, you know. I have a life. It just… happens, then it stops. It’s annoying. Very annoying. Are you going to give me a lot of tests? I don’t like tests. <frowns>
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and that tests aren't enjoyable, Mr. Sobkowicz. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. A few minutes of pain with exertion or stress is… concerning enough that we need to do some investigation, yes. Before we talk tests, let’s quickly go through some other things. Have you ever had chest pain like this before?
PATIENT: No. Never. This is new. Very new. And I don’t like new things. Especially if they hurt. Look, I’m a busy man. I used to be very important. Emergency Management, you know. Lots of responsibility. I don't have time to be sick. Just fix it. <taps his foot impatiently>
DOCTOR: Okay, new onset chest pain. That's important to know. And I appreciate you sharing your history with Emergency Management – that gives me a better understanding of your overall health and activity level. Alright, let's see… Have you had any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? Like what? I’m not a doctor! I just know my chest hurts. Maybe… sometimes I feel a little short of breath when it happens. And… maybe a little dizzy. Not a lot, just… a little off. Is that what you want to know? <rolls his eyes> Honestly, it's probably nothing. My wife worries too much.
DOCTOR: Short of breath and a little dizziness along with the chest pain… okay. It's good you're telling me everything, even if you think it's "nothing." It’s important for me to get a full picture. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical problems that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, they said at the pharmacy! Just now. Before that… I don’t know. I don’t go to doctors. Never needed to. I eat okay, I guess. My wife makes me eat vegetables. Cholesterol… no. Diabetes… no. I’m Korean, you know. We don’t get those fancy diseases. <scoffs> What’s next? Just tell me if I’m dying, doctor. I’m not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: Okay, so recently diagnosed high blood pressure. And you haven't been diagnosed with diabetes or high cholesterol. It's good you mentioned your Korean heritage, as that can sometimes be relevant to health concerns. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I don’t take pills. Never have. I don’t trust those things. My wife tries to get me to take something for my knees, but I refuse. Makes you weak, all that medicine. <shakes his head firmly> Next question. I want this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have any medical problems, like heart disease, stroke, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmph. My father… he had some heart trouble, I think. A long time ago. He died when I was young. Mother… she lived a long time, healthy as a horse. Lots of kimchi. My brother… he's okay, I guess. Works in a bank. Doesn't talk about his health. Honestly, doctor, this is a waste of my time. I’m a busy man. <leans forward impatiently>
DOCTOR: Okay, father with heart trouble. That’s helpful information. Alright, one last thing before we do a quick exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never. Disgusting habit. Alcohol… maybe a small glass of soju with dinner sometimes. Very small. And… no. Definitely no to those other things. I’m a respectable man. This is ridiculous. Just look at me! <gestures to himself dismissively> I’m healthy! <pauses, then sighs> Well, relatively. Just get it over with. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz, thank you for that information. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Then, I’ll want to check your oxygen level with a small clip on your finger. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just hurry. And be gentle! I don't want any poking and prodding. <crosses his arms and looks away> Get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 162 over 94. Your pulse is a little fast at 98 beats per minute. Your oxygen level is 96%, which is good. I hear… a slight murmur with your heart, and your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the lower left side of your chest. I’m concerned about your high blood pressure, the murmur, and the diminished breathing. Given your description of chest pain and dizziness, I think we need to rule out some more serious problems. I want to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: EKG? X-ray? More tests?! <exasperated sigh> Look, doctor, I told you, I don't like tests. Is it serious? Am I dying? Just tell me straight. I can't sit around waiting for results. I have a life, you know. <taps his foot impatiently> Fine, do the tests. But I want them done quickly. And I want the results today. Understand?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. It's not my intention to make you wait unnecessarily. An EKG and a chest X-ray will give us a better understanding of what's going on. They’re relatively quick and painless. These tests will help rule out a heart attack, arrhythmia, or pneumonia. Given your symptoms and family history, we need to be thorough. I'll have the nurse schedule those tests for you right away. While we're waiting, I'm going to prescribe a medication to help lower your blood pressure. It's important to get that under control. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. I'm Korean, remember? We're tough. Just… no pills, if possible. Can't you just tell me to eat more vegetables? Or something? But fine, do what you have to do. Just… a small dose, okay? I don't want to feel weak. What's the name of this pill? And what does it do? I want to know everything before I take it. Don't try to poison me. <narrows his eyes suspiciously>
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Sobkowicz. I would never give you anything that would harm you. The medication I'm prescribing is called Lisinopril. It’s a common blood pressure medication. It works by relaxing your blood vessels, which makes it easier for your heart to pump blood. We’ll start with a very small dose – 5 milligrams once a day. Side effects are usually mild, like a slight cough or dizziness, but if you experience anything concerning, please let me know immediately. The nurse will explain how to take it and what to watch out for. And we'll go over the results of your EKG and X-ray as soon as they're available. In the meantime, eating a healthy diet, including plenty of vegetables, is always a good idea. But given your blood pressure and symptoms, medication is important right now. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: <sighs heavily> Fine. Lisinopril. 5 milligrams. Small dose. Just… get it over with. This is a waste of my time. But… alright. Tell the nurse to hurry. I want to go home. And make sure those tests are done quickly! I have things to do. <leans forward, tapping his foot impatiently> Is there anything else? I'm really very busy, you know. This is all just… inconvenient. Stop with the questions, please. It's annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. I will have the nurse come in right away with the prescription and to schedule your tests. I understand your frustration and will do my best to make this as quick and convenient as possible. Before you go, I’m going to give you a handout with information about high blood pressure and what to expect after taking Lisinopril. And if you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness at any point, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions before I let you go?
