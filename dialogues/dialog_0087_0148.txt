DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepro. I'm Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been having some… discomfort. Down there. With… my testicles. It's rather embarrassing to talk about, but it’s been bothering me for a little while now. I don’t… I don’t really know how long, exactly. A few weeks, perhaps? It’s just… a pain. A dull ache, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stepro. It’s alright. These things happen, and we're here to help. It takes courage to come in and discuss sensitive issues. To clarify, you’re experiencing pain in the testicular region. And you said a dull ache, for approximately a few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A dull ache. It's not… sharp, thankfully. More like a constant… pressure, I suppose. And… yes, a few weeks. It's hard to be precise. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. I wish I could give you a better timeline, but it feels like it’s been… a while. It doesn't come and go, exactly. It's just… there. Most of the time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don’t have an exact timeline. A constant pressure for a few weeks is helpful information. Has anything specific made the pain worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t… I don’t think so, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t seem to be affected by anything, really. Walking doesn’t make it worse. Sitting doesn’t make it worse. I work with wood, you see. Lots of bending and lifting… but it doesn’t seem to change the pain at all. It's just… consistently there. I suppose that’s… unusual? I don't know. Perhaps if I moved a certain way it would flare up, but I haven't noticed anything specific.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Stepro. No exacerbating or alleviating factors despite your work. Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth in the area?
PATIENT: Swelling… no, I don’t believe so. Redness… no, it doesn’t look red, does it? It’s difficult for me to see, to be honest. And warmth… I haven’t really checked, I suppose. I haven’t felt it being particularly warm, but I haven’t gone out of my way to feel it either. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. Is that something I should be checking for?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Stepro. You're doing just fine. It’s good you haven’t noticed any obvious swelling or redness. And it's perfectly reasonable that you haven't specifically checked for warmth. We'll take a look. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a bit of a list, truthfully. I’m getting older, you see. I have… well, I have some arthritis, mostly in my hands. It makes my work a little difficult sometimes. And I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. I think… 1998? Perhaps 1999. It’s hard to remember exactly. I also take medication for high blood pressure. That’s… Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Other than that… I don’t… I don’t really recall anything major. It's been a long time. Do you have a record of it somewhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Stepro, the EHR confirms a history of arthritis, a cholecystectomy in 1998, and Lisinopril for hypertension. Thank you. Any family history of similar issues or other significant illnesses, such as cancer or heart disease?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had… she had some problems with her heart, I believe. She passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t have a lot of details. She was… in her sixties, I think? And my father… he had cancer, I believe. Lung cancer. He smoked, you see. A lot. Other than that… not that I recall. I wasn’t very close to my family, so I don’t have a lot of information about their medical histories. It’s… unfortunate, I suppose. I wish I knew more.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to have limited information regarding family medical history. Thank you for what you’ve shared. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have, to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. I don't think I have any major allergies, thankfully. I'm not allergic to any medications that I know of. I have a slight… sensitivity to shellfish, perhaps? It doesn't cause a severe reaction, but I sometimes get a little… indigestion. And I’m not fond of cats, but that’s more of a preference than an allergy, I suppose. I don't have any trouble with pollen or anything like that. Nothing that requires an EpiPen, certainly. I’m a fairly robust person, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Good. No known drug allergies, a mild shellfish sensitivity, and no cat allergy. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Ms. Stepro, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I would like to perform a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve me examining your abdomen and, with your permission, the testicular area. We'll need to be able to see the area, of course. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. I understand it’s necessary. It’s just… a little embarrassing, truthfully. But I trust your judgment. I suppose I should probably go to the restroom beforehand? Just to… be prepared? I’m ready when you are. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Stepro. It is a sensitive area, and you're right to be prepared. Yes, if you wouldn’t mind using the restroom before we begin, that would be helpful. There's one just down the hall. I'll give you a few moments of privacy. I’ll be right outside when you’re ready. Please just let the nurse know when you've finished.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your understanding. I’ll be right back.
