DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just…this fever keeps coming back. It’s been a real pain, honestly. Happens every few weeks, goes away for a bit, then bam, it’s back. I just want it to stop coming back, you know?
DOCTOR: “Every few weeks,” you say. And when it comes back, what exactly do you experience?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a high fever, never been over 101, I don’t think. Mostly just feel really tired, achy…like I got the flu, but not as bad. And a bit of a chill, even when it’s warm. It usually lasts two, three days, then just…goes away. It's been happening since…oh, let me think…March, maybe? Around then, anyway. I haven’t kept perfect track, if that matters.
DOCTOR: “Not perfect track.” Right. And besides the fatigue, aches, and chills, have you noticed anything else accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. Not really. No cough, no sore throat, no…rash or anything like that. My wife keeps asking if I've been eating right, but I eat the same stuff I always do. Maybe a little headache sometimes, but I get those anyway. It’s just… this cycle of feeling sick, then okay, then sick again. It’s annoying, mostly. And I’m starting to worry about what it is, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Haven't left Puerto Rico in…oh, goodness, must be ten years now. Just been here, working, trying to keep things running. No fancy vacations for this old man. Just local trips, to see family, nothing like flying anywhere.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off it a while back, said I was doing okay. I take a multivitamin sometimes, just to be safe, but that’s it. Mostly just try to rest when I feel bad, drink plenty of water. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife's the one with all the allergies, always has to read the labels, double-check everything. I just eat what's put in front of me. Lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Let’s take a look at you then. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Temperature is 99.2 Fahrenheit. Pulse is 72. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Breathing sounds are clear. Heart sounds are regular. Any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Nope. No chest pain, nothing like that. And I can breathe just fine, thank you. Gets a little winded walking up the stairs sometimes, but that's just old age, I reckon. Been working too hard, probably.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpable. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. I’m going to check your throat now. Throat is clear, no obvious signs of infection. Now, I’m going to take a look at your ears. Ears are clear as well.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good, I suppose. Everything seems… normal, huh? I just wish I knew why I keep getting sick. It's frustrating, honestly. I got things to do, you know? Can’t be laying around every few weeks feeling awful.
DOCTOR: Well, your physical exam is unremarkable. However, the recurring nature of your fever warrants further investigation. Given your lack of travel history and negative physical findings, it's unlikely to be something exotic. But we can’t rule things out without some blood work. I'm going to order a Complete Blood Count and a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to start. These will give us a baseline and help rule out any underlying infection or inflammation.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work, huh? Fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… how long will that take? And will it be expensive? I don’t have insurance, so I gotta be careful with money. Just want to get this figured out and get back to work.
DOCTOR: The lab work should take 24-48 hours to come back. As for the cost… I’ll have the lab draw a cost estimate for you. Given your uninsured status, I can also provide you with information on some local resources that may offer assistance with medical bills. It's not ideal, but we'll do what we can. In the meantime, continue to rest and hydrate when you experience these episodes. And if your fever spikes above 101, or you develop any new symptoms like a severe headache, rash, or difficulty breathing, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. Emergency room if it gets worse. Okay. And I appreciate you looking into the cost thing, Doctor. Every little bit helps. 24-48 hours… that feels like a long time when you’re feeling sick. But alright. Where do I go to get the blood drawn? And should I fast beforehand? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: You’ll need to go to the lab across the street – the address is on this requisition. Yes, you’ll need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand – no food or drink except water. The requisition also has instructions on how to prepare for the test. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… try not to take too long, Doctor. I got a business to run, you know? Thanks for your help. I'll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: Very well. Some patients… .
