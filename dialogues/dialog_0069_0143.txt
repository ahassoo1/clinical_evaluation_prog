DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, it’s a bit… complicated, I think. My… someone I care about, she wants to… have a baby. And I thought it best to… check things first. I’m not the… youngest anymore, you see. It’s good to be sure, right? I… don’t really know where to start.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. It's very responsible of you to want to get a check-up beforehand, and it's perfectly alright if it feels a bit complicated to explain. We'll take it one step at a time. So, you're interested in learning about your overall health and potential factors that might affect starting a family. That's a great starting point. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: Right, yes. That sounds… good. My health… well, I work, you know? Sales, travelling around a bit. Keeps me busy. I… I don’t get sick much, not really. Maybe a cold now and then. Nothing serious. I… used to be stronger, I think. But that was a long time ago. I… eat okay, I suppose. Not fancy. And I… try to walk when I can. Is that… enough information? I forget things easily, you see. So, if I miss something, please tell me.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Verrall, thank you. It's good you're active and generally feel well. And please don’t worry about forgetting – I'll certainly prompt you if I need anything further. To get a more complete picture, let’s go through a few things systematically. First, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High… blood pressure? I… think the doctor mentioned something about it once, a long time ago. He said to watch my salt, maybe. But I don’t… I don’t remember being told I had it. Diabetes? No, I don’t think so. Heart… no, nothing about my heart. I… had a bad knee for a while, but that’s just old age, I think. I… honestly, I can’t remember much beyond that. I don’t go to the doctor often, you see. Only when I have to. It's a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. Many people don’t see a doctor regularly, and it's common to forget details. It sounds like there might have been a mention of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, which is good to know. We’ll check that today. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… When I was a boy, I had my… tonsils out. That was a long, long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, when I was playing football. They put a cast on it. But… that's it, I think. No hospital stays, not really. Just a quick visit to get the cast on, and then again to take it off. Nothing… serious. I don’t think so, anyway. It was a very long time ago. I… sometimes my memory is like a sieve. Everything just… slips away.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Verrall. No major surgeries or hospitalizations – that’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That’s a hard one. My… my father, he had a heart problem. I think it was his heart. He… passed away when I was quite young. And my mother… she had… I don’t know… something with her stomach. She was always complaining about her stomach. But… I don’t really know what it was. They didn’t talk much about these things back then. And I… I don’t have any siblings, so I don’t have anyone to ask. It’s… a bit of a blank, really. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Verrall. It's common not to have detailed family medical history, and you're not to blame for that. Knowing about a potential heart condition in your father is helpful, though. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. My… my mother always told me it was terrible for you. And… I just never wanted to. I’ve seen what it does to people, you see. It’s a nasty habit. No, definitely not a smoker. Never have been. And I… I don't like being around people who smoke, either. Makes me cough.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Verrall. That's very good for your health. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, I… I have a glass of wine with my dinner sometimes. Not every night, but… maybe a few times a week. Just one glass. Sometimes two if it’s a special occasion. And… I used to drink more when I was younger, but I’ve cut back. It doesn't agree with me as much anymore. But… just a little bit. Nothing heavy. I… I don’t get drunk or anything. Just… to relax. Is that… okay? I hope that’s not a problem.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Verrall. Having a glass or two of wine occasionally isn’t generally a concern. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. I take a tablet for my… knees. The arthritis, you see. Just one a day. And… sometimes I take something for a headache, if I have one. Paracetamol, I think it’s called. Over-the-counter, you said? Yes, that’s right. And… no, nothing else. No supplements or anything fancy. Just the tablet for my knees, and the paracetamol when I need it. I… try to avoid taking too many pills, you see. It can’t be good for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, you're taking a medication for your arthritis and occasional paracetamol for headaches. Now, just to confirm, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s… good question. Let me think. I… I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Not that I can remember, anyway. Maybe a little bit of a runny nose sometimes when I'm around cats, but that’s not really an allergy, is it? Just a bit of… sniffles. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. I… I’m pretty lucky, I think. No allergies at all. Unless… unless something is very minor, and I just forgot. But… no, I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Verrall. No known allergies. Now, to get a better picture of your current health, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Yes, yes, that’s… fine. I suppose that’s a good idea. I haven’t had one in… well, a very long time. What will it involve? I… I don’t want anything… unpleasant. And… will it take long? I have an appointment later, you see. But… yes, go ahead. If you think it’s necessary. Just… be gentle, please? I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. We’ll take things at your pace and be as gentle as possible. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, looking in your ears and throat, and feeling your abdomen. We’ll also check your reflexes and look at your knees. It shouldn't take too long, maybe 15-20 minutes. If you could just sit on the table, we’ll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Right, yes. Fifteen minutes… that’s alright. Blood pressure first, you say? Okay. Just… tell me if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I… I don’t like surprises. And… is this cuff going to be tight? I… I have a bit of a sensitive arm, you see. Just… be careful, please? This is all a bit… overwhelming, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. I completely understand. I’ll explain everything before I do it. The cuff will be snug, but not overly tight. It will feel pressure for a moment while it inflates, and then it will release. It shouldn’t cause any discomfort, but please let me know immediately if it does. I’m just placing this cuff around your arm now. I'll ask you to relax your arm and keep it still. Take a few deep breaths. Okay… your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we may want to consider an echocardiogram to get a better look in the future.
PATIENT: A murmur? What’s a murmur? Is that… bad? I… I don't like the sound of that. Is it something serious? And… what’s an echo… echo-whatsit? You said it was likely… benign, but… what if it’s not benign? I… I’m getting a bit worried now. I… I just wanted to make sure everything was okay before… before we try for a baby. This is all a bit much.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Mr. Verrall. A murmur is simply an extra sound that’s sometimes heard when listening to the heart. It doesn’t automatically mean there’s something wrong. Many people have innocent murmurs that cause no problems at all. An echocardiogram – or echo, as we call it – is a painless test that uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart. It allows us to see the heart’s structure and how well it's functioning. It's the best way to determine if the murmur is significant. Because you're planning to start a family, it’s best to be thorough. I’m not saying there is a problem, but it’s always better to be safe, especially in your situation. I want to reassure you that most murmurs are harmless. But, just to be on the safe side, I’d recommend an echocardiogram. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An echo… yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I… I don’t want to worry… the person I care about. She’s… very excited. And… I don’t want to ruin things before they even begin. But… if you say it’s best, I’ll do it. When would this… echo test be? And… will it hurt? I… I don’t like needles, you see. And… will it take long? I have commitments, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Verrall, and I want to assure you we'll take things at your pace. The echo test doesn't involve any needles. It's completely non-invasive. A technician will apply a gel to your chest and use a small handheld device to create the images. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. We can schedule it for next week, if that works for you. Would Tuesday afternoon suit you?
PATIENT: Tuesday… yes, I think so. Tuesday afternoon would be… alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… will I need to do anything to prepare? Should I… avoid caffeine? Or… anything else? I… I don’t want to mess it up. And… will I get the results right away? Or… will I have to wait? This is all a bit… stressful, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to do anything special to prepare for the echo test. You can eat and drink as usual, and there’s no need to avoid caffeine. Just come as you are. The technician will perform the test and a cardiologist will review the images afterwards. You won’t get the results right away, unfortunately. It usually takes a couple of days for the cardiologist to write up their report. I’ll contact you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss them in detail. We’ll get this sorted out, Mr. Verrall. In the meantime, let's finish the physical exam. I just want to listen to your lungs and check your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright… yes, finish the exam. I… I just want to get this all over with, if I’m honest. Lungs and… abdomen, you say? Just… be gentle, please. And… try not to poke too much. It… makes me nervous, you see. I… I hope everything is alright. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. Gentle is my priority. Your lungs sound clear, good air entry. Now, I'm just feeling your abdomen. It’s soft and there’s no tenderness. Everything seems normal here. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Overall, you seem to be in reasonably good health, aside from the slight murmur and elevated blood pressure, which we'll investigate further with the echo and monitor. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… yes, I have questions. If the echo shows… something’s wrong with my heart… what then? Would that mean… we can’t try for a baby? And… if my blood pressure is too high, can that be fixed with… pills? I… I don’t want to take too many pills, you see. And… is there anything I can do to improve my health in the meantime? Exercise? Diet? I… I’m just trying to understand what’s going on, and what the future holds. It’s… a lot to process.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Verrall, and it’s good you're thinking about these things. Let’s address them one by one. If the echo does reveal a heart issue, it doesn’t automatically mean you can’t try for a baby. The severity of the issue would determine the best course of action. Some heart conditions are easily managed with medication and regular monitoring, allowing people to have healthy pregnancies. In other cases, we might recommend further evaluation or delaying pregnancy until the condition is stabilized. We'll cross that bridge when and if we come to it, and I'll explain everything thoroughly. Regarding your blood pressure, yes, it can often be managed with medication. However, lifestyle changes can also make a significant difference. I recommend regular exercise – at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days of the week. A healthy diet low in salt, saturated fat, and processed foods is also crucial. Losing even a small amount of weight can help lower your blood pressure. We can discuss a referral to a nutritionist if you’d like. I want to reassure you that we’ll work through this together. We’ll get the echo done, evaluate the results, and develop a plan that’s right for you. Don’t jump to conclusions before we have all the information. Do you feel any better having talked through these concerns?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. It’s… good to know there are options. And… that it’s not necessarily the end of the world. I… I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. The nutritionist… yes, a referral would be good. I… I could probably do with some help with my diet. I… I tend to eat a bit too much… comfort food, you see. I… I think that’s all my questions for now. I… I just need to process everything. And… wait for the echo test. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very patient with me. I suppose I should… go now? And wait for your call?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. It was my pleasure. I completely understand needing to process everything, and I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Yes, you should go now. I’ll arrange the referral to the nutritionist for you, and my office will contact you to schedule the echo test. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, Mr. Verrall. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll get this sorted out.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
