DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. So, you're here today... what brings you in?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t have all day. It’s my stool. It’s… dark. Black, mostly. And I take those pills, you know, for the aches. The red ones. Been taking ‘em for years. I figured it was probably that, but my daughter, bless her heart, she insisted I come in. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark stool… and you’re taking red pills for aches. Right. Those “red pills”, can you tell me the name of them?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens, names. I never remember names. They’re… NSAIDs, I think she said? Something like that. They come in a big bottle. I get ‘em from the drugstore, always have. They help my joints, you know. Arthritis, mostly. And back pain. They’re… strong. I take two every morning, sometimes more if it’s bad. Honestly, I don't see what the fuss is about. It's just… dark poo.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long have you noticed this dark stool?
PATIENT: Oh, it's been… a while. Maybe a month? A month or so. It comes and goes, you know? Not every time. Sometimes it's normal, sometimes it's… not. Honestly, I haven't been paying close attention. It's… stool. People have dark stool, don't they?
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Heavens, no! Not that I’ve seen. I would know if there was blood. I always check. It's just… dark. Like coffee grounds, my daughter said. Honestly, she reads too much on the internet. It's probably just the pills. Everything causes trouble these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, besides the dark stool and the pills, have you had any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What do you mean? I go to the bathroom when I need to go. Sometimes it’s easy, sometimes it’s… not. Old age, you know? Things don't work like they used to. Honestly, I haven't been keeping a detailed log of everything that comes out of me. Is that what you want?
DOCTOR: No, I don't need a "detailed log." But have you noticed any diarrhea, constipation, or any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Diarrhea… sometimes. Constipation… sometimes. It goes back and forth. And pain… well, my stomach aches a bit sometimes. I'm an old woman! Things ache. It’s probably just gas. Honestly, I don't think it's anything serious. It's probably just the pills, again.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Nausea… occasionally. I get a bit queasy sometimes, especially after I eat. Vomiting… not recently, no. And weight loss? I haven't weighed myself in ages. Honestly, I don’t see what any of this has to do with my stool. It’s dark. The pills are red. Isn’t that enough?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and feel your stomach. This will help me get a better idea of what's going on. And then, just to be safe, I’m going to order a stool test to check for blood, even if you haven't seen any. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A stool test? Honestly. Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do, you know. Don't take all day poking and prodding. I hope this doesn’t involve… unpleasantness. And I expect results quickly. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the examination table, please. I'll start with listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't expect miracles. I'm not exactly a spring chicken anymore. And if this involves touching my stomach, be gentle! Honestly, doctors these days...
