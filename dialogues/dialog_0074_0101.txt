DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Reisig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this headache I been havin'. Right at the back of my head, you see? Been botherin' me for a little while now. Not constant, mind you, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: I see. A headache at the back of your head that comes and goes. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it's not a sharp pain, not like a stabbing thing. More of a dull ache, really. Like someone’s tightened a band around my head. Sometimes it’s just a little niggle, other times it's enough to make me stop what I'm doin'. Usually happens in the evenin', I think. After a long day on my feet. I do a lot of work with my hands, you see, bein' a manicurist.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. So, a dull ache, sometimes a little worse, mostly in the evening after work. And you mentioned you’re a manicurist, so you use your hands quite a bit. Does anything specifically seem to trigger the headache, or make it worse – like certain movements, smells, or stress?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… sometimes when I'm really concentratin' on somethin' delicate, you know, real intricate nail art, it seems to come on quicker. And if I'm bendin' over a lot for a long time, that doesn't help either. Smells… not really. Stress, maybe a little, but I don't think it's a major factor. Just a long day, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be related to concentration and bending over, in addition to just a long day. And no significant triggers with smells or stress. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No dizziness, thankfully. And no blurry vision. Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, especially in the mornin', but I put that down to my age, to be honest. I haven't been feelin' nauseous or anything like that, and no fever. Just the headache and the occasional stiff neck.
DOCTOR: Alright. No dizziness, blurry vision, nausea, or fever, just headache and occasional stiff neck. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I've been blessed with good health, I think. Had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was under control with diet and exercise, and it’s been fine since. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of gettin' old! No major surgeries or anything like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. High blood pressure managed with diet and exercise is excellent. And I understand the aches and pains of getting older! Are you currently taking any medications for anything, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my joints sometimes, when they're botherin' me. Ibuprofen, you know? The regular kind. Not every day, just when I need it. And that's about it. Oh! And sometimes a little bit of liniment rub on my neck, but that's more for comfort, really. Not a medication, per se.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for your joints and liniment rub on your neck. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental things?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had one in my life, touch wood. I can eat anything, breathe anything, no problems at all. My wife always jokes I’ve got a cast iron stomach!
DOCTOR: That's wonderful! No allergies is excellent. Now, to get a better understanding of things, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes and sensation. We'll also feel your neck and head. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I haven't got anything to hide! Let me know if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 140 over 90. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal, sensation is intact, and coordination appears good. There's some mild tenderness in the muscles at the base of his skull and in his upper neck, but no significant swelling or masses. Everything seems generally normal, but the tenderness in your neck muscles is notable. It sounds like you may be experiencing what we call a tension headache, likely related to the strain from your work and potentially the mild elevation in blood pressure.
PATIENT: A tension headache, you say? That sounds about right, I suppose. I do spend a lot of time hunched over. So, what do we do about it, Doctor? Is there anything I can take, or anything I should be doin'? I don't want it gettin' worse.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. For a tension headache like this, we can try a few things. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, which you already use, can be helpful, but we should be mindful of using them too frequently. We can also explore some non-medication options. Heat packs or a warm bath can help relax the muscles in your neck and shoulders. Gentle stretching exercises throughout the day can also be beneficial. And it's important to maintain good posture while you're working. I'm also going to recommend that we monitor your blood pressure regularly at home. You can purchase a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Keeping a log of your readings will help us see if it's consistently elevated and if we need to consider further investigation. Would you be comfortable trying these approaches for the next few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very sensible, Doctor. I can certainly try that. Heat, stretches, keep an eye on my posture… and get a blood pressure monitor. No problem at all. How often should I be checkin' my blood pressure, and what sort of numbers should I be lookin' for? I don't want to worry unnecessarily if it's a little high sometimes. I know I get a bit anxious at the doctor's office!
DOCTOR: That’s a very good point about being anxious at the office – it can definitely elevate your blood pressure temporarily! Ideally, check your blood pressure at home twice a day – once in the morning and once in the evening – for a week. Try to relax for five minutes before each reading. A normal blood pressure is generally considered to be less than 120/80 mmHg. Readings between 120/80 and 139/89 mmHg are considered elevated, and readings of 140/90 mmHg or higher are considered high. If your readings are consistently above 140/90 mmHg, or if you experience any symptoms like severe headache, vision changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please contact me immediately. Otherwise, keep a log of your readings and bring it with you to your next appointment. Does that sound manageable for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly manageable. Twice a day, mornin' and evenin', keep a log... and watch out for the high numbers and any other symptoms. I can do that, no problem. I appreciate you explainin' it so clearly, Doctor. It puts my mind at ease a bit. When should I book my next appointment? Just to check on things, you think?
DOCTOR: I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease. Yes, let's schedule a follow-up appointment in about four weeks to review your blood pressure log and see how you’re responding to these measures. That will give you enough time to get a good baseline reading and see if the lifestyle changes are making a difference. We can also discuss any other concerns you might have at that time. My receptionist can schedule that for you before you leave. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. Four weeks gives me plenty of time. Yes, please ask the receptionist to book me in for then. Thank you very much for your time and for explainin' everything so clearly. I feel much better now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. I’m happy to help. Remember, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in four weeks.
PATIENT: It was lovely meetin' you too, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I will certainly keep that in mind, and I'll see you in four weeks. Have a good day now!
