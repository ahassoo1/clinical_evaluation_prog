DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is… nice to meet you as well. Hmm. What brings me in… yes. It is… the words. They do not come so easily now. It is difficult, you see. I… I forget them. Or, not forget, exactly. They are… there, but not on my tongue. It is frustrating, yes.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite frustrating, indeed. So, you're experiencing difficulty finding the right words… has this been a sudden change, or has it been developing gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Yes, gradually. It was… small things at first. Misplacing a word here or there. Like… like when you know the name of something, but it is on the tip of your tongue. You understand? But now… it is more often. And sometimes… sometimes I struggle to even… explain what I mean. It is not… sudden, no. It has been… months, perhaps? A long time, yes.
DOCTOR: Months, okay. And it’s been progressively getting worse, you said. Do you notice any particular times of day when it’s worse, or any situations that seem to trigger it more?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. Let me think… No, not really a time of day. Not that I have noticed, anyway. But… when I am tired, it is worse. Definitely worse. And… if I am trying to explain something complicated… something with many details… then the words… they hide. Yes, hide. When I am relaxed, talking about… simple things… it is easier. Much easier.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and complexity seem to be factors. Have you noticed any changes in your memory besides the difficulty with words?
PATIENT: Memory… That is… a difficult question. I do… sometimes forget where I put things. Keys, mostly. And… names. I forget names of people I have met. But… I do not think that is new. I have always been… not so good with names. It is the words that are the problem, you see? Not… remembering events. I remember my wife… I remember… many things. It is just… expressing them now.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. So, primarily the difficulty is with finding the words, not necessarily with recalling events or memories themselves. Okay. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if that's alright. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Ask away. Let me see… I have… high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take pills for it. And… my knees. They are… not so good. Arthritis, they say. But… that is all, I think. Nothing else that I can remember. Oh! And… I wear glasses, of course. For reading. Yes, reading. That is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, arthritis in the knees, and you wear reading glasses. Do you know what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a good question. My wife… she always handled the pills. She knew everything. Now… I see a little white pill. And… a little blue one. I take them every morning. I do not know the name, no. I apologize. It is… embarrassing, I know.
DOCTOR: Don’t apologize at all, Sherrell. It’s very common for patients to not remember medication names. We can look it up in our system if you don’t mind. And just to be sure, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Not that I know of. I have taken many pills in my life… for headaches, for colds… and never had a reaction. No, no allergies. And… yes, please look up the pills. That would be… very helpful. I appreciate it. It is just… after my wife… everything is… a little muddled.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you're taking Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide for your blood pressure. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Li… Lisinopril? Hydro… yes, that sounds… right. Yes, I think so. My wife… she would know for sure. But… yes, those names sound familiar. Yes, I believe that is correct. Thank you. That is… a relief.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any family members who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she was… a little forgetful in her old age. Not so much dementia, I do not think. Just… misplacing things, forgetting names. Like me, yes. But… no one else, I do not think. My father was very… sharp. Always remembering everything. And… my siblings… they are all… fine. Healthy, as far as I know. Nothing… serious, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some forgetfulness in your mother, but no other significant neurological conditions in the family. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… I live alone, now. After my wife… it is quiet. I try to… stay active. I walk in the park most days. Not a long walk, but… enough. I read a lot. And… I watch television. Mostly news. I do not… socialize much. Not anymore. It is difficult, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and you're doing your best to stay active despite everything. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just a quick neurological assessment, and I’ll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That is… fine. A physical exam. Yes. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I… I just want to know what is happening. Why the words… escape me. Yes. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that’s not uncommon. Your reflexes and coordination seem normal, and your facial symmetry is good. You repeated the phrase correctly, although a little slowly. Now, let's move on to recalling those three words I asked you to remember: apple, table, pencil. Do you recall them?
PATIENT: Apple… yes. I remember apple. And… table. Yes, table. But… the third one… It is on the tip of my tongue… something… wooden? Used for… writing? Oh dear. It escapes me. I apologize. I try… but it is gone.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Sherrell. It’s not a test, just an assessment. You remembered apple and table, which is good. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some cognitive changes, specifically with word finding and short-term memory. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation. It could be a number of things, including normal age-related changes, stress, or a mild cognitive impairment. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing. And I also think it would be beneficial to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, alright. That makes sense. Rule out… other causes. And… a neurologist? A specialist? Yes, alright. If you think that is best. I… I just want to know what is happening. To understand. Yes. A neurologist. And blood tests. That sounds… reasonable. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get the lab orders sent over to the front desk, and they’ll schedule you for those. I'll also prepare a referral for a neurologist – Dr. Anya Sharma is very good. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, it’s important to stay mentally active – continue reading, walking, and engaging in activities you enjoy. And if you notice any sudden changes in your condition, or if you become more confused or disoriented, please contact me right away. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Stay active… and contact you if things worsen. Yes. I understand. I… I appreciate your kindness. It is… reassuring to know someone is taking this seriously. No, no questions at this time. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and I’ll be here to support you along the way. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. If you need anything at all, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
