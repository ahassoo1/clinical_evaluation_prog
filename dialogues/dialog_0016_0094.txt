DOCTOR: Hi Airam, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. The…paper said something about…learning? I don’t really remember. My husband, he made the appointment. Something about…making sure I know things. I work with metal, you see. It’s…loud. My ears sometimes ring.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your husband scheduled this appointment for a general check-up, potentially related to your work environment and the noise exposure. It’s good he’s thinking ahead about your health. And yes, working with metal and being exposed to loud noises can definitely affect your hearing. Let me just pull up your information here…Okay, Airam Fontanazza, age 33. It doesn't seem like there’s much detail in the system right now. That’s alright, we'll fill that in together. To start, can you tell me a little more about this ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing…yes. It’s…not all the time. Mostly after a long day at the shop. Like, when I’m trying to sleep. It’s…high pitched. Annoying. Like a little mosquito buzzing, but inside my head. My husband says I should get it checked, but I…I don’t know. It’s always been that way, a little bit. Just worse sometimes. I don’t see what a doctor can do about a buzz in my ear.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's frustrating when something like that has been going on for a while. It sounds like you've been dealing with tinnitus – that buzzing or ringing sound – for some time, and it's worse after work. It's good your husband is encouraging you to get it checked. While we can't always cure tinnitus, it's important to rule out any underlying causes and make sure it's not getting worse. We also want to discuss ways to manage it, to help improve your quality of life. Okay, so tinnitus, worse after work, high-pitched. Has this been a gradual change, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual…I think. It’s…hard to say. It’s been so long. When I started at the shop, it was a little bit. Now…it’s just more noticeable. Everything is louder, I guess. Not just the buzz. Like, the TV. My husband complains I turn it up too loud. He says I’m ruining his hearing. He’s…sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started when you began working at the shop and has been gradually worsening over time. And you've also noticed that sounds in general seem louder to you now. That's helpful information. It’s good your husband has noticed too, that indicates a change. Have you noticed any dizziness, pressure in your ears, or any pain along with the ringing and increased sound sensitivity?
PATIENT: Dizziness…sometimes. Not spinning, exactly. More like…off balance. When I stand up too fast. Or…when I’ve been working a long time. Pressure…no, not really. Maybe…a little bit after a really loud day. Like, when we’re cutting thick metal. But pain, no. Never any pain. Just…annoying. Really annoying. It makes it hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional dizziness, feeling off-balance especially when standing quickly or after long work days, and a little bit of pressure in your ears after particularly loud days. No pain. And the main issue is the annoyance and difficulty concentrating. That gives me a clearer picture. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your ears, balance, and overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Uh…fine. I guess so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I need to get back. My husband…he’s waiting. He doesn’t like me being gone too long. He worries. What exactly are you going to do?
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. It won’t take long, I promise. I’m going to take a quick look inside your ears with this instrument, called an otoscope, just to make sure there’s nothing obvious causing the problem. Then I’ll use this tuning fork to test your hearing response. We’ll also quickly check your balance and reflexes. It’s all very straightforward, and shouldn't be uncomfortable. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Okay…fine. As long as you’re gentle. My ears…they’re sensitive. I don’t like things poking around in there. My husband says I’m a baby, but…it just feels weird. Do you have to put anything in my ears?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s perfectly alright to feel anxious about that. And you are not a baby! It’s good to be aware of your sensitivities. I'll be very gentle. The otoscope has a light and a small speculum - that's the cone-shaped part - that goes just into the opening of your ear canal, but it doesn't go in very far at all. I'm just looking at the eardrum and the ear canal. The tuning fork will be held near your ear – nothing will be in your ear with that one. We can go slowly, and if anything feels uncomfortable, you just let me know, and we'll stop immediately. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay…slowly sounds good. Near my ear is okay. Not in my ear. I don’t like things in my ears. My husband…he once tried to clean them with one of those little…scoops. It hurt. Very bad. He said he was being helpful, but…I yelled. Just…be careful.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Your husband's attempt at cleaning your ears sounds very unpleasant, and it’s definitely best to leave that to professionals, and even then, usually we don't use those scoops unless absolutely necessary. I promise I won't do anything like that. Okay, let’s start with the ears. I’m just going to gently look inside with this instrument. It will be quick. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. I’ll start with the right ear, okay?
PATIENT: Okay…right ear. Be quick. And…don’t poke! Hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, just taking a quick look… I see a little bit of cerumen – that’s earwax – but nothing significant. Your eardrum looks…slightly retracted, meaning it's pulled in a little bit. It’s also a little bit dull in color. No signs of infection. And now the left ear… Similar findings – some cerumen, slightly retracted eardrum, also a little bit dull. Okay, all done with the ears. Nothing alarming, but the retracted eardrums and dull color are something we'll want to keep an eye on. Now, let’s do a quick hearing test with this tuning fork. I’m going to tap it and hold it near your ear. Just tell me when you can no longer hear the sound. Sound good?
PATIENT: Okay…tapping sounds…fine. Near my ear, you said? Don’t hit me with it! My husband once…never mind. Just…don’t hit me. And don’t take too long. I have to make dinner.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not! I promise I won’t hit you with it! It’s just a gentle tap to create a sound. Okay, close your eyes and tell me when you can no longer hear the sound. …Do you hear it?
PATIENT: Yes…I hear it. It’s…a ringing. Like a little…buzz. Wait…no. It stopped. It stopped a few seconds ago. It’s quiet now. See? I told you I have ringing in my ears. It’s always there, sort of. It just…comes and goes. And it makes it hard to hear things. Especially when it’s quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, you heard the initial sound, but then your tinnitus took over, making it difficult to hear anything else. Let’s try the other ear. Close your eyes again, and let me know when you can no longer hear the sound. …Do you hear it?
PATIENT: Yes…I hear it. Faint. Like a…distant mosquito. Wait…no. Gone. It’s the buzzing again. Always the buzzing. It’s worse when I’m tired. Or…stressed. My husband is very…demanding. It’s gone now. Just the buzzing. Can we be done now? I really need to make dinner. He likes it hot.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful information. So similar findings on both ears – you heard the sound initially, but your tinnitus quickly masked it. It sounds like stress and fatigue definitely make it worse. Yes, we can absolutely be done with the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing tinnitus, possibly exacerbated by noise exposure at work and stress. The slightly retracted eardrums could indicate some Eustachian tube dysfunction, which means the pressure in your middle ear isn't equalizing properly. It could also be a sign of fluid buildup, but we'd need further testing to confirm that. Would you be open to doing a hearing test, or a tympanometry – that tests the function of your middle ear – to get a clearer picture of what’s going on?
PATIENT: Testing…more testing? I really don’t like tests. And my husband…he wants dinner. Hot dinner. Maybe…maybe it’s just the buzzing. I’ve always had it. It’s just…worse lately. Can’t I just…take something for it? Something to make the buzzing stop? I don’t want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: I understand. You're right, you’ve been dealing with this for a while, and it's frustrating to have it worsen. And I completely respect that you don’t want to spend all day here. There are some things we can try to manage the tinnitus, even without a definitive diagnosis. Unfortunately, there isn't a "cure" for tinnitus, but there are strategies that can help you cope with it. We could try some relaxation techniques to help with the stress, and I can recommend some white noise apps or machines that can mask the buzzing sound and make it less noticeable, especially at night. There are also some over-the-counter supplements, like zinc or magnesium, that some people find helpful, although the evidence is limited. I'm going to write up a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication, as stress seems to be a major trigger for you. This might help you relax and cope with the buzzing. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to see if it's helping. If it's not, we can revisit the idea of the hearing test. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Medication…okay. If it helps me relax. My husband gets…upset when I’m stressed. Very upset. And if it lets me sleep…that would be good. A month…okay. Just…not a very long appointment. Can I get the prescription now? And can you write down those…white noise things? For me to remember. I forget easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'm happy to write up a prescription for you. It's a low dose, just to help take the edge off. And I completely understand – it's perfectly alright to forget things. Here's your prescription – you can take it to any pharmacy. And here’s a list of some white noise apps and machines. I also wrote down the contact information for a tinnitus support group, in case you’d like to connect with others who are experiencing similar issues. We've scheduled a follow-up appointment for one month from today. If you experience any side effects from the medication, or if your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No…I think that’s everything. Thank you. For the…buzzing things. And for not making me take too many tests. My husband will be happy I’m home. He likes his dinner hot. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Airam. I’m glad I could help, and I hope the medication and the relaxation techniques make a difference. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And please, enjoy your dinner! Have a good day. .
