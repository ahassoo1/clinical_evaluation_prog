DOCTOR: Hi Sherion, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Is okay to call you Doctor Yoshino? I have… pain here. <points to chest> Not all the time, but it’s… worry me a little. It’s been happening for maybe… three days now?
DOCTOR: Yes, please do call me Doctor Yoshino. Okay, chest pain, I understand. And it's been happening for about three days. Can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s not… sharp pain. More like… pressure? Like someone is sitting on my chest, but not really sitting. And it comes and goes. When I walk a little, it gets worse. When I sit and rest, it’s… better. Not gone, just… less. Is that make sense? I worry it’s my heart. My husband, he says I worry too much. But still…
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Sherion. Pressure is a good way to describe it. And the fact that it gets worse with walking and better with rest is important information. It's good you’re taking it seriously, and it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about your heart, especially with that description. I see here you’ve had Medicare for a few years, and your height and weight are noted. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I have… the high blood pressure. The doctor, back home, he told me about it. I take the pills every day. Little white pills. And… sometimes my ankles swell up. Not always, just when it’s very hot, maybe. And… oh! My knees! They bother me a lot, especially in the morning. Is that important? I don't know if that's for the chest pain though.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, that's definitely important, and good that you’re taking medication for it. Swelling in the ankles and knee pain are also good things to mention. They could be related, or they might be separate issues. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a good question. I just ask the pharmacy for more when I run out. It’s a little white pill, like I said. I think… it starts with an ‘A’? Maybe ‘Amlodipine’? Is that right? I’m not good with remembering names. My husband, he does all the remembering. I just know to take it with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine is a very common blood pressure medication, so that sounds right! And don't worry about not remembering the names, that’s perfectly alright. We can double-check it with the pharmacy records if needed. Okay, so we have high blood pressure managed with Amlodipine, ankle swelling, and knee pain. Now, let's go back to the chest pain for a moment. Have you ever had this type of pain before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I have… sometimes a little heartburn. But that’s different. That’s more… burning. This is… heavy. Like a weight. And it’s… scary. It makes me feel tired, even when I haven't done anything. It started after I helped my daughter move some boxes. Not heavy boxes, but… a lot of them. I wonder if that had something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is new chest pain, different from heartburn, and it started a few days after helping your daughter move boxes. That's helpful information. It's good you're recognizing that it is different. Feeling tired with it is also important to note. To get a better understanding, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel around your chest a little. Just to see if we can narrow down what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. My husband, he always says I worry too much, but… I want to make sure everything is okay. It's just… this pain is worrying me. <nods head slowly> Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion. That's very good of you. Let's get started. Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me… and let it out slowly. Another one… good. I'm hearing some normal heart sounds, no murmurs that I can detect right now. Lungs are clear as well. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. That’s a bit higher than we’d like, even considering you’re here at the clinic. And just feeling your chest, there's no tenderness to the touch. Everything seems okay so far, but based on what you’ve told me and this initial exam, I'd like to run a few tests to get a better picture of what's going on. Would you be okay with an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart?
PATIENT: EKG and… X-ray? Is that… safe? I don’t like too much radiation. My neighbor, she had a lot of X-rays, and she… well, never mind. But is it necessary? Is the pain… serious? I'm getting a little nervous now. Maybe it's just my blood pressure? Should I just take more pills?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the radiation, Sherion. That’s a very valid question. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very low, and the benefits of getting a clear picture of your heart and lungs far outweigh the small risk. We take precautions to minimize exposure as much as possible. And to answer your other question, it's possible this is just related to your blood pressure, but because the pain is new and feels like pressure, and it's triggered by activity, we need to rule out anything more serious. An EKG and X-ray will help us do that. They are routine tests and take only a few minutes. We definitely don’t want to just increase your medication without knowing why you’re having this pain. It’s important to find the root cause. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. You say it’s not much radiation. And you want to find out why… Yes, that makes sense. I don’t want to just take more pills. Okay, then. Yes, I’ll do the tests. But… will it hurt? I don’t like needles. And what if… what if something is really wrong? My husband, he will worry so much.
DOCTOR: That's very good of you, Sherion. I'm glad you're willing to go ahead with the tests. The EKG is completely painless. We just put some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs and connect them to a machine that reads your heart’s electrical activity. There are no needles involved at all. The X-ray involves standing in front of a machine for a few seconds. It doesn't hurt, but you'll need to remain very still. I understand your worry about something being wrong, and it’s natural to be concerned. We'll take things one step at a time. I'll be here to explain everything to you clearly, and we'll discuss the results as soon as they’re available. And we will keep your husband informed as well, if that’s what you’d like. Let's just get these tests done first, and then we'll have a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… yes. No needles, that’s good. And you will tell me everything. And my husband… yes, please tell him. He worries too much, but… he needs to know. Okay, let’s do the tests. Where do we go? I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have to make dinner for my daughter tonight. She’s been working very hard.
DOCTOR: Wonderful, Sherion. I’m glad we’re on the same page. Just down the hall, to your left. The technician, Maria, is expecting you. She’ll explain everything again and get you started with the EKG first. After that, she'll take you for the X-ray. It shouldn’t take more than 20-30 minutes total. I’ll be right here in the office, reviewing your chart and preparing for your results. As soon as they're available, I’ll come and get you, and we'll discuss them together. Don’t hesitate to let Maria or me know if you have any questions at all. You’re doing great. Let’s get this done, and then we can figure out what’s going on and get you back to making dinner for your daughter.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. <nods slowly, then starts walking down the hallway towards the technician> I hope Maria is nice. And I hope the tests don't take too long. Dinner is at six! <mumbles to herself as she walks away>
