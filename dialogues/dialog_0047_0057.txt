DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Press. It's... about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you about it. It's been a little hard to understand everything, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… concerning to hear you've been told about cancer without a proper consultation. Let's start at the beginning. Who told you this, and what exactly did they say?
PATIENT: Um... it was a nurse, back at the hospital. She was going over some test results with my husband… before he passed. She said something about a spot, and needing to see an oncologist. I didn’t really… grasp it all at the time, and then… well, things happened very quickly after that. I just remember the word "cancer" and knowing it wasn't good. I don't know what kind of spot, or where it was, exactly.
DOCTOR: I see. That's… less than ideal communication on their part, frankly. It’s never acceptable to deliver news like that without a doctor present to explain things thoroughly. Alright. Let's try to piece this together. Do you have any records from the hospital visit with your husband?
PATIENT: I do, actually. I brought a folder with all the papers. It's a bit messy, I'm sorry. Everything felt… overwhelming after he was gone. It’s in here somewhere…
DOCTOR: Please, take your time. Just put it wherever you're comfortable. We'll sort through it together. I'll pull up your file on the computer here as well, see what the clinic already has documented. Now, while you're finding that, can you just tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Okay. As for my health… I generally feel okay. I try to eat healthy, when I can. I walk a bit, but it's been harder since… well, you know. I don't have any major problems, usually. Just… tired, sometimes. A lot of the time, actually. It could just be from everything, though. Is that… helpful? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: “Fatigue.” Right. And you said you eat healthy when you can. Any specific dietary restrictions or allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no restrictions or allergies. I just… sometimes don’t have the energy to cook. It's easier to grab something quick, even if it’s not the best for me. Nothing serious, really. I don’t drink or smoke, if that matters. My husband… he used to smoke, but he quit years ago.
DOCTOR: No alcohol or tobacco use. Good. Now, any significant medical history on your side of the family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… something with her stomach, I think. She was sick for a long time. And my uncle… he had diabetes. But other than that, not really. My mother was very healthy, until… until the very end. It was quick. A heart attack. I don’t know much about the specifics, to be honest. We didn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you yourself, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, never. Aside from the usual things, like colds and the flu. I broke my arm when I was a child, but it healed fine. I've always been pretty healthy, I thought. That’s why this whole thing is so… confusing. Is it possible they made a mistake? About the cancer, I mean.
DOCTOR: Mistakes happen, of course, but we won’t jump to conclusions. Let’s focus on getting the facts. Now, let’s see if we can locate these test results. You mentioned a nurse discussed them with you…do you recall what kind of test it was?
PATIENT: I… I think it was a scan. A body scan. She said something about looking for… something inside. It was a big machine, and I had to lie very still. And they gave me something to drink beforehand. It was… chalky. That's about all I remember. I wish I could be more helpful. This folder is full of bills and appointment reminders, but not much else.
DOCTOR: A scan… Right. Well, let's see if we can find anything in your electronic record. Ah, here we are. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, performed July 15th at St. Jude’s Hospital. The report indicates… a small mass was identified on your left adrenal gland. It’s… inconclusive. Further investigation is needed.
PATIENT: Adrenal gland? Where… where is that, exactly? And what does "inconclusive" mean? Is that… bad? I don't understand any of this medical language. I just… I wish someone would explain it to me like a person, not a textbook. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: The adrenal glands are small organs located on top of your kidneys. They produce hormones. As for “inconclusive,” it means the scan showed something, but we can’t determine from the scan alone what it is. It could be benign – harmless. It could be something more serious. That’s why we need further testing. And yes, you are right, it is frustrating when doctors use jargon. So, the next step is an MRI to get a clearer picture, and likely a referral to an endocrinologist - a hormone specialist. Does that make more sense?
PATIENT: MRI… and a… endocrinologist. So, more tests. More waiting. Will the MRI… will it tell me what it is? If it’s… the cancer? And what happens if it is cancer? What are the… options? I know I'm asking a lot of questions. It's just… it’s a lot to take in. And I’m doing this alone now.
DOCTOR: The MRI will give us a much clearer picture of the mass, its size, and its characteristics. As for what happens if it is cancer… that depends entirely on the type of cancer, its stage, and your overall health. There are many different treatments available – surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy… It’s too early to discuss those specifics. Frankly, we haven’t even confirmed a diagnosis yet. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We will take one step at a time. First, the MRI. I will write you a referral order now. And I'll arrange for the radiology department to call you to schedule the appointment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… acceptable. One step at a time. How long… how long will it take to get the results from the MRI? And… is there anyone I can talk to about this? Someone who can… explain things in a way I understand? It’s hard to…process everything on my own.
DOCTOR: The MRI results typically take 24-48 hours to be reviewed by the radiologist. Once I have the report, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings. As for someone to "explain things," I am your doctor, and I will do my best to answer your questions. However, my time is limited. I can provide you with a list of resources – websites and support groups – but I cannot guarantee individual counselling sessions. Now, let me print out the referral order, and we can wrap this up. And please try not to worry unduly until we have definitive results. It could very well be nothing.
PATIENT: Nothing… right. Thank you, Doctor. I understand. I won’t take up any more of your time. Just… please let me know when I can schedule the MRI.
DOCTOR: Here you are. The radiology department will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. And as I said, please try to remain calm. Now, if there's nothing further, I have other patients waiting.
