DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, well. It’s about my bruising, really. I’ve been… noticing more of it lately. It’s ridiculous, frankly. I’m on that blood thinner, you know, Warfarin… or whatever it’s called. And I just seem to bump into things now and then, and then boom, a purple mess. It's getting old, I tell you. And I don't even feel the bumps sometimes. It’s very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I see. So, increased bruising, particularly since starting Warfarin, and sometimes occurring with minimal trauma, even without recalling a significant bump. That’s helpful to know. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It wasn’t right when I started the medication, no. It took… maybe six months? It was subtle at first, just a little more discoloration than usual after a knock. But it’s definitely gotten worse in the last few months, the last… three, perhaps? I can’t be precise. Honestly, I don’t spend my days cataloging every little bruise. I have better things to do. And my wife… well, she always took care of those sorts of things. It's just been me since… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you aren’t tracking it meticulously; we'll do our best to figure things out. So, it sounds like the bruising was initially mild and has progressively worsened over the last three months. Now, where are you typically noticing these bruises?
PATIENT: Well, mostly on my arms, you know, the forearms especially. And my legs, shins mostly. I do seem to whack them on things. Not intentionally, of course. And… sometimes on my hands. It's not like I’m going around getting into fights or anything! It’s just… there. I haven't noticed any… on my face, thankfully. That would be embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily on your arms and legs, with occasional bruising on your hands. No facial bruising, which is good. And you haven’t noticed any bruising appearing for no apparent reason at all – always associated with some sort of bump or minor injury, even if you don't recall a significant one?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. No, I suppose not completely without reason. Though sometimes I swear I don’t remember touching anything. But… no, I can’t honestly say I’ve woken up with a bruise and no idea how it got there. Not that I recall, anyway. It’s just… they seem to come easier now, that’s what bothers me.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. It’s good that you can usually associate them with some minor trauma, even if you don’t fully remember it. It’s also understandable that you’re concerned about them appearing more easily. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Well, I've been feeling… a little more tired lately, perhaps. But honestly, who doesn't feel tired? I'm not exactly a spring chicken anymore. And… my gums bleed a little when I brush my teeth, but that's happened on and off for years. I always figured it was just… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increased fatigue and a tendency for your gums to bleed, which you've experienced on and off for some time. Fatigue can have many causes, so we'll want to investigate that further. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides the reason you’re on Warfarin?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I have… atrial fibrillation. That's why I'm on the Warfarin, to begin with. My heart… it flutters sometimes. The doctor said it could cause a stroke if I didn’t take the medication. And… I had my prostate removed a few years back. Nothing serious now, just… regular check-ups. And high blood pressure, but that's controlled with medication. I used to be very active, you know. But… things change.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information. Atrial fibrillation, a history of prostatectomy, and controlled hypertension. That gives me a clearer picture. And just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries other than your prostate removed?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, I suppose. A very long time ago. And… I had a hernia repaired, oh, maybe twenty years ago? It wasn't a big deal. That's all I can think of, really. Nothing recent. And no major illnesses, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and hernia repair in the past. Good to know. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take… Lisinopril, for the blood pressure. And… Atorvastatin, for the cholesterol. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for aches and pains, but not very often. That's about it, I think. A small dose of Vitamin D, but that’s just what the doctor recommended for everyone, practically. Honestly, keeping track of all these pills is a nuisance.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright; it can be a lot to manage. So, Lisinopril, Atorvastatin, occasional Tylenol, and Vitamin D. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My wife used to worry about that, always asking me if I was allergic to something before I ate anything new. But I've always been fine. No hives, no swelling, nothing. I might be a little sensitive to shellfish, but it just gives me a stomach ache, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies, and a possible mild sensitivity to shellfish. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my father had heart disease. That's probably why I ended up with this atrial fibrillation, honestly. And my mother… she had diabetes, later in life. And… my brother had high blood pressure, like me. Nothing too exciting, really. No cancers or anything like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. That's helpful to know. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I’m retired now, so I don't have a stressful job anymore, thank goodness. I live alone since… well, you know. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, but I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I don’t smoke, never have. And I used to be very active, played golf regularly, but my knees aren't what they used to be. I walk a little bit, but not much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Retired, living alone, healthy diet with occasional wine, no smoking, and reduced activity due to knee issues. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Mr. Farson. It gives me a very good overview of your health. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if that's alright with you. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and examining your skin to look at the bruising. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Go ahead. The sooner we figure this out, the better. It’s just… worrying, you know? And I'd like to get back to… well, to things.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/85, which is consistent with your history of hypertension, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your heart rhythm is irregular, as expected with atrial fibrillation. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look at the bruising on your arms. I see several bruises in various stages of healing. Some are newer, reddish-purple in color, while others are older and more yellowish. They don’t appear to be causing any significant pain or swelling. And I don’t see any signs of internal bleeding. No tenderness to palpation. Based on your history and the physical examination, it appears the increased bruising is likely related to the Warfarin, especially given the mild trauma associated with their appearance. The fatigue and gum bleeding could also be related, though we’ll need to investigate further. We should also rule out any other potential causes of bruising. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a coagulation panel to assess your overall blood health and your Warfarin levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. A blood test… fine. Just get to the bottom of this. I don’t want to end up looking like a plum.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. We'll get to the bottom of this. The lab results will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. I'll also write you a prescription for a multivitamin, as fatigue can sometimes be related to vitamin deficiencies. While we're waiting for the lab results, I would recommend avoiding any activities that could lead to injury, even minor bumps or scrapes. And if you do happen to experience any significant pain, swelling, or bleeding, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… how long will the tests take? And will they be painful?
DOCTOR: The blood test will only take a few minutes, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. You likely won’t even feel the needle. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back, so we should have them by Thursday at the latest. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action, which may involve adjusting your Warfarin dosage. In the meantime, I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment for Thursday to review the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Thursday is fine. That gives me something to… focus on, I suppose. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Farson. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and provide you with any necessary paperwork. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Farson.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, you too, Doctor. Goodbye.
