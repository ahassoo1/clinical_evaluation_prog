DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s…it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having trouble…going. It’s not easy, you see. Not easy at all. It takes me a while, and sometimes I just…can’t.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Yadao. You're experiencing difficulty with urination – it takes effort and sometimes you're unable to go. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It started…oh, maybe a month ago? It’s not sudden, thankfully. It just…gotten worse slowly. I find I have to…push, quite a bit. And sometimes, even after pushing, it's just a little trickle. It's very frustrating, and a little worrying, to be honest. I always went normally before this. Perfectly normally.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset about a month ago, requiring you to push to urinate, and sometimes only a small amount comes out. And this is a change from your usual pattern of urination. Have you noticed any pain or burning during urination?
PATIENT: No, no burning at all. That’s good, isn’t it? It doesn’t hurt while I’m going, just…the effort to start is the problem. And afterwards, I don't feel empty, like there's still some left. It's a strange feeling. I do have to get up during the night more often now too, maybe two or three times. But that could just be getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no pain or burning during urination, just difficulty initiating the stream, a sensation of incomplete emptying, and you’ve noticed an increase in nighttime urination. Two to three times a night, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Two or three times. Sometimes just once, but more often it’s two or three. I used to sleep right through, you know? Not a stir. Now, I’m up and…well, trying to go. It’s not always successful, which is the worst part. I drink a normal amount of fluids, I think. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, not that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you tell me about any past medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years ago? And I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Oh, and my knees aren’t so good, arthritis. But nothing else, really. No major illnesses. I have Medicare, if that’s helpful. And I go to the Lithuanian church every Sunday, if that matters. I'm pretty healthy otherwise, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of gallbladder removal about thirty years ago, pneumonia in the past, and arthritis in your knees. No other significant medical history. Thank you. Are you currently taking any medications for your arthritis or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I do take something for the arthritis. It's called…let me see…Naproxen. Just one a day, usually. Sometimes two if my knees are really bothering me. And that’s it. Nothing else. Just the Naproxen. I get it filled at the pharmacy down the street. They know me well there!
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen as needed for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. My grandmother made wonderful dumplings, and I ate plenty of those! Never any trouble. No allergies at all, that I’m aware of. I don't even have sensitivities to pollen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… My mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father, he had…well, he just got old, really. Lots of aches and pains, but no specific illnesses. My sister is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. She lives in Chicago. No one in my family had any trouble with their…waterworks, if that’s what you mean. No, not that I remember. It's a good question, though. My grandfather smoked a lot, but that was a long time ago. I always stayed away from cigarettes, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of high blood pressure in your mother, and generally good health in the rest of the family. No known urinary issues. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…Well, I live alone. I keep busy. I go to church every Sunday, like I said. I do a little gardening when the weather is nice. I read a lot – mostly Lithuanian history books, to be honest. I don't smoke, never have. I drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not every night. I don't do much strenuous exercise, my knees aren’t good for that. I mostly walk around the house and do a little puttering. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and fish. A normal life, I suppose. Not very exciting!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll just check your abdomen and do a quick neurological check. Then, I’d like to order a urine sample to check for infection and other issues. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. An exam and a urine sample sounds fine. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it will be…uncomfortable. I haven’t had one in a while, you see. But please, proceed. I want to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will explain everything as I go. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels amiss. First, I'll just listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Okay, sounds normal so far. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness. Not much tenderness there. Now, I’ll just do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes. This involves tapping on your knees and ankles. Reflexes are normal. Okay, everything appears normal on the initial exam. Now, I will need a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup and instructions. Please try to collect a midstream sample. Is that something you are comfortable with?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. A midstream sample, you say? I remember those from…well, from years ago. I can manage that. Just tell me where to go, and I'll do my best. Hopefully it won't take too long. My waterworks are a bit…temperamental, you see. But I'll try! Where do I go, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Just down the hall, second door on the right is the restroom. I’ll leave you a cup and some instructions on the counter. Just try to collect a sample midstream – start urinating, then collect about two ounces in the cup, and finish urinating. Take your time, there’s no rush. Once you’ve collected it, please bring it back to me, and I will send it off to the lab. I’ll be right here. Let me know if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Okay, second door on the right. Midstream sample. I think I can remember. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. It took a little effort, but I managed it. Hopefully it’s enough. It’s not the prettiest sample, I’m afraid! My waterworks weren’t cooperating. But it’s what I came up with.
