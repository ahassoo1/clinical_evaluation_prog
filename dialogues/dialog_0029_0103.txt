DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I’m Dr. Chora. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back. It’s been hurting. Lower back, mostly. It’s not like a sudden thing, it’s been building for… a while now, I guess. It makes it hard to do things, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradually worsening lower back pain. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s mostly when I’m standing for too long, or bending over. Like, if I try to pick something up off the floor, oof. That’s a bad one. And it doesn’t go away quick, you know? It kinda lingers. It’s not sharp, not really. More of a… dull ache. And it's been worse lately, that's for sure. I used to be able to work in the garden all day, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. So dull ache, worsened with standing and bending, lingering pain, and impacting your ability to garden. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, not really. It stays in my back, mostly. Sometimes I feel it a little in my hips, but it doesn’t go down my legs. No shooting pains or anything like that. Just…back. And a little in the hips when it’s bad. I do feel kinda stiff in the mornings too, now that I think about it. Like I need to get moving to loosen up.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness in the mornings that improves with movement, no radiating pain. Now, have you had any fever, weakness, or numbness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No fever. And no weakness or numbness, thank goodness. My feet feel fine. Everything feels… normal, except for my back, of course. And maybe a little tired, but I'm 77, Doctor! I get tired easy these days, ha! But that’s just old age, I think. It's not related to the back, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Any recent injuries, falls, or changes in your activity level before the pain started getting worse?
PATIENT: No injuries, no falls. Not that I can remember, anyway. And my activity level… well, it’s definitely gone down because of the back! I used to walk a lot, do a little gardening, help my grandkids. But lately… not so much. I try to take it easy, so I don't make it worse. It's a bit of a chicken and egg thing, I guess. Less activity 'cause of the back, and then the back gets worse 'cause of less activity. You understand, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. And I have high blood pressure, but I take medicine for that. Keeps it mostly under control. Oh, and the doctor told me a few years back my bones are…thinning. She said something about osteoporosis. I don’t remember all the details, honestly. It's something about not getting enough calcium, I think. I try to drink milk, but it doesn’t always sit well with my stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gallbladder removal, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a diagnosis of osteoporosis. Do you know what medication you’re taking for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… the little pill is white, and it has… numbers on it. 25… no, 50. Yeah, 50 milligrams. I think it’s called… amlodipine? Something like that. I have to look at the bottle when I get home. My memory isn’t what it used to be, Doctor. I apologize. I know I should write these things down.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Vankampen, don’t worry about it. Amlodipine 50mg is good to know. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one in my life, thank goodness. I can eat anything, take most medicines… except for penicillin, I think. I think I had a bad reaction to that once, a long, long time ago. But other than that, no problems. I’m pretty lucky, really. Except for this back, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies except a possible reaction to penicillin in the past. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, no smoking for me. Never liked it. And I don’t drink alcohol either. Not really my thing. Never have been much of a drinker, honestly. Just water and tea for me. Maybe a little juice sometimes. Simple life, Doctor, simple life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Vankampen, that gives me a good start. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable. I'm a bit of a delicate flower these days, ha!
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll have you lie down on your back so I can assess your back. I’ll be palpating, or feeling, along your spine and the muscles around it to see where the pain is most prominent. I’ll also check your range of motion – how far you can bend forward, backward, and to the sides. It might be a little uncomfortable, but let me know if it's too painful, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. Just take it easy, alright? My bones are… well, you know. Old and a little fragile. Let me know what you find, okay? I'm trusting you with my back here!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. I'm feeling along your lower back now. I do notice some tenderness when I press here, on the right side. And there's some muscle spasm as well. When you bend forward, I notice some limited range of motion and discomfort. And bending backward also seems to be a little restricted. Neurologically, your reflexes are intact and I don’t see any weakness or numbness. Your vital signs are within normal limits. Based on the physical exam, it does seem like we are dealing with a lower back strain, likely aggravated by some underlying muscle weakness and potentially your osteoporosis.
PATIENT: Okay… a strain. That’s… not too bad, right? It's not something serious? And the osteoporosis is making it worse? So, what does that mean? What can we do about it? I really want to get back to gardening, Doctor. My grandkids miss me helping them. It’s important to me.
DOCTOR: It's good you're focused on getting back to gardening, that gives us a goal. A strain means the muscles and ligaments in your back are stretched or torn, but it doesn’t sound like there’s any nerve compression or fracture based on what I’ve found so far. The osteoporosis contributes because it weakens the bones, making them more susceptible to injury and slowing down the healing process. To start, I recommend a course of physical therapy to strengthen your back muscles and improve your flexibility. We can also discuss some pain management options, like over-the-counter pain relievers and possibly a muscle relaxant. I also want you to continue taking calcium and Vitamin D, if you can tolerate it. I'd like to order an X-ray of your lumbar spine just to rule out any underlying fractures or other bony abnormalities. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay, physical therapy, pain relievers, and calcium. That sounds… reasonable. I can try the calcium, maybe with some juice. And an X-ray… yeah, alright. If it makes sure there’s nothing really bad, then that’s good. What about the pain relievers? What kind? And will they make me sleepy? I don’t want to fall asleep in the garden!
DOCTOR: Alright. For the pain relievers, we can start with over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen, following the instructions on the bottle. If that’s not enough, I can prescribe a mild muscle relaxant. They can sometimes cause drowsiness, so we’ll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If it makes you too sleepy, we can adjust the dosage or switch to a different medication. I'm also going to send you a referral to our physical therapy department. They'll assess your back and develop a personalized exercise plan to help you strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: No, that all makes sense. Ibuprofen, muscle relaxants… I think I can manage that. And physical therapy sounds good. Hopefully, they’ll know what they’re doing. So, what about the X-ray? When can I get that done? And will it be… uncomfortable? I’ve got a bit of a sensitive back, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. The X-ray can be done right here in the clinic, the radiology technician can usually fit you in today or tomorrow. It's generally a very quick and painless procedure. You’ll just need to stand or lie down while the machine takes some images of your back. There’s minimal radiation exposure, and the benefits of ruling out any serious underlying issues outweigh the risks. I’ll send this referral to radiology, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. Once they have the results, I'll review them with you and discuss a long-term treatment plan. I want to reiterate that this sounds like a typical lower back strain, and with physical therapy and proper pain management, we should be able to get you back to gardening in no time. Do you have any other questions before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for not making me feel like I'm falling apart. It’s good to know it’s probably just a strain. I appreciate your help. And I’ll call radiology to schedule that X-ray. Hopefully, it won’t be too bad.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I’m glad I could reassure you. Remember to listen to your body, avoid lifting heavy objects, and follow the instructions from the physical therapist. Here’s the referral to radiology, and a printout with instructions on how to take ibuprofen safely. If you have any concerns or your pain worsens, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We're here to help. Get well soon, and hopefully I'll see you back to your gardening soon! Now, do you happen to have a preference for how you'd like to receive test results?
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. That's very kind of you. I think… a phone call would be best. My computer skills aren't the greatest, and I'm always a little worried about getting confused with emails. A phone call is much easier. And I will try to take it easy. No heavy lifting, you said? Noted. I’ll listen to my body.
DOCTOR: Excellent. A phone call it is. We'll make sure to call you as soon as the results are available. Is there a preferred number where you can be reached?
PATIENT: Yes, my home phone is best. It’s 555-123-4567. My grandkids taught me how to use the answering machine, so I can get the message if I’m not there. Hopefully, it’ll be good news.
DOCTOR: Perfect. 555-123-4567, noted. I’ve added that to your file. Alright, Mr. Vankampen, I think that covers everything. If you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We're here to help. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: Okay, thank you Doctor. You too. I will. Bye bye to you. And thanks again for everything.
