DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s my hearing, mostly. It keeps…going. Like, suddenly just gone. And then it comes back, but…with a bit of spinning, you know? It’s a bit unsettling. My daughter, Lani, she worried about it, said I should come see someone. She mentioned something about…family history, too, but I don’t rightly remember what she meant.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds concerning when your hearing fluctuates like that, and the spinning sensation is definitely something we should investigate. It’s good that Lani encouraged you to come in. So, just to clarify, this “going” of your hearing – is it in one ear or both?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Both, I think. Or…maybe just one at a time? It’s hard to say, really. It comes and goes so quickly. I usually don’t notice which one until after it’s happened, and Lani usually tells me. It’s been happening…oh, for a while now. Not constantly, thankfully, but enough to make me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, fluctuating hearing in both ears, coming and going…that’s helpful. And you mentioned it’s been happening for a while. Roughly how long would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's…a good question. It feels like…years, maybe? At least a couple. It started slow, and I just thought it was…old age, you know? Not paying attention to things. But it's getting worse, and now it feels…different. Lani said I shouldn't ignore it anymore, and she’s usually right.
DOCTOR: You're right to get it checked out, and Lani sounds like a very sensible daughter. It's good you're taking this seriously. "Different" is a good way to describe it. Could you elaborate on how it feels different?
PATIENT: Well…it's not just the hearing going, it's…the room. It spins. Not all the time, just when the hearing goes. And I get a bit…off balance. Like I might fall. It doesn't last long, thank goodness. Just a few minutes usually. But it’s scary when it happens. It's not a sharp pain or anything, just…disorienting. And a bit nauseous sometimes, but I haven’t actually been sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. The spinning sensation, the imbalance, and the nausea – those are all important pieces of the puzzle. This sounds like what we call vertigo. To get a better understanding, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll take a look in your ears and check your balance and coordination. It won’t take long, and it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s best. I don’t like doctors poking around too much, but…if it will help find out what’s going on, then yes. Go ahead. Just…be gentle, please? I'm a bit…sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, let's start with your ears. I’m just going to look inside to see if there’s any wax buildup or any signs of infection. This might feel a little cool. Okay, good. Your ear canals look clear. Now, let's check your balance. Could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, I can do that. Just…slowly, please? My eyes aren't what they used to be. It's hard to focus sometimes.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll go slowly. Good. Now, if you’d be comfortable, could you stand up and walk a few steps forward?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes… It’s…a bit wobbly, Doctor. I haven't been steady on my feet lately. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like I’m dizzy all the time, just…off.
DOCTOR: I noticed a slight unsteadiness. That’s helpful information. Okay, thank you. Could you sit back down for a moment?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Is something wrong, Doctor? You’re looking very serious.
DOCTOR: Not necessarily "wrong," Ms. Mayhugh, but your exam does suggest a possible issue with your inner ear. The fluctuating hearing, the episodes of spinning, and the slight unsteadiness all point in that direction. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I suspect you may be experiencing a condition called Meniere’s disease. It affects the inner ear and can cause those specific symptoms – the hearing loss, vertigo, and balance issues. However, to confirm this, we'll need to do some further testing. Would you be agreeable to an audiological evaluation—a hearing test—and possibly a balance test?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A disease? That doesn’t sound good. Meniere’s…that’s a mouthful. Testing…well, if it will help find out what’s going on, then yes. I suppose so. Lani always said I need to listen to the doctors. What kind of tests are they? And will they be…uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Ms. Mayhugh. Many conditions have long names, and it doesn't necessarily mean it's something severe. Meniere’s disease is manageable with appropriate treatment. The audiological evaluation is a painless hearing test that measures your ability to hear different tones and frequencies. It will be done by an audiologist—a specialist in hearing—in a soundproof booth. The balance test, also called a vestibular test, involves wearing sensors that track your eye movements and balance while you perform different maneuvers. It might feel a little unusual, but shouldn't be painful. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Sharma, a very good audiologist here in the clinic. She’ll schedule the tests for you. In the meantime, if you experience a severe episode of vertigo—meaning you’re unable to stand or walk—please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh…alright. Sounds…a bit complicated, but alright. Dr. Sharma, you say? I’ll have to ask Lani to write that down. And the emergency room…yes, I’ll remember that. Thank goodness for Lani, really. Is…is there anything else I need to do right now, Doctor? I’m a bit tired, and I think I’d like to get home.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Mayhugh, that’s perfectly understandable. We’ve covered a lot today. I’ll print out a summary of our conversation and the referral to Dr. Sharma for you to take home. I also want to recommend avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and excessive salt intake, as these can sometimes worsen symptoms. I’ll see you back in a few weeks once you’ve had the testing done, and we can discuss the results and create a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. No caffeine…Lani will be happy about that. And no salt…that’s a bit hard, I love my island cooking. I think…I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for…explaining everything. It’s all a bit much to take in, but…thank you. And tell Dr. Sharma I said hello.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. I understand it's a lot to process. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Dr. Sharma. I'll tell Dr. Sharma you said hello. Get home safely, and take care.
