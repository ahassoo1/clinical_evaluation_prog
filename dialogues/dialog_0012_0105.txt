DOCTOR: Hi Bradlee, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… well, it’s about getting surgery, I think. For my weight. It’s… something my wife and I have been talking about. I don’t really… remember all the details, to be honest. It’s a pre-surgery thing, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, Bradlee, that’s perfectly alright. It is a lot to take in. And yes, this is a pre-surgical consultation – we'll go over everything to make sure it's the right path for you, and that you’re fully prepared. So, you mentioned talking with your wife about weight loss surgery. Do you know what type of surgery you've been discussing?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. Something with… the stomach, I think? She did most of the research. I just… I know we talked about it being… less eating, and it helping me get healthier. I'm bad with names and stuff. I'm sorry. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, not a problem at all, Bradlee. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, and it's great that you have your wife supporting you. Many people don’t remember all the medical details. Okay, so it sounds like you're considering a procedure to help with weight loss by affecting your stomach. There are a few different options – things like gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or a lap band. We can go through those later. First, let’s get a better understanding of your overall health and why you’re considering this now. Can you tell me a bit about your weight history?
PATIENT: Um… I’ve always been… bigger, I guess. Since I was a kid. It got worse after… well, after I moved here. It’s just been… steadily going up. My wife says it’s affecting my health, but I mostly just feel tired all the time. I don’t really… keep track of the numbers, if that makes sense. I try not to think about it too much. It’s been… a long time like this.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Bradlee. It sounds like this has been a long-term issue, and it’s understandable you wouldn’t necessarily keep close track of the numbers. We can definitely figure things out without that information right now. When you say "tired all the time," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Just… really tired. Like, even after a full night’s sleep. I have trouble getting out of bed. I get winded easily, just walking up the stairs. I don’t have the energy to do much with my kids, and that makes me feel… bad. I used to play with them more, but now… I just sit and watch. It’s… hard to explain. It's not like I feel sick, just… worn out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds really tough, Bradlee. Feeling worn out and not having the energy for things you enjoy is definitely something we need to address. It's good you're recognizing that. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Um… I think my wife said something about my blood sugar being a little high at the last check-up. And… the doctor mentioned my cholesterol once. But they didn’t really… say anything specific. I don’t take any regular medicine, if that helps. I try to avoid doctors when I can, honestly. I don’t like being poked and prodded. Is it bad that I don’t remember these things? I feel like I should know.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable, Bradlee. It’s not bad at all that you don’t remember – a lot of people don’t retain all the details from doctor’s visits. That’s why we’re here today – to go over everything. Okay, so potential high blood sugar and cholesterol. We can check your records to confirm that. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never had any problems with medicine or anything like that. No food allergies either. My wife always makes sure I don’t eat anything weird. She's really good about that. I'm pretty lucky to have her, honestly. But… I still feel bad about not remembering things. It’s like my brain is just… foggy sometimes.
DOCTOR: You're not alone in feeling that way, Bradlee. And it sounds like you have a wonderful support system with your wife. Okay, good to know about the allergies. Now, let’s talk a bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, or obesity?
PATIENT: Um… my dad… he had heart problems, I think. He died when I was young. And… my mom, she was… bigger, like me. I don’t remember if she had any specific illnesses. We didn’t talk about that stuff much. My wife says there's probably a history of diabetes on her side, but I can't really remember who. It's just… a lot of people on both sides. Sorry, I’m not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Bradlee. It's perfectly alright that you don’t have all the details. Knowing a little bit about a history of heart problems and potential diabetes is a good starting point. And finally, let's touch on your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. My wife would kill me if I did. She's really strict about that. And… I don’t drink much either. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. I mostly just… work and spend time with my family. It's not a very exciting life, but it's… a good one.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Bradlee. It sounds like you have a healthy lifestyle in many ways. Okay, we’ve covered a lot. Before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything you want to ask me at this point?
PATIENT: Um… well… is this surgery… dangerous? That’s probably a stupid question. My wife said it’s pretty safe these days, but… I keep having this image in my head of something going wrong. And… what if it doesn't work? What if I just end up… the same? I’m sorry, I’m just… nervous. It's a big thing.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Bradlee – and not stupid at all. It's completely normal to be nervous about a surgery, especially a major one like weight loss surgery. All surgeries carry some risks, and it’s important to be aware of those. We’ll discuss those specifically, including potential complications like infection, bleeding, or blood clots. But modern weight loss surgery is generally very safe when performed by an experienced team, and at a qualified facility. As for it not working, that’s a valid concern too. Success depends on many factors, including the type of surgery, your commitment to lifestyle changes after surgery, and your overall health. We’ll discuss realistic expectations, and make sure it's a good fit for you. We'll also talk about the pre-operative workup, which helps us identify and minimize those risks. Would you like me to explain the different types of weight loss surgery now, and we can go from there?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… good. I think knowing more would help me feel… less scared. And… maybe help me understand what my wife has been talking about all this time. I just… I don’t like feeling like I’m in the dark.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Bradlee. That’s exactly why we’re here. Okay, so there are a few main types of weight loss surgery. The most common ones are gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding, often called lap-band. Gastric bypass involves creating a small pouch from the upper part of your stomach and connecting it directly to your small intestine. This reduces the size of your stomach and bypasses a portion of it, which limits how much you can eat and reduces the absorption of calories. It’s very effective for weight loss, but it's also the most complex surgery. Then there's sleeve gastrectomy, which involves removing about 80% of your stomach, leaving a long, narrow “sleeve.” This also reduces the size of your stomach and restricts food intake. It’s less complex than gastric bypass, but still very effective. Finally, lap-band involves placing a band around the upper part of your stomach to create a smaller pouch. It’s the least invasive surgery, but it typically results in less weight loss than the other two. It also requires regular adjustments by a doctor. Do you want me to go into more detail about any of those, or talk about the risks and benefits of each one?
PATIENT: Um… maybe… the sleeve gastrectomy sounds… less scary. Because it’s not as complicated? And… what does “less invasive” even mean? Does that mean… less pain? I'm sorry, I have so many questions. I just… I don't want to make the wrong decision. Is there a right decision?
DOCTOR: That's a very smart question, Bradlee. And yes, sleeve gastrectomy is often considered less complicated than gastric bypass. "Less invasive" means it's done through smaller incisions, usually with the help of a laparoscope – a small camera and instruments. This generally leads to less pain, faster recovery, and a lower risk of complications compared to open surgery. And there isn’t necessarily a right decision, Bradlee. The best surgery depends on your individual health, lifestyle, and goals. We’ll consider all of those factors to determine which one is most appropriate for you. Before we dive deeper into the specifics of each surgery, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline of your current health. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay. That’s… fine. I guess. I just… I don't like doctors poking around. But if it helps… then yeah. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Bradlee. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, so I'm just listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds… normal rhythm, no abnormal sounds. Now, I'm just gently feeling your abdomen. It feels… a bit soft, and I can feel some fullness. No sharp pain or tenderness, right?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. Just… uncomfortable. It's always uncomfortable. I get a lot of bloating, especially after I eat. My wife says it's because I eat too fast. And… sometimes I get heartburn. It’s not terrible, but… it’s annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know, Bradlee. It sounds like there's some bloating and potential heartburn. Everything feels normal here, no unusual masses. Your abdomen is a bit… protruded. Your blood pressure is a little elevated - 140/90. Your pulse is normal at 78. I'll just listen to your heart one more time. No murmurs or irregularities noted. Okay, that completes the basic physical exam. Overall, you seem to be in generally good health, but your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and you have some bloating and discomfort. We'll want to get some blood work done to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and other levels. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Blood work is fine. The sooner we know something, the better, right? I just want to get this figured out. I want to feel better. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Bradlee. Feeling better is exactly what we're aiming for. And yes, the sooner we have the results, the sooner we can make a plan. Okay, let’s get that blood work ordered. The nurse will come in shortly to draw some samples. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and answer any other questions you have. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
