DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, good morning to you too. It's…fine. I am here because I am very tired. Always tired, even when I sleep a long time. The other doctor, he said something about my…liver? It is not good, he said. That is why I am here, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're feeling persistently tired, despite getting enough sleep, and your previous doctor mentioned something about your liver. That’s a good starting point. Let's talk a little more about this tiredness. When did you first start noticing it?
PATIENT: Hmm. When? That is…difficult. It was a long time ago, maybe six months? More? It started slow. Just…not wanting to do things. Now…now it is hard to even get out of bed some days. My wife, she says I am always grumpy too. She is probably right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been a gradual onset over at least six months, and it's significantly impacting your daily life, even affecting your mood. It's good your wife has noticed as well. Besides the tiredness and grumpiness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…being sick? No, not really sick. Sometimes my stomach feels…off. Not pain, just…full. And itchy. My skin gets very itchy. Especially my legs. It is annoying. That is all, I think. Maybe a little bit of…swelling in my feet sometimes. But I don’t know if that is something to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have tiredness, grumpiness, a feeling of fullness in your stomach, itchy skin, particularly on your legs, and some swelling in your feet. That’s helpful. Let's move on to some other questions. Have you had any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat. My wife makes good food. I always eat it. Sometimes I don't want to eat, but I eat anyway. It is better to eat, she says. I do not feel hungry, but I eat. Is that…good? I don't know.
DOCTOR: It's good that you're still eating, even if your appetite isn't great. That's important. So, you’re eating a normal amount, just not necessarily feeling hungry. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements or the color of your stool?
PATIENT: Bowel…movements? You want to know about…going to the bathroom? Really? Is this important? It is…normal, I think. Sometimes a little hard, sometimes soft. Nothing strange. And the color…brown, of course. What color should it be? This is…a strange question.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask – it is a strange question, but changes in bowel movements can sometimes give us clues. It's good to hear that it's generally brown and consistent. Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical…history? Well, I had malaria when I was younger, a long time ago in Ethiopia. And my blood pressure…the doctor says it is a little high. He gave me a pill for it. I take it every day. Other than that…no. I am a healthy man. Mostly. This tiredness is new. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of malaria and currently managed high blood pressure. That’s good to know. And you take medication for the blood pressure daily – do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Name…? Hmm. It is a white pill. Small. I take it with breakfast. The doctor…he wrote it down, but my wife has the paper. I do not remember the name. Something…with an 'A'? Or maybe a 'B'? I am not good with remembering names. Just numbers, I remember numbers.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we can look it up in your records. Do you mind if I take a quick look on the computer?
PATIENT: No, go ahead. Look it up. I do not know these names. Numbers are better. I used to be a builder, you know. Numbers for everything. Wood and stone, all numbers. This…medicine…it is just something I take.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a moment… Alright, I see here you’re currently taking Amlodipine 10mg daily for hypertension. That confirms what you said. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the malaria?
PATIENT: Malaria…no. No surgeries. Never. I do not like hospitals. Bad place. My wife, she had her gallbladder out, many years ago. But I…no. Just the malaria when I was a young man. It was very bad. But I recovered. Strong man. No surgeries. No other hospitals.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, liver problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family…history? My father…he died of old age. Very old man. My mother…she had high blood pressure too, like me. And my sister…she had some kind of sickness with the sugar. Diabetes, I think that is what you said. Liver problems? No, I do not think so. No one in my family had liver problems. No cancer either. Mostly just old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension and diabetes in the family, but no known liver problems or cancer. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social…history? What does that mean? Do you want to know about my friends? I have a few friends, we play dominoes sometimes. Is that what you mean? I am married, as you know. That is my social life. I like to watch football on television. Quiet life.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine. I just want to know about things like alcohol consumption, smoking, and any recreational drug use. Have you ever smoked cigarettes or used tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never. Bad for you. My wife would kill me. She says it is foolish. And no, I do not use any…drugs. I am a builder, a worker. I need to be strong. Drugs make you weak. No, never. Just a little bit of beer sometimes, with my friends when we play dominoes. But not much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you don't smoke and rarely drink alcohol – just a little beer occasionally with friends. That’s good. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I eat everything. My wife makes good food, I told you. No allergies to medicines either. I take the blood pressure pill every day, no problems. I am a strong man, I can handle anything. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you for providing me with all of that information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and then I'll feel your abdomen. I'll also take a look at your skin to check for any rashes or changes in color. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Go ahead. Listen to my heart. I am a strong man, you will see. But this tiredness…it is something. My wife says I look very pale. Maybe you will see that too. But go ahead, do your exam. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/90. It’s a little elevated, but not drastically so, considering you take medication for it. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, good breath sounds. Now, let me feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some slight tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Nothing too concerning, but we'll keep that in mind. And……yes, your skin does appear slightly pale, as your wife mentioned. There's no rash or other noticeable changes. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: A little bit. Not much. Just…uncomfortable. It's been like that for a while, I think. I just thought it was…old age. Or maybe from working too hard. But yes, a little bit of pain when you press there. It is not a sharp pain, just…dull.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Based on your symptoms – the persistent tiredness, the slight tenderness in your upper right abdomen, the pale skin, and your previous doctor’s concern about your liver – I’m going to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Specifically, I want to check your liver function tests, a complete blood count to look for anemia, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Yes, alright. If you think it is necessary. I do not like needles, but…I want to know why I am so tired. So, yes, do the blood tests. Liver tests, you said? And something for the…kidneys? Alright. Just get it done. And tell me the results when you have them. I trust you will figure out what is wrong.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will have the lab draw the blood now. It will only take a few minutes. After the results come back – usually within a couple of days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, jaundice , or confusion, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just…get the tests done. And tell me what is wrong. I just want to feel normal again. I miss working in the garden. Thank you, doctor. That is all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Grumman. We will do our best to get to the bottom of this. I will have the lab technician come in and draw your blood now. Please let me know if you feel lightheaded at any point during or after the procedure. It was a pleasure meeting you today, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
