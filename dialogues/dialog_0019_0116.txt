DOCTOR: Good morning, Genette. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Let me see… well, it's my legs. They bother me something awful at night. Cramping, mostly. It wakes me up, you see. It’s been going on… oh, goodness, a while now. I don’t rightly recall how long. A few months, perhaps? I just thought it would… go away.
DOCTOR: Alright, cramping in your legs at night, waking you up. A few months now, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A few months. It feels like… a tightening. A hard squeezing. Starts in my calf, usually, but sometimes it’s higher up. It’s not… a sharp pain, exactly. More… uncomfortable. And it makes me jump. My poor husband… he used to get up with me every time.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s a tightening, squeezing sensation, often in the calf, but sometimes higher up. Not a sharp pain, more uncomfortable and makes you jump. Does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger? Oh, goodness. I don’t know about triggers. I mostly just sit and… well, I used to do a lot of knitting. But my hands aren’t what they used to be. I don’t go for many walks anymore, either. It just… happens. Sometimes when I’m resting, sometimes when I’m… well, just sitting. I can’t seem to find anything that makes it more likely, or less, for that matter.
DOCTOR: Okay. So it seems to happen somewhat randomly, whether you’re resting or just sitting. No particular activity makes it better or worse. Have you noticed if it happens more often at a certain time of day, besides at night?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… No, not really. It's mostly nighttime. Though, now that you mention it, sometimes my legs feel a little… achy during the day. Not bad, just… tired. But the cramping is always at night. It’s the worst then, when I’m trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright, nighttime cramping, with some daytime leg achiness. Now, have you tried anything to help with the cramping?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Well, my husband used to rub them. That helped sometimes, just the rubbing. A nice, firm rub. But… he’s gone now. And I… I mostly just try to stretch them out. Sometimes that works a little. But not always. I’ve tried a little bit of warm water on them, too, but that doesn’t seem to do much good either.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've tried a few things on your own. Rubbing helped when your husband was able to do that, and you’ve tried stretching and warm water. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, the doctor always said my blood pressure was a little high. Years ago, that is. I haven't been to a doctor in… oh, I couldn’t tell you how long. I mostly just try to take it easy. And my arthritis, of course. In my hands, mostly. That's why I don't knit as much anymore. But nothing… serious. I don’t think so. I just get tired easily, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure and arthritis in your hands. You mentioned getting tired easily as well. Do you take any medications currently, for your blood pressure, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not anymore. The doctor took me off the blood pressure pills years and years ago. Said I didn’t need them anymore. And I don’t take anything for the arthritis. Just try to manage it. Rubbing it when it gets bad, mostly. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. They never seemed to do much good anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Not that I know of. I’ve eaten just about everything over the years. And I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to a pill. My husband always said I was a sturdy one. Though, I do get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats. But that’s just a little itch, not a… a reaction, you see. Just a little bit of a tickle.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known medication allergies, just a little itchiness around cats. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your past medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, when I was a little girl, I had a bad case of the measles. I was in the hospital for a week or so. And… oh, when I had my son, of course. That was a hospital stay. But other than that… not really. Nothing serious. Just the usual things, you see. Nothing to write home about.
DOCTOR: Alright, measles as a child and hospitalization for childbirth. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Yes, actually. Years and years ago, I had my appendix taken out. And… oh, I had a hysterectomy when I was younger. That’s about it, I think. Both a long time ago. I don’t remember much about them, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and hysterectomy. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… My mother had… what was it? Something with her heart, I think. She was always tired. And my father… he had diabetes, I believe. But other than that… not really. A lot of sturdy folks on both sides of the family, you see. Long lives, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of heart condition in your mother and diabetes in your father. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a bit when he was younger, but he quit years and years ago. Said it wasn’t good for him. I always told him that, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking history. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Just a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing much. Maybe a glass on a Sunday. My husband and I used to enjoy it. But I don’t drink much anymore. It doesn’t seem to agree with me as well as it used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional wine. Now, before we move on to a quick exam, is there anything else you think I should know about your health or what's been going on?
PATIENT: Oh… well, now that you mention it, I’ve been feeling a little more… forgetful lately. Just little things, you see. Like where I put my glasses. Or what I had for breakfast. It’s not too bad, but it’s… noticeable. And sometimes, I feel a little bit… unsteady on my feet. Nothing major, but I have to hold onto things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, some forgetfulness and occasional unsteadiness. That's good to know. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just be gentle, if you would. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Can you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Here you are. I always did have a strong pulse, my husband said. He was a bit of a worrier, you see. Always checking to make sure I was alright.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/88. And your pulse is 78, regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. My husband always said I had a strong constitution. He was very proud of me, you see. Go on, Doctor. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Your gait is a little unsteady, as you mentioned, but within normal limits. Now, let's just take a look at your feet and legs. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your feet or legs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Sometimes they feel a little… cold. But no tingling or numbness. Just a bit chilly, especially at night. I always wear thick socks to bed, you see. It helps a little.
DOCTOR: Your pulses are a little weak, but present. Your skin is dry, and I do notice some slight discoloration on your lower legs. It’s likely due to poor circulation. Now, one last thing - can you tell me if you have any difficulty with balance?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, sometimes I feel a little… off balance when I stand up quickly. Or when I turn my head too fast. It’s not too bad, but I have to hold onto something sometimes. Like the kitchen counter, you see. I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Genette. That was helpful. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms related to peripheral artery disease, combined with some age-related changes in your circulation and balance. The leg cramping, especially at night, the weakness in your pulses, the dry skin, and the occasional unsteadiness all point in that direction. It’s also possible the forgetfulness could be unrelated, or a separate concern. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar, kidney function, and vitamin levels. I also think an Ankle-Brachial Index test would be helpful. It’s a non-invasive test that measures the blood flow in your legs. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot of information, Doctor. Peripheral… something? And tests? Oh dear. Will the tests be painful? And what if… what if it is something bad? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Genette. It is a lot to take in. Peripheral artery disease, or PAD, simply means that the arteries in your legs are narrowed, reducing blood flow. It’s common as we get older. The blood tests are just a routine check, and they won’t be painful – just a small prick of a needle. The ABI test is completely non-invasive, it involves measuring blood pressure at your ankle and wrist, just like we did today, and comparing the results. As for what if it is something bad, that's why we're doing the tests. If it is PAD, we can manage it with lifestyle changes – like regular exercise, if you’re able, and sometimes medication – to improve your blood flow and prevent complications. We’ll talk about all your options if that's the case. And you are absolutely not a bother. My job is to help you, and I'm here to answer any questions you have. Would you like me to explain any of that in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that’s… a little reassuring, I suppose. Exercise… oh dear. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And medication… I don’t like taking pills. But… if it will help, I suppose I can try. The blood tests… when will I get the results? And where do I go for these tests? The ABI… what does that even mean?
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take it one step at a time. The blood tests and ABI can be done right here at the clinic. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood before you leave, and schedule you for the ABI test with our technician later this week. It usually takes a few days to get the blood test results back, and the ABI results are usually available within a day or two. The nurse will let you know when they're ready. The ABI – Ankle-Brachial Index – it’s basically a way to see how well the blood is flowing in your legs compared to your arms. It doesn’t hurt at all, it just involves using a blood pressure cuff on your ankles and wrists. As for medication, we’ll discuss that after we get the test results. It might not even be necessary. And we’ll start slowly, if it is. We’ll focus on the least invasive options first. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that sounds… manageable, I suppose. Getting the tests done here at the clinic is good. I don’t like going to lots of different places. And not starting with medication is… reassuring. Will the nurse explain everything before she draws my blood? I don’t like surprises, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The nurse will explain everything step-by-step before she draws your blood. She'll tell you exactly what to expect, and answer any questions you have. She's very gentle and experienced. She’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for the ABI test. I'm going to write up a referral for the blood tests and the ABI test, and the nurse will get everything set up for you. I’ll also give you a sheet with some basic information about PAD, so you can read up on it if you’d like. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Genette?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don’t think so. That’s… very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for not rushing me. It’s… nice to have someone listen.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Genette. That’s my job. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions at all, even after you get the test results. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll figure out the best plan for you. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you started with the blood draw. You take care now. And please, try not to worry too much.
