DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Benic, is it?
PATIENT: Aye, that's me. Aurthur Benic. Good to meet ye, Doctor… Sink, is it? I hope I'm no keepin' ye too long this mornin'.
DOCTOR: Let’s just get straight to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Aye, sounds sensible. It's this mornin' sickness, ye see. Been feelin' right poorly, especially first thing. It's not like… well, not like a woman's mornin' sickness, mind ye. More like a queasy stomach and a bit of… well, bringin' things up. It's been goin' on a wee while now.
DOCTOR: “Mornin’ sickness”… right. And how long exactly is a “wee while,” Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, I'd say about three weeks ago now. Maybe a bit longer. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, ye see. It started gradual, just a bit off colour, then it's gotten worse each day. Mostly just when I wake up, though. A right nuisance it is.
DOCTOR: Three weeks… and you’ve just now come in?
PATIENT: Well, I didn't want to bother ye with somethin' that might just be a bit of indigestion, ye see? I thought it would pass. I've always been a stoic sort, try to get on with things. But it's not gettin' better, and my heart… well, I do have a bit of trouble with my heart, and I thought it best to get it checked out. I didn't want it to be somethin' serious, connectin' to that, like.
DOCTOR: You have a history of… cardiac issues, yes. Alright. Let’s start with a basic review of systems. Any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And thankfully, no night sweats either. I've been sleepin' alright, all things considered. It's just this queasiness when I wake up that's the bother. Though I do feel a bit cold sometimes, but that could just be the weather. It's been a damp August, ye see.
DOCTOR: Any change in your appetite?
PATIENT: Aye, that's a good question. It's definitely gone down. I'm no as hungry as I used to be. Usually, I'd be lookin' forward to my porridge, but now… it just doesn't appeal. I've been tryin' to eat somethin' light, just toast and a bit of fruit, but even that can be difficult sometimes. I've lost a wee bit of weight, I reckon.
DOCTOR: And what about bowel movements?
PATIENT: Och, well now... they've been a bit… irregular. Not as frequent as they should be, and a bit… harder to pass than usual, if ye understand what I mean. I've been drinkin' plenty of water, tryin' to keep things movin', but it's no helped much. It's not causin' me any pain, mind ye, just a bit of… discomfort. It's no a pleasant topic, I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Lie back on the table, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll feel your abdomen.
PATIENT: Right ye are. Just let me know if ye need me to do anythin', Doctor. I'm no used to all this, but I trust yer judgement.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is… slightly irregular. Murmur present. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a bit shallow. Abdomen is… tender in the upper quadrants. No guarding, but definitely some discomfort upon palpation. Alright. Blood pressure is 130/80. Temperature is normal. I'm going to order some blood work: complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests, and amylase. And a stool sample, just to rule things out.
PATIENT: Och, that sounds… thorough. Is that all normal, Doctor? The irregular heart and tender stomach, I mean? I'm no wantin' to worry ye unnecessarily, but I'm a bit anxious now. Is it somethin' serious, d'ye think? The heart failure, is it worsenin'?
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions, Mr. Benic. We need the lab results before we can say anything definitive. The irregularity is concerning, given your history. The tenderness could be a number of things. We’ll rule out the most common causes first. I'm going to prescribe you an anti-emetic to help with the nausea. Take it as directed. And try to stick to bland foods for now. I’ll also order a stool test, as I said, to rule out any infection. I'll get the nurse to draw the blood and collect a sample. And we’ll follow up once the results are back, alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I'll take the medicine as ye say. And I'll try to stick to toast and fruit, as ye suggested. It's just… it's all a bit much, ye see. Worryin' about the heart, and now this stomach trouble. But I trust yer judgement. Thank ye for lookin' after me. When can I expect to hear back about the results? And who should I contact if the nausea gets worse before then?
DOCTOR: The results should be back in 48-72 hours. The nurse will let you know. If the nausea gets significantly worse, or if you develop a fever, go to the emergency room. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Och... right. No, I don't think so. Just… thank ye again, Doctor. I'll just wait for the nurse, then. I appreciate yer time. I'll be seein' ye, I suppose, when the results come back.
DOCTOR: Right. .
