DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. I'm Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, good morning. Look, I don’t really enjoy coming to doctors, if I’m honest. It’s just… my mother, she’s been having some problems. Heart stuff. And my grandfather… well, let's just say it didn’t end well. I'm probably fine, but I figured it was better to get checked out, you know? Just for peace of mind. It’s genetic, I think. Is that even a thing?
DOCTOR: It absolutely is a thing, Blain. Family history is very important, and it’s good you’re thinking about that. It’s very proactive of you to come in, especially with your mother and grandfather’s history. It's understandable to feel anxious about that. So, when did you start noticing things that made you want to get checked?
PATIENT: Noticing? I haven’t noticed anything, exactly. That’s the problem! Everyone keeps telling me to watch for symptoms, but I feel perfectly… normal. Which is probably what people say right before something bad happens, isn't it? My sister, she’s a bit of a hypochondriac, and she’s been on my back about this for weeks. She's convinced I'm going to drop dead any minute. Honestly, it's a little annoying. I just want a quick check-up to prove her wrong, and maybe put my mind at ease. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Blain. It’s very common to want reassurance, and it’s smart to get things checked out even if you aren't feeling specific symptoms, especially with the family history you've mentioned. Okay. So, let's just go through a bit of a general check-up, then. Just to cover all bases. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Fine. General health… I guess it's okay. I work, you know? Engineering teacher. It keeps me busy. I try to eat reasonably well, mostly. Not a lot of junk food. I wouldn't say I exercise exactly, but I walk around a bit. I was married, briefly. That was… stressful. Divorced now. That’s probably relevant, right? Stress is bad for your heart? Honestly, I'm not one for rambling about my personal life to strangers, but you asked. And I suppose a doctor needs to know something. Do you really need to know about the divorce?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Blain. You’re right to ask, and I appreciate you being open. It is helpful to have a full picture, and stress can definitely play a role in health. Don't worry, I won't pry. So, aside from the divorce, would you say your stress levels are generally manageable?
PATIENT: Manageable? Look, I’m a teacher. Every day is a controlled level of chaos. I deal with it. It’s not… relaxing. But it's not like I’m constantly on the verge of a breakdown, if that's what you mean. I suppose I drink a bit more coffee than I should to get through it. And I probably don’t sleep as much as I ought to. But who does? Is that even a question? My sister says I need to take up yoga. She's impossible. Honestly, it’s probably fine. I just… I want to know if I’m going to suddenly keel over while grading papers. Is that so unreasonable?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not unreasonable at all, Blain. It’s very good you're thinking about these things. And the coffee and sleep—those can both affect things. Okay. Let's move on to some specifics. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. I’ve eaten pretty much everything. My sister’s a vegetarian, which I find baffling, but I've always been pretty adventurous when it comes to food. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. And no medication allergies either. I haven’t really taken much medication, to be honest. Maybe some ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s about it. I'm not one for popping pills if I can avoid it. I've always been fairly robust, if you get my meaning. Are we getting anywhere with this? I'm starting to feel a bit silly, explaining all this. I don't feel sick.
DOCTOR: You're not feeling silly at all, Blain. It's good you're so open, and it's helpful to know all of this. No medication allergies is good to know. Okay. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Like I said, just the occasional ibuprofen. I don’t really believe in all that supplement nonsense. My sister's always trying to get me to take something for “energy” or “brain health,” but I tell her to save her money. Honestly, I get enough headaches from dealing with teenagers, I don’t need to pay for more. Is that enough? Can we get to the actual check-up now? This is feeling a bit like a life history questionnaire. I haven’t even gotten to the divorce details yet. Do you really need to know why we divorced? It was complicated.
DOCTOR: You’re right, we can move on to the check-up. And no, you don’t need to share any details about the divorce. We’re just covering all the bases. Okay, let's talk about your family history a little more specifically. You mentioned your mother and grandfather had heart problems. Can you tell me anything about what those problems were?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history. Fine. My mother... she has atrial fibrillation, I think. Something to do with her heartbeat being irregular. She’s on medication for it. And she gets tired easily. She went to the doctor a lot. My grandfather… he had a heart attack, a pretty bad one. He didn’t make it. They said it was… sudden. That was years ago, of course. My aunt on my father's side has high blood pressure, too, if that’s relevant. It seems like it runs in the family, honestly. That's why I'm here, isn’t it? It's all genetic. Is that what you’re going to tell me? I'm doomed.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're aware of all of that, Blain. Knowing your family history helps us to assess your risk. And it doesn't necessarily mean you're doomed! It simply means we need to be proactive and pay attention. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. Just some basic things – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, things like that. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can go back to my life. And please, try not to look too worried while you're listening to my heart, alright? My sister will be insufferable if she finds out you’re concerned.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll do my best to remain calm and professional. Alright. If you could just sit back and relax, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Will document for further evaluation. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. That’s slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Reflexes are normal. Okay. Everything seems within normal limits for now, but the murmur and slightly elevated blood pressure are things we should keep an eye on. Now, I'd like to order some basic blood work - a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and a metabolic panel. That will give us a better picture of your overall health. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood work. Great. More poking and prodding. Look, I still feel perfectly fine, you know? Is this really necessary? I mean, I haven’t even felt sick. My sister’s going to be ecstatic. She’ll say I told you so. This is exactly what she wanted. But… alright. If you insist. Blood work, fine. Just… try not to make a big deal out of it, alright? I don't need to be labeled as a "high-risk patient." Can I at least get a list of places to go? And what do I have to do to prepare? Do I have to fast? This is such a hassle.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Blain. And you’re right, you don’t feel sick, which is good. The blood work is just a preventative measure, given your family history and the slight murmur and elevated blood pressure. It helps us get a baseline and monitor things over time. You will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood work. No food or drinks, except water. And I'm printing a list of nearby labs for you now. Here you go. And I’ll also send the lab order electronically to the lab of your choice. Once you have the results, they will be sent to me, and we can discuss them at a follow-up appointment. Would you like me to schedule that appointment now?
PATIENT: Fine, schedule it. Just… not first thing in the morning, alright? I need to wake up properly before being poked and prodded. And no lectures about lifestyle changes, please. I eat reasonably well and I don’t smoke. I already know all that. Just… do it. .
DOCTOR: Alright, I have you scheduled for a follow-up appointment on August 16th at 2:00 PM. That gives the lab plenty of time to get the results back to me. I won't lecture you about lifestyle changes, I promise. We can discuss the results at your follow-up appointment and if necessary we can come up with a plan. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
