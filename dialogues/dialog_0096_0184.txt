DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look here, I ain't got all day. It's about… well, it's about how I look. I see myself in the mirror, and it ain't a pretty sight. Used to be strong, you know? Pile driving takes a lot outta a man. Now… not so much. Just want to know if anything can be done about it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Right. “How you look.” Well, that's… a rather broad complaint, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Broad? What broad about it? I'm lookin' worse every day! Skin hangin' loose, nothin' where it should be… You a doctor, shouldn't you understand that? I don’t need fancy words, just tell me if you can fix it or not. I ain't here to play games.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, simply saying you “look worse” isn't a medical diagnosis. It could be a multitude of things – weight loss, aging, changes in muscle mass… Let’s try to be a little more specific. Have you lost weight recently?
PATIENT: Lost weight? Maybe a little. Hard to say exactly, I don't weigh myself every day like some woman. But I ain’t been eatin’ like I used to, truth be told. Less appetite now. And when I look in the mirror, it's not just less weight, it's… saggin'. Everywhere. You understand saggin', Doctor? It’s not a good look for a man.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reduced appetite and… changes in skin tone and muscle mass. And you mentioned this is happening “everywhere.” Has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, mostly. Started maybe six months ago, after my wife… well, after she passed. Didn't feel much like eatin' after that, and I guess everything just went downhill from there. It ain't like it happened overnight, you know? Just… slow. And annoyin'.
DOCTOR: I see. And besides the appetite and the changes you’re describing, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kinda symptoms? I feel… old. Tired, mostly. And weaker than I used to be. Can't lift things like I once could. Everything aches a little bit, but that's just part of gettin’ old, ain't it? I ain't lookin' for sympathy, Doctor, just a fix for this… droopin'.
DOCTOR: “Droopin’,” right. Well, weakness and fatigue can be part of aging, certainly. But they can also be signs of other things. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? No, not really. Legs feel a bit heavy sometimes, but no puffiness or nothin'. I wear boots most days, so I wouldn't notice much swelling anyway. Look, are we gettin' anywhere with this? I explained how I look, and I want to know if you can tighten things up. Is there a cream or somethin'?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, I need to understand why you’re experiencing these changes before I can even begin to consider a treatment. "Tightening things up" isn't a medical procedure. It sounds like you’ve experienced significant weight loss and are feeling weaker, which could be due to a number of things. We need to rule out more serious causes first. I'm going to need to do a physical exam. Can we start with your vital signs?
PATIENT: Vital signs? What for? I told you what's wrong! I'm saggin'! Look, I ain't got time for a whole examination. If you can't just look at me and tell me what cream to use, then I’m wastin' my time here. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand you’re frustrated, but I am a doctor. I cannot simply prescribe a “cream” based on your self-assessment of “sagging.” That would be irresponsible, and frankly, poor medical practice. I need to assess your overall health. This is for your benefit. Now, are you willing to allow me to perform a basic physical exam – blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs – or would you prefer I refer you to another physician?
PATIENT: Another physician? Look, I came to you. And I ain't lettin' some fancy exam tell me what's wrong. I know what's wrong! It's obvious! I just want somethin’ done about it, and if you can’t help, then… then forget it. I’m leavin'. This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. I understand your frustration, but I strongly advise you to reconsider. Without a proper assessment, any treatment would be… ill-advised. I will document your concerns and your refusal of examination. Please be aware that these symptoms could indicate a more serious underlying condition. If you change your mind, please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment.
