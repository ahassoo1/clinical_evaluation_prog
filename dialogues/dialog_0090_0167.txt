DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… this foot. It’s been bothering me for a little while now. It hurts, you see. Real bad sometimes. And there’s… a sore. A bad one. It won’t get better.
DOCTOR: A sore, you say. “A little while now” is rather vague, Mr. Stoegbauer. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… three, four weeks? It’s hard to say for sure. Time… it goes fast when you get old, eh? It started small, just a little red spot. I didn’t think much of it at first. Now… now it’s bigger. And it hurts to walk. I have to be careful.
DOCTOR: Three or four weeks. Alright. And where exactly on your foot is this sore located?
PATIENT: It’s… on the bottom of my foot, Doctor. Right here… … near my heel, I think. It’s hard to see without a mirror, you know. And I don’t bend over so easy anymore.
DOCTOR: Right. Near the heel. Has anything changed about it recently?
PATIENT: Well… it feels warmer than the rest of my foot, now. And… sometimes it smells a little funny. I try to keep it clean, I really do, but… it's hard. And it's been leaking a little. Not a lot, but enough to get on my socks. I’m sorry if that’s… unpleasant to hear.
DOCTOR: Leaking and a foul odor… alright. And have you noticed any redness or swelling around the sore itself, besides on the foot generally?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes. Now that you mention it, there is. A little bit. Redness. And it feels… puffy around the edges. Not a lot of puffy, but… noticeable. It’s like… a ring around it, you see? It’s tender too. Hurts when I touch it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. Let's take a look at this. Please try to relax. I need to examine your foot to get a better idea of what we’re dealing with. I'll need you to tell me if anything is particularly painful. Now, can you describe the sore itself?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Of course. It’s… deep, I think. Not just a little scratch. And… it’s got… some funny colors in it. Like… yellow and white. And some red too, around the edges, like you said. It doesn't look clean, Doctor. It looks… angry. It doesn't feel good, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m seeing some significant inflammation and… yes, it does appear deep. There’s some purulent drainage present as well. And it is quite tender to the touch. Your pulses are present, but diminished in that foot. Mr. Stoegbauer, it's difficult to say for certain without further testing, but this is concerning for a possible infection, potentially a deep space infection. Do you have a fever, or have you been feeling generally unwell?
PATIENT: A fever? No, I don’t think so. I haven’t taken my temperature. I just feel… tired. More tired than usual, maybe. And a little shaky. But I get shaky sometimes. Old age, eh? I haven’t been feeling sick sick, just… worn out. And this foot… this foot is what’s bothering me the most. It just feels… wrong. What does “deep space infection” mean, Doctor? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: A deep space infection means the infection has gone beyond just the skin and is affecting the deeper tissues. It can be serious, especially given your age and the diminished pulses I detected. It suggests reduced blood flow to the area, which makes it harder for your body to fight the infection and heal. We need to determine the extent of the infection. I’m going to order some blood work to check for signs of infection in your system. We’ll also need an X-ray of your foot to see if the infection has affected the bone. Depending on those results, we may need to consider a CT scan. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. I don't think so. Not that I know of. My wife… she used to keep track of those things. But she’s… gone now. I haven't been to a doctor in a long time. I don't remember ever being allergic to anything. But… I do get a little heartburn sometimes. Does that count? And… what will the tests show, Doctor? Is it going to be… really bad?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. The heartburn is not relevant at this time. The tests will help us determine the severity and extent of the infection, and guide our treatment plan. It’s too early to say definitively how “bad” it is, Mr. Stoegbauer. We need the results first. However, given your age and the fact that you haven’t seen a doctor in a while, we need to be cautious. It’s possible that this infection has spread, or could spread further. I’m going to order a stat blood draw and X-ray. While we wait for those results, I recommend staying off your foot as much as possible. Do not attempt to walk on it. We also need to rule out any underlying conditions that might be contributing to this infection, such as diabetes. Do you have a history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh… diabetes. Yes. My wife… she said I have it. She used to give me… pills. Every day. And I had to watch what I eat. But… that was a long time ago. I stopped taking the pills after she… after she passed. I didn’t think it was so bad. Just a little tired sometimes. And thirsty. But nothing… nothing like this. So… it is bad, then? Because of the diabetes?
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, uncontrolled diabetes significantly impairs your body's ability to fight infection and heal wounds. It also compromises blood flow to your extremities. Your history of diabetes is a very important factor here, and likely contributing to the severity of this infection. It's not hopeless, but it does mean we need to be aggressive with treatment. We need to get your blood sugar under control immediately, in addition to addressing the infection itself. I’m going to admit you to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. We’ll start you on intravenous antibiotics, monitor your blood sugar closely, and consult with an infectious disease specialist and potentially a vascular surgeon. This will allow us to provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any advance directives or a living will?
PATIENT: Hospital? Oh… dear. I… I don’t like hospitals. My wife… she passed away in the hospital. It’s… not a happy place for me. Advance… what? No. I don’t have any of those. I just… I want to get better. I want to be able to walk again. Is… is there anything else I can do? Can’t I just… take some pills? Or put some cream on it? I don’t want to go to the hospital, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, I understand your reluctance. Hospitals aren't pleasant places, and I’m truly sorry for your loss. However, given the severity of the infection, your history of diabetes, and the diminished pulses in your foot, this is the safest course of action. Oral antibiotics and topical creams are unlikely to be effective in this case. The infection is too deep and widespread, and your body needs more aggressive treatment. We can try to manage your anxiety and make your stay as comfortable as possible. We have excellent pain management resources and can provide emotional support. The vascular surgeon will assess the blood flow to your foot and determine if any intervention is necessary to improve circulation. I realize this isn't what you want to hear, but it's what's best for your health. If we don’t address this infection promptly, it could lead to serious complications, including amputation. I want to help you avoid that at all costs. Let’s get the admission process started, and then we can discuss your concerns with the hospital staff. Do you have a preferred hospital, or should we send you to the closest one?
PATIENT: Amputation…? Oh… dear Lord. No. No, no, no. The closest one… is fine. Whatever is easiest. Just… please, Doctor, make sure they give me something for the pain. And… and can my… can my nephew, Kaleo, be contacted? He’s… he’s the closest thing I have to family. He lives in Honolulu. I… I don't want to be alone. Please, Doctor… just help me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. We will absolutely make sure you’re comfortable and not in pain. And yes, we will contact your nephew, Kaleo, immediately. Please give me his contact information, and I’ll have the admitting staff reach out to him. I understand this is frightening, but we are going to do everything we can to get you through this. We have a wonderful team at the hospital, and they will provide you with the best possible care. I will personally speak with the vascular surgeon and ensure they are aware of your concerns. Let's focus on getting you stabilized first, and then we can address any further concerns. And please, don't hesitate to let me or the hospital staff know if you're experiencing any pain or anxiety. We are here to help.
