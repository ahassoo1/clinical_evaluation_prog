DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a…reset, you know? A jumpstart to feeling like myself again. I’m not sure exactly how to explain it. It’s not a specific illness, just…general fatigue and a lack of motivation, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Stuck” and lacking motivation… those are certainly things we can explore. It’s good you’re recognizing this now. To help me understand what’s going on, let’s try to be a bit more specific. When did you start feeling this way, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It didn’t happen overnight, certainly. If I had to put a timeframe on it… maybe six months ago? Around February, perhaps. Things just slowly started to feel…heavier, I guess. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, but that feels about right. It was gradual.
DOCTOR: Six months, around February… gradual onset. And would you say this feeling has been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. There are days where I feel…okay. Not great, but manageable. I can get things done, you know? But then there are other days… other weeks even… where it’s just… a struggle to get out of bed. It’s not every day, thankfully, but it’s becoming more frequent, those difficult days. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Pitzel. Fluctuating symptoms are quite common. Now, when you say “struggle to get out of bed,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… not physical pain, exactly. It’s more… a weight. A heaviness in my limbs, and just… a complete lack of energy. Like I know I need to do things, but the thought of even starting feels exhausting. And the motivation… it’s just gone. It’s like… trying to push through mud. And I find myself sleeping more, even though I'm tired all the time. Does that sound strange?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound strange at all. It sounds… debilitating, frankly. And you mentioned sleeping more, despite being tired. How many hours of sleep are you typically getting each night?
PATIENT: Oh, it varies. On a good night, maybe seven, seven and a half hours. But then there are nights where I’m tossing and turning, and I end up only getting five, or even less. And even when I do sleep, I don’t always feel rested. It’s… frustrating. I used to be such a sound sleeper.
DOCTOR: Right. Variable sleep, not restorative when you do sleep. Now, Ms. Pitzel, let’s broaden the picture a bit. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Actually, yes. My appetite hasn’t been the same. I used to enjoy cooking, and eating, very much. But now… I just don’t have much of an appetite. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. And when I do, it doesn’t really…satisfy me. I've lost a few pounds, but nothing dramatic.
DOCTOR: A decreased appetite and weight loss… These are important details. Now, are you experiencing any difficulty concentrating, or have you noticed any changes in your memory?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. It's… embarrassing, to be honest. I used to be very organized, very sharp. But now… I forget things constantly. Little things, mostly. Where I put my keys, what I was about to say… And concentrating is… a struggle. If I'm reading, I have to reread paragraphs multiple times to understand them. It’s quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling indeed. Now, Ms. Pitzel, I’m going to ask you a few questions about other potential symptoms. Have you experienced any unexplained aches or pains, changes in your bowel habits, or any feelings of sadness or hopelessness?
PATIENT: Okay. Let's see... Unexplained aches and pains... not really. Maybe a little stiffness in my shoulders sometimes, but nothing consistent. Changes in bowel habits… no, that hasn’t changed. And… feelings of sadness or hopelessness… … yes. I wouldn’t say I’m severely depressed, but… I’ve been feeling… down. A little… lost, perhaps. Not really enjoying things anymore. It’s not constant, but it’s definitely there. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Pitzel. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, let’s briefly discuss your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve been quite healthy, all my life, really. I do have… well, I was diagnosed with mild arthritis in my hands a few years ago, but it’s well-managed with over-the-counter medication. Other than that… no chronic conditions. I take a daily multivitamin, and occasionally ibuprofen for the arthritis, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant medical history. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Nothing major. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was young, but that was it. No other surgeries. I’ve always been lucky, in that regard. Well, aside from this, of course.
DOCTOR: Right. No surgeries. Now, Ms. Pitzel, I'm going to ask about family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or mental health issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, and she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes later in life. My father… he had heart disease. He passed away when he was 75. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, struggled with depression for many years. It wasn’t spoken about much, back then. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Ms. Pitzel. Family history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and depression… Now, finally, let’s briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe once or twice a week. But I don’t drink to excess, and I certainly don’t rely on alcohol. And no, I do not use any recreational drugs. I lead a very… ordinary life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Thank you for providing me with that detailed information. Based on what you’ve told me – the fatigue, lack of motivation, decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, and your family history – it could be a number of things. I’m not prepared to offer a definitive diagnosis at this stage, but we need to investigate further. First, I would like to order some blood work. This will help rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, or anemia. I also want to perform a physical exam. Can I ask you to step onto the scale and then we will move to the exam table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood work and a physical exam… I’m happy to do whatever is necessary. I just want to feel like myself again. Yes, let’s start with the scale.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please step on, and I’ll record your weight. 115 pounds. And your height is 198 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. 198 centimeters. Is that… a cause for concern? I haven't weighed myself in a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Your BMI is 29.3, which places you in the overweight category. While not drastically concerning, it's something we should address in conjunction with your other symptoms. Now, if you'll please follow me to the exam table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then palpate your abdomen. Please lie down.
PATIENT: Alright. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses palpated. I'm also going to check your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Now, I’m going to check your thyroid gland. Thyroid gland is not enlarged, no nodules detected. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable, but that doesn't rule anything out. We’ll send the blood work to the lab. I also want to rule out depression as a potential contributing factor. I’m going to have you complete a brief questionnaire before you leave, the PHQ-9.
PATIENT: A questionnaire… the PHQ-9… Alright. That sounds sensible. I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. It’s just… frustrating not knowing what’s going on. I'm happy to complete the questionnaire. And how long will it take to get the results of the blood work?
DOCTOR: The lab typically takes 2-3 business days to return the results. Once I have them, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on getting regular sleep – aim for 7-8 hours each night – and incorporating a balanced diet into your routine. It’s also important to acknowledge your weight. While I'm not prescribing a strict diet at this time, I encourage you to make small, sustainable changes to your lifestyle, such as increasing your physical activity and reducing your intake of processed foods. Here is the PHQ-9. Please take your time completing it. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, don't hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions before you begin?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all makes sense, Doctor. Sleep, diet, exercise… and the questionnaire. I can certainly do that. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate your thoroughness. I hope the blood work gives us some answers. I think I’m ready to start this now.
DOCTOR: Very good. I'll leave you to complete the questionnaire. The nurse will be in shortly to review it with you and schedule your follow-up appointment. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. I’ll see you in a few days, Ms. Pitzel. .
PATIENT: .
