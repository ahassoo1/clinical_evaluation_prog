DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, okay. My heart… it feels like it’s jumping sometimes. Not always, but when it does… it’s fast. Really fast. Like a bird flapping, you know? It scares my wife a little bit. That’s why I came.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds concerning when your heart rate feels that way. “Jumping” and “fast like a bird flapping” – that’s a helpful way to describe it. And it's good you came in to get it checked out, especially if it worries your wife. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? Okay. It doesn't happen when I’m doing something hard, like work. I lift things all day, big tanks and stuff. It feels… more when I’m just sitting. Or maybe when I’m trying to sleep. Not every night, but sometimes. And it goes away after a little while. Maybe ten, fifteen minutes? I don’t time it. It just… stops.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn’t seem to be directly related to physical exertion, which is helpful to know. It happens more at rest or when you're trying to fall asleep, and it resolves within about ten to fifteen minutes. That gives us a starting point. Have you noticed anything else happen when your heart races like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… else? Let me think. Sometimes… I feel a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, but like… the room is moving a little. And maybe a little short of breath. Like I can’t get a full breath. But it goes away when my heart slows down. It’s all… together, you know? Heart fast, dizzy, hard to breathe. Then… normal again.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense – those symptoms often go hand-in-hand. So, fast heart rate, dizziness – not severe enough to make you fall, but noticeable – and shortness of breath that resolves when the heart rate slows. Now, have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. This is new. Maybe… a few weeks? I don’t remember exactly. My wife noticed it first, she said I looked… scared. I didn’t feel scared, just… weird. And then it happened again a few days later. And then… it started happening sometimes when I try to sleep. That's why I came. I don't want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new development, starting a few weeks ago. Your wife noticed it first, which is good she’s paying attention. It's good you came in now, before it gets worse. Let’s go through some other information to help me understand the situation better. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I’ve been lucky. I work hard, eat okay… I try to, anyway. My wife cooks. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time. Maybe five years? Just for a check-up. Everything was fine then. No problems. I don't take any pills, or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. No known medical conditions, haven't needed regular medical care recently, and no current medications. Have you ever had any surgery or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, but that’s it. Just a cast. My wife says I’m too tough to get sick! She jokes, you know? But really, I haven’t needed the hospital. I try to be careful at work. Big tanks can be dangerous.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. So, no surgeries or hospitalizations, just a broken arm as a child. Now, do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had any heart problems, like heart disease, arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac death?
PATIENT: Hmm… family? That’s a hard one. My father… he died when I was young. A car accident. I don't really remember him. My mother… she lived a long life. She died when she was old, just… old age. I don't think she had heart problems. Maybe a little high blood pressure? My wife says her grandfather had something with his heart, but I don't know what. It was a long time ago. She doesn't remember exactly. Yemen… it’s hard to get good doctors there. People don't talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Father passed away young in an accident, mother lived a long life, possibly with high blood pressure. Wife’s grandfather had some heart issue, but details are limited. It can be difficult to get comprehensive family medical history, especially when family members are far away or information is limited. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I work, Doctor. Chemical equipment… it’s hard work. I lift things, clean tanks, check the machines. Long hours. I come home, eat dinner with my wife, watch some TV, go to sleep. I don’t drink alcohol, don't smoke. I try to eat healthy, but sometimes it’s hard. My wife makes good food, but I like sweet things sometimes. I don’t really exercise… I get enough exercise at work, you know? I don't have time for the gym.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a physically demanding job, long hours, don’t drink or smoke, and try to eat a healthy diet. You get limited recreational exercise due to work commitments. Just one more question for now, and it’s an important one. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. Never. My wife always asks, but I don’t have any. No problems with food, no problems with anything. She worries, you know? But I’ve never had an allergic reaction. I can eat anything. She makes spicy food, sometimes too spicy! But no allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. No known allergies. Okay, Mr. Puder, thank you for providing me with all of that information. It’s very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me – the fast heart rate that comes on at rest or when falling asleep, the dizziness and shortness of breath, the lack of prior medical problems, family history, and allergies – I'd like to do a physical examination now, if you're comfortable with that. It will allow me to listen to your heart and lungs and check your overall health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Sounds good. I trust you. I want to know what’s wrong. I just… I don’t like being scared. My wife gets worried when my heart does that thing. So, if you can find out what’s going on… that would be good. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, and I will do my best to determine the cause of your symptoms. Alright, if you could please lie down on the examination table, we’ll get started. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. This may feel a little cold. Okay, your heart rate is currently a little elevated, around 98 beats per minute, which isn't dramatically high, but it’s on the faster side. I’m also hearing a slight irregularity in the rhythm. It’s subtle, but it’s there. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your pulse is a little weak, but regular besides the irregularity I heard with the stethoscope. Your blood pressure is 130/85, which is slightly elevated. Your throat looks clear, and your ears are normal. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your extremities have good pulses, but they are a little cool to the touch. Okay, Mr. Puder, based on the physical exam, I’m hearing a subtle irregularity in your heart rhythm, slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure, and cool extremities. These findings, along with your symptoms, suggest a possible arrhythmia – an irregular heartbeat. However, to get a more definitive diagnosis, I’d like to order some tests. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests, Doctor? I don’t like needles. And I don’t have a lot of money. I work hard, but it’s not easy. What do you need to find out? And will it cost a lot?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about needles and the cost, Mr. Puder, and I’ll do my best to minimize both. The primary test I’m recommending is an electrocardiogram, or ECG. It’s a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t involve any needles. We just place some small, sticky patches on your chest, arms, and legs. Additionally, I’d like to order a basic blood panel to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and thyroid levels. This does require a small blood draw, but it provides important information that can help rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. As for the cost, I’ll have the billing department check your insurance status and provide you with an estimate before proceeding with any tests. We can also discuss options for financial assistance if needed. We don't want cost to be a barrier to getting you the care you need. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… no needles for the first one is good. And you’ll check about the money? My wife is good with that stuff. She’ll want to know how much it costs. So, you think this test… the ECG… will tell you what’s wrong? I just want to know why my heart does that thing. And how to make it stop. Is it dangerous? I don't want to die, Doctor. That would scare my wife too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Puder. It's natural to be worried when your heart is behaving irregularly. The ECG is a very helpful first step in determining the cause of your symptoms. It allows us to visualize your heart rhythm and identify any abnormalities. Regarding whether it’s dangerous, it’s difficult to say definitively without knowing the specific cause of the irregularity. Some arrhythmias are harmless, while others require treatment. That's why the ECG and blood tests are important – they help us assess the risk and determine the appropriate course of action. We will be able to better assess risk after we get the results. Let me assure you that we will take every precaution to ensure your safety. We’ll discuss the results thoroughly and develop a plan that’s right for you. I will explain everything clearly, and we can discuss any concerns you have. And I will be sure to ask you to come back for a follow-up if any symptoms worsen. I’ll have the billing department contact your wife with an estimate for the tests, and we can schedule them as soon as possible. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… talk to my wife about the money. That’s good. And you’ll tell me what it means? And what happens next? I trust you, Doctor. You seem… nice. But I still get scared when my heart does that thing. Maybe if I know what’s wrong… it won't be so scary. I’ll wait for my wife to talk to the money people. And then… schedule the test. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s not too bad. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Puder. I understand your anxiety, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. We'll take things one step at a time, and I promise to explain everything clearly. I will make sure my staff contacts your wife to discuss the cost of the tests. Once we have that sorted, we'll schedule the ECG. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you leave?
