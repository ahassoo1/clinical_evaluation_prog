DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I’m not entirely certain why I’m here. My husband insisted. Something about… settling in? We just moved, you see. From… well, a place. A perfectly good place, really. And frankly, I haven't the time for these things. Is there a form I need to fill out? I do hate paperwork.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Candice. It’s very common to feel a bit overwhelmed after a move, and a check-up to ensure everything is settled health-wise is a wonderful idea – thank you for coming in. Your husband sounds like a very thoughtful man. Yes, there is a brief form to update our records, mostly about insurance and medications. It shouldn’t take too long. I have a nurse who can assist you with that, or I can quickly go over the basics with you now if you prefer. Which would you find easier?
PATIENT: Easier? Honestly, either is… bothersome. If it must be done, just… get it over with, I suppose. Quickly is always preferable. I have a luncheon, you see. Very important people will be there. Medicare is my insurance, I believe. And I take… a small white pill. For… something. My husband handles all that, really. He's very organized. Just… ask him, dear. It will be much faster.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candice. We can certainly get through this quickly. It sounds like your husband is very helpful. Let's just focus on a few basic questions for now, and we can certainly ask him about the specifics of your medication later. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens, I haven't given that a thought in decades. I suppose… dust, perhaps? Old houses always bothered my sinuses. And… shellfish, I think? Though I rarely eat it. It’s rather… common. All those little legs. Dreadful. Is that what you need to know? Just the common things? I haven't the energy for a detailed inventory, dear.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Candice, thank you. “Common things” is perfectly alright for now. We can always delve deeper if needed. Now, thinking about your overall health, have you been experiencing any new or unusual symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, I am 79, Doctor. One has symptoms at my age. Aches, mostly. And… a general weariness. It’s the price of a life well-lived, I suppose. Nothing alarming. I move a bit slower than I used to, naturally. And my memory… isn't what it was. But honestly, whose is at my age? I assure you, I’m perfectly… functional. Is this going to take much longer? I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: I understand, Candice. It’s perfectly normal to experience changes as we age. We’re just trying to get a comprehensive picture of your current health status. You are right to point out these things, and I appreciate you sharing them with me. Could you tell me a little more about the “weariness” you mentioned?
PATIENT: It’s… pervasive, Doctor. A general lack of… oomph. I used to be quite the social butterfly, you see. Always attending events, volunteering, hosting parties. Now… I find myself preferring a quiet afternoon. It’s not an illness, dear. It’s… contentment. Or perhaps… resignation. Honestly, I can't quite put my finger on it. It just… is. And frankly, it's rather exhausting to discuss. Is there a point to all of this? My husband said something about a blood pressure check?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candice. It’s good to know you’ve had an active life. It sounds like you’re a very vibrant person. We are simply trying to ensure there isn’t a medical reason for this change in energy levels. Your husband is correct; a blood pressure check is a good starting point. It’s a quick and easy way to assess your overall cardiovascular health. Would you mind if I listened to your heart and lungs, and then take your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Get it over with, then. I suppose it can't be that unpleasant. Though I do dislike the cold instruments. And please be gentle. I’m a delicate flower, you know. A very delicate flower. Just… hurry, if you would. I really must be going soon. The luncheon… it’s a rather important engagement.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candice. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, let's start with listening to your heart. I'm hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, which is not necessarily concerning at your age, but something we should monitor. Your lungs sound clear on both sides. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145 over 85.
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that… bad? My husband always harps on about blood pressure. He’s terribly anxious, you see. Always worrying about something. He probably inflated the numbers just to get me to come here. Honestly, I told him I felt perfectly fine. Elevated… well, that sounds… ominous. Is there something I need to do? Some sort of medication? I really don’t want to be taking more pills, dear. It’s such a bother.
DOCTOR: It’s good that your husband is attentive to your health, Candice. A blood pressure of 145/85 is slightly elevated, but it's not necessarily cause for immediate alarm. It's common for blood pressure to fluctuate, and we often see readings slightly higher in a clinical setting due to anxiety. We want to ensure it’s consistently managed, though. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to repeat the blood pressure reading in a few minutes, after you’ve had a chance to relax a bit. In the meantime, we can discuss some lifestyle modifications that can often help lower blood pressure, such as diet and exercise. We can also explore the possibility of home blood pressure monitoring to track your readings over time. As for medication, let's hold off on that for now. We’ll see what your readings are like after we repeat the test. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Agreeable? I suppose. Though I haven’t the energy for “lifestyle modifications.” I prefer a quiet life, as I mentioned. And exercise? Heavens, no. I used to play tennis, but that was decades ago. A glass of sherry and a good book are my preferred forms of recreation. But very well. Repeat the test. And then… can we be finished? I really must be going. My luncheon… the attendees are quite important. And I haven’t even chosen what to wear yet! Honestly, this whole ordeal has been terribly disruptive. Is there anything else you need to know? Because I’m quite certain I’ve exhausted my medical history.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candice. We’ll repeat the blood pressure reading now. And then, we’ll discuss next steps, taking your preferences and lifestyle into consideration. We can certainly prioritize getting you back to your luncheon. Okay, your blood pressure is now 140 over 80. That's a slight improvement, which is good. It’s still a bit elevated, but not significantly so. Before we finalize anything, could you tell me if you have any known allergies to medications, and if you're currently taking any vitamins or supplements in addition to the small white pill you mentioned earlier?
PATIENT: Allergies… as I said, dust, perhaps. And possibly shellfish. Though I rarely eat it. As for vitamins… honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea. My husband handles all of that. He’s terribly organized, you see. Always making sure I’m taking something. I think… a multivitamin, perhaps? And calcium, for my bones. He’s very concerned about osteoporosis. Honestly, I try not to pay attention to it all. It’s such a bother, keeping track of everything. Is this absolutely necessary? I really must be going soon. The luncheon… it’s a very important engagement. And I haven’t even chosen my hat!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Candice. It sounds like your husband is very attentive to your health. We can certainly clarify the specifics with him later. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings from the brief examination, it seems you’re generally healthy, though your blood pressure is slightly elevated. I recommend we monitor your blood pressure at home for a week. I can provide you with a simple device and instructions. We’ll also discuss some gentle lifestyle changes that may help lower your blood pressure. And I’ll follow up with your husband to get a complete medication list. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Home monitoring… more gadgets. Honestly, I’m drowning in gadgets. But very well. If it will get me off the hook, so to speak. And yes, speak to my husband. He’ll be delighted. He loves to talk about medical things. As for the “lifestyle changes”… I suppose gentle is key. No strenuous activity, I trust? I really must be going soon. The luncheon… it’s a very important engagement. And I haven’t even chosen my shoes! Honestly, this whole ordeal has been terribly disruptive. Is there anything else you need to know? Because I’m quite certain I’ve exhausted my medical history. .
DOCTOR: No, nothing further at this time, Candice. We’ve covered everything for today. I’ll have the nurse provide you with instructions for home blood pressure monitoring and a device to use. And I will reach out to your husband to discuss your medications and any concerns he may have. Thank you for coming in today. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And enjoy your luncheon! .
