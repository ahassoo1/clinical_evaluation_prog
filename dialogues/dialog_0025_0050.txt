DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Pavlovic… yes, that’s right. It’s… well, it’s this cough. Been with me a long time, this cough. A dry cough. Feels like something stuck in my throat, but there ain’t nothing in there. Just… dry. Hard to explain, really. I mostly just deal with it.
DOCTOR: A long time, you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Years, I reckon. Maybe… five? Ten? Time gets away from you when you’re old, you know? I mostly just try to ignore it. It doesn't… well, it doesn’t keep me up at night, not usually. But it's always there. Just a little tickle, then a dry… hack.
DOCTOR: And has anything changed about it recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I don’t know. Maybe… a little worse lately? Not much, but… it feels like I’m clearing my throat more. And… well, my daughter, May, she says I sound more… raspy. I don’t notice it myself, much. She worries, that one.
DOCTOR: May says you sound raspy… Alright. And do you have any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Not that I’ve noticed. I get a little tired, maybe, but I'm ninety years old! A little tired seems normal, doesn't it? No fever, no… chest pain. Nothing like that. Just… the cough. And a little tired. Mostly just the cough.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh, goodness. I don’t know. May does most of the cooking now. She says I don’t eat as much as I used to, but… I just haven’t been very hungry, I suppose. It's hard to say if I’ve lost weight. I don’t weigh myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s have a listen to your lungs, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Lungs, you say? I haven’t had my lungs listened to in… well, I don't rightly remember ever having my lungs listened to. Sounds important, I suppose.
DOCTOR: If you’ll just sit up straight and take some deep breaths for me. I'm going to listen to your back and your chest. Try to breathe normally, but a little deeper than usual.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Deep breaths… right. Like this? Oh dear. Sorry. This cough always seems to come at the wrong time.
DOCTOR: Alright. I do hear some… diminished breath sounds, especially on the lower lobes. And a bit of… wheezing. It's not terribly dramatic, but it is present. Now, I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. Just hold still.
PATIENT: Oxygen… saturation? Sounds… scientific. Diminished… what was it? Diminished breath sounds… Is that bad, Doctor? I don’t mean to bother you with questions. I just… don’t understand all this medical talk.
DOCTOR: It means your lungs aren’t moving quite as much air as they should be. Your oxygen is… acceptable, at 92%, but not ideal. Given your age and the length of this cough, and the diminished breath sounds, I'd like to get a chest X-ray. Just to rule out anything serious. We need to see what’s going on in there. Do you have any problems with X-rays?
PATIENT: X-ray… Oh dear. I don't think so. I… I don't remember ever having one. But… I don't have any reason to not have one, do I? No, I don't think so. Is it… painful? I don’t like being poked and prodded, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: No, it's not painful at all. You just stand still for a moment while a machine takes a picture of your lungs. It doesn’t involve any needles or anything like that. It’s very quick and easy. We’ll send you over to radiology, and they’ll take care of it. I'll also order a basic blood test to check your overall health. It's just to get a more complete picture. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… not that I know of. May gives me something for my arthritis sometimes, but I don't think I've ever had a bad reaction to anything. I mostly just take what she gives me. She’s very good at taking care of things. Arthritis is the main thing, you know? But no allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I’m going to write an order for the X-ray and the blood tests. The radiology department is just down the hall, and they'll let you know when they're ready for you. Once you have those done, please come back and let me know. We'll discuss the results then. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you an inhaler. It’s a bronchodilator – it will help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It won't cure the cough, but it should provide some relief. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Inhaler… Oh dear. Another thing. Bron… bronco… what was it? It opens up my airways? I… I’m not sure I understand. Does it… does it have side effects? I don’t want to be dizzy or anything like that. May would be very upset if I fell.
DOCTOR: Alright. An inhaler is a small device you breathe into. It delivers medication directly to your lungs. The bronchodilator helps to relax the muscles around your airways, making it easier for air to get in and out. As for side effects, most people don't experience any. Sometimes it can cause a slight tremor or a racing heart, but those are usually mild and temporary. If you do experience any unwanted effects, just let us know. We'll write down clear instructions on how to use it. It's important to follow them carefully. May can help you with that. Do you want me to show you how to use it now before you go for the tests?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that sounds… complicated. If May can help, that would be best. I don’t think I’d remember all that right now. Too much information, you see? If you could just… write down the instructions, and she can help me with it. That would be much easier. And yes, please, write it down very clearly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here you are. It explains everything in detail. Make sure May reads it carefully before you use the inhaler. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to call the office. The radiology department is right down the hall. Just tell them Dr. Fourney sent you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. We’ll discuss the results of your tests when you come back. Hopefully, it's nothing serious.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. I will make sure May reads it. And… yes, I’ll come back when I have the tests done. Thank you very much.
