DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're sixty-five years of age. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Clide is fine. Yeah, sixty-five. Look, I've been gettin' these fevers, on and off. Happens outta nowhere. It's a pain, really. I just want to figure out what’s goin’ on so I can get back to work. I’m a chiropractor, you know? Can’t be layin’ around.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I understand wanting to get back to work as quickly as possible, especially with your profession. Fevers coming and going is certainly something we should investigate. To help me understand what’s happening, could you tell me a little more about these fevers?
PATIENT: Well, they don’t last long, usually. Maybe a couple of hours, tops. I get chills, feel really weak, then I sweat a lot. Then it’s just… gone. Happens maybe once a week, sometimes not for a couple of weeks. It’s hard to say. I haven't taken my temperature regularly, to be honest. Just feel awful when it hits.
DOCTOR: I see. So, these fevers are intermittent, lasting a couple of hours, accompanied by chills and weakness, followed by sweating. And they occur roughly once a week, though not consistently. Do you notice any other symptoms around the time you experience these fevers?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. No cough, no sore throat. Sometimes my joints ache a little, but I'm old, Doctor, everything aches! I don’t get headaches or anything like that. Just the chills, the weakness, and the sweat. It’s just… weird. And it’s been happenin’ for maybe a month now, I guess. Hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no cough, sore throat, or headaches accompanying the fevers. You've mentioned some joint aches, which you attribute to age, and this has been occurring for about a month. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Nah, appetite's been the same. I eat like a horse, always have. And my weight… hasn’t changed a bit. Still a skinny 121 pounds, if you must know. My wife keeps tellin’ me to eat more, but I’m fine. Really.
DOCTOR: Good to know your appetite and weight haven’t changed. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bad back, obviously, that's why I'm a chiropractor! But other than that, nothing major. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothin' like that. Just the usual old man stuff. I don’t take any regular medications, either. I try to stay natural, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, so no significant past medical history aside from your back issues, and you aren’t currently taking any medications. You prefer to stay natural, which is good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had a surgery. Always avoided 'em if I could. Too risky, I always thought. I fixed other people's backs, never needed fixin’ myself, 'til I got older, that is. Still managed okay without surgery.
DOCTOR: Good to know you haven't had any surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… is there a history of any serious illnesses in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had some heart trouble when she got old, I think. And my father… he had cancer, lung cancer. Smoked his whole life, unfortunately. My brother’s okay, as far as I know. Nothing major on his side either. That’s about it, really. We weren't a big family for talkin’ about health problems.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. It’s helpful to know about the history of heart trouble and lung cancer in your family. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy in my life. Lucky me, I guess. I can eat anything, take anything. Doesn’t bother me none.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to know. Alright, Clide, let’s move on to a quick physical examination. I'd like to check your temperature, pulse, blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your throat and lymph nodes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just wanna get this figured out. Let’s get it over with. I got patients waitin’ on me this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, your temperature is slightly elevated at 100.2°F. Your pulse and blood pressure are within normal limits. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear – no wheezing or crackles detected. I’m now going to check your throat and lymph nodes. Your throat looks clear, and your lymph nodes are a little enlarged, but not significantly tender to the touch. Given your intermittent fevers, slightly elevated temperature, and mildly enlarged lymph nodes, there are several possibilities we need to consider. While it could be a common viral illness, we should rule out other causes. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever tests you think are necessary, Doctor. Just get me back to work. A CBC and… metabolic panel, you said? Sounds good. How long will it take to get the results? And how much will it cost? I ain’t insured, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Clide. I’ll write the orders for the CBC and metabolic panel now. The lab typically takes 24-48 hours to return the results. Regarding the cost, as you mentioned you are uninsured, the lab will likely charge a self-pay rate. I don't have the exact amount available at this moment, but I can have our billing department contact you directly with an estimate of the costs before the tests are performed. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yeah, please. That would be great. I don’t wanna get stuck with a huge bill I can’t pay. Just let the billing department give me a call. They got my number, right? I just wanna know what I’m lookin’ at, cost-wise. And when I can expect the results. Two days, you said?
DOCTOR: Yes, two business days is typical, so you should have the results by August 4th. And yes, our billing department has your contact information. They will call you with an estimate of the costs before the tests are processed. In the meantime, while we await the results, I recommend getting plenty of rest and drinking fluids. If your fever spikes above 101°F, or if you develop any new symptoms such as a severe headache, stiff neck, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Rest and fluids… got it. And call 911 if it gets bad. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you lookin’ into this. Now, can I go? I really gotta get back to my patients. I'm sure they're wonderin' where I am.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. Of course. I’ll have the lab orders sent over immediately and our billing department will be in touch shortly. Thank you for coming in today, and please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before the results are available. Get well soon, and I hope to see you back in good health.
