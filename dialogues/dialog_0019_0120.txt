DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, honestly? I don’t have all day to explain my life story. I just...want to get pregnant. Simple as that. I lost my husband a couple years back, and I want a baby before...well, before it’s too late. I don’t want any trouble getting pregnant, you know? I just want it to work. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Carmaleta. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to understand what’s going on and make sure everything is as smooth as possible. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and wanting to build a family is a beautiful thing. Now, to get a better idea of things, could you tell me a little bit more about your cycles?
PATIENT: Cycles? Honestly, I barely pay attention. They… happen. Every month. I mean, I know when they happen, roughly, but I don't keep a calendar or anything. It's not like I was trying not to get pregnant before, you know? It just… never really came up. Is this going to be a long thing? Because I have errands.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright if you haven't been tracking things meticulously. We can work with that. Knowing roughly when your cycles happen is a good start. And no, we’ll try not to make this too long. Just to get a little more specific, could you tell me, on average, how long does a period usually last?
PATIENT: Ugh, four… maybe five days? Sometimes shorter, sometimes a bit longer. It varies. Honestly, they’re just… annoying. Look, is this important? Will knowing how long I bleed help me get pregnant faster? I really don't understand why this is even necessary.
DOCTOR: It is important, Carmaleta, and I apologize if it feels like a lot of questions. The length of your cycle and your period can give us clues about your hormone levels, which are very important for getting pregnant. It helps us understand if everything is working the way it should be. It’s like… if you’re trying to bake a cake, you need to know the ingredients are fresh and the oven temperature is right. Now, besides the length of your period, have you noticed any changes in your cycles lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Well... they've been a bit irregular, I guess. Not hugely, but sometimes they're a few days early, sometimes a few days late. I haven't really thought about it much, honestly. Like I said, I don't really track these things. Is this because I'm getting older? Don't tell me I'm running out of time… I really don't want to hear that.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to have some variation in your cycle, especially as we get older. And I promise, I won’t jump to any conclusions about running out of time. But it's good you mentioned the irregularity, that's helpful information. Now, have you been trying to get pregnant for a specific amount of time?
PATIENT: No! Not really. Like, I've... been with someone a few times, and we weren't trying to prevent anything, but we also weren't actively trying, you know? It's all been very casual. So, no, I haven’t been trying for any length of time. This is… new. And honestly, a bit scary. I just want it to be easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful to know, Carmaleta. So, it’s fairly recent that you’ve started thinking about actively trying to conceive. That makes a difference. And it’s perfectly normal to feel a bit scared, especially after everything you’ve been through. Now, do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Uh... not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox, but nothing major. I'm generally healthy, I think. I try to eat well, though I do love a good pastry now and then. No diabetes, no high blood pressure… I don’t take any regular medication. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Carmaleta. No major medical conditions or medications is a good starting point. And enjoying a pastry now and then is perfectly fine! Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I barely remember my childhood, let alone hospital visits. I think I had my tonsils out when I was little… but that was ages ago. Nothing since, I don't think. I really hope we’re almost done here. This is taking up my whole morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child is good to know. And we are getting there, Carmaleta. Just a few more questions. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh, family… Honestly, my mother's side… a lot of heart problems. And my aunt, on my father’s side, had… cancer, I think. Breast cancer. It was a long time ago, I barely knew her. But that’s all I really know. My family wasn’t big on sharing medical details.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems on your mother’s side and breast cancer in your aunt. That's helpful information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've never had any bad reactions to anything. I can eat anything, take anything, no problems. Honestly, I'm pretty robust. I just want to know if I need to worry about something preventing me from getting pregnant. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. And being robust is excellent! Now, to get a complete picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic abdominal exam. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, an exam? Really? Do I have to? I mean, I guess… if you insist. But please be quick. I have errands to run, and honestly, I'm not a fan of doctors.
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. It won’t take long, I promise. Just a quick check to make sure everything looks good. If you could just have a seat on the table, we'll start with your blood pressure. Okay, blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is good. Now let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. No tenderness or masses noted. Everything feels normal so far.
PATIENT: Ugh, just get it over with. Honestly, I hate being poked and prodded. Is that it? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s it, Carmaleta. The exam was normal. Everything felt good. Now, to get a clearer picture of what's going on, I’d like to order some basic blood tests. These will check your hormone levels, thyroid function, and some other things that can affect fertility. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Honestly, this is ridiculous. But… fine. If you really think it's necessary. Just… tell me how to do them, and how long it'll take. And please don’t make me come back a million times.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It’s not ideal, but these tests will give us a much clearer picture and help me understand the best way to help you. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll draw a small amount of blood. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. The results usually take about 5-7 business days to come back. Here’s the form. Take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of everything. Once I have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a plan. Do you have any questions about the tests or the follow-up?
PATIENT: Ugh, 5-7 days? That's ages! Fine. I guess I'll go do it. Just... try to remember that I don't have all day. And please, no complicated medical jargon when you tell me the results. I want it explained in plain English. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. I promise to explain everything in plain English. And I’ll do my best to remember that your time is valuable. Here's a pamphlet with some helpful information about fertility in the meantime. Thank you for coming in today. I look forward to seeing you again when the results are back. .
