DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… lab work, right? That’s what the nice lady on the phone said. Just need to get that done. Honestly, I don’t really remember why exactly, just that I need it. Getting old, you know? Things slip your mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you have some routine lab work scheduled. It looks like your primary care physician, Dr. Chen, ordered it. Do you happen to know what specifically Dr. Chen wanted checked?
PATIENT: Dr. Chen… now that rings a bell. A kind fella, I think. But what he wanted checked… shoot, no. I see doctors a lot, you know? Power plant work… always getting checked up on. It all blurs together. Is it important I know? Can't you just… do the tests? I'm trying to get this over with, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Croonquist. It can be a lot to keep track of. The tests Dr. Chen ordered include a Complete Blood Count, a Basic Metabolic Panel, a Lipid Panel, and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test. These are fairly standard blood tests. Knowing why he ordered them helps me interpret the results and make sure we’re looking at the right things, but we can proceed with the tests as scheduled. Would you like me to briefly explain what each test checks for, or would you prefer I just get things started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot of words. Look, I appreciate it, Doctor, but if it’s not urgent, just… the tests are fine. Whatever Dr. Chen thinks is best. I trust him. I really just want to get this done, if that's alright. Is there paperwork? Or do we just… get poked?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist, we can certainly proceed that way. There's a brief consent form just confirming you agree to the blood draw. It's mostly standard language. I'll have the nurse, Maria, come in and get you set up. She'll draw the blood and then we'll send it to the lab. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, and then we can schedule a follow-up to discuss them. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Sounds…fine. Just as quick as possible would be great. I've got things to do, you see. Maria, you said? Alright. Just let me know when she's ready. I'll try not to faint. Old man problems, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. Maria is very experienced. She'll make sure you're comfortable. I'll let her know you're ready. Just relax, and she'll be in shortly. I’ll also make a note on your chart regarding your preference for a quick turnaround on the results.
PATIENT: Good. That's… good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. Just… wake me when it's over.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Croonquist. We’ll take good care of you. I’ll leave you to rest, and Maria will be with you momentarily. Please don’t hesitate to let us know if you feel unwell at any time.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… tell her to be gentle, okay? Old veins, you see. .
DOCTOR: I certainly will, Mr. Croonquist. I’ll make sure she’s aware. .
