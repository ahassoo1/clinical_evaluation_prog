DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… a letter, I think? Something about a pet. My niece, she said I needed a… a paper from a doctor. For the building, you know? They’re being fussy all of a sudden. Honestly, people these days… I can’t quite recall what they need it for, exactly. Something about ownership? Is that right? It’s all a bit of a bother, really.
DOCTOR: A letter… regarding a pet?
PATIENT: Yes, a pet. A lovely little thing, a Pomeranian. Fluffy. Very fluffy. Though, honestly, I don’t remember the name. My niece, Tolu, she’s the one who handles all that. She said something about the landlord needing proof… proof that I have a pet. And that I am responsible for it. You know, standard things. Is this a complicated letter? Because I really don't have time for… fuss.
DOCTOR: Right. A pet registration form, then. A formality, really. Though, I must say, it is rather unusual to require a physician's attestation for pet ownership. Are you experiencing any health issues related to the pet, Ms. Wrye?
PATIENT: Health issues? Goodness, no! The little thing is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Though… sometimes the hair gets everywhere. All over my clothes, the sofa… it’s a nuisance, I suppose. But not a health issue. Honestly, Doctor, I just need the paper so they’ll stop bothering me. My niece said something about allergies for other tenants… is that what this is about? It’s just a fluffy dog.
DOCTOR: Allergies are a legitimate concern, Ms. Wrye. It is my professional responsibility to ascertain if your pet poses any health risks to others, or if you are experiencing any respiratory or dermatological issues potentially caused by the animal. Let's begin with a brief review of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies yourself?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. Well, I used to get hay fever as a child, I think. But that was ages ago! And I haven’t had it in years. As for anything else… no, not that I recall. I generally have a strong constitution. I eat well, mostly. And I certainly haven’t noticed anything… unusual, regarding my breathing or skin. Really, Doctor, are you sure this is necessary? This feels like a lot of trouble over a small dog.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had that… that little thing with my back a few years ago. Nothing serious, just a twinge. It flares up sometimes when I garden, but I manage it. I take some… some pills for it, occasionally. Nothing else, really. I try to stay active, you know? Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. Are we getting anywhere with this paper? Because I really do have appointments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: The “pills” you mentioned – could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. They’re… small and white, I believe. And I get them from… the pharmacy, naturally. Tolu usually picks them up for me. I don't bother with remembering names, honestly. It's all a bit much. They're for my back, like I said. Makes it easier to bend over for the garden, mostly. Ibuprofen, maybe? Or something like that. I really wouldn't know. I just take them when it hurts. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important to have a comprehensive understanding of your medications, Ms. Wrye. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and while generally safe, it can have interactions and side effects. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Oh, yes! I had my gallbladder removed, years ago. A long time ago. When Tolu was still very small. It was a… a necessary thing, the doctor said. I don’t remember much about it, to be honest. It was all a bit of a blur. Aside from that… no, I don’t believe so. I’ve always been rather lucky, health-wise. Though, admittedly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Are we still on about this paper? This is quite exhausting, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, dear. That’s a… a tricky one. My mother… she lived a long life, thankfully. But she had… high blood pressure, I think? And my father… he had some sort of heart trouble, later in life. But beyond that… I really couldn’t say. We weren’t terribly close, you see. It was a large family, and we didn’t keep up with each other much. I mostly just remember they both enjoyed gardening. Is this really necessary for a pet letter? I mean, I just want them to leave me alone!
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, with all due respect, I am attempting to ascertain whether you have any underlying medical conditions that could be exacerbated by pet ownership, or pose a risk to others. Now, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit, really. My mother always said it was terribly bad for you, and I took her word for it. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, though. A nice Chardonnay. But that’s hardly the same thing as smoking, is it? Honestly, Doctor, this feels like a complete waste of time. I just need a piece of paper. Surely there’s a form I can sign?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration, but I must fulfill my professional obligations. Now, regarding allergies – have you noticed any skin rashes, sneezing, or difficulty breathing since acquiring this pet?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake! No, I haven't! Honestly, you are being terribly repetitive. I told you, I'm perfectly healthy. And the dog is perfectly healthy! I haven't noticed any sneezing or rashes or… whatever else you're asking about. It's a fluffy dog, Doctor. A perfectly lovely, fluffy dog. And I just need a letter to prove I own it. Can we please just get to that? I have things to do, you know. This is becoming quite… stressful.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will document that you deny any significant health issues, allergies, or respiratory symptoms. However, I must advise that any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to your primary care physician immediately. Now, as for the pet… I will write a brief statement confirming that you are in possession of a canine companion. But I will also include a disclaimer stating that I have not conducted a comprehensive medical evaluation to assess the pet's impact on your health. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A disclaimer? Honestly. But… yes, that’s… acceptable. As long as it gets them off my back. Can I have it now? And… is there a charge for all this… questioning? Because, frankly, I think it’s a bit much for a letter about a dog. A perfectly lovely, fluffy dog, I might add. Just… hurry up, please. I’m starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: Here you are. The cost for the office visit is \$75. I trust this will resolve the matter. And Ms. Wrye, I strongly advise you to consult with a specialist if you experience any new or unusual symptoms. .
PATIENT: \$75! Goodness gracious. Well, thank you, Doctor. Though, honestly, it feels a bit… excessive. Still. I suppose it's better than dealing with the landlord. .
