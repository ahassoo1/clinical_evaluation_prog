DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I'm Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about this… clearance thing. For… work. Something about a physical. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details. My daughter signed me up, I think. It has to do with… acting, maybe? Or something on a stage. It's all a bit fuzzy. I just want to get it over with if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Acting, you say?
PATIENT: Yes… or performing. Something like that. I used to… well, I used to work at the theaters, taking tickets and showing people to their seats. Maybe it’s connected to that? It's been a long time. Honestly, I’m not sure what they need me to do for this clearance. Just tell me what needs to be checked, Doctor. I’m a simple man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. We'll do a standard physical, then. It covers the basics - height, weight, blood pressure, heart and lungs, reflexes... and a little bit of everything in between. It’s standard procedure for…well, for anyone needing a clearance. Do you have any known allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I recall. I mean, I sneeze sometimes, like everyone does, but I don’t think I’m allergic to anything specifically. I eat everything my daughter cooks, and she puts all sorts of things in her food! No, I don't think so. No allergies, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, herbal supplements…anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. My daughter keeps trying to get me to take those… fish oil pills. For my brain, she says. But I mostly forget. And sometimes a pain reliever for my… back. When it acts up. Just the regular kind you get at the drugstore. Nothing special, Doctor. Really. Just the pain pills when I need them, and the fish oil sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. And how often would you say you take the pain reliever?
PATIENT: Oh, not very often, I promise. When I really strain myself. Maybe… once or twice a month? It depends. If I’ve been gardening, or helping my daughter with something heavy. Sometimes not at all for a few months. I really try not to take it unless I absolutely have to. It doesn't always work very well, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Oh my… serious conditions? Well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high. But he said it was nothing to worry about too much, just to watch my salt. And… I think my back… they said something about a disc when I was younger, but I don't really remember all the details. Mostly just aches and pains, Doctor. Nothing major, I don't think. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise.
DOCTOR: "A little high," you say?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s what he said. A little high. He gave me a pamphlet about it, and my daughter started making all my food low-sodium. It went down after that, I think. I haven't been back to the doctor in a while, so I’m not sure. It’s… all a bit of a blur, honestly. I'm old, Doctor. Things slip my mind.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. My appendix, when I was a boy. That’s the only thing I can recall. A long, long time ago. Everything went fine, as far as I remember. It was… a very long time ago, Doctor. I don’t think there’s been anything since then.
DOCTOR: And your family?
PATIENT: My family? Well, my daughter, of course. She's taking good care of me. And… my ex-wife. We don’t talk much anymore. As for health problems… my mother, she had… something with her heart, I think. But she lived a long life. My father… he was a strong man, never really sick a day in his life. That’s about all I remember, Doctor. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t really paying attention to medical things back then.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get a little bit of physical information. You said you're 69, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Sixty-nine. Though I don’t feel sixty-nine, sometimes. Mostly I just feel… tired. But yes, sixty-nine. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Krahn. Now, I see here your height is listed as 199cm. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Is it? That sounds awfully tall. I haven’t been measured in years. I suppose so. I’m a big man, always have been. My daughter probably wrote that down. I just go along with what she says. Yes, 199cm sounds about right, I think. Though, it feels… exaggerated.
DOCTOR: And your weight?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My weight… Well, I haven’t weighed myself recently. I think it’s… around 118 pounds? Give or take. I’ve always been on the lighter side. My daughter keeps trying to get me to eat more.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's get a physical exam done, then. Please step onto the scale. And then, if you could loosen your shirt, I'll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Alright. I suppose so. It's been a long time since I had a proper check-up. I hope I don't embarrass myself.
DOCTOR: 118 pounds, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s what my daughter tells me, anyway. Oh… oh dear. That seems… low, doesn't it? I must be losing weight. My daughter will be very worried. Is something wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, the scale reads 53 kilograms. That is approximately 117 pounds. But…you are significantly underweight. And frankly, I find the discrepancy between your stated height and weight…concerning. Now, if you’ll please remove your shirt, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. We need to rule out any underlying causes for this weight loss.
PATIENT: Oh. Oh dear, oh dear. I... I didn't realize. My daughter must have… she must have written it down wrong. Or maybe the scale is broken? It’s just… it’s been a long time since I’ve… had anyone look at me like this. This is a bit embarrassing, Doctor. But alright, alright. If you think it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath, Mr. Krahn… and exhale. Another deep breath… Good. Your heart rate is a little elevated… and your breathing is slightly…shallow. I'm also noting some mild… muscle wasting. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please extend your arms.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a bit… ticklish. Are you finding something wrong, Doctor? I don't feel very strong lately, but I assumed it was just old age. This is… unsettling. My daughter will be furious if I haven't been taking care of myself.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are diminished, Mr. Krahn. And I'm concerned about your muscle mass. This, combined with your weight loss and elevated heart rate… raises some red flags. Do you experience any fatigue?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Oh, yes. Constantly. It’s… it’s hard to get through the day sometimes. I just… assume it's because I'm getting old. I sleep a lot, but I never feel rested. I just thought… well, I thought that’s just what happens when you reach a certain age. Is it… is it something serious, Doctor? I really hope it’s not something serious. My daughter will be so worried.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, given your symptoms and physical findings, I'm concerned about possible malnutrition and a potential underlying medical condition causing this weight loss. We need to run some tests. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid function test, and a urinalysis. We'll also need to check your vitamin D and B12 levels. And frankly, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to rule out anything serious in your lungs. I’m also concerned about possible cognitive decline, so I’m going to recommend a brief cognitive assessment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. That’s… a lot of tests. I… I don’t understand. Malnutrition? Cognitive decline? I just came in for a clearance thing! Is it… is it something bad, Doctor? Is it… curable? My daughter will be very upset if I need… serious treatment. I… I just want to go home and rest.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I understand this is overwhelming. We're not jumping to any conclusions. These tests are simply to get a clearer picture of what's going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but we need to rule out potential causes for your symptoms. Given your low weight and fatigue, we need to be thorough. I’m going to refer you to a specialist, a geriatrician, who can conduct a more comprehensive assessment and develop a treatment plan. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to discuss the test results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A… a geriatrician? Is that… is that a doctor for old people? I… I don’t want to see a specialist. I just want to be left alone. And… what if the tests are bad? What if it’s… something I can’t fix? My daughter will… she’ll be so worried. I just want to go home, Doctor. Can’t I just… rest and see if I feel better?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, with all due respect, simply resting is not an adequate course of action. Your weight loss, fatigue, and diminished reflexes are concerning, and ignoring them could have serious consequences. I understand your hesitation about seeing a specialist, but a geriatrician is best equipped to address your complex health needs. I’m obligated to ensure you receive the appropriate care, and that includes thorough evaluation and treatment. I strongly advise you to follow my recommendations. I’m ordering the tests now, and my staff will schedule an appointment with the specialist for you. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, in case we need further imaging?
PATIENT: Contrast dye…? I… I don’t know. I don't remember anything about contrast dye. My daughter handles all that sort of thing. I just… I just want her to be here. She always knows what to do. I’m scared, Doctor. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I understand you're scared. It's alright to be scared. Let’s focus on getting these tests done and seeing what we find. My staff will contact your daughter and explain everything. In the meantime, I'm going to write a referral to Dr. Chen, a highly-regarded geriatrician in the area. She will be in touch to schedule an appointment. I also want to emphasize the importance of nutrition. Please try to eat something, even if you don’t feel hungry. Small, frequent meals are best. And please, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before I finish?
PATIENT: Emergency room…? No… no, I don’t think so. I… I just want my daughter. And… can you promise she’ll be informed of everything? And… can you just tell me… is it something bad, Doctor? Is it… is it something I can’t fix? I just want to know… is it going to be alright?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I cannot tell you definitively whether it's "something bad" or "something you can’t fix" until we have the test results. That would be irresponsible and unethical of me. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you, my staff will contact your daughter immediately to explain everything and provide support. I will personally review your test results with Dr. Chen and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, please try to remain calm. We are doing everything we can to get you the answers you need. I'm going to have my nurse come in and give you a list of recommended foods and a brief summary of the tests we’re ordering. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I understand. Just… just please tell my daughter. Tell her… tell her I’m scared. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for trying.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Krahn. My nurse will be with you shortly. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Please remember to contact my office if you experience any new symptoms. .
