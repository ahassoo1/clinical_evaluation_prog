DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Tired. Just… very tired. Always tired now. Not good tired, like after work. Bad tired. Like… heavy. It’s been a few months, maybe longer. Hard to say, time… slips. Doctor said something about… liver, last time. That right?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see a note from Dr. Alistair… a few months ago. Fatigue. Right. And you say it’s been going on for… a while. "Slips," you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Slips. Like sand. I work with the cloth, you see? All day. And the tiredness… it makes my hands feel slow. Hard to make good work when tired. Wife… she gets angry. Says I not fast enough. Not good cloth, she says. It’s true, I guess. Everything feels… slow.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fatigue impacting your work… and marital stress due to that. And you mentioned Dr. Alistair investigated something with your liver. Do you recall any specific tests he ordered?
PATIENT: Tests… many tests. Blood, I think. And… the machine. Big machine. You lie down. Makes… pictures. Not good pictures, blurry. He talked… numbers. I not good with numbers. Something about… enzymes? Is that right? He said liver not happy. But I feel… just tired. Not painful tired, just… gone. Like a light… dimming.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here some liver function tests were done. And yes, your ALT and AST levels were elevated. Those are enzymes, as you said, and they can indicate liver inflammation. It’s good you remember that much. But “just tired” isn’t specific enough for me, Mr. Grumman. Are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… other? Let me think. Sometimes… stomach feels full. Even when I not eat much. And… color. Not right color. Like… yellow. Wife says so. She very good at seeing colors. I not notice. And… sleep. I sleep, but not rest. Like… floating. Not good sleep. Makes tiredness worse. Is that… symptoms?
DOCTOR: Okay, abdominal fullness, jaundice – your wife noticing yellowing of your skin – and non-restorative sleep. That's helpful. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Urine… no. Always same. Maybe… darker, sometimes? But I drink water all day. So… always wet. Stool… yes. That… not good. Pale. Like sand. Very pale sand. And… sometimes soft. Very soft. Wife says I need more fiber. She makes me eat… bran. Does not help. Just more pale sand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pale stools and changes in bowel habits… that’s concerning. Now, let's go over your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Other conditions… Not really. I have… old back. From work. Lifting cloth. Hurts sometimes, but I take pills. Doctor give me pills. And… high blood pressure, maybe? I think so. Doctor said… watch salt. But I like salt. It makes food taste good. Wife says… never mind. Just back and… maybe blood pressure. No other. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of back pain and hypertension. And you're currently taking medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes. Small white pill. Every morning. And sometimes, when back hurts, I take… blue pill. Doctor give me. For pain. I forget the name. Too many pills, you know? Makes head fuzzy. But I take them. Wife makes sure. She very good at remembering.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… No. Never allergies. I eat everything. Spicy food, sweet food, everything. Wife says I have iron stomach. No allergies. Never had. Not to pills, not to food, nothing. I just… tired. That’s my problem. Not allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, let's talk about your family history. Any significant medical conditions in your family – liver problems, cancer, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… Ethiopia… far away. Hard to remember. My father… strong man. Worked land. He died… old. Very old. My mother… she died young. Sickness. Not sure what sickness. My sister… she is healthy. Lives in city. No sickness. No liver problems, I think. They did not talk about liver. Everyone… just lived. Worked. Died old… or young. Not many doctors. Hard to say. Everyone… just lived.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Thank you for that information. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam now. We’ll start with your abdomen. Lie back on the examination table, please. I need to feel for any tenderness or enlargement. It's important we rule things out, and given your fatigue, jaundice noticed by your wife, pale stools, and elevated liver enzymes from previous tests… I suspect we need to investigate your liver further. Now, just relax.
PATIENT: Investigate… Okay. Relax… I try. But… tired. Very tired. Everything feels… heavy. Just… tell me if it hurts. I not good with pain. I just… want to sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. I'm just going to press gently here. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Deep breath in… and out. Hmm… a little tenderness here, on the right side. Not severe, but present. Your liver feels slightly enlarged. Also, I'm noting some mild swelling in your abdomen. I'm also going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to rule out other possibilities. Take a deep breath for me…
PATIENT: Okay… Right side… yes. That… not good. Hurts a little. Like… pressure. Heavy pressure. And… breathing… hard. Lungs feel… tight. Always tight. From dust, maybe? Working with cloth… lots of dust. But… tired. So hard to breathe when tired. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Based on the physical exam, and your history, I'm concerned about possible liver dysfunction. The enlargement and tenderness, along with the jaundice and pale stools, point towards a problem with your biliary system, possibly a blockage. The fatigue, swelling, and difficulty breathing… those could be related. I need to order some more blood tests - a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and liver function tests to get a clearer picture. I also want to order an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your liver and gallbladder and check for any blockages. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Ultrasound… more tests… I understand… but… tired. So many tests. Will tests… make me less tired? I just want to sleep. Blockage… is that… serious? Will I need… surgery? I not strong enough for surgery. And… what about my wife? She… angry when I not work. She need me. Will I… be able to work?
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, I understand your concerns. It's natural to be worried. The ultrasound will give us more information so we can determine the cause of your symptoms and decide on the best course of treatment. I can't tell you definitively whether you'll need surgery yet – we need the results of the tests first. As for your wife… we'll address that after we have a diagnosis. The priority right now is to figure out what's wrong and get you feeling better. I'm going to order those tests right away. The lab will draw your blood, and you'll schedule the ultrasound at the imaging center. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and develop a plan. Do you have any questions about getting the tests done?
PATIENT: Questions… How long… will tests take? And… will they make me more tired? I already so tired. And… the imaging center… is it far? I not good with long trips. And… will my wife need to come with me? She… very busy. I don’t want to bother her.
DOCTOR: The blood draw will only take a few minutes, Mr. Grumman. You might feel a little tired afterwards, but it shouldn’t be significant. The ultrasound will take about 30-45 minutes. The imaging center is located on Elm Street, about a 15-minute drive from here. I can give you directions. And your wife doesn't need to come with you, but it's always helpful to have someone with you for medical appointments, especially when you're feeling unwell. It's up to you. I’m going to write you a referral for the ultrasound and a lab requisition. The nurse will go over everything with you before you leave. Do you think you can manage that, Mr. Grumman?
PATIENT: Manage… I think so. Nurse… will explain? She… good at explaining? I not… good with papers. And… directions. I write them down. Elm Street… okay. But… if I forget… can I call? Just… to ask again? About the directions? Or the appointment? I not want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Grumman, you can absolutely call. The nurse will explain everything clearly, and if you forget anything, you can call the clinic anytime. We'll make sure you have all the information you need. I'm writing down the clinic's number here for you. Please don’t hesitate to call. Now, let the nurse come in, and she'll go over the details with you. Nurse Patel, could you please come in here?
PATIENT: Okay… thank you. I… will call. If I forget.
