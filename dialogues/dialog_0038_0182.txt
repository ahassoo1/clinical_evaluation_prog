DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, let's get this over with. I need a signature, that's all. This… procedure. My daughter insisted I get a check-up first. Seems silly, frankly, but here I am. Don't have all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right, a signature for a procedure. I understand you're a bit pressed for time. And you're having a check-up at your daughter’s request. Before I sign anything, I do need to understand what the procedure is, and just make sure you’re generally fit and healthy enough to proceed. That’s just standard practice, you see. Could you tell me a little about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t see why I have to explain it to you. It's a bit of… cosmetic work. Tightening things up, you could say. My daughter found some doctor online, very modern, very expensive. She says my face looks “tired.” Tired! I’ve lived a full life, what do you expect? But apparently, this doctor can fix it. It's not like I'm trying to climb Mount Everest afterwards. Just… a little lift. Is that good enough for you? I really don't recall the specifics. It involves needles, I think. And a lot of money.
DOCTOR: Alright, a cosmetic procedure, involving needles… and a bit of an investment. It sounds like it's a facial rejuvenation of some sort. No problem at all. I just need to be sure it's safe for you. Before we focus on the procedure specifically, let’s just quickly go over some general health questions. Do you have any major medical conditions like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? No. Never been told that. Heart problems… well, my father had something when he was older, but that was a long time ago. Diabetes, definitely not. I eat a sensible diet. Mostly. I used to be a terrazzo worker, you know. Hard physical labor. Keeps a man fit. Although, my knees aren’t what they used to be. That’s about it. Perfectly healthy, for an 81-year-old. Now, can we please hurry this along? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, a sensible diet and a history of hard work is excellent. And knowing about your father's history is helpful. We’ll make a note of the knee discomfort. Just to clarify, when you say 'discomfort', is that constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. It flares up with the weather, mostly. Damp days are the worst. And if I overdo it. Gardening, mostly. My wife… my late wife, she loved her garden. I try to keep it up for her. It’s not a crippling pain, mind you. Just… annoying. Honestly, I don't see what this has to do with… tightening my face. Is this standard procedure to interrogate a patient about their knees before allowing a simple cosmetic fix? It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: You're right to question that, Mr. Orwin. I apologize if it seems excessive. It’s not about the knees specifically, it’s about understanding your overall health, and ensuring any procedure, even a cosmetic one, won’t be complicated by underlying issues. Certain medications used in these procedures can interact with other conditions, and we need to rule those out. To continue, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Years ago, I had my appendix out. Standard stuff. And a hernia repair, maybe twenty years ago? That was uncomfortable, I remember. Nothing major. No heart surgery, no brain surgery, nothing like that. Just the usual wear and tear repairs. Are you writing all this down? I hope so. This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am writing everything down, Mr. Orwin. Appendix removal and hernia repair noted. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pills, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees. Ibuprofen, when they really bother me. And a multivitamin, keeps the bones strong, you understand. That's it. Nothing fancy. My daughter keeps trying to get me to take all sorts of things, but I’m a simple man. I don't need all these pills and potions. Now, can we please get back to the signing of whatever document you need me to sign? This is really testing my patience. I have a perfectly good lunch waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed for the knees, and a multivitamin. Thank you for letting me know. Before we get to the signature, just a few more quick questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never been allergic to anything. Dust bothers me a bit, but that’s not an allergy, is it? And bee stings, but who isn’t bothered by bee stings? Nothing serious. I'm a hardy Norwegian, you know. We don’t get allergies. Now, are you sure this is necessary? I feel like I’m being put through an interrogation. I just want this procedure done and over with. My daughter will be furious if I’m late for lunch.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. I truly do. We're nearly finished. Just trying to be thorough. No known allergies noted. Finally, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, for goodness sake. Now you want to know about my ancestors? What does that have to do with anything? My father lived to 85, a bit of heart trouble towards the end. My mother… she died young, pneumonia. Lots of aunts and uncles, lived perfectly normal lives. No… nothing remarkable. Look, I’m a simple man with a simple family history. Healthy people, mostly. Can we please get this over with? I really don't see the point of all this. I’m wasting a perfectly good afternoon. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I apologize if this feels like a waste of your time. I understand your frustration, and I assure you I'm not trying to deliberately delay things. The reason I ask these questions, even about family history, is to identify any potential risks associated with the procedure. Knowing about conditions that run in your family, such as heart issues or clotting disorders, can help us ensure your safety. However, given your clear desire to proceed, and the information you've provided, I'm willing to move forward. Before I sign off on the procedure consent form, would you mind if I quickly take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
