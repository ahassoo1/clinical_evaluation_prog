DOCTOR: Hi Alayne, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Let me see… well, it’s a bit hard to explain, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s… family history, mostly. My brother, he used to get terrible headaches, and then one side of his body would just… feel weak. Something like that runs in the family, I think. And I've had a few headaches myself lately, nothing too bad, but… it just made me a little worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's smart to be proactive, especially with a family history of something concerning. So, you're coming in because of some headaches, and you're worried about a possible connection to your brother's previous issues with headaches and weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Weakness… that’s the part that worries me. He needed help with things, you know? I don’t want that. The headaches… well, everyone gets headaches. But the weakness… I haven’t had any weakness, not yet, but… it’s just a feeling. A worry, really. It's hard to explain. How did you know about my brother? Did I tell you that already? I get so mixed up sometimes.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Alayne, that's perfectly understandable. I see your brother, Vincent Tofani, was a patient here a few years ago – that’s how I knew. It's good you’re bringing this up, and it’s very helpful that you remember he was a patient here. Let’s talk about these headaches you’ve been having. Can you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, Vincent, yes! That's right. He always complained about the weather affecting his head. Goodness, he was a grump about it. The headaches… hmm. They’re not… sharp, exactly. More of a dull ache, usually on the side of my head. Sometimes in the front. And they come and go. Not every day, thank goodness. I usually just take a little something for them, you know, one of those over-the-counter pills. But they’ve been… more frequent lately, maybe? It's hard to say. I don't really keep track. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Dull aches, more frequent recently… and you've been managing them with over-the-counter medication. What medication are you usually taking, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it's one of those… the little pink ones. I think it’s… acetaminophen? Is that right? My daughter, she’s the one who usually buys them for me. She keeps a big bottle in the kitchen. I just take two when my head starts to bother me. I don’t take them very often, really. Only when I need to. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, acetaminophen – good to know. And you only take it as needed, when the headaches are bothering you. Have you noticed anything else that seems to bring on these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think… Sometimes when the weather changes, like before a storm. And if I get too tired, maybe? It’s hard to say for sure. I don't really pay that much attention, if I'm honest. I try not to dwell on things. But… now that you mention it, I think sometimes when I’m stressed, maybe? My grandson… he's a lovely boy, but he worries me sometimes. He’s always getting into trouble! But that's just being a grandson, I suppose. Does worrying count as stress?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, worrying counts as stress, Alayne. It sounds like the weather, fatigue, and stress might all be potential triggers for your headaches. Now, you mentioned being concerned about weakness, similar to what your brother experienced. Have you noticed any weakness at all – in your arms, legs, or face?
PATIENT: No, not… exactly weakness. It’s more of a… funny feeling. Like a little heaviness, sometimes, in my right arm. But it goes away. I just thought I was tired, you know? Or maybe I slept on it wrong. It’s not like I can’t move my arm, or anything. It just… feels a little different sometimes. And I get a little clumsy, perhaps? I dropped a teacup the other day, which was silly. I haven't dropped a teacup in years! But I don’t know if that means anything. It's probably just my age. Everything gets a little harder when you get older, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does, Alayne. And it’s good you’re paying attention to these little changes. A heaviness in your right arm, occasional clumsiness… those are definitely things worth looking into, especially with your family history. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just a basic neurological exam – checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. If you think it's best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. My daughter always says I worry too much, but it's better to be safe than sorry, isn’t it? Yes, go ahead. Just… please be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be. I don’t want to break anything!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle. We’ll take things slowly and just do a few simple checks. Okay, Alayne, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go. Is that alright? I'm not very strong, you know. Arthritis, mostly. It makes everything a little difficult. My daughter buys me those little heat packs… they help a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And now, can you close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Oh dear. That wasn't very good, was it? My hands are so clumsy today. I used to be very good at things like that. It’s harder than it looks, you know. It’s probably just the arthritis. It plays tricks on me sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Alayne, that’s alright. It is a little more challenging than it looks. And yes, the arthritis can definitely contribute to some difficulty. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of everything. Okay, Alayne. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, you're reporting headaches that are becoming more frequent, and you've noticed some changes in your right arm - a feeling of heaviness and some clumsiness. The exam shows slightly reduced coordination and a mild tremor in your right hand. Given your family history of headaches and weakness, I want to be thorough and rule out anything serious. I think it would be best to get a brain scan - a simple MRI - to get a better look at what's going on. It will help us determine the cause of your headaches and assess whether there’s anything affecting your coordination. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A scan? Is it… dangerous? I don’t like being closed in, you know. My brother, he hated those things. All those noises… And what if you find something… bad? I don’t want to know if I’m going to… well, you know. I’m not afraid of dying, exactly, but I don’t want to worry my daughter. She's got enough on her plate. But… if you think it's really necessary… I suppose I can do it. But please, Doctor, be gentle. And explain everything to me very carefully. I get so confused easily. What will it feel like?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Alayne. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about a scan, especially with your history and your brother’s experience. Let me assure you, modern MRI scans are very safe. There's no radiation involved. You will be lying flat on a table, and the machine makes a knocking and whirring noise – that's what your brother likely experienced. We can give you earplugs or headphones to help with the noise, and you’ll be able to communicate with the technician at all times. The scan itself takes about 30-45 minutes, and you need to lie very still during that time. We will explain everything to you step by step before the scan, and we’ll make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. As for what we’re looking for, we’re trying to rule out any structural problems that could be causing your headaches and coordination changes. It doesn’t necessarily mean there is anything serious – it’s just a precaution. And we will discuss the results with you in detail, and only share what you want to know. We can even involve your daughter if you wish. I understand your concerns about worrying your daughter, and we can work together to manage that. We won’t discuss anything with her unless you specifically give us permission. Would you like me to explain the scan process in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. More detail would be good. You said I have to lie still? How still? Can I move my fingers, or my toes? What if I get claustrophobic? I’ve heard stories… about people getting stuck. And what if it finds something… really bad? What are the chances of that, honestly? I just want to know… what I’m getting myself into. And what does it feel like inside the machine? Is it hot? Cold? I get so flustered, you know. My daughter says I worry too much, but I can’t help it. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s go through everything step by step. This is the MRI machine. It looks like a large tube, and you lie flat on a table that slides inside. As for lying still, it’s important to remain as still as possible to get clear images. However, you can move your fingers and toes. You don’t need to be perfectly rigid. The technician will give you instructions before the scan to help you stay comfortable. Regarding claustrophobia, it’s a common concern. The tube is relatively open, and we can adjust the table so your head isn’t fully enclosed. We can also offer you a sedative to help you relax if you’re feeling anxious. And the technician will be monitoring you the entire time through a two-way intercom, so you can communicate with them at any point. They can stop the scan if you’re feeling uncomfortable. We’ve had many patients who were initially anxious but were able to complete the scan with a little support. Now, as for what it feels like, the machine itself isn’t hot or cold. It’s usually room temperature. You might hear loud knocking and whirring noises – that's the machine taking the images. That’s why we offer earplugs or headphones. You’ll also be asked to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. It's like taking a very long nap. Regarding the chances of finding something "bad," it’s difficult to say definitively. Many things can cause headaches and coordination changes, and the scan will help us narrow down the possibilities. It could be something minor, like a small structural abnormality, or it could be something more significant. But it's important to remember that an abnormal scan doesn't automatically mean you have a serious condition. We'll discuss the results with you in detail and explain all your options. Would you like me to schedule the scan for you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Thirty to forty-five minutes… that is a long time. And all those noises… I don't know… I don’t think I can do it. Not alone, anyway. Maybe… maybe my daughter could come with me? And could you… could you promise me you’ll explain everything very carefully afterward? And if it finds something… bad, I want to know all the options. Everything. I don’t want any secrets. And could I have a sedative? A strong one? I don’t want to feel anything. I just… I just want it to be over with. Maybe… maybe schedule it for next week? That gives me time to… to think about it. And to talk to my daughter. Yes, next week would be good. And please… please promise me you’ll be there to explain everything afterward. It’s just… I’m so scared.
DOCTOR: Of course, Alayne. Absolutely. We will schedule the scan for next week, and your daughter is more than welcome to come with you for support. We will make sure you both feel comfortable and informed throughout the entire process. And I promise you, I will be there to explain everything afterward, in as much detail as you want. We won’t keep any secrets from you, and we’ll discuss all your options thoroughly. And yes, we can absolutely discuss a sedative to help you relax during the scan. We’ll talk to the radiology department and see what options are available. Don’t worry, Alayne. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll be with you every step of the way. We’ll get through this together. Let me just schedule the appointment for you now. What day next week works best for you and your daughter?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a little better. Let me see… Tuesday would be good, I think. Yes, Tuesday. My daughter usually has the afternoon free. She can pick me up afterward, too. And… and could you remind me about the sedative? I don't want to forget. It's just… I'm so forgetful these days. And… and could you please write down everything we talked about? Just so I have it to refer to. Yes, that would be wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Alayne. Tuesday it is. I’ll schedule you for an appointment next Tuesday afternoon. I will also make a note to discuss the sedative options with the radiology department and we will have that figured out before your appointment. Here you go. This is a summary of everything we discussed today. It includes information about the scan, the potential need for a sedative, and a list of your questions. Please take it with you, and don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any further questions or concerns. We’ll see you next Tuesday, Alayne. And remember, we’re here for you every step of the way. .
