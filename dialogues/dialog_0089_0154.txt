DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about my waterworks, I suppose. Been having trouble with them again. Honestly, it feels like it never ends. I don’t… I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s been a while. A while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, "trouble with your waterworks"—that generally means issues with urination. And you said it’s been going on for a while. Can you tell me more specifically what kind of trouble you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, urination. That’s… a good way to put it. Well, it burns, Doctor. When I… you know. And I have to go very often. More often than I should, I think. It’s… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like it doesn’t all come out. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Claudene. Burning with urination, frequent urges, and a feeling of incomplete emptying—those are all helpful details. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me roughly how often you're going to the bathroom during the day and night?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… During the day… well, probably every two hours, maybe less. It’s hard to say exactly. I drink a fair bit of water, you see. And at night… oh, goodness. Two, maybe three times. Sometimes more if I drink something before bed. It wakes me up, of course. It’s… disruptive. Is that… is that normal? I really don't remember ever talking about this with a doctor before. It's just… been something I deal with.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly every two hours during the day and two or three times at night. That is more frequent than we'd typically like to see. And disrupting your sleep is definitely not ideal. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Blood? No, I don't think so. I haven't looked, to be honest. I… I try not to look. It would upset me. And pain… sometimes a little ache in my lower back, but I put that down to my age, you see. I'm not a young woman anymore. I do a lot of bending and lifting at work, fixing those… those campers. Recreational vehicles, they call them. Perhaps it’s that. Does that make sense? I forget things so easily.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Claudene. Lifting and bending can certainly contribute to back pain. No blood in the urine is good to know. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting along with this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. No fever, no chills. And I haven’t been sick to my stomach. No, none of that. Just the… the burning, and having to go all the time. It’s just… bothersome. Really bothersome. Is this something serious, Doctor? I’m a bit worried, to be frank. I really don’t have time for this. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good you're getting this checked out. It doesn't necessarily mean it's serious, but we need to figure out what's going on. Given your symptoms, the most likely possibility is a urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, to confirm that, and rule out anything else, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and then collect a urine sample for testing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a test? Oh dear. I don’t like tests. But… if you think it’s necessary. A UTI, you say? Is that… Is that easy to fix? I have a camper to repair next week, and I really need to be working. A physical exam… What does that involve, exactly? I don’t want anything… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your apprehension. A UTI is usually quite treatable with antibiotics. We'll get you sorted if that's what it is. The physical exam is fairly straightforward. I'll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and gently press on your belly to check for tenderness. I’ll also do a quick neurological check. It's not usually unpleasant at all. Then, we just need a urine sample—you’ll sit on the toilet and collect a small amount in a cup. It's a standard procedure. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Oh… listening and pressing? That doesn't sound too bad. And a cup… yes, I can manage a cup. Alright, Doctor. Go ahead. But please be quick, if you would. I have a schedule to keep, you see. And please, no surprises. I really don’t do well with surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Claudene. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible, and I’ll explain everything as I go along. No surprises, I promise. First, let's have you lie down on the examination table over here. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with this stethoscope. It might feel a little cool. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. Breathe normally… Yes, I can do that. It is rather cool. Is this going to take long, Doctor? I really don’t like being on my back for too long. It makes me feel… faint.
DOCTOR: Just a moment, Claudene. I'm just listening for any unusual sounds. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. How about here?
PATIENT: Oh… here feels a little tender. Not painful, exactly, but… sensitive. Just a little. It's… it's hard to explain. Does that mean something is wrong? I really hope it’s nothing serious. This is making me quite anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. A little tenderness isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm, but it’s helpful information. Now, let's collect that urine sample. There's a private bathroom just over there. I'll give you a cup and instructions. It's a "clean catch" sample, so I'll explain how to do that properly. Then we can send it off to the lab.
PATIENT: Oh… a clean catch? What does that mean? I just… go. Isn’t that enough? This is all rather complicated, Doctor. I’m not very good at these things. Perhaps I should just go home. I really don’t think I’m cut out for this.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Claudene, it's not complicated, I promise. A clean catch just means we want a sample that isn’t contaminated with bacteria from the skin. It's a little bit more accurate. I have a little leaflet here with pictures. Basically, you’ll start urinating, and then collect the sample mid-stream in the cup. The first bit and the last bit can have bacteria on it, so we want the middle part. I can also walk you through it if you’d like. It's perfectly normal. Would you like me to show you?
PATIENT: Oh… a leaflet. Well, that’s… helpful. Pictures are good. Mid-stream? Oh dear. This is… awkward. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose I can try. Just… please don’t rush me. And try not to look at me, if you would. This is… embarrassing. I’ll… I’ll go now.
