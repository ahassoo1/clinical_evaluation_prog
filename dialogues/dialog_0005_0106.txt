DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Cannington, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's my foot. Been botherin' me something awful. It's a sore, a nasty one. And frankly, I shouldn't have to be here if I'd listened to my daughter, but... here we are.
DOCTOR: A sore, huh?
PATIENT: Not just a sore, young man. A proper ulcer. It's been open for… oh, goodness, at least a month now. Maybe longer. I lost track after a while. It's on the bottom of my foot, near my heel. And it hurts. Especially when I try to walk, which, naturally, I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said it's been open for at least a month… have you been doing anything to care for it?
PATIENT: Care for it? Honestly. I put some ointment on it, the kind my granddaughter brought over. But it doesn't do much. And I try to keep it clean, but it’s difficult, you know? Everything seems to get in it. Dust, bits of sock… It's a nuisance, really. I always took care of myself perfectly fine before, but this… this is just embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Embarrassing or not, we need to take a look. It's good you tried to keep it clean, though. Let’s have a look. Could you please take off your shoe and sock?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to see it. Well, alright. Don't expect pretty, young man. I warned you. It’s not a sight for delicate eyes, I assure you. It's just… everything aches these days, you know? Getting old isn't for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, well. It’s… certainly an ulcer. Quite a bit of exposed tissue. I’m noting some redness and a little swelling around the edges. Do you have any diabetes, Mrs. Cannington?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Goodness, no! I eat perfectly reasonable. A little rice, some fish… I certainly don't have any of that affliction. My husband, God rest his soul, he had a touch of it, but I always made sure he ate right. It's a terrible thing, diabetes. Weakens a person, it does. So, you're saying I have it now? That's preposterous.
DOCTOR: I didn't say you have it, Mrs. Cannington. I'm simply asking if you've ever been diagnosed with diabetes. Ulcers like this can be common in patients with diabetes, as it affects circulation and healing. It’s a standard question. Have you ever had your blood sugar checked?
PATIENT: Blood sugar? I… I don't recall. The doctor poked and prodded at me every year, like they do, but I don't pay attention to those numbers. They just tell me I'm getting old! Honestly, young man, you’re making me nervous with all this talk of sugar and diagnoses. I just want this sore fixed, not a whole list of ailments. My daughter keeps telling me I need to go to specialists, but… well, I don't trust those people. Too much poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We'll focus on the sore. It’s clearly not healing on its own, which is why it’s important to figure out why. Regardless of diabetes, we need to rule out infection. I’m going to need to take a sample to send to the lab. It’s a quick swab, won’t hurt much. And I'll order some bloodwork, just to get a baseline. It’s standard procedure, Mrs. Cannington. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Swabbing and bloodwork… honestly. All this fuss over a little sore. I suppose… if you insist. But don’t go poking around too much. And I expect a quick answer. I haven’t got all day, you know. My granddaughter is bringing over a new batch of fish stew, and I don't want to miss it. Just… be gentle, alright? And tell me what this "infection" is, exactly. Is it catching?
DOCTOR: It’s not “catching,” Mrs. Cannington. It's a local infection, meaning it’s likely bacteria that got into the wound. The lab will tell us exactly what kind. Alright, let's get this swab done. This might sting a little. Just try to relax.
PATIENT: Oh, be careful now! That’s… that’s quite tender, young man. Honestly, I’ve had less painful experiences at the dentist. You're digging around in there like a… like a little crab! Just get it over with quickly, please. And don't tell me it won't hurt, because it is hurting.
DOCTOR: Alright, done. That wasn’t so bad. I'm documenting the wound size and appearance: approximately 2cm in diameter, located on the plantar surface of the left heel, with moderate surrounding erythema and some purulent drainage. We'll send this off to the lab, and it should take a couple of days to get the results. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a topical antibiotic ointment. Apply it twice a day after gently cleaning the wound with soap and water. And keep pressure off of it as much as possible.That means, no long walks, Mrs. Cannington.
PATIENT: No long walks? Honestly! What am I supposed to do, sit in a chair all day? I have errands to run, you know. And my garden needs tending. A little walking keeps me spry. But… alright, alright. I’ll try to take it easy. But don’t expect miracles. And what about this ointment? Is it smelly? I don’t want to reek of medicine. And will it stain my socks?
DOCTOR: It’s a standard topical antibiotic, doesn’t have a strong odor. And no, it shouldn’t stain. I’m also ordering those bloodwork tests to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues that could be affecting your healing. The lab results will give us a clearer picture. I’ll have the nurse give you the requisition forms. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess the wound and review the lab results. If it gets significantly worse – increased pain, redness, swelling, or a foul odor – come in immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A week? Honestly, that’s a long time to wait! But… alright. I suppose. And what if I can’t make the appointment? My granddaughter is often busy, and I rely on her for transportation. And who is going to explain all this to my daughter? She’ll have a fit if she finds out I haven’t seen a specialist yet. This is all very… complicated. Just give me the forms, and I’ll deal with it. I suppose there’s no avoiding it. And tell the nurse to be gentle with the blood draws, alright? I bruise easily. .
DOCTOR: The nurse is aware. Just try to follow the instructions, Mrs. Cannington. It’s for your own good. Next patient. .
