DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Thanks for having me. It's... about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. I think my wife set all this up, to be honest. I don't really remember all the details, but it’s something about getting… smaller, I guess? Before the surgery, they wanted me to come talk.
DOCTOR: Smaller… alright. So, your wife scheduled an appointment for you regarding potential weight loss surgery?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. She’s been worried about my health for a while now. I… I know I’ve put on weight, but it just kind of happened, you know? I don't really remember when it started being a big deal. She says it’s important to get checked out before anything happens with the surgery. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s absolutely the right approach. It’s very thoughtful of your wife to be proactive about your health. We always want to make sure you're a good candidate for any procedure, and understand any other health concerns you might have. It sounds like things have progressed gradually. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Do you have any specific concerns right now that are bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific concerns… Not really, not that I can think of. I get tired easier, I guess. And sometimes my knees ache. But… honestly, I just figured that was getting older. I don’t really know what would be a specific concern. It just… feels like things are a bit harder than they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue and some knee discomfort. That's a good starting point. And it’s common to dismiss things as just getting older, so you're not alone there. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about when this fatigue started?
PATIENT: When it started… That’s… a good question. It feels like it’s been a slow thing. Maybe… a couple of years ago? But I honestly couldn't say for sure. I was working a lot then, maybe that’s why I was tired. It's hard to remember exactly when things changed, you know? I didn’t really pay attention to it at first.
DOCTOR: A couple of years ago, gradually worsening. Okay. And was there anything specific happening around that time – any major life changes, stress, or illness – that you recall?
PATIENT: Major life changes… uh… I think my son got married around then? Yeah, that was a big thing. A lot of planning, a lot of family… It was happy, but it was also stressful, I guess. And work was busy, like I said. That was probably it. Just a lot going on. I don’t think I was taking very good care of myself then, either.
DOCTOR: Congratulations on your son’s marriage, by the way. It sounds like you were quite busy. A lot of stress can certainly take a toll on your health. Let’s shift gears a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve been to the doctor before, for checkups, but they always said I was pretty healthy. My wife keeps telling me my cholesterol is a little high, but I don’t really pay attention to those things. She’s always reading about stuff online. I just take whatever she says, to be honest. I don’t really understand all that medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medical conditions, wife mentions potentially high cholesterol. And it's perfectly alright not to know all the medical details – that's what I'm here for. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. And I broke my arm once, when I was playing soccer. But… that was a long time ago. Other than that, nothing I can remember. No hospital stays, either. Not that I recall, anyway. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Tonsils as a child, broken arm, no other surgeries or hospitalizations to your knowledge. Good. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking – even over-the-counter ones, like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, if it’s really bad. And my wife makes me take a multivitamin, but that’s about it. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I don't take anything regularly, though. Just now and then.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen occasionally for headaches, multivitamin. Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I might get a little itchy sometimes, but that’s probably just from the weather. Nothing serious. I don’t think I have any real allergies. My wife always asks, but I never have anything to tell her.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Okay, Mr. Kochubey. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health status, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just step over here and lie down on the table, that would be great. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear, although slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally, which could be related to weight. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Okay. A little bit, maybe. Around… here. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It’s been there for a while, I think. I just figured it was gas or something.
DOCTOR: Alright, some tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen, described as a dull ache. We’ll need to investigate that further. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Reflexes are normal bilaterally, strength is 5 out of 5 in all major muscle groups. Good. And lastly, I'll just take your blood pressure and listen to your heart rate again. Blood pressure is 148/92, heart rate is 88. A little elevated, but not overly concerning. Alright, Mr. Kochubey. That gives me a basic overview. Your weight is 139 lbs, and your height is 5'1" - that puts your BMI at 26.6, which is classified as overweight. We also noted some fatigue, knee discomfort, a dull ache in your lower abdomen, and slightly elevated blood pressure. Given your desire for surgical options, and your concerns, I recommend some further blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. We should also consider an abdominal ultrasound to investigate the source of the discomfort. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good, I guess. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work and… an ultrasound? Is that going to be expensive? I don't have insurance, so… I'm not sure how I’m going to pay for all this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Kochubey. It’s certainly a valid point. We’ll do our best to work with you. The lab work and ultrasound aren't overly expensive, and we do have some options for payment plans or assistance programs we can explore. We also have a financial counselor who can help you navigate those options. Before we proceed with the tests, let's discuss your lifestyle a bit. What is your typical diet like?
PATIENT: Uh… not very good, I guess. My wife tries to get me to eat healthy, but I like comfort food, you know? Pizza, burgers, pasta… stuff like that. I eat a lot of takeout. It’s easier than cooking. And I like sweets. I have a sweet tooth, definitely. I don't really exercise much. Maybe a little walking, but that’s about it. I know I should do better, but… it’s hard.
DOCTOR: It is hard, and you're not alone in that. Many people struggle with those things. Lifestyle changes are often the most challenging part, but they can also make a huge difference. Before we talk about specific changes, let's focus on getting these tests done so we have a clearer picture of your overall health. I’ll write you a lab order and a referral for the ultrasound. We can schedule those for you when you're ready. In the meantime, if you experience any significant pain, fever, or changes in bowel habits, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explained everything pretty well. Do you think… do you think I’m a good candidate for surgery? Even with all this… stuff? I really want to feel better, Doctor. I just want to be able to keep up with my grandkids.
DOCTOR: That's a wonderful goal, Mr. Kochubey, and a perfectly valid reason to explore your options. Whether you’re a good candidate for surgery depends on the results of these tests, your overall health, and a thorough evaluation. We won’t know for sure until we have all the information. The tests will help us assess your fitness for surgery and identify any potential risks. We'll discuss everything thoroughly and make a decision together. I’m optimistic that we can find a solution that will help you feel better and keep up with your grandkids. I’ll have the nurse come in and go over the lab order and ultrasound referral with you, and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you today.
