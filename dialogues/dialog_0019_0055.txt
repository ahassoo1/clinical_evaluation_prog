DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well, I suppose. Though I must say, this office is… quaint. I’m here because I’ve heard tell you can get a… permission slip, for the marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, thinks it might help with my nerves. Though I’ve never understood what a woman my age needs with that sort of thing. But she’s insistent.
DOCTOR: Right, a permission slip, as you say, for medical marijuana. That’s perfectly alright. We can certainly explore that possibility. Just to be clear, you’re interested in this to help manage your nerves?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. My nerves. Though I wouldn’t say they’re bad, precisely. It's just… the world is a very unsettling place these days. And frankly, a little something to take the edge off after a long day wouldn’t go amiss. My husband, Harold, says I worry too much, naturally. He’s a very practical man, Harold. Doesn't understand the finer points of… unease.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you're looking for something to help you relax and manage some anxiety, especially given everything going on. Let's talk a little more about that anxiety. Could you tell me a bit about when you find yourself feeling most anxious?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a constant thing, Doctor. I'm not always on edge, if that's what you’re asking. It's more… situational. The news, for one thing. Dreadful, just dreadful. And large gatherings. Too many people, too much noise. And frankly, I've been… less comfortable travelling since all the trouble with the airlines. Harold wants to take a trip to Florida next winter, but the thought of it… well, it’s enough to give anyone palpitations. I used to travel all the time, you know. But things are different now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point. So, news, crowds, and travel seem to be the biggest triggers. Have you experienced any physical symptoms when you're feeling anxious?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. My heart, naturally. It flutters. Sometimes it feels like it's going to beat right out of my chest. And my hands get… clammy. Dreadfully clammy. And my stomach… well, let's just say it's not always agreeable. I don't usually bother Harold with it. He wouldn't understand. He thinks a cup of tea solves everything. Which is all well and good if you’re not feeling like the world is about to end, but… it doesn’t, you know? It simply doesn't.
DOCTOR: Right, palpitations, clammy hands, and stomach issues. Those all make sense with anxiety. Have you ever tried anything to manage these feelings before, aside from tea?
PATIENT: Well, Harold suggested… a hobby. Knitting, of all things. He thinks if I kept my hands busy, it would calm me down. Honestly, Doctor, I’m seventy-four years old. I don't need a hobby. I've had hobbies. I used to paint, quite well, actually. But it just doesn’t hold my attention anymore. And frankly, sitting quietly and focusing on something just… amplifies the worry, if you understand. It gives my mind too much room to wander. I tried a little sherry before bed once, but Harold disapproved. Said it was a slippery slope. He’s a very sensible man, Harold. But sometimes… sensible isn’t enough.
DOCTOR: I understand. Knitting and sherry haven't been helpful, and it sounds like you've already had a full life with hobbies. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have a touch of arthritis in my hands, naturally. It's what comes with age, I suppose. It doesn't bother me terribly, though I can't do much fine work anymore. Harold helps me with the gardening. And my blood pressure runs a little high, but it's usually well-controlled with medication. Just a small pill each day. Nothing dramatic. And… oh, I had my gallbladder removed years ago. But that was decades ago. I don't think that's relevant, is it? I've always been quite healthy, for my age. I don't believe in coddling.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Arthritis, controlled blood pressure, and a gallbladder removal years ago. And it's good you've been generally healthy. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: No, just the one. Harold is very particular about medication. He believes doctors hand them out like sweets these days. "Unnecessary chemicals," he calls them. I suppose he has a point, but sometimes… a little help wouldn’t go amiss. He’s a retired accountant, you see. Very precise. Everything has to be accounted for, down to the last penny. It’s… endearing, I suppose, but sometimes a bit much. He makes me take a multivitamin, though. He insists it’s good for my "general constitution.” Honestly, Doctor, I feel like a specimen sometimes.
DOCTOR: He does sound like a very… involved husband. Alright, so just the blood pressure medication and the multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've always been rather careful about what I eat, though I do enjoy a good piece of chocolate. Harold disapproves, naturally. Too much sugar, he says. But a little indulgence is necessary, don't you think? I've never had a reaction to anything, though. No hives, no difficulty breathing, nothing like that. I suppose I'm rather fortunate. Though I did get a rather nasty mosquito bite last week. But that's hardly an allergy, is it? Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel like I'm giving you a full medical history for a perfectly healthy woman. Perhaps I shouldn’t be bothering you with all this.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ellan. It's good for me to get a complete picture of your health. And a mosquito bite doesn’t count! It’s important for me to rule out any potential interactions or contraindications before considering any treatment, even something like medical marijuana. Let's just finish going through a few things. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always been remarkably healthy, as I said. A few childhood illnesses, of course, measles, mumps… things you get as a child. But nothing serious. I broke my wrist once, when I was about ten, climbing a tree. Harold always tells that story. Says it was a sign of my rebellious nature. Honestly, it was just a silly accident. But I've never had to spend any significant time in the hospital. I've always been able to look after myself. And Harold, of course, is very capable. He's a practical man, you see. Always prepared. He even has a first aid kit in the car. A very comprehensive one, I might add. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I'm giving you a full account of my life. Perhaps this whole thing is a waste of time. I'm sure I'm just being silly.
DOCTOR: Ellan, you're not being silly at all. You’re providing me with valuable information, and I appreciate you taking the time to share it. It sounds like you’ve lived a very full and healthy life, and that’s wonderful. Knowing your history helps me make the best recommendations for you. Now, before we discuss the possibility of medical marijuana, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just a quick check of your heart, lungs, and blood pressure, and a look at your hands. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright. If you think it's necessary. I suppose it can't hurt. But I do warn you, my heart flutters a bit when I'm nervous. And my hands are a little arthritic, as I mentioned. Harold always says I have "delicate" hands. Honestly, they’re just old. And cold. I always have cold hands. But if you need to listen to my heart and look at my hands, I suppose I don't mind. Just… be gentle, alright? And don’t be alarmed if my blood pressure is a little high. It always goes up in the doctor’s office. It's the white coat effect, you know. It's a perfectly normal phenomenon. But alright. Go ahead. Just… be quick, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I completely understand about the white coat effect. We'll try to get an accurate reading, but don’t worry if it’s a little elevated. Okay, your blood pressure is a little high, but we'll just keep that in mind. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Okay, your lungs sound good and clear. Your heart rhythm is a little irregular, but that’s consistent with what you’ve described. And now, I'd like to take a quick look at your hands. Okay, your hands show some evidence of arthritis, as you mentioned. Some mild swelling and stiffness. Everything looks normal otherwise. Okay, Ellan. Everything seems generally normal. Your arthritis seems mild, and your heart rhythm is a little irregular, but that’s consistent with your report. Now, let’s talk about medical marijuana and whether it might be a suitable option for managing your anxiety. Would you like to discuss that further?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That's what I came for, after all. Though honestly, Doctor, I'm still a bit skeptical. It's not something I ever thought I'd be considering. My generation… well, we weren’t raised with any of that. But my daughter, bless her heart, she’s done a lot of research. Says it might help me relax, sleep better… and not worry so much. She says it's perfectly legal now, and much safer than some of the pills Harold refuses to let me take. Though I do worry about… the side effects. And what people will think. Honestly, I don't want to be seen as… eccentric. But I suppose if it could help… I'm willing to listen. What exactly does it involve, Doctor? And what are the risks?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to have reservations, Ellan. It's a big change, and it's good you're thinking through the pros and cons. Let's talk about what it involves and the risks. First, medical marijuana comes in different forms: oils, tinctures, edibles, and sometimes even inhalable forms. For someone new to it, I usually recommend starting with a low-dose tincture or oil, taken under the tongue. That way, we can control the dosage carefully and see how you respond. As for risks, the most common side effects are drowsiness, dry mouth, and dizziness. Some people experience changes in appetite, and it can sometimes interact with other medications. It’s important to start with a very low dose and increase it slowly, and to avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you. There’s also a potential for cognitive impairment, especially with long-term, heavy use, but that’s less likely with a low-dose, carefully monitored approach. And, of course, there’s the social stigma you mentioned. It’s becoming more accepted, but it’s still important to be discreet and comfortable with your decision. Before we proceed, I want to be clear that medical marijuana isn't a cure-all. It can help manage anxiety, but it’s often most effective when combined with other strategies, such as therapy, relaxation techniques, or regular exercise. Do you have any specific concerns about any of these risks, Ellan?
PATIENT: Well, the drowsiness doesn’t sound appealing. I already have trouble staying awake in the afternoons. And the dry mouth… well, that just sounds unpleasant. And the changes in appetite… I enjoy my meals, Doctor. Harold cooks a lovely Sunday roast. I wouldn’t want to lose my appetite. And the cognitive impairment… honestly, I’m not ready to start forgetting things. My memory isn't what it used to be, as it is. The social stigma… that’s a concern, as well. I don't want to be gossiped about. Or judged. I’m a respectable woman, Doctor. I’ve always been a respectable woman. And I certainly don’t want Harold to find out. He’d be terribly disapproving. He thinks it's all… frivolous. Honestly, it sounds like a lot of trouble. Perhaps it's not worth it, after all. My daughter will be disappointed, I'm sure. But I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Perhaps I should just stick to a cup of tea. Though it doesn’t seem to be doing much good these days. What would you recommend, Doctor? Do you think it's even worth trying, given my concerns?
DOCTOR: You’ve raised some very valid points, Ellan. It’s completely understandable to feel hesitant, especially given your concerns about side effects and Harold’s disapproval. Based on what you’ve told me, I think it’s reasonable to explore other options before considering medical marijuana. It sounds like you've already tried some relaxation techniques with limited success. Before we dismiss it entirely, let's talk about some alternative strategies for managing your anxiety. Have you ever considered therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy?
PATIENT: Therapy? Oh, no. Absolutely not. I've never been one for… talking about my feelings. It's not something my generation does. And frankly, I don't have anything to talk about. I have a perfectly pleasant life. A loving husband, a comfortable home… a few minor worries, perhaps, but nothing worth bothering a therapist with. Besides, I don't want anyone poking around in my head. I’m a private person, Doctor. I keep my thoughts to myself. And frankly, I wouldn't trust a stranger with my innermost secrets. No, therapy is out of the question. Absolutely out of the question. What else is there? Perhaps some sort of… medication? Something mild? Something that won't make me drowsy or change my appetite? Something that Harold will approve of? He does trust doctors, you see. As long as they prescribe something sensible. But honestly, I'm not keen on taking pills. They always seem to have such dreadful side effects. It's a difficult situation, Doctor. A very difficult situation indeed.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're looking for a medication that’s effective but doesn't interfere with your daily life and that Harold will approve of. There are some anti-anxiety medications that might be a good fit. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, are often used to treat anxiety. They generally have fewer side effects than older medications, but they can take several weeks to start working. Common side effects include nausea, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction, but they're usually mild and temporary. Another option is buspirone, which is a milder anti-anxiety medication that doesn't cause drowsiness or cognitive impairment. However, it's not as effective as SSRIs for more severe anxiety. Before we decide on anything, I want to be clear that these medications aren’t a quick fix. It takes time to find the right medication and dosage, and they’re often most effective when combined with lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet. Would you be open to trying a low-dose SSRI, with close monitoring of any side effects?
PATIENT: Well… a low dose… and close monitoring… that sounds… reasonable. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my appetite. And doesn't make me drowsy. And Harold approves. He does have a point about unnecessary chemicals, you see. But if it could help me relax… and not worry so much… I suppose it’s worth considering. But I want to be clear, Doctor. If I start feeling unwell… or if it interferes with my daily life… I want to stop immediately. And I don’t want to be dependent on it. Harold wouldn’t approve of that, either. He believes in self-reliance, you see. And I want to be able to sleep. I need my sleep. I can’t function without my sleep. So, if it interferes with my sleep… that’s out of the question. And I want to be able to think clearly. I need to be able to manage my affairs. I can’t be forgetful. I need to be sharp. So, if it interferes with any of those things… that’s out of the question. Do you think we can find a medication that meets those criteria, Doctor? It's a tall order, I know. But I'm willing to try, as long as it doesn’t interfere with my daily life. And Harold approves.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ellan. Those are perfectly reasonable concerns, and we'll take them very seriously. Finding the right medication is about minimizing side effects and maximizing benefits, and we'll work together to achieve that. I think a low-dose SSRI, like sertraline, might be a good starting point. It's generally well-tolerated, and it has a relatively low risk of causing drowsiness or cognitive impairment. We'll start with a very low dose, and we'll monitor you closely for any side effects. If you experience any problems, we'll stop the medication immediately and explore other options. Before we start, I want to be clear that it takes time to see the full effects of an SSRI, usually several weeks. It's also important to be patient and consistent with the medication. Would you like me to write you a prescription for a low-dose sertraline?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A low dose, as you said. And please, write a note explaining the potential side effects. I want to be fully informed. And I want to be able to show it to Harold. He likes to know everything. And please, remind me to be patient. I’m not a patient person, as you may have gathered. And I want to be able to stop the medication immediately if I start feeling unwell. And please, remind me to schedule a follow-up appointment. I want to make sure everything is going smoothly. And please, don't be alarmed if I call you with questions. I tend to worry, you see. And please, don't judge me if I change my mind. I’m a bit indecisive, as you may have gathered. And please, thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your patience. And your understanding. I hope this works. I really do. I just want to be able to relax… and not worry so much. It's a simple request, really. A simple request.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. I’ll write a detailed prescription for a low-dose sertraline, and I’ll include a comprehensive information sheet outlining the potential side effects. I’ll also make a note to remind you to be patient, to stop the medication immediately if you experience any problems, and to schedule a follow-up appointment. And please, don’t hesitate to call me with any questions or concerns. I’m here to help, and I won’t judge you if you change your mind. Here you go. And remember, it takes time to see the full effects of the medication, so be patient and consistent. I’ve scheduled a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks. We’ll check in then to see how you’re doing. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. You’ve been very thorough. And very patient. And very understanding. I appreciate everything. I really do. I suppose I should be going. Harold is probably wondering where I am. He's a very punctual man, you see. Thank you again, Doctor. I hope this works. I really do. Good day, Doctor. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ellan. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, take things one step at a time, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. Have a good day! .
