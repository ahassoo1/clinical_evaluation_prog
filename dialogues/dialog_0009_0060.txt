DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, it's...family, mostly. My mom, she’s been having some issues, and my grandfather… well, he wasn’t so lucky. I just… I want to make sure I’m okay, you know? It’s probably nothing, but it’s better to be safe than sorry, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Blain. It’s very responsible of you to think ahead and be proactive, especially with a family history of health concerns. It's always better to address things early. When you say “issues” with your mom, could you tell me a little more about what she’s experiencing?
PATIENT: She’s been… forgetful, mostly. Not like, can’t-remember-her-name forgetful, but little things. Where she put her keys, appointments… things like that. And she gets tired really easily. She went to the doctor, they ran some tests, but honestly, they didn’t seem to take her seriously. Just said it was “age” or “stress.” She’s barely 70, you know? It feels…dismissive. And, like I said, my grandfather… he had something with his memory, too. It was bad. Really bad. They said it was…Alzheimer’s, I think. Or something like that.
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds frustrating, Blain, especially when you feel like her concerns aren’t being fully addressed. It’s good you’re advocating for her health. And yes, a family history of dementia does raise a valid concern. So, you mentioned your mom’s forgetfulness and fatigue. Has she noticed any changes in her personality or behavior?
PATIENT: Well, she’s… gotten a bit more irritable, I guess. Snappier than usual. And she’s…repeating herself a lot. Asking the same questions over and over, even if I just answered them. It’s… annoying, frankly. Not that I want to sound insensitive, but it's hard to deal with. It’s not just the forgetting, it's… everything. She used to be so organized, so put-together. Now? It's a mess. And she’s starting to get paranoid about things, too. Thinking people are talking about her, that things are being stolen. It's… a bit much.
DOCTOR: That does sound concerning, Blain. Those changes – the irritability, repetition, paranoia – are all things we’d want to take seriously, especially with the family history you’ve described. It’s understandable that it’s difficult to deal with, and it doesn't make you insensitive to acknowledge that. Now, turning to you – you came in because you're concerned about your health, given all of this. Have you noticed any changes in your memory or cognitive function?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I’m only 24. I haven’t forgotten where I parked my car or anything. I’m a teacher, I have to remember a lot of stuff for my classes, and I’m doing fine. But that’s the thing, right? It starts small. That’s what I’m worried about. I don’t want to be like her, or like… Grandpa. I just want to know if there's anything I can do, any tests I can take to… rule things out, I guess. It's probably nothing, but it's always in the back of my mind. I feel like I’m constantly checking myself, you know? Making sure I haven’t forgotten something important. It's exhausting.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Blain. It’s very insightful of you to be proactive and want to address this now, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when you have a family history of these conditions. It’s good you’re aware of any potential changes and monitoring yourself. Let’s do a quick cognitive assessment, just to get a baseline. It’s a simple series of questions and tasks, and it will give us a starting point. Then, we can talk about lifestyle factors and any further testing that might be helpful. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… good. A baseline sounds smart. I guess the sooner we know, the better. I just... don't make it a big deal, okay? I don't need everyone worrying about me. I'm probably fine. It’s just… better safe than sorry, like I said. What kind of questions are we talking about? I hope it's not too embarrassing. I'm not good with tests.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Blain. We’ll keep it very low-key, and I assure you, it’s nothing to be worried about. It’s not a graded exam, just a way to assess your current cognitive function. It won’t be embarrassing at all, I promise. We’ll start with some simple memory questions – remembering a few words, recalling dates. Then, we’ll do a few tasks to assess your attention, language, and problem-solving skills. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Words and dates… I can probably handle that. As long as it’s not like, complicated math or something. I haven’t done math since high school, and I barely passed then. Seriously, let’s just get it over with. I have a class to prepare for this afternoon, so the quicker, the better. Don't mean to rush you, but… you know. Time.
DOCTOR: No rush at all, Blain. And no complicated math, I promise. We'll start with the memory portion. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Then, later, I'll ask you to recall them. Ready?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Hit me. Three words, right? Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me, please?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Got it. That's easy enough. Next?
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. What is today's date?
PATIENT: Ugh. Dates. Okay, let me think… It’s August… the 2nd. August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I always mess up the years. I should really pay more attention.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly correct, Blain! August 2nd, 2025. Very good. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Okay, seriously? Okay, it's… 2025. I just said it, didn't I? Look, I'm a teacher, not a historian. I deal with Shakespeare, not dates. This is a bit pointless, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s not pointless at all, Blain. We’re just establishing a baseline, as we discussed. Now, let’s move on to a different type of question. Can you tell me the name of the current President of the United States?
PATIENT: Seriously? Okay, fine. It's… Harris. Kamala Harris. Is that what you wanted? I swear, this is more like a civics test than a… whatever this is supposed to be. I'm starting to feel a little… insulted, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Blain. These questions are standard for a cognitive assessment. They help us get a broad picture. Now, I’m going to ask you to count backwards from 100 by sevens. Take your time.
PATIENT: By sevens? Are you kidding me? I haven't done that since… I don't even remember. Okay, um… 100… 93… 86… Ugh. This is impossible. 79… Wait, is that right? I'm terrible at math. 72… Oh, forget it. I can't do this. This is ridiculous. I'm a teacher, not a mathematician! .
DOCTOR: Okay, Blain. That's perfectly alright. It seems like this is causing you some stress, and we don’t want to push you beyond your comfort level. Let’s stop here for now. Based on what I’ve observed, and your concerns about your family history, I think it would be prudent to order a few blood tests. These will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to cognitive changes. We can also schedule a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. How does that sound?
