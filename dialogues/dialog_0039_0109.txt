DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now? Not real bad all the time, but… a steady ache. Like someone is pressing on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a steady ache at the back of your head for about three days. That sounds uncomfortable. Hmm. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a throbbing pain. More like… a weight. And sometimes it feels… tight. Like a band around my head, but just the back part. I was working on the rail yard, like always… moving the little train cars around. Maybe that did it? I don’t know. I’m old, Doctor. Things hurt. But this is… different. Not like my usual aches.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you're paying attention to what feels different. Working hard at the rail yard certainly could contribute. A weight or a tight band sensation... alright. Has anything made it better or worse since it started?
PATIENT: Let me think… resting helps a little. When I sit down and close my eyes, it doesn't hurt as much. But not much else. Drinking water doesn’t help, and neither does… what you call it… the pain pills my neighbor gave me. They didn’t do nothing. And… being out in the sun makes it worse, I think. Been very hot these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting helps a little, but not a lot. Pain pills aren’t touching it, and the sun seems to aggravate it. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Let me see… no fever. No dizzy. I haven't been throwing up. My vision… I think it’s okay. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I always need glasses, you know? And… no, I don’t think so. Nothing else. Just the head pain. Oh! Wait… maybe a little tired. But I'm always a little tired, Doctor. Being old is tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no dizziness, no vomiting. Vision’s a little blurry, as usual. And just general tiredness. I appreciate you thinking so carefully about it all. Now, I’m going to ask some general questions just to get a fuller picture. Have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: No. Never like this. I get… regular headaches sometimes, you know? Like a muscle tension thing, from working. But I take a little rest and it goes away. This is different. It’s… deeper, somehow. And it doesn't go away with rest. It’s been three days now, and it’s… constant. Even when I sleep. It's a dull ache, but it's always there.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important – it’s different from your usual tension headaches, and it's persistent even with rest. Now, do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, my knees are bad. Real bad. Doctor told me years ago it’s… arthritis, I think? Makes walking hard. And my blood pressure... it goes up and down. I try to watch the salt. But other than that… no. I don’t take much medicine. Don’t like putting things in my body. I'm old. Everything gets a little broken down, you know? It's just… part of getting old. But this head pain… that feels new.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis in your knees and some trouble with blood pressure. You try to watch your salt. That's good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think... yes. Long time ago. Maybe… thirty years ago? I had a hernia operation. And… oh! And they took out my appendix when I was young. But that was… a long, long time ago. Nothing else. Small things. Nothing important. This head pain is… more worrying than any of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, hernia repair and appendix removal, both a long time ago. Now, can you tell me about your family?
PATIENT: Family... My wife, she passed away… ten years ago. We had two children. A boy and a girl. My son, he lives in Guatemala, back where I was born. My daughter… she lives in the city, but I don’t see her much. She’s busy. They both have families of their own. Not much help to me now, but… they visit when they can. They worry, I think. But I try to take care of myself. I always have. Still, this head pain... it makes me think of bad things.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife. It sounds like you have a close family, even with the distance. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Never had any trouble with allergies. I eat everything. My wife… she used to make me special foods. But I can eat anything. No medicine allergies either. Doctor gave me some pills years ago… for my knees… and I didn’t have any trouble with them. No. No allergies. I'm a simple man, Doctor. Simple tastes, simple body. Just this head pain… it’s not simple. It's worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, one last few questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. My wife… she didn't like smoking. And I didn’t want to upset her. Always tried to be a good husband. No, never smoked. I drink a little beer sometimes. When I'm with friends. But not much. Just a little. It helps me relax. But no smoking. I try to take care of myself, you see. Still… this head pain… it’s making me think about my health. It's worrying me a lot. I'm an old man, but I still want to live a little longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, you drink a little beer socially but don't smoke. That's good to know. Now, if you're comfortable, I’d like to take a look at your head and neck, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. My head… it doesn’t hurt more when I move it. But… go ahead. Do what you need to do. I just want to feel better. This head pain… it’s making me tired. And worried. I haven't felt this worried in a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start by checking your blood pressure. Then, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll gently feel your head and neck for any tenderness or swelling. I'll also ask you to follow my finger with your eyes and do a few simple balance tests. It won't take long. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Not alarmingly high, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit faint. Lungs are clear. Now, let me feel around your head and neck. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe a little tight, around the back of my head. But that's probably just… my muscles. I work hard, you know? Rail yard work is hard on the body. No, no sharp pain. Just… tightness. Like a band. That's what I told you before. It's just... a constant pressure. Not sharp, just... there. Always there. It doesn't hurt more when you touch it. It just… is. And the pressure… it feels like it's inside my head, not on my head. If that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful – tightness, more of an internal pressure than pain on the surface. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes only, keeping your head still. Look to the left… now to the right… up and down. Good. Now, let's try standing with your feet together, arms at your sides, and just try to stay balanced for a few seconds. And finally, if you’re able, could you try walking heel-to-toe for a few steps?
PATIENT: Okay... I can do that. Standing… okay. I can stand. But… I’m a little wobbly. My knees… they don't like standing for too long. But I’m trying. Whoa… careful now. My knees… they’re bad. Walking heel-to-toe… it’s hard. I can do it, but it’s… unsteady. I almost fell. My knees are just… weak. Old age, Doctor. Everything gets weak. This head pain… it's making it harder. I'm worried.
DOCTOR: Whoa, easy there. That’s alright. Please, sit down. Your balance is a little unsteady, and the heel-to-toe walk was difficult, likely due to your knees as you said. And you’re right to be concerned. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, the headache, the tightness, and the slight unsteadiness… it could be a number of things. It's unlikely to be life-threatening, but we need to rule out a few possibilities. It’s concerning that it’s new, persistent, and not responding to rest or over-the-counter pain relievers. Given your age and your history of high blood pressure, I’d like to order a CT scan of your head just to be safe. It will help us see if there’s anything going on inside your head causing the pain. And I want to get a blood test to check your electrolytes and rule out any inflammation. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A CT scan? And a blood test? Oh dear. It sounds… serious, Doctor. Are you saying something is… bad? I don't like going to the hospital. And blood tests… I hate needles. But… if you think it's necessary, then okay. I trust you. You’re the doctor. But… what if it is bad? What if there is something wrong? This head pain… it’s just… worrying me so much. I’m an old man, Doctor. I just want to feel better. Is it going to hurt? The CT scan, I mean? And the blood test… will it take a long time? I have… things to do, you know? Simple things, but… important things.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mr. Brum. I want to assure you that I’m not saying anything is seriously wrong. A CT scan and blood test are just precautionary measures to rule out any potential causes for your headache. They are the best way to get a clearer picture of what's going on. The CT scan itself is painless. You'll lie on a table, and a machine will take pictures of your head. It takes only a few minutes. The blood test will involve a small prick of a needle – a little discomfort, but it’s very quick. We'll get the results back within a few days. While we wait for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help manage the discomfort. And I recommend resting as much as possible and avoiding any strenuous activity. If the pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, dizziness, vision changes, or weakness, please come back to see me immediately or go to the emergency room. Here’s the prescription. And I’ll have the lab order ready for you so you can go get the blood test done when you’re ready. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. A mild pain reliever… that’s good. And resting… I can do that. It’s just… hard to sit still. Always been a busy man. A CT scan… and a blood test… It sounds… scary. But I trust you, Doctor. You seem very kind. And I want to feel better. I really do. The lab order… where is that? And when can I get the CT scan done? I hope it doesn’t take too long. And… will they tell me the results right away? Or do I have to come back again? I hate waiting. Waiting… makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: I'll print out the lab order for you now. It’s just a small slip of paper that you take to the lab at [Name of local lab]. They’re open [Lab hours]. As for the CT scan, I'm sending a referral to [Name of local imaging center]. They’ll call you within 24-48 hours to schedule an appointment. Usually, you'll get an appointment within a few days. They’ll let you know all the details about the preparation and what to expect. The radiologist will read the scan and send the results to me. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, usually within 24-48 hours of the scan. I promise to keep you informed every step of the way. I know waiting is difficult, and I’ll do my best to get you answers as quickly as possible. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Lab order… imaging center… waiting… I’ll try to be patient. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. You’ve been very kind. I hope… I hope everything is okay. It's just… this head pain… it's making me so anxious. I just want to feel like myself again. I think… I think I should go home now. Get some rest. And wait. Just wait.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns at all, even if it’s just to check in. And please, try to rest. Take it easy. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Take care, Mr. Brum. And I hope you have a peaceful evening.
