DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. I see you’re 90 years young – that’s wonderful! Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Is…Petri-moolx? That’s a pretty name. Well, my tummy…it’s gotten big. Not fat, just…puffy. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Everything feels… heavy, you know? I just don’t have much… pep. Is that how you say it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Petri-moolx is correct, and thank you, that’s kind of you to say. “Puffy” and a loss of appetite, and feeling less energetic… I understand. That gives me a starting point. When did you first notice your tummy feeling puffy, and would you say it’s been gradually getting bigger, or did it happen more suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I notice? It feels like…a long time now. Maybe a month? Or two? It’s hard to say. Things…blur. I think it got bigger slowly. Not one day, poof! Just…more and more. Is that helpful? I don’t remember much about dates, you see.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Soila, thank you. It’s perfectly alright that dates are difficult to recall. “Slowly getting bigger over a month or two” is very useful information. And you mentioned not wanting to eat much anymore – has your weight changed at all recently?
PATIENT: Oh, weight… I used to be… sturdier. But now? I think so. My clothes…they feel a little loose. But I don't… weigh myself. Never have, really. Does that make sense? I just feel…lighter. And not in a good way, if you know what I mean. Like… empty.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Soila. Feeling lighter and clothes being looser, even without a specific weight, is a good observation. And the feeling of “emptiness” is important too. Now, besides the puffiness and loss of appetite, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? Let me think… Oh! Sometimes I feel… tired. More tired than usual, even after a good sleep. And… my legs, they feel a little weak. Not all the time, but sometimes. Like they might… give out. Is that a change? I do a lot of sitting, you see. It's easier.
DOCTOR: Yes, Soila, feeling more tired and having weak legs are definitely changes we should explore. When you say your legs feel weak, does that happen when you're trying to stand up, or walk, or at other times?
PATIENT: Oh, mostly when I stand up. See? It’s like… a wobble. Not a big one, but enough to make me hold onto things. The furniture, mostly. I don’t want to fall, you know. Not at my age. It's scary, falling. And… sometimes my tummy… it feels uncomfortable when I stand too long. Like a… a heavy feeling.
DOCTOR: I understand. The wobble when standing, and the heavy feeling in your tummy with prolonged standing… those are important details. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel…habits? Oh dear. Is that… a polite question? I… I try not to think about those things. Old ladies don't talk about… that. But… well, I haven’t been going to the bathroom as often. And… it's harder, you know? I have to… push. Is that… enough information? I don't like talking about this.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Soila. You’ve told me exactly enough. It’s very common for changes in bowel habits to occur, and it’s important for me to know. Less frequent bowel movements and needing to strain… thank you for sharing that. Now, I’m going to ask about other parts of your body, just to get a complete picture. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. Not really. They might be a little puffy sometimes, but… I always thought that was just old age. My mother’s feet were like that too. Not swollen, exactly. Just… not as firm. Does that make sense? I mostly wear slippers, you see. They hide everything.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Soila. It’s good to know your feet aren’t noticeably swollen, and that you’ve noticed a change in firmness. Okay, one more general question for now: have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite besides the decreased desire to eat?
PATIENT: Nausea…? No, I haven’t been sick. No throwing up. Just… not hungry. Food doesn’t sound good. Like… it doesn’t appeal to me anymore. Everything tastes… bland. Even my favorite candies. And sometimes, if I try to eat too much… my tummy feels… full. Very full. And uncomfortable. But no… no sickness. Just… less interest. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very clear, Soila. Less interest in food, and a feeling of fullness with even small amounts… thank you for explaining that. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history? That was a long time ago. I… I think I had high blood pressure once? The doctor gave me pills. But I stopped taking them. They made me feel… funny. And… I had a little trouble with my heart, maybe? I had some tests. But mostly… I’ve been lucky. Old age is the worst thing I’ve got, I think. I don’t remember much about what the doctors said. It was so long ago. Does that help? I’m sorry I’m not more… organized.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Soila. It’s very common for details to become fuzzy over time. High blood pressure and some tests for your heart… that gives me a starting point. Do you happen to remember when you were diagnosed with the high blood pressure, even approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear… When? That was… before my husband passed away. No, wait… maybe after? I really don’t remember. It was a long time ago. Maybe… twenty years ago? Or more? I’m so bad with dates. Everything just blurs together. I… I don’t want to guess and be wrong. I’m sorry. It’s just… so long ago. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Soila. It’s alright that you don’t remember the exact timing. Knowing it was some time ago is helpful enough. Do you recall if you were ever hospitalized for anything, even briefly?
PATIENT: Hospitalized…? Hmm… I think… yes. Once. A long time ago. I broke my hip. I fell in the garden. It was very painful. But they fixed it. I had to stay in the hospital for a week, maybe two. They gave me a lot of pain medicine. And… they taught me how to walk again. It was very hard. But I got better. That was… a long time ago. Before my husband passed away, I think. Is that helpful? I'm sorry I can't be more precise. Everything feels like a dream sometimes.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Soila. A broken hip requiring hospitalization… thank you for sharing that. Now, have you had any surgeries besides the hip repair?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Oh dear… let me think. I think… no. Just the hip. I remember being very scared. And the pain. But just the hip. I didn’t like hospitals. Too many… smells. And too many young people running around. I prefer being at home. Is that… enough? I’m pretty sure it was just the hip. Nothing else. I would remember something else, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is good to know, Soila. Just the hip repair. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – had any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother… she had a weak heart. She died when I was young. And my father… he had trouble breathing. He smoked too many cigarettes. And my brother… he had some kind of sickness with his blood. He had to go to the hospital a lot. But that was a long time ago. They’re all gone now. I… I don’t remember much about what the doctors said. It was so long ago. Is that helpful? I’m sorry I can’t be more specific. Everything feels so distant.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Soila. Knowing about your mother's weak heart, your father's breathing problems, and your brother’s blood condition gives me a better picture. Now, I’d like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no, never. I don’t like the smell of cigarettes. My father smoked, but I always told him it was bad for his health. I prefer fresh air. I used to have a garden, but I can't get around to it much anymore. Too hard on my legs. I prefer sitting, you see. It's easier. Does that make sense? I don't like smoke. Never have.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Soila. You've never smoked. Now, do you drink alcohol, even occasionally?
PATIENT: Alcohol…? Oh, sometimes. A little glass of wine with dinner. But not very often. Maybe once a week? Or less. It helps me relax. But I don't need it. I just… enjoy the taste sometimes. It’s a small glass. Nothing big. I don’t drink much. Does that make sense? I'm not a big drinker. Never have been.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A small glass of wine occasionally. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Oh dear… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to eat everything. But sometimes… my skin gets a little itchy. But I think that’s just old age. Dry skin, you know? I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Never have been. But I don't remember everything, you see. Is that helpful? I'm sorry I can't be more precise. Everything feels so distant.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Soila. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... I used to take a pill for my blood pressure. But I stopped taking it. Like I said. It made me feel funny. And... sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis. Just when my joints are really aching. It's… a small white pill. But I don't take it very often. And… sometimes I take a vitamin. Just a general one. But I forget to take it sometimes. Is that helpful? I'm sorry I can't remember the names. Everything feels so distant. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter, Soila, thank you for telling me. Stopping the blood pressure medication and taking something for arthritis occasionally… that's important information. Do you remember the name of the arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear…the name… No, I don’t. I just ask the pharmacist for something for my aching joints. He knows what I need. It’s a small white pill. That’s all I remember. Small and white. It helps a little. But I don't take it very often. It's just… when my joints are really bothering me. I’m sorry I can’t be more precise. Everything feels so distant. I don’t remember names very well. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Soila. Knowing it’s a small white pill for your joints is helpful enough. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t mind. But please be gentle. My old bones are… fragile. And… I don’t like being poked and prodded. But if you think it will help… then go ahead. Just be careful. Is that alright? I just… don't want to fall. Or break anything.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I will be very gentle. We’ll take things slowly. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds a bit… regular, but a little quiet. I hear some… diminished breath sounds, especially on the lower lobes. That could be normal for your age, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is… 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not dangerously high. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is… soft, but there's some… mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. And I do feel some… fullness. Not a hard mass, just… generalized fullness. Now, let’s check your legs. Your legs… have some… mild pitting edema, meaning there’s a little swelling that remains when I press on them. And your pulses are… a little weak, but present. Finally, let’s quickly check your reflexes. Your reflexes are… a little diminished, which is common with age. Okay, that’s all for the exam. Everything went well. You were very brave.
PATIENT: Oh… that was… a lot. Everything feels… poked and prodded now. Did you find anything bad? Is everything alright? My tummy feels… funny. And my legs feel… weak. Is that the fullness you felt? Is it something serious? Please tell me. I just want to know if I'm going to be alright. I don’t want to be sick.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Soila. It was a quick exam, and you did wonderfully. I didn't find anything definitively bad, but there are a few things that need further investigation. The fullness in your abdomen, the mild tenderness, and the edema in your legs… these could be related to several things. The diminished breath sounds are also something we need to monitor. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, I suspect it could be a combination of factors – possibly some fluid retention, some mild congestion, and potentially some digestive issues. But to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray. The blood tests will check your kidney function, liver function, and look for any signs of infection or anemia. The chest X-ray will help us assess your lungs and rule out any serious problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests? Blood tests and an X-ray? That sounds… scary. Will it hurt? Will they find something bad? I don't like tests. I just want to feel better. Is it really necessary? Can't we just… give me something for my tummy? A pill, maybe? I don’t want to be poked and prodded anymore. I just want to go home and rest. Is there anything else we can do? Please tell me. I’m getting scared now.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Soila. Tests can be frightening, and I want to assure you that we’re doing this to get a clear picture of what's going on, so we can best help you feel better. The blood test will only involve a small sample of blood taken from your arm – it’s a quick pinch, and most people don’t find it very painful. The X-ray is completely painless – you’ll just stand or sit while a machine takes a picture of your chest. It doesn’t involve any radiation that’s harmful. I wish I could just give you a pill to make everything better, but without knowing the cause of your symptoms, it’s difficult to prescribe the right medication. It’s important to rule out any serious conditions first. The tests will help us determine the underlying cause of your fullness, tenderness, and leg swelling, so we can develop a treatment plan that’s tailored to your specific needs. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… detail…? I don't know… I just… everything is so confusing. Blood and X-rays and… causes… It's too much. I just want to feel better. Is it really necessary? Can't we just… wait and see? Maybe it will go away on its own? I don't like hospitals. Or tests. Or doctors. I just want to go home and rest. Please… can't we just try something simple first? A pill, maybe? Or a warm compress? Anything? I’m getting very scared now. I feel so… old and tired.
DOCTOR: I understand, Soila. You’re feeling overwhelmed and scared, and that’s perfectly alright. It's completely reasonable to want to avoid tests and try something simple first. Let me explain my reasoning. While it’s possible your symptoms could improve on their own, there are a few things we need to rule out, even if it's unlikely. The fullness in your abdomen could be caused by several things, some of which are more serious than others. The swelling in your legs could indicate a problem with your heart or kidneys. I don't want to unnecessarily subject you to tests, but I also want to make sure we're not missing anything important. Here’s what I propose. We can start with the blood tests. They are relatively simple and provide a lot of valuable information. We can hold off on the chest X-ray for now and see what the blood tests show. If the blood tests are normal, we can try some conservative measures, like a low-sodium diet and compression stockings for your legs. We can also discuss some medications to help with your digestive issues, but without knowing the cause, it's difficult to choose the right one. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh… just the blood tests…? Just the blood tests for now? And then… we see what they say? And then maybe we don't need the X-ray? That sounds… better. A little better. But… will it hurt? And will it take a long time? And what if they find something bad? Please tell me… what are you looking for? What kind of bad things? I don’t want to know if I’m… dying. But I want to know… what are you worried about? Please be honest. I just want to know… what are we looking for in the blood?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable to ask, Soila. I want to be completely honest with you. The blood tests will check several things. Primarily, we're looking at your kidney and liver function. Your kidneys help remove fluid from your body, and if they aren’t working properly, it can cause swelling in your legs. Your liver helps with digestion, and problems with your liver can cause fullness in your abdomen. We’ll also check for signs of infection, which could be causing your symptoms. And we’ll check your red blood cell count to see if you’re anemic, which can cause fatigue and weakness. To be upfront, we're also looking for signs of heart failure, though based on your exam, it's not my primary concern. We can assess your electrolytes too, as these can affect your energy level. The blood draw itself is a quick pinch – most people don’t find it very painful. It will take a few minutes to collect the sample, and then we’ll send it to the lab for analysis. The results usually take a few days to come back. I want to emphasize that these are just preliminary tests, and we don't know what they'll show. It's possible everything will be normal, and we can move on to other treatments. I am not assuming the worst, but I have to rule out potential causes. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… kidneys and liver… and heart… It sounds… scary. So many things can go wrong. And it will take days to find out? Days of worrying? But… if everything is normal…? What then? What if the tests don't show anything? What if it’s just… old age? I just want to feel better. I want to be able to eat again. And I want to be able to walk without feeling so tired. Is that too much to ask? But… okay. Okay, let’s do the blood tests. But please… please be gentle. And please tell me the results as soon as you can. I just want to know. I just want to know what’s wrong. And then… maybe we can go home?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask those questions, Soila, and it's perfectly okay to feel worried. If the tests are normal, that's wonderful news! It would mean we need to explore other possibilities. We could consider it being related to age, as you said, or perhaps it’s a digestive issue that needs further evaluation. We can also try some symptom management techniques, like dietary changes and light exercise. I promise to be very gentle during the blood draw, and I’ll let you know the results as soon as they’re available – usually within a few days. I understand how anxious you are, and I'll do everything I can to keep you informed. Let’s get the blood draw done now. I'll have my nurse come in to assist us. We'll get you comfortable, and it will be over before you know it. And then, we’ll discuss the next steps once we have the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… alright. Let’s get it over with. But please… be quick. And gentle. I… I don't like needles. Thank you… for being patient with me. I know I’m not very easy. Let’s just get it done now. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. You are not difficult at all. And I completely understand your anxiety about needles. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Let me call my nurse, Maria, and she will come in to assist us. She's very skilled and gentle, and I’m sure she’ll make you feel comfortable. Just take a deep breath, and we’ll be done before you know it. And then, we can discuss the next steps and get you on your way. Maria! Could you please come to room three?
PATIENT: Just… be gentle. Just… be gentle…
DOCTOR: Hi Soila, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Maria. Dr. Petrimoulx has told me you’re a little nervous about the blood draw, and I want to assure you that we’ll take things slowly and gently. Do you have a preferred arm?
PATIENT: Oh… hello. That one… please. But… please be quick. And… gentle. I don't like needles. At all. It hurts… doesn’t it? Is it going to hurt a lot? Please… just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I understand your anxiety, and I promise to be as gentle as possible. It’s a quick pinch, and it won’t last long. We’ll use a small needle, and I’ll distract you while we get it done. I'm going to clean the area with an alcohol swab first. It will feel a little cold. Okay, just a little pinch now… Just breathe deeply, Soila. You're doing great. Almost done… All done! See?
PATIENT: Ooh… that did pinch. It’s… over now? Is it… bleeding? It feels… strange. But… thank you. Thank you for being gentle. It wasn’t as bad as I thought. But… I still don’t like needles. Now what? What happens now? Do we have to wait? I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s all over now. You did wonderfully, Soila. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little strange afterwards. The small amount of blood that came out is perfectly normal and the bandage will keep it clean and protected. You don’t have to wait. The nurse will send this off to the lab. We'll get the results within a few days. Dr. Petrimoulx will contact you as soon as they're available. For now, you just need to rest and avoid strenuous activity with that arm. You can remove the bandage in a few hours if you like. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m alright. Just… tired. And a little… shaken up. Thank you both… for being so kind. And patient. It’s… hard being old, you know? Everything hurts. And everything scares you. I think… I just want to go home. And rest. And maybe have a cup of tea. Thank you… again. You’ve been very good to me. Is there anything I need to do before I leave? Or… anything I should remember?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Soila. It’s my pleasure. You didn’t need to thank us, you've been a very brave patient. There's nothing you need to do before you leave. We’ll send the results to the number on file. Just remember to take it easy and rest. And if you experience any bleeding or discomfort at the site of the blood draw, please don’t hesitate to call us. Here’s our card. Let’s get you home now. Maria will walk you to the reception desk. Is there anyone waiting to pick you up, or are you taking a taxi?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you. No, I’m taking a taxi. My son… he's busy. He works long hours. He’s a good boy. But he’s always busy. I think… I’m ready to go now. Thank you both… again. You’ve been very kind. I… I appreciate it. Let’s go… I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. We’re happy to help. Just take your time, and let me know if you need anything at all. There you go. Maria will help you get a taxi. Please make sure Soila gets a comfortable ride home. It was lovely meeting you, Soila. We hope you feel better soon. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call. .
PATIENT: Home… just want to go home… and have a cup of tea…
