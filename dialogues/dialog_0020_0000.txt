DOCTOR: Good morning, Sharifa. My name is Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… alright. Honestly, I don’t usually bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. But this leg thing is… inconvenient, to say the least. I had a bit of a cold last week, nothing serious, just a sniffle and a cough. Now, suddenly, my legs feel like jelly. It’s just…weak. Both of them. And it's so frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Like jelly,” and weakness in both legs… that is concerning, and I’m glad you came in to get it checked out. It's good you’re here. Just to clarify – this weakness started after your cold symptoms subsided?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely after. The cold was… Tuesday, I think. Maybe Wednesday. It was gone by the weekend. Then yesterday morning, I went to get up and… well, it was like trying to walk through water. I almost fell. It hasn’t gotten better since then, and frankly, I don't have time for this. I have a tour scheduled next week. People are paying me to show them around.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the weakness began yesterday morning, following a cold that resolved last week. And it's impacting your ability to walk normally. I see. Before we go further, could you tell me a bit more about the weakness?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not painful, exactly. More like… they just won’t hold me up. Like there's no strength there. When I try to stand, I have to really concentrate, and even then I’m wobbly. Walking feels… precarious. I keep thinking I’m going to stumble. It’s in both legs equally, which is what’s so odd. Usually things happen on one side, don’t they?
DOCTOR: That’s a good observation – it is unusual for it to affect both legs equally. And the fact that it’s not painful is also notable. "Wobbly" and needing to concentrate to stand… alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No numbness or tingling. No fever. My back doesn’t hurt. I’m a little tired, but that’s just because I was up late worrying about my tour, honestly. Oh! And… my ankles feel a little swollen, now that you mention it. Not terribly, but definitely puffier than usual. I hadn’t really connected that to the legs, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankles a little swollen, but no numbness, tingling, or fever. And the tiredness is likely from worry, you think. Good information. I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and feel your ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Get on with it. Honestly, the sooner we figure this out, the better. I really need to know if I can still give that tour. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. People rely on me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to have you lie back. First, let’s check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Okay, reflexes are… a little diminished, but not absent. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? I don't usually do a lot of… hand-squeezing. It feels a bit silly, honestly. And I’ve always been rather delicate. I do a lot of pointing and explaining, not heavy lifting.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Your strength is… reduced in both legs and arms, but more noticeable in your legs. Now, I’m going to palpate your ankles to check for swelling and tenderness. Alright, there is some mild swelling in both ankles. Not a lot of tenderness, though. It doesn't seem to cause you significant pain when I touch them.
PATIENT: No, it doesn’t hurt, just… puffy. Like a balloon that’s been blown up a little too much. It’s rather unsightly, actually. I have to wear certain shoes to hide it. And frankly, this whole thing is just… inconvenient. Do you have any idea what’s going on? Is it something serious? I'm not one for dramatics, but I do need to know if I can work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sharifa. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like we need to rule out a few things. It could be related to a vitamin deficiency, or possibly a nerve issue, though the symmetry makes that less likely. It's also possible there’s something going on with your circulation, or even a reaction to something. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work. It will check your vitamin levels, kidney function, and rule out any inflammation or infection. I also think an EKG would be a good idea, just to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? An EKG? Honestly, Doctor, it sounds… excessive. I just had a cold! But… if it will tell you what’s wrong and if I can work… fine. Yes, do your tests. But please, be quick about it. And try not to poke me too much. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sharifa. I understand your concern. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll order the blood work and the EKG right away. The EKG will only take a few minutes – just some stickers on your chest. And the blood work… well, it’ll be a few vials, but the phlebotomist is very good. I’ll make a note of your easy bruising. While we wait for the results, I'm going to recommend you limit any strenuous activity. No tours for now, alright?
PATIENT: No tours. Of course. Just what I needed. This is a disaster. People are depending on me. Do you have any idea how long this will take? A few hours? A few days? Because if it's days, I’m going to have to cancel everything and… well, it won’t be pretty. And what if it’s something… serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Sharifa. We'll try to get the results back as quickly as possible. Usually, the blood work takes about 24 to 48 hours, and the EKG should be available almost immediately. As for “serious”… it’s too early to say. That’s why we’re doing the tests. It’s more likely to be something treatable, like a vitamin deficiency, but we need to rule out anything more concerning. In the meantime, if you notice any new symptoms – like numbness, tingling, severe pain, or difficulty breathing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? Now you are frightening me. No, no, I don’t have any of that. Just weak legs and puffy ankles. Honestly, Doctor, it feels like I’m falling apart. Fine. No questions, just… hurry. And try to find someone who knows how to draw blood properly. I’ve had bad experiences.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sharifa. I’ll make a note of your previous experiences with blood draws and ensure we use a skilled phlebotomist. I will also speak with the lab to prioritize your tests. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and place the EKG stickers. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in and let you know what we find. In the meantime, please try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. And remember, if anything changes, don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention.
PATIENT: .
