DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, good morning. Look, I don’t have all day, you know. It’s this…shaking. My hand. It’s been happening for a while now, and frankly, it’s embarrassing. It’s just…trembling. Is that enough for you to start figuring it out?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I understand your concern and appreciate you coming in. Trembling can be unsettling, and we'll certainly look into it. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this shaking started?
PATIENT: When did it start…? Honestly, it feels like ages ago. A good…couple of years, maybe? It comes and goes, you know? Worse when I try to…do things. Like, hold a fork. Or sign my name. Not that I do much signing anymore. My wife…she handled all that. It’s just…annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of years, intermittent, and worse with fine motor skills. I see. Does anything specifically seem to trigger it, besides tasks like eating or writing?
PATIENT: Trigger it…? Hmmm. Not really. Sometimes when I’m… agitated. Or tired, I suppose. But mostly it just…happens. Look, I’ve lived a long life, you know? I was a producer, a director. Big movies, important people. I don’t need a fancy diagnosis. Just tell me if it’s something serious, and if there's a pill to fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide, and I appreciate your directness. It's good to know your history as a producer and director – that certainly speaks to your focus and drive. We'll certainly try to get to the bottom of this and see if we can find a solution. To help me understand the scope of the shaking, could you tell me if it's just in your hands, or does it affect other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Just my hands, mostly. Though, sometimes I feel…a little unsteady on my feet. Nothing major, you understand. Just a little wobble now and then. But it’s the hands that are bothersome. Makes me look like a…a weakling. I used to have such steady hands. Crucial in my line of work, you know? Framing a shot…everything had to be perfect.
DOCTOR: I understand how frustrating that must be, especially given your career. A little unsteadiness along with the hand tremors is helpful to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the shaking and unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Let me think. Well, I’ve been a bit… forgetful lately. Though, at my age, who isn’t? And my sleep’s not the best. Wake up a lot during the night. But again, probably just old age. I don’t see what all the questions are for. Are you going to give me something for this, or not? This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions feel extensive, Mr. Baide. I just want to gather as much information as possible to provide the best care. Forgetfulness and difficulty sleeping are important to note, and we’ll certainly consider those. Now, regarding your medications, are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medicare covers… something, I think. My wife always took care of all that. I take… a little pill for my blood pressure, I believe. And sometimes I take something for…digestion. It’s a little pink one. That's about it. I don’t bother with fancy vitamins or anything. Waste of money. Honestly, I don’t even remember the names of these things. It all blurs together.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pill for blood pressure and something for digestion – that’s a good start. Knowing those names would be helpful if you happen to remember them, but don't worry if not. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve always eaten pretty much everything. My wife… she was the one with the sensitive stomach. Had to be careful what she ate. But me? No, no allergies. I'm a pretty robust Italian, you know? Though, I don’t eat much shellfish anymore. Makes my stomach a little… unsettled. But that’s not an allergy, just…preference.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just a preference to avoid shellfish. That's good to know. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes, coordination, and look at your hands more closely. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. I’ve got a lunch reservation. And honestly, poking and prodding isn’t going to magically fix this, is it? But, alright. Do what you have to do. Just…be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. [I take his blood pressure, noting the reading: 140/90 mmHg] Okay, a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. [I auscultate his heart and lungs, noting normal sounds] Everything sounds clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms?
PATIENT: Ugh, are you always this thorough? Look, I was a very busy man. Directors don't have time for… endless examinations. Just…get on with it. I haven't got all day. It's probably just stress. That's all. A lifetime of making tough decisions. It'll catch up with you eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Baide. Now I'm going to check your gait. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't expect any fancy moves. I'm not a dancer, you know. Just an old man trying to get through the day. There. Happy? It's not exactly graceful, but it gets me from point A to point B. Now, can we please talk about a solution? I'm wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Baide. That was helpful. Based on the exam – the slightly diminished reflexes, the tremor more pronounced on one side, and the shuffling gait – and considering your history, I suspect you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with Parkinson’s disease. However, it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. We need to rule out other potential causes and get some further testing done. Would you be willing to schedule an appointment with a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation?
PATIENT: Parkinson's...? Parkinson's? What are you talking about? I was a director, a man of action! I don't… tremble! It's just… a little shake. Everyone gets a little shaky when they get old. A neurologist? More doctors, more tests? No, thank you. I’ve had enough poking and prodding for one day. Just… give me something for the tremor, and I'll be on my way. I don’t need labels and fancy diagnoses. I just want to be able to hold a fork without looking like a fool. .
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Baide, and respect your wishes. However, Parkinson’s disease is best managed with early intervention. While medication can help with the symptoms, it’s important to understand the underlying cause and rule out other possibilities. Given your reluctance to see a neurologist at this time, I can prescribe a medication to help manage the tremor. However, I strongly recommend a follow-up appointment with me in a month to reassess your symptoms and discuss the possibility of a referral again. I'm going to prescribe you a low dose of propranolol, which can help with essential tremor. It's important to be aware of potential side effects like fatigue and low blood pressure. I will also provide you with a handout detailing these. Do you have any questions about the medication or the potential side effects?
