DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Clarke. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good afternoon to you too, Doctor Georgiou. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's these bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, and they’re… painful, you know? Red and kinda hard. Been bothering me for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay, painful bumps on your shins for a few weeks. That definitely sounds bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: It’s not like a sharp pain all the time. More like… achy? And when I touch them, that’s when it really hurts. Especially if I’m wearing jeans or something tight. They just get rubbed all day, you know? It feels… irritated.
DOCTOR: Okay, achy pain that worsens with pressure or friction from clothing. That gives me a little more to work with. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, to be honest. Maybe when I stay off my feet? But I work, you know? Can’t just stay off my feet. Putting my legs up a little helps, I guess, but it doesn’t really make it go away. Just… less bad for a bit. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Clarke. You’ve explained it very clearly. And I appreciate you telling me that resting helps a little, even if it doesn’t completely resolve it. Now, have you noticed any other changes to your legs besides the bumps and the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. They don’t itch, that’s for sure. And they haven’t gotten any bigger, not that I’ve noticed. Skin still looks the same around them, too. No swelling or anything. Just… bumps. Red, painful bumps. I haven’t had a fever or anything like that, if that matters.
DOCTOR: No itching, no changes in skin appearance, no fever – that’s helpful. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your general health, if you don't mind. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me see. I have Medicare, so they check me up every so often. Nothing major, you know? My wife, she keeps track of all that. I think… I had high blood pressure for a bit, but they got it under control with pills. Other than that… not really. I’m a pretty healthy guy, all things considered. I work hard, you know? Keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, managed high blood pressure, that's good to know. And it sounds like you're generally quite active, which is excellent. Are you currently taking any medications for that blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, let me see… Here. These little white ones. I take one every morning. My wife fills up this bag for me, so I just take what’s in here. I don’t really know the name, to be honest. Sorry. She handles all that stuff.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Clarke. It's very common for patients to not remember medication names. We can look up what these are based on how they look. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. I had my appendix taken out when I was young. A long time ago, when I was just a boy. Other than that… no, not really. A few doctor’s visits here and there, but nothing major. No hospitals, no other surgeries. Just the appendix. That was… a long time ago. I was just a kid.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed in childhood. Good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. My family… that’s a tough one. Lots of us. My mother, she had… something with her heart, I think. But she passed away a long time ago. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. He lost a leg because of it. But other than that… I don’t really know. Lots of cousins and aunts and uncles, you know? It’s hard to keep track. Mostly just… old age stuff, if you know what I mean. Lots of passing away. Sorry. It’s not a very helpful answer, is it?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Clarke. You've given me useful information. Heart condition in your mother and diabetes in your father are both important to note. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she doesn’t like them. And I don’t need them, you know? I get enough exercise just from working. Keeps me going. Never had any interest in smoking, no.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. Nothing fancy, you know? Just to relax. My wife and I, we’ll have one or two on a Saturday night, maybe. It’s not a habit, not at all. Mostly just enjoy a good meal with a little something to drink. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate alcohol consumption. Good. Now, just a few more quick questions before I take a look at your legs. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... no, not that I know of. My wife always checks when she gets me new medicine, and she hasn't said anything. I eat pretty much anything, you know? Never had a problem with food. No itchy rashes, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I think I'm pretty lucky, to be honest. No allergies. It's a good thing, right?
DOCTOR: It is a good thing, Clarke. Alright, if you don’t mind, I'm going to take a look at your legs now. Would you mind rolling up your pants legs so I can get a better look?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. No problem at all. Here you go. They're a little tight, these jeans. My wife likes them, though. There you are. Pretty red, aren't they? And sore. Especially when I touch them.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the bumps you're talking about. They're erythematous – that means red – and I can feel some induration, meaning they're firm to the touch. They're mostly located on the anterior, or front, of your shins. And, yes, they are quite tender to palpation. Are they warm to the touch?
PATIENT: Ouch… yeah, they feel… warm. Not burning hot, but… warmer than the rest of my leg, for sure. Especially these ones right here. They feel… angry, you know? Like they’re inflamed. Is that a bad thing? Sorry, I don’t mean to bother you with questions.
DOCTOR: You’re not bothering me at all, Clarke. These are important observations. “Angry” is a good way to describe it – the warmth and redness do suggest inflammation. Now, I’m going to check your pulses in your feet to make sure the circulation is good. Your pulses feel strong and regular, which is reassuring. Based on what I'm seeing and hearing, these bumps could be a number of things, including shin splints, a mild form of vasculitis, or possibly a skin infection. It’s difficult to say for sure without doing a little more investigation. Have you noticed any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. I feel… normal, other than the pain in my legs. Like I said, just sore. And red. And warm. It’s just… a nagging pain. It doesn’t stop me from working, but it's always there, you know? It’s just… annoying. I just want it to go away. Do you think it’s serious? Sorry, I’m probably asking too much.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too much at all, Clarke. It's good you want to understand. Given your strong pulses, lack of fever, and the location of the bumps, it’s unlikely to be something immediately serious. However, we need to rule out a few possibilities. I'd like to order some blood work, just to get a better picture of what's going on. It will help us check for inflammation, infection, and rule out other conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… Okay. That sounds… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. My wife always says I need to get more check-ups anyway. So, blood work… Yes. That’s fine. Will it hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? Sorry, I just… I just want to know what’s going on. And I want it to stop hurting.
DOCTOR: No, the blood draw itself shouldn’t hurt much. Just a quick pinch. It usually takes a few days to get the results back from the lab. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible, and avoiding activities that aggravate the pain. Also, I’m going to prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream to help reduce the inflammation and itching, although you haven’t mentioned itching, it can sometimes help with redness and discomfort too. Are you allergic to any creams or ointments?
PATIENT: No… No allergies that I know of. Like I said, my wife always checks. She’s very careful. Corticosteroid cream… Okay. That sounds… good. Anything to make it stop hurting. Elevate my legs… I can try. It’s hard when I’m working, but I can try to put them up when I get home. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… a little better just knowing what we’re trying to figure out. Will someone call me when the results are back?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clarke. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Yes, my nurse will call you with the results as soon as they are available, usually within 3-5 business days. She'll explain what the results mean and schedule a follow-up appointment if needed. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you again, Doctor Georgiou. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. And thank you for not making me feel silly about these bumps. It’s just… annoying, you know? I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: It’s my pleasure, Clarke. It’s never silly to ask questions or seek help for something that’s bothering you. That’s what I’m here for. And I understand how annoying it can be to deal with persistent discomfort. I’ll have my nurse come in shortly with the lab requisition and instructions. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Clarke, and I hope you find some relief soon.
