DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… it’s my leg. It’s been swelling. After… after the cancer stuff. It’s just… puffy, you know? And a little uncomfortable. I hope you can help.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Queener. "After the cancer stuff" – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Well, I had… treatments. A few years ago now. For… it was in my breast. They did… things. Pills, mostly. And… radiation. It was a long time ago. I don’t remember all the details, to be honest. They said it was all good, but now… this leg. It started slowly, but it’s getting worse. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, you had breast cancer treatment with pills and radiation, and now you're experiencing swelling in your leg. To clarify, can you tell me which leg is swelling – your right or your left?
PATIENT: Oh! Good question. It’s my… left leg. Yes, the left one. It's funny, I always forget which side it is. It's just… there. And bigger than the other one. Sorry, I’m not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Queener. It's perfectly alright. We'll get to the bottom of this together. And forgetting details is very common. Now, regarding the swelling in your left leg – when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? It was very small then, barely noticeable. I thought it was just… getting old, you know? But it’s definitely bigger now. Like, I can see it when I wear shorts. And sometimes it feels… tight. Not painful, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been progressively getting worse over the past six months. You described it as feeling tight, but not painful. Has anything specific made it worse, like standing for long periods, exercise, or even just the time of day?
PATIENT: Oh… now that you mention it. Standing is bad. If I stand for too long, it gets much worse. And… hot weather. When it's really hot, it puffs up even more. I haven’t been doing much exercise, to be honest. I get tired easily. But standing… definitely makes it worse. I used to like gardening, but I can’t do that much anymore. It’s just too hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, standing and hot weather seem to exacerbate the swelling. And you've noticed some fatigue limiting your activity. Have you noticed any changes in the skin on your left leg – any redness, warmth, or sores?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. The skin looks… normal, I think. Maybe a little bit… dry? But no redness or anything. It doesn’t hurt to touch, either. Just… puffy. And sometimes it feels… heavy. Like I’m dragging it around. Is that… normal? I don’t know if that makes sense. I feel silly asking all these questions.
DOCTOR: It doesn't make you silly at all to ask questions, Ms. Queener. It’s important to describe everything you're feeling. Feeling heavy is a good detail to mention. Okay, so no redness, warmth, or sores, just swelling, tightness, and a feeling of heaviness, worsened by standing and hot weather. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam of your legs, if that’s alright with you. I'll just measure the circumference of both legs, check your pulses, and look for any other clues. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds… sensible. I mean, you’re the doctor. You need to look at it, right? Just… be gentle, please. My legs aren’t what they used to be. And… I don’t like surprises. If you find anything… bad, just tell me straight, okay? No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Queener. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I promise to be straightforward with you. No surprises, as you said. Okay, your right leg measures 38 centimeters at the ankle, 52 centimeters at the knee, and 60 centimeters mid-thigh. Now, let’s measure your left leg… 41 centimeters at the ankle, 55 centimeters at the knee, and 63 centimeters mid-thigh. So, there is a noticeable difference in circumference on your left leg. Your pulses are present and equal bilaterally, though slightly diminished. Skin temperature is normal in both legs, and there’s no significant difference in color. I don’t feel any tenderness or unusual lumps. No signs of skin breakdown or infection. Based on what you’ve told me and this quick exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing lymphedema, which is swelling caused by a buildup of fluid in the lymphatic system. It can sometimes occur after cancer treatment, especially if lymph nodes were removed or damaged. However, we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Lymp… what? Is that bad? Cancer… coming back? Oh dear. I knew I should have just stayed home. I don’t understand all those… words. What does that mean? And what do we do about it? Will it hurt? I’m getting nervous now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Queener, please don’t worry. Let’s take this one step at a time. “Lymphedema” just means a buildup of fluid in your leg, like I mentioned. It’s not cancer coming back, but it can be a side effect of the cancer treatment you had. The treatment can sometimes damage the lymphatic system, which is like a network of tubes that helps drain fluid from your body. Think of it like a blocked drain. The fluid can’t flow properly, so it builds up. It's not always serious, and there are things we can do to manage it. Right now, it's important to get a definitive diagnosis. To do that, I’d like to order a duplex ultrasound of your left leg. This is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to look at the blood flow and lymphatic system. It will help us rule out other causes of swelling, like a blood clot. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… what? Sound waves? No poking or… needles? Okay. As long as it doesn't involve needles. And it won't… hurt? Honestly, I hate doctors. Not you, personally, but… all the tests and the poking and the worrying. But… if it rules things out, then… yes. Let's do the sound wave thing. When do we do it? And how long will it take? I have a bingo night on Thursday. I don’t want to miss bingo.
DOCTOR: No poking or needles, I promise. It's completely painless. You'll just lie on a table, and a technician will move a small device over your leg. It doesn't take long – about 30 to 45 minutes. We can schedule it for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. That would give us plenty of time before your bingo night on Thursday. We’ll get the results back usually within a day or two. While we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend you elevate your left leg whenever possible, especially when you're sitting or lying down. And avoid standing for long periods, like you already noticed makes it worse. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Elevate it… bingo… okay. Tomorrow morning is fine. I suppose. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my afternoon tea. And… is there anything else I should be doing? Any creams or… pills? I always forget things. Maybe I should write it down. You know, just in case. I really appreciate you being patient with me, Doctor. I’m a bit of a mess sometimes.
DOCTOR: You're not a mess at all, Ms. Queener. It's perfectly normal to be anxious and forgetful, especially when dealing with health concerns. For now, there aren’t any specific creams or pills I want you to take. We need the ultrasound results before we decide on a treatment plan. I will give you a sheet with these instructions written down, including elevating your leg and avoiding prolonged standing. I'll also include information about lymphedema, so you have something to read in the meantime. I'm happy to answer any questions you have, now or later. And we'll take things one step at a time. Now, let's get you scheduled for that ultrasound. One moment while I check availability…
