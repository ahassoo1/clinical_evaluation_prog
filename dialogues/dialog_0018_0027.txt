DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Reflux. It’s… reflux. Been happening for a while now. Honestly, I don't have time for this. Just want something to stop it, quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Altine. It can be quite disruptive when reflux persists. “A while now” is a bit vague, could you tell me approximately how long you've been experiencing this?
PATIENT: Oh, months. Six? Maybe eight? Look, it comes and goes, alright? It’s not like it’s constant torture. Just… unpleasant. And it's getting worse when I… well, when I lie down. Is that important? Because I do like to lie down after a long day.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Mr. Altine. Worsening symptoms when lying down is a common indicator. So, it flares up six to eight months ago, and has been increasing in frequency or severity recently. Can you describe the sensation?
PATIENT: Describe it? It's… burning. Coming up. Like… like acid. You know, reflux. Honestly, do I need to draw you a picture? It's not a pleasant feeling, that’s why I’m here. And it sometimes… comes back up. Regurgitation, I think the wife calls it. Though, frankly, she worries about everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. And you are right to seek medical attention. “Burning” and “coming up,” with occasional regurgitation... thank you for clarifying. Do you experience this after meals specifically, or at other times as well?
PATIENT: Mostly after meals. Big meals, mostly. Though sometimes it happens even if I just… eat something a little too quickly. And… spicy food. My wife makes this Polish sausage, delicious stuff, but it doesn't agree with me. She won't stop making it, though. Stubborn woman. Does it matter what I eat? Just get to the medicine, alright?
DOCTOR: It does matter, Mr. Altine. Knowing what triggers it helps us determine the best course of action. So, large meals, eating quickly, and spicy foods seem to be culprits. Have you noticed if it's worse with certain beverages - coffee, alcohol, carbonated drinks, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Coffee, yes. I drink coffee. Every morning. And… sometimes a beer with dinner. Look, I’m a grown man, I know what I can and can’t handle. This isn’t rocket science. Are you going to tell me to stop living my life? Because if so, I’m walking out right now. Just tell me what pill I need to take.
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Mr. Altine. I am not suggesting you drastically alter your lifestyle. I simply want to gather a complete picture to ensure we select the most appropriate treatment. You mentioned coffee and beer. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? No. Diabetes? Absolutely not. I’m a perfectly healthy man for my age. Tall, strong… mostly. Look, my wife makes me get a checkup every year. Everything’s always fine. Honestly, I think she just likes the doctor visits. She worries too much. Now, can we please move this along? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. And thank you for clarifying. Since you have regular checkups and report no known medical conditions, that’s helpful. Have you tried any over-the-counter remedies for the reflux – antacids, H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors?
PATIENT: Antacids, yes. The chalky ones. They do… something. Barely. And my wife bought some other stuff, pink pills, blue pills... I don’t keep track. She's always trying something different. None of them really worked for long. That’s why I’m here, remember? I want something stronger. Something that actually works. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Altine, that's not too much to ask at all. It sounds like you've tried a few things without significant relief. To be thorough, could you tell me about any allergies you have, particularly to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nothing. I'm a Polish man, we're built tough. No allergies. Never had them. Look, I've been taking medicine my whole life, all sorts of things. I doubt I'm allergic to anything. Can we just get to the prescription already? I really don't have time for this questioning. I've told you everything. EVERYTHING.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Given your history, the lack of response to over-the-counter medications, and the reported worsening symptoms, I believe it’s prudent to start you on a proton pump inhibitor. I’m going to prescribe Omeprazole 20mg daily, to be taken 30 minutes before a meal. However, given your age and the persistence of symptoms, I would also like to perform a brief physical examination to rule out any other contributing factors. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Are you serious? Look, I came here for a pill, not a check-up. I just told you I’m perfectly healthy. Stubborn woman, my wife. Stubborn doctor, you. I’m not lying down on a table and letting you poke and prod. Absolutely not. Just give me the pill. I’ll try it. If it doesn’t work, I’m finding another doctor. And frankly, I'm wasting my time here. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I understand your frustration. However, as a physician, I have a professional obligation to ensure your safety and provide the best possible care. While you may feel healthy, a brief examination can help rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. It is a standard part of medical practice and, frankly, vital to making the correct diagnosis. Given your insistence, I will prescribe the Omeprazole as you requested. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider the examination. If you continue to experience symptoms despite the medication, I will be unable to provide further assistance without a more thorough evaluation. Are you certain you wish to proceed without an examination?
