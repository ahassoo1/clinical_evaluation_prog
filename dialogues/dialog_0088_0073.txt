DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s… well, it’s my stomach. Just constantly… going. They’ve given me things for it, you know? Pills. But they aren't doing anything. It’s been going on for weeks. Honestly, it’s embarrassing to even talk about.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weeks of ongoing stomach issues can be very disruptive – and yes, embarrassing. We'll get to the bottom of this. When you say “constantly going,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Ugh, how many details do you need? It’s… a lot. Multiple times a day. Watery. And it just… won't stop. I’ve tried everything, honestly. Bland food, staying hydrated... like they always tell you. It's not like I haven't tried things. It’s just… persistently awful. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. "Multiple times a day" and "watery" gives me a better picture. And you've tried the typical dietary adjustments… okay. Has there been any blood in the stool, or fever, or nausea or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Look, if there was blood, do you really think I’d be sitting here? I’d be in the emergency room. No fever, no throwing up. Just… this. Constant, awful diarrhea. And I’m getting really tired of being stuck near a toilet, okay? It’s… inconvenient. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, no blood or fever, that’s good. And you haven't noticed any weight loss with this either?
PATIENT: Weight loss? I… I haven't really been weighing myself. I mean, I’ve been eating, when I can keep anything down for more than five minutes, but… probably. I don’t know. Look, is this going to take much longer? I have a painting job scheduled for this afternoon, and I really need to get back to prep work.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's quickly go over some other things, just to rule things out. Do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No. None. I eat pretty much everything. I haven’t had any reactions to anything, ever. Honestly, I’m a pretty healthy person. This… this is just a weird glitch, I think. It's not like I'm some fragile thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just those pills the other doctor gave me for my stomach. I don't even remember what they were called. Little white ones. They clearly aren't working, so it doesn't matter, does it? I haven't been taking anything else. I usually don’t bother with all that… herbal stuff. Seems like a waste of money.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any significant medical history – any other conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And… my husband passed away a few years back. But that’s not… medical, is it? I've otherwise always been fine. Strong as a horse, usually. This whole thing is just… baffling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a full picture, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Really? Are we going that far back? Honestly, I don’t know. My mother had… something. I think. She wasn't very good at talking about that sort of thing. And my father was a fisherman. He was pretty healthy, as far as I know. Lots of outdoor work. I doubt he had any fancy medical conditions. Look, is this information actually helpful, or are we just going through a checklist? I'm starting to feel like a science experiment.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. It's good to know you're generally healthy and haven't had significant medical issues. Let’s just do a quick physical exam of your abdomen. It will help me rule out some of the more common causes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just… be quick about it, please. I really need to get going. And try not to poke too hard. This is already unpleasant enough. I have a reputation to maintain, you know? A painter needs steady hands.
DOCTOR: Alright, I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and then I'll gently press on different areas. Let me know if anything is particularly painful. Your bowel sounds are… hyperactive. That means they're louder and more frequent than normal. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes! A little. Right… there. It’s not excruciating, but it’s… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. Not constant, though. It comes and goes. And honestly, everything feels a little sensitive when I’m poked and prodded. It's not exactly a relaxing experience, you know? Are you sure you’re not making it worse?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just checking for any other areas of tenderness. There’s no guarding or rebound tenderness that I’m detecting. Okay. Based on what you've told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you may have infectious gastroenteritis – essentially, a stomach bug. However, because it’s been going on for weeks, and you’ve tried other treatments without relief, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a stool sample to check for any bacteria, parasites, or other infections. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A stool sample? Seriously? You want me to… collect that? Look, I already feel humiliated enough. Is that absolutely necessary? Couldn't you just give me something stronger? I don’t have time to be running around with little containers. I have work to do! This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Woodring. It's not a pleasant task, I agree. However, it's the best way to pinpoint the cause of your ongoing diarrhea and ensure we’re treating you appropriately. It’ll also help rule out things like C. difficile infection, which requires specific treatment. I can provide you with detailed instructions and a collection kit. It's a small sample, and the lab will analyze it for any pathogens. If we don’t identify an infection, we can consider other possibilities like Irritable Bowel Syndrome or food sensitivities. Would you like me to write you a requisition?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… fine. Give me the stupid kit. But I swear, if this takes all day, I'm sending you the bill for lost wages. And make sure the instructions are clear. I don’t have a degree in… in sample collection. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here you are. The instructions are straightforward, and the lab is very experienced. They will need a small sample, about the size of a walnut. Try to collect it as soon as possible and bring it to the lab within 24 hours. I’ll also write you a prescription for loperamide, which is an anti-diarrheal medication. It should help to slow things down in the meantime. I recommend starting with two capsules initially, and then one capsule after each loose bowel movement, up to a maximum of eight capsules per day. Do you have any questions about the medication or the stool sample collection?
PATIENT: Ugh, eight capsules? That sounds… excessive. Okay, fine. I’ll try it. And I guess I’ll collect the… sample. Honestly, this has been a waste of my time. Is there anything else? I really need to get going. I have paint to apply, and a reputation to uphold. I'm not paid to sit around discussing… bodily functions.
DOCTOR: Alright. No, I don’t think there’s anything else at this time. We'll review the stool sample results as soon as they come in, and contact you with a plan. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool – please go to the emergency room immediately. Here's a work note excusing you from strenuous activity for the next 24 hours. Get well soon, Ms. Woodring. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. I guess. I really hope this works. And I really hope I don't have to come back here.
