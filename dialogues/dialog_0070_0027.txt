DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get to it. It’s my stomach. Food keeps…coming back up. Not violently, you understand. Just…regurgitation. It’s unpleasant, and frankly, a waste of a perfectly good meal. I’m a busy man.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I understand your time is valuable, and we’ll get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. So, this regurgitation – it's happening after meals, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. Though sometimes it happens even if I haven't eaten much. It's…unpredictable. And it’s not like throwing up, alright? It's more like… a little bit of food just… comes back up, especially when I bend over. It's embarrassing, honestly. You wouldn't understand. A man in my position…
DOCTOR: I certainly understand it can be distressing, Mr. Altine. And I assure you, I’m here to listen without judgment. It's helpful for me to gather as much detail as possible, so thank you for sharing that. When did you first start noticing this happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, hmm, maybe six months ago? It was subtle at first, just a little bit after a big dinner. I thought it was just overeating, to be honest. But it’s gotten…more frequent. I've tried antacids, those over-the-counter ones, but they don't seem to do much good. Waste of money, really. I expect better results for what I pay for healthcare.
DOCTOR: Six months, and the antacids haven’t provided much relief. Thank you. Can you describe what the food looks like when it comes back up?
PATIENT: Well, it's… food. Undigested, mostly. Whatever I ate last, really. If I had pasta, it's pasta. If I had a steak, well, you get the idea. It's not…broken down, not like it should be. And sometimes it's a bit… sour, you know? Like something's not sitting right in my stomach. It's quite unpleasant, frankly. A good chef would be appalled.
DOCTOR: Undigested food, sometimes sour… I see. And is there any particular time of day when it's more likely to happen?
PATIENT: It's worse at night. Definitely worse at night. Laying down… that seems to bring it on. I try to avoid bending over, but it’s not always possible. I have a very active lifestyle, you see. A man has things to do. It’s just… inconvenient. And embarrassing. And quite frankly, a bit worrying. I don’t have time for illness.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Altine. It's good you’re being proactive about this. Since it’s worse at night and with lying down, that gives us a helpful clue. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Well, I do get a bit of heartburn sometimes. A burning sensation in my chest, especially after eating something spicy. And I have… well, I wouldn't say pain, exactly, but a discomfort in my stomach. Like a fullness, even when I haven't eaten much. And occasionally, a little bit of bloating. Nothing major, mind you. I’m not one to complain. A man toughens up. But it’s all connected, isn’t it? All this… unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: Heartburn, a feeling of fullness, and some bloating… yes, it certainly sounds like these symptoms are related. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as GERD or ulcers?
PATIENT: GERD? Ulcers? Honestly, I haven't got the foggiest. I rarely go to doctors. Waste of time, mostly. My father was a strong man, never saw a doctor in his life. I’ve had the usual – the flu a few times, a broken arm when I was a boy… But nothing serious. I take good care of myself. Good food, plenty of exercise… I’m a very active man, as I’ve said. I don’t believe in dwelling on ailments. It's a sign of weakness. I think my wife had something once, but I don’t pay much attention to those things. It’s… womanly things.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, to clarify, no prior diagnoses of any gastrointestinal conditions?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Never. Look, I'm a busy man. I don’t have time for this. Can we just get to the solution? What do I need to do to fix this? I have important meetings this afternoon. Honestly, this whole process is rather inefficient. I expect more from a proper clinic.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your time, Mr. Altine, and I understand your urgency. To determine the best course of action, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you're willing. It will involve listening to your abdomen and palpating it to check for any tenderness. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But make it quick. I really don’t have all day, you know. And please, be gentle. I have important things to do. Don't go poking around unnecessarily. I’m not made of iron.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It helps me assess the sounds within your digestive system. Alright, I'm listening now… Your bowel sounds are a little bit quieter than I’d expect. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if you feel any pain. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oof. Yes, there. A little bit. Not excruciating, mind you, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. See? I told you I was busy. This is delaying important things. Honestly, what does it mean? Is it serious? I don't have time for surgery or anything… I have meetings! Important meetings! And a golf game scheduled for tomorrow. A man needs his recreation.
DOCTOR: Mild tenderness in the epigastric region… Thank you for letting me know. It doesn't sound like anything immediately requiring surgery, Mr. Altine, but it’s good to investigate further. Based on your symptoms – the regurgitation, heartburn, fullness, and tenderness – it could be several things. Most likely, it's related to acid reflux, possibly complicated by some inflammation of the esophagus or stomach. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few simple tests. I'd like to order a blood test to check for anemia and inflammation, and an endoscopy to visualize your esophagus and stomach directly. This will allow us to determine the exact cause of your symptoms and create an appropriate treatment plan. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood test… fine. Whatever. But an endoscopy? You want to put a camera down my throat? Absolutely not! That sounds… barbaric! I’ve heard stories. A man has a reputation to maintain, you know. I cannot go around looking like I’ve been… invaded. Are you sure it’s necessary? Can’t we just try some stronger medication? I'm a busy man! I do not have time for invasive procedures. Honestly, this is becoming quite unacceptable. I expect better from a proper medical establishment. Perhaps I should seek a second opinion…
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Altine, and I wouldn't recommend an endoscopy if it weren't potentially very helpful. It's the most accurate way to diagnose the cause of your symptoms and rule out more serious conditions, like ulcers or even, rarely, cancer. The procedure itself is quite safe and relatively painless. You'd be sedated, so you wouldn't feel anything. While medication can provide temporary relief, it won't address the underlying cause of your symptoms. If we don’t know what’s causing the problem, we can’t effectively treat it. Perhaps we could start with the blood test and a trial of a more potent acid-reducing medication, a proton pump inhibitor. If your symptoms don’t improve significantly within a couple of weeks, then we could revisit the possibility of the endoscopy. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A blood test and stronger pills… fine. But two weeks, alright? Two weeks, and if I’m not better, we drop the whole camera business. Completely. I have important meetings! And a golf game! I’m not putting my life on hold for… stomach issues. Honestly, this is most inconvenient. And if those pills give me any side effects, I’m holding you personally responsible. A man needs his energy, you understand? Can we get this over with now? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. We’ll start with the blood test and a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor – specifically, omeprazole. I'll give you detailed instructions on how to take it, and a list of potential side effects to watch out for. If your symptoms don't improve after two weeks, we’ll discuss other options, respecting your decision regarding the endoscopy. I’ll have the lab technician draw your blood now. Then, my nurse will give you the prescription and schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it done. Quickly. I have things to do. And make sure that nurse explains everything clearly. I don’t have time for confusion. Honestly, this whole experience has been rather… disruptive. A man needs his peace of mind, you understand? And his golf game. Now, let's just get this blood test over with. The sooner I'm out of here, the better. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I will inform the nurse to provide a thorough explanation. The lab technician will be with you shortly. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort during the blood draw. Thank you for your patience. .
