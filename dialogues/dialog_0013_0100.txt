DOCTOR: Hi Lytisha, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, and I’m one of the family medicine doctors here. So, to get started, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Chriselda, right? Well, um… honestly, it’s about a test. Something the… the folks at work said I needed. A drug test, I think? It’s all a bit of a blur, to be truthful. I’m Lytisha, by the way. Hughston.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lytisha, nice to meet you too. And you’re right, I’m Chriselda. So, work requested a drug test. Okay. Do you know why they requested it?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Something about… safety regulations, I think? I operate one of the big paving machines, you see. A lot of responsibility, and a lot of heat. They just said it was routine, or… something like that. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Is it… is something wrong?
DOCTOR: No, no, nothing is wrong at all, Lytisha. It's perfectly normal to feel a bit confused when things are sprung on you. And it’s very common for memory to have its ups and downs. Just to be clear, were you told what they were testing for specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… they mentioned something about making sure I wasn’t… impaired, or anything? But honestly, I don’t recall the specifics. It’s all a bit of a haze. I don’t really… use anything, if that makes sense. Just a little chamomile tea to help me sleep, sometimes. But I wouldn’t call that… a drug, would I?
DOCTOR: No, chamomile tea definitely doesn’t count as a drug in this context, Lytisha. It sounds like they just want to ensure everyone's safety on the job. Okay, so work requested a drug screen to make sure you’re fit for duty. To help me understand the situation better, have you had a drug screen before?
PATIENT: I don’t think so… not that I recall. I've been with the company for… oh, goodness, nearly fifteen years now. And I don’t remember anything about a test like this before. Everything's a bit of a blur these days. It’s probably just me being forgetful, though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: You're not being sorry, Lytisha. It's perfectly okay to have gaps in your memory, and we’ll figure this out. To get a better picture, and to make sure we're covering all bases, are you currently taking any medications, aside from the chamomile tea?
PATIENT: No, dear, not really. Just the tea, like I said. And… oh, sometimes I take a little something for my knees. They ache, you see, from being on my feet all day. But it's just… an over-the-counter pain reliever. Ibuprofen, I think? Nothing prescribed, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for knee pain. That’s good to know. Now, just to cover everything, have you had any major medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… Let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, a long time ago. And… I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. But other than that… not really, I don’t think. I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back, but the doctor said it was just… anxiety. Nothing serious. Is this important? I’m just trying to remember everything… it’s hard, you know?
DOCTOR: It is important, Lytisha, and you're doing great. It’s perfectly alright to take your time. Knowing your medical history helps me understand what's going on and make sure we’re addressing everything. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a tough one. My mother… she had diabetes, I think. And my father… he had problems with his heart, I remember that. But other than that, I don’t really know much. We weren’t very close, and we never talked about health stuff much. It’s all a bit hazy, to be honest. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. My memory just isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lytisha. It’s common to not have a complete family history. Okay, one last few quick questions before we move on. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Not at all. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped years ago. And… recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Never been interested. Like I said, I just have that chamomile tea to help me sleep. I'm a pretty simple woman, really. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Lytisha, that’s exactly what I needed to know. Thank you. So, to recap: you're here today because your work requested a drug screen. You don't recall the specific reason, but they mentioned safety regulations. You haven't smoked, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs. You occasionally take ibuprofen for knee pain and had an appendectomy and broken wrist in the past. You also have a history of anxiety and a family history of diabetes and heart problems. You occasionally drink chamomile tea. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. That… that sounds about right, as far as I can remember. You’ve got a good memory! I wish I could recall everything as clearly as you do. It’s a bit… unnerving, to be honest, not knowing why they need this test. But I suppose if they say it's for safety, that's good enough. So, what happens next?
DOCTOR: It's alright to feel unnerved, Lytisha. And you're right, safety first. Now, let’s talk about the test itself. It's a pretty standard urine test, and it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. We'll need a sample, and I’ll give you instructions on how to collect it. Before we do that, though, I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees since you mentioned pain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. That sounds… thorough. I suppose it’s good to be careful. Yes, that’s fine. My knees do ache sometimes. And my heart… well, like I said, the doctor thought it was just anxiety, but it does flutter sometimes. Just… please be gentle, dear. I’m not used to all this fuss.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lytisha. I will be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. We can keep an eye on it. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Now, about your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oof. There we go. That’s… not very comfortable. They crack a lot, you see. And they feel stiff, especially in the mornings. It’s just getting old, I suppose. I used to be very active, but it’s harder now. Is something wrong, dear?
DOCTOR: Yes, there’s definitely some crepitus and tenderness. It seems like you have some mild osteoarthritis in both knees. It’s quite common, especially with activity. It doesn’t seem severe, but it explains the pain and stiffness. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Now, let’s get that urine sample. There’s a bathroom just down the hall. I’ll give you these instructions and a cup. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample, and bring it back to me when you’re ready. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Mid-stream… right. And… this is just for the drug test? Nothing else? It all seems a bit… complicated, dear. But alright. I suppose I can manage. No, I think I’m alright for questions. Just… mid-stream, right? And bring it back to you. Thank you, dear. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lytisha, just for the drug test. And yes, mid-stream is correct. You've got this! Take your time, and let me know if you have any trouble. I'll be right here.
