DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been giving me trouble. Specifically, when I lie flat. It feels… difficult. I don't know how else to explain it. It’s been happening for about a week now, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, difficulty breathing when lying flat, and it’s been going on for about a week. That’s helpful to know. Can you tell me a little more about that difficulty?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a sharp pain, Doctor. More like… a squeezing. In my chest. And I have to… I have to use more effort to breathe. It’s not constant, just when I’m lying down. I usually sleep propped up with pillows now, which helps, but it’s not very comfortable. I haven’t noticed it getting worse, thankfully.
DOCTOR: A squeezing sensation in your chest when lying flat, requiring extra effort to breathe, and improved with propping up pillows. That gives me a bit more information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the breathing trouble?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No cough. No fever. My ankles have been a little swollen lately, but I thought that was just from the heat. And… oh! Sometimes my heart feels like it's fluttering. Not all the time, just occasionally. It doesn’t last long, maybe a few seconds. I don’t know if that’s related. I haven't told anyone about that fluttering before, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no cough or fever, some ankle swelling, and occasional heart fluttering that lasts just a few seconds. Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Ms. Vanderwiele. That fluttering is good to know – even if it's brief, we should take note of it. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have a list of any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Just a moment. Here. It’s a bit messy, I apologize. High blood pressure, that’s the main one. And… arthritis in my knees, but it’s not too bad these days. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that hasn’t bothered me in a long time. I believe that’s it. And I have Medicare, of course.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Vanderwiele. High blood pressure, arthritis, and gallbladder removal. Good. And you’re covered by Medicare. Now, are you currently taking any medications for these conditions, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Yes. For the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. And I take Ibuprofen sometimes for my knees when they act up, but not every day. Just when I need it. That’s it, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril ten milligrams daily for blood pressure, and Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I haven’t had any problems myself. I eat pretty much everything. Is this taking long, Doctor? I have an appointment to get my hair done this afternoon.
DOCTOR: No, you’re doing great, Ms. Vanderwiele. We're almost through with the history part. I just want to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any heart problems, lung problems, or blood pressure issues?
PATIENT: Yes… my father had high blood pressure, like me. He was on medication for it for years. And my mother… she had a stroke, years and years ago. That’s what took her, actually. As for lung problems, not that I know of. My brother smokes, but he’s the only one in the family who does. He’s always been stubborn about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure and stroke. Thank you. Finally, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I've never smoked. Never had the urge. My husband used to smoke, but he quit years before he… well, never mind that now. I do enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning, and I try to walk when the weather is nice. But the heat has been terrible lately, so I haven't been getting out much. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly. I like my frybread, though. It’s a Zuni tradition, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking history, enjoy coffee and walking when able, and a preference for frybread – I understand traditions are important. Thank you, Ms. Vanderwiele. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and ankles, and just take a general look. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Get it over with, please. I really do need to be going soon. Just… try to be quick, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 158 over 92. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a faint murmur. Nothing alarming, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let me listen to your lungs. Your lungs sound a little congested, with some decreased breath sounds and mild wheezing. Finally, let me check your ankles for swelling. I do notice some swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned, and it’s about a two-plus level of pitting edema.
PATIENT: What does that mean, Doctor? All those… terms. Is something seriously wrong? I just want to know, plain and simple. Is my breathing going to get worse?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Vanderwiele, I understand your concern. Let me explain everything in plain language. The elevated blood pressure means your heart is working harder than it should. The faint murmur is a slight unusual sound, but it’s not necessarily serious right now. The congestion and wheezing in your lungs suggest some fluid buildup, which can make it harder to breathe. And the swelling in your ankles is also a sign of fluid buildup. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve found in the exam, it sounds like you may be developing some heart failure. It’s not necessarily a sudden, catastrophic thing, but it means your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should, and that fluid is backing up into your lungs and ankles. The difficulty breathing when lying flat, the occasional fluttering heart, and the swelling – those are all consistent with that. Now, it’s important to remember that we need to do some further testing to confirm this. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better look at your heart and lungs. I also want to check your blood levels to see how well your kidneys and heart are functioning. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds… terrible. So, what does that mean for me? Will I have to go to the hospital? Will I be able to… to continue my life? I just had my hair appointment scheduled, you know! And what about those tests? What will they do? I don’t like hospitals. Or needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Ms. Vanderwiele. It’s frightening to hear the term "heart failure," but it doesn’t always mean a sudden, drastic change in your life. It simply means your heart needs some support to work more efficiently. It's a condition that can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes, and many people live full and active lives with it. We’re not talking about an emergency right now. The tests will help us determine how severe the condition is and what the best course of treatment will be. The chest X-ray is a simple image of your lungs, like a photograph, to see if there's fluid buildup. The EKG is a painless recording of your heart’s electrical activity, which will show us if there are any irregular rhythms or signs of strain. As for the blood tests, they involve a small needle prick, and will give us information about your kidney function and levels of certain chemicals that can indicate how well your heart is working. The tests will take about an hour and can be done here at the clinic. We'll review the results together and discuss the best plan for you. We can start with medication to reduce fluid buildup and ease the strain on your heart. Do you want me to go over any of this again, or are you ready to proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: Alright. I… I suppose I should have the tests. But please, make it quick. And no surprises, Doctor. I don’t handle surprises well. And I need to know if I’ll be able to go to my hair appointment. It’s very important. Next Tuesday at two o’clock. Can I still go?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. No surprises, I promise. I will explain everything clearly before we proceed with any treatment. And we will do everything we can to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. Let me get the order for the chest X-ray, EKG, and blood tests. The tests will take about an hour, and we should have the results by tomorrow morning. As for your hair appointment next Tuesday, I don't foresee this interfering with that at all. It's likely you'll be able to continue with your normal activities. We will assess your condition tomorrow morning and if everything looks stable, you should be able to go to your appointment as planned. We can even write a note for your stylist if that would make you feel more comfortable. Let me call the lab and have them prepare for your arrival. In the meantime, please try to relax. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate that. Just get it over with, please. And… please be gentle with the needle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. I understand your apprehension. I’ll let the phlebotomist know to be extra gentle. They are very experienced and skilled. I’ll walk you over to the lab now. It's just down the hall. They will call me once they're finished, and I’ll come get you. Let’s go. And remember, we're taking things one step at a time. .
