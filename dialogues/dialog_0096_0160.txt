DOCTOR: Alright, Candis, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Candis Hardenburgh. And frankly, I don’t have all day, Doctor. What do you need to know? I just… I'm tired. Really tired. And it's gotten worse lately.
DOCTOR: Well, “tired” is a very broad symptom, dear. Lots of things can make a person tired. We need to be a bit more specific if I’m going to be of any help, and wasting time isn’t productive for either of us. Now, when you say “lately,” how long are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh, don't you start with me about wasting time. It’s been… hmm… probably the last three months, maybe a little longer. It's not just normal tired, you understand? It's… heavy. And I've started… well, it's embarrassing, but I've been eating dirt. Not a lot, but… clay, mostly. From the garden. Don't look at me like that! It helps, okay? It just… settles things.
DOCTOR: “Settles things,” right. Well, eating dirt is… unusual, to say the least. And frankly, concerning. We'll get to that later. Three months, you say. Is this tiredness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's pretty constant, yes. Worse in the afternoons, definitely. Mornings I can usually get something done, but by 2 or 3 o'clock… forget it. I just have to lie down. And it’s not like I haven’t been trying to keep busy! I have to, you know? Bills don't pay themselves. It's just… harder and harder. And this… craving... it’s new. Never did that before.
DOCTOR: Right. And besides the tiredness and this… peculiar habit, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Honestly, Doctor, what does that even mean? I’m tired and I eat a little dirt. What more do you want from me? Hmm… well, my stomach has been a bit upset sometimes. Not bad, just… unsettled. And I’ve been a little bit… I don’t know… weak, I suppose. But I work, don’t I? Physical therapy aide. It’s not easy work, you know. Though these young people I work with… they don’t seem to do much heavy lifting, frankly.
DOCTOR: Physical therapy aide. And you’ve been experiencing stomach upset and weakness along with the tiredness and… the clay ingestion. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I can. I don’t fuss much over food, honestly. It's fuel. Though sometimes... I just don't feel like eating. It’s not that I'm nauseous, it's just… unappealing, I guess. Everything. Even things I used to like. Though I have been craving… lemons, strangely enough. And… and the clay, of course. Don't act surprised! It's a craving. People have cravings.
DOCTOR: Lemons and clay. Fascinating. Alright. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake! Are you always going to ask me about… things like that? It’s a bit personal, don’t you think? Look, everything is just… slower, if you must know. And darker. Is that good enough for you? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I came here because I’m tired, not to be interrogated about my… everything.
DOCTOR: Well, someone has to ask the questions, dear. It’s called a medical history. And changes in bowel habits are relevant, especially given the… other symptoms. Now, before we continue with this line of questioning, let’s just get one thing straight. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No! Never. I've always been healthy as a horse, practically. Until these last few months, that is. I don't go to doctors. Waste of time and money, frankly. I eat well enough, I keep busy... I just… I feel weak, and I'm tired. And I have this… unfortunate habit. That’s it. No conditions. No diagnoses. I'm a perfectly healthy seventy-nine-year-old woman who’s suddenly feeling like she's a hundred. Is that satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, Doctor, you’re going to be here all day. My mother lived to be eighty-five, perfectly healthy, until she fell and broke her hip. My father… he worked himself to death, practically. Always building things, always fixing things. Didn’t take a moment for himself. Strong as an ox, but no common sense. No one in my family had any fancy diseases or anything. Just… hard workers. Mostly. Is that what you need to know? Because if it is, I’m telling you, there isn’t much of one.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No! None. I've never had an allergic reaction in my life. Honestly, Doctor, you’re asking me about things that have never happened. It’s… insulting, frankly. I’m perfectly healthy, or I was perfectly healthy, before this… tiredness and… clay. Now, are you going to do something about this, or are you just going to keep asking me questions? I have things to do, you know. Bills to pay, work to get to... .
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a look at you. Just a quick physical exam, alright?
