DOCTOR: Hi Keoni, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve just been… going to the bathroom rather frequently lately. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s… disruptive, to say the least. I don’t really recall when it started, exactly. It just… gradually became more noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination can definitely be disruptive. And you said it gradually became more noticeable – that's helpful to know. When you say "frequently," could you give me a rough idea of how often you're going to the bathroom during the day?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. Let me see… I suppose… every couple of hours, at least. Perhaps more often if I’m drinking fluids. It’s hard to say precisely. I don’t keep track, you see. I just know it’s… a lot. More than it used to be, certainly. Is that… helpful? I apologize for not being more specific.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Keoni, thank you. And don’t apologize at all, it’s common to not keep exact counts. Every couple of hours, and more with fluids – that gives me a starting point. Now, when you do need to go, do you feel like you're completely emptying your bladder, or do you feel like you still have to go a little bit afterwards?
PATIENT: Um… that's… a personal question, isn't it? But, yes. I believe… mostly. Sometimes I feel like I could go a little more, but it’s not a strong sensation. It’s difficult to describe. It’s just… not always a complete emptying, I suppose. And sometimes… well, sometimes it feels like I have to go urgently, even if I’ve just been. Is that… making sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Keoni, and you’re not alone in experiencing that. It's good you’re able to describe it to me, even if it feels a little uncomfortable. The urgency and not feeling fully emptied are both things we need to explore. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not exactly pain. But… a discomfort, sometimes. A slight stinging sensation, perhaps. It doesn’t happen every time, and it’s not severe. It’s… fleeting, really. More of an irritation than anything else. And no, I haven’t noticed any fever or chills, if that’s what you were going to ask. Is that… significant?
DOCTOR: Okay, a slight stinging sensation sometimes, not every time, and no fever. That's helpful. It could be a sign of irritation, and it’s good we’re noting it. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh dear… well, I suppose… now that you mention it, sometimes it smells a little… stronger than usual. It’s not a constant thing, but I have noticed it on occasion. As for the color… I haven’t paid much attention, truthfully. It seems normal, but I haven’t been actively looking, if that makes sense. I apologize for being so… vague. I really don't keep track of these things. Is that useful information?
DOCTOR: It is useful, Keoni, please don't apologize! It's perfectly normal not to keep track of these things, and you’re doing great just telling me what you experience. A stronger smell can be a clue. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you experienced any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Lower abdomen… sometimes, yes. Not a sharp pain, but more of a dull ache. It comes and goes. And no, I haven't noticed any pain in my back. It's mostly just the discomfort in my lower abdomen, and it doesn't happen all the time. It's usually… after I've been to the bathroom, actually. Does that… change anything?
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in the lower abdomen, after going to the bathroom. That’s definitely good information. Now, thinking about your general health, have you had any recent illnesses like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not recently. I had a mild cold, perhaps… a couple of months ago? But it was very minor, and it didn’t last long. Nothing serious at all. And no, I haven’t been hospitalized or had any surgeries recently. I generally… try to stay healthy. I keep active, and I eat well. But… this bathroom issue is quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent illnesses or surgeries. That's good to know. Now, just to be thorough, I’m going to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I don't believe so. I had… a bout of bronchitis when I was younger, but that was many years ago. And I had my tonsils removed as a child, but that's all I can really recall. My doctor… years ago, before my divorce… he said I had slightly high cholesterol, but I haven't had it checked in a long time. Honestly, I haven't been to a doctor regularly in… well, a very long time. It's embarrassing to admit, I know. But this… this feels different, and I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Keoni. Life gets busy, and it’s understandable to fall out of regular check-ups. The fact that you’re here now is what matters. Okay, so slightly high cholesterol in the past, but nothing currently diagnosed. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I generally avoid taking medications unless absolutely necessary. I prefer to… deal with things naturally, if possible. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements either. I don’t like the idea of putting unnecessary things into my body. Is that… unusual? I apologize if I’m rambling. I just… want to be as thorough as possible.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not unusual at all. It's good to be mindful of what you put into your body. Okay, so no current medications or supplements. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had any medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or bladder cancer?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandmother, on my father’s side… she had some sort of… stomach problem, but I don’t recall the specifics. I don’t really know much about my father’s side of the family, truthfully. He wasn’t very forthcoming with information. And no, I don’t recall anyone having kidney problems or bladder cancer. Does that… help? I apologize for being so vague. It's frustrating not to have more information.
DOCTOR: It does help, Keoni, thank you. It's perfectly alright that you don't have all the details. Now, just a few lifestyle questions. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked. It's… a terrible habit. My mother smoked for a while, and it caused her a great deal of trouble. I’ve always avoided it. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, thank you. And how much alcohol do you drink, if any?
PATIENT: Um… very little. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. A few times a month, maybe. I don’t really enjoy it enough to drink it regularly. It’s mostly just… social. I’m not a big drinker, certainly. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your work or daily activities?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m a concierge. I work at a large hotel downtown. It’s a rather demanding job, actually. I’m on my feet for most of the day, assisting guests with various requests. It involves a lot of walking, lifting, and… well, just being available. It keeps me active, but it can be quite tiring. Does that… give you a better understanding? I do try to stay hydrated throughout the day, which I suppose might be contributing to this… issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Keoni. Thank you for answering all those questions. So, to summarise: you’re a 31-year-old female, experiencing frequent urination for an unknown duration, not feeling completely emptied, with occasional stinging, stronger urine smell, and a dull ache after going to the bathroom. You have a history of slightly high cholesterol, no current medications, a family history of high blood pressure, and a demanding job that keeps you active. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your abdomen, and I'd also like to do a urine sample to rule out any infection. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I understand that's necessary. A physical exam and a urine sample… yes, that’s perfectly alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I just… hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could just lie down on your back, that would be perfect. Alright, I'm just going to press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay, no significant tenderness there, which is good. Now, I just need a urine sample. I’ll leave you with a cup and instructions. It’s important to collect a midstream sample, so please clean the area thoroughly before you start. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. A midstream sample… I remember something about that from a previous doctor's visit, years ago. I’ll do my best to collect it properly. I apologize if I’m a little awkward; it’s been a long time since I’ve done this. Just let me know if I’m doing anything wrong.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Keoni. Take your time. I’ll just step outside and give you a little privacy. Okay, the urine sample is clear, with no obvious signs of infection. However, there is a slightly elevated level of protein. It’s not dramatically high, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Now, based on your symptoms, the physical exam, and the urine sample results, there are a few possibilities. It could be a urinary tract infection, even with the clear sample, as some infections don’t always show up immediately. It could also be a sign of kidney issues, although that’s less likely given the clear sample. The elevated protein could also be related to stress or dehydration, given your demanding job. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a more comprehensive blood test to check your kidney function and a repeat urine analysis in a week. I’d also like to rule out a possible bladder issue, so I suggest a pelvic ultrasound. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A blood test, another urine analysis… and an ultrasound? It sounds… rather involved. Is it… serious? I mean, is it likely to be something very wrong? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I’m getting rather worried. An ultrasound… is that… painful? I've never had one before. I trust your judgment, Doctor, but I'm just… trying to understand what we're looking for.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask questions, Keoni, and I understand your anxiety. It's better to be informed. The tests aren't necessarily indicative of something very wrong. We're just being thorough to rule out potential causes. The blood test will give us a baseline of your kidney function, and the repeat urine analysis will confirm whether an infection is present. The ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging test that allows us to visualize your bladder and kidneys. It doesn't involve any radiation, and it's generally not painful. You'll lie on a table, and a technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and move a wand over it. You might feel some slight pressure, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Given your age and symptoms, it’s important to investigate, but it’s also likely to be something relatively minor, like a urinary tract infection or dehydration. Do you have any insurance coverage?
PATIENT: No, unfortunately not. I lost my insurance when I divorced. I’ve been meaning to look into it, but… things have been rather hectic. How much… approximately… would these tests cost? I’m concerned about the financial burden, truthfully. I’m… not in a good position to afford a large medical bill. I appreciate your understanding, Doctor. Perhaps we could discuss… alternative options if the costs are too high?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Not having insurance can certainly make things complicated. Let me check with the billing department to get a rough estimate of the costs for you. Okay, so the blood test will be approximately $150, the repeat urine analysis around $50, and the ultrasound is the most expensive at around $300. That's a total of $500. I know that's a significant amount. We can explore a few options. Some labs offer a cash discount, and we can see if they're willing to lower the price. There are also some community resources that may be able to help with medical expenses. I can provide you with some information on those programs. We can also prioritize the tests. The most important test to start with is the repeat urine analysis, as it will quickly tell us if you have an infection. We can delay the blood test and ultrasound if necessary. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: $500… that’s… a considerable sum. Perhaps… the repeat urine analysis is the best place to start, as you suggested. If it reveals an infection, that might explain everything. I’m reluctant to delay the blood test altogether, though. It’s… reassuring to know how my kidneys are functioning. Could we perhaps… do the blood test and the urine analysis first, and then discuss the ultrasound if the results are concerning? I’m hesitant to commit to the ultrasound without knowing more. I appreciate your understanding and willingness to work with me, Doctor. This is… a great deal to process.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable plan, Keoni. We can definitely do the blood test and the repeat urine analysis first, and then we can discuss the ultrasound based on those results. I’ll write you a lab order for both tests. The lab is located just a few blocks from here, and you can go whenever it’s convenient for you. They accept cash, and we can see if they offer any discounts. I'll also give you a prescription for a short course of antibiotics, just in case the urine analysis does reveal an infection. You can hold onto it until we have the results. If it is an infection, you can start taking them right away. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. A prescription… just in case. That’s… reassuring. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I’m… grateful for your help. I’ll go to the lab as soon as I can. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Anything I should do or avoid before the tests?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Keoni. I'm glad we have a plan. For the blood test, it’s best to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks except for water. For the urine analysis, try to drink plenty of water to ensure a good sample. Avoid caffeine and alcohol for 24 hours before the test. Otherwise, just try to relax and don't worry too much. We're just being thorough, and hopefully, it's something minor. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. Does Tuesday at 2 pm work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2 pm… yes, that works perfectly. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I think… that’s all I need for now. I’ll see you next Tuesday. Thank you again, Doctor Maskal.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ll see you then, Keoni. Here are the lab orders and the prescription. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
