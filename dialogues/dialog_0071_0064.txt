DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. I'm Dr. Galena. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It feels… tight, sometimes. Like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. Tightness in the chest… and it comes and goes, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, comes and goes. It's not a sharp pain, never sharp. More like… a heavy feeling. Like I’m carrying something on my chest. It usually happens when I’m walking, maybe up a little hill. Or after I eat a big lunch. But not every time. Sometimes I eat a big lunch and nothing happens. It's funny, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, interesting. So it’s related to activity and sometimes meals… and not consistent. How long has this been going on for, Sherion?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, about… three months now, maybe a little longer? It started small, I didn’t pay much attention at first. Just thought I was getting old, you know? But it’s been happening more often lately, so I thought I better get it checked. My husband, Ricardo, he told me to come right away. He worries a lot.
DOCTOR: That’s good of Ricardo to encourage you to come in. Three months… okay. And would you say it radiates anywhere – does the feeling spread to your arm, jaw, or back at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes. Not always. When it's really bad, I feel it in my left arm. Not like a pain, exactly. More like… a dull ache. And sometimes, a little bit in my jaw. But not every time. It's hard to explain. It just… feels uncomfortable. Like something is not right. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Discomfort radiating to the left arm and jaw… that's helpful information. And when this discomfort happens, how would you rate it on a scale of one to ten, with one being very mild and ten being the worst pain you can imagine?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. It never gets to ten, Doctor, never! Maybe… a four or five, on a bad day? Usually it’s more like a two or three. Enough to make me stop and catch my breath, but not… terrible. Like I said, it's uncomfortable, more than anything. It just scares me a little, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a four or five at its worst, usually two or three. No sharp pain, discomfort radiating to the arm and jaw. And it's concerning you, which is perfectly reasonable. Now, aside from this chest discomfort, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. Well, I've been a little more tired lately, I think. But I'm 62, Doctor, so maybe that’s just getting old too! I don’t sleep as well as I used to, sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night. And… oh! My feet swell up a little at the end of the day, but that happens sometimes, especially when it’s hot. Does that count? I don’t know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased tiredness, some trouble sleeping, and swelling in the feet… those are good things to mention. We’ll keep those in mind. Now, do you have any history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me see… Ricardo has high blood pressure, but I don't, not that I know of. The doctor checks it every year, and it’s always good. Cholesterol… I think I had it checked a long time ago, and it was okay too. And no, I don't have diabetes. I drink a lot of water, and I try to eat healthy. Not too much sugar, you know? I like my arepas, but I try not to eat too many!
DOCTOR: Arepas are good! It's good you're mindful of your health. Alright, and just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, just one. I take a little pill for my arthritis in my hands. It's called… let me see… meloxicam, I think? And no allergies, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Ricardo is always worried I'll forget to tell you something, but I think I remembered everything!
DOCTOR: Okay, meloxicam for arthritis, no known allergies. Good. Now, Sherion, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and pulse. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. My heart feels okay, but I trust your judgment. You are the doctor!
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back for me… Let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85… Okay. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are a little diminished at the bases of both lungs, but no wheezing or crackles. Heart sounds… regular rhythm, but a slight murmur. Not a new murmur, I recall from previous records. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to feel around your chest and back, just to check for any tenderness. No tenderness noted. And one last thing - can you take a deep breath and hold it for me?
PATIENT: Okay, I'm holding it... Is that okay? It’s a little hard for me to hold my breath for very long. I get a little dizzy sometimes. Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem very serious. What do you think it is?
DOCTOR: Okay, you can breathe normally now. And don’t worry, I'm not too concerned, but I want to rule a few things out. Your lungs sound a little congested, which can happen with age, but we need to investigate further. Considering your symptoms and the murmur I heard, I think we should get an EKG done to check your heart rhythm and a chest x-ray to look at your lungs. Also, I want to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a cardiac enzyme test. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That sounds… like a lot. EKG, chest x-ray, blood work… Is it something serious, Doctor? Is my heart bad? I’ve never had any of these tests before.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Sherion. It sounds like a lot, I agree, but these tests are just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on and to rule out anything serious. Many things can cause chest discomfort. It doesn't necessarily mean your heart is bad. The EKG will look at the electrical activity of your heart, the x-ray will show us what your lungs look like, and the blood work will help us check for any inflammation or other issues. It's better to be safe and thorough. We'll take it one step at a time. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, I… I think I understand. One step at a time. You’re right. It’s just… my Ricardo, he worries so much. He always says something bad is going to happen. And I don't want to worry him even more. But… if you think it’s best, then I trust you, Doctor. When do we do these tests? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: You're a very thoughtful person, Sherion. And Ricardo is lucky to have you looking out for him. The EKG is completely painless – we just attach some sticky pads to your chest. The x-ray doesn’t hurt either, it’s just a quick picture. As for when… we can do the EKG right here in the office, and the lab can take the blood now as well. For the chest x-ray, we'll need to send you to the imaging center across the street. They're open until 5 pm today. I'll have my nurse, Maria, set everything up for you. She’ll explain everything in more detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Okay. The nurse, Maria, will help me. And the imaging center is close by? Good. I don't like going far. I think I can do this, one step at a time, like you said. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve calmed me down a lot. Now… what about Ricardo? Should I tell him everything? Or just… that I'm getting some tests done? He gets so anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're thinking about Ricardo. You know him best. You could tell him you’re getting some tests done to rule out a few things, and that you’re doing it as a precaution. There's no need to alarm him unnecessarily. Focus on letting him know you're taking care of it and following the doctor's advice. That might ease his mind. I’ll make a note for Maria to provide you with a simple explanation to share with him, if you’d like. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s a good idea. A simple explanation for Ricardo… thank you, Doctor. And I will remember about the emergency room. I just… I don't want to scare him. He worries so much. Okay. I think… I think that’s everything. I guess Maria will tell me what to do next? Thank you again, Doctor Galena. You’ve been very kind. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. And you're a wonderful wife, thinking of Ricardo. Yes, Maria will take excellent care of you. She'll explain everything and get the tests scheduled. Please don't hesitate to ask her any questions. I'll review the results as soon as they're available and we’ll discuss them at your follow-up appointment. Get those tests done and try not to worry too much. .
