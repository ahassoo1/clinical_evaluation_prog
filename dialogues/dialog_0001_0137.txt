DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Thank you. My son... he want me to go to a… a place for old people. A nice place, he say. But the place, they need… check from you, yes? To make sure I am okay for live there.
DOCTOR: Right. A pre-admission physical, as it were. Your son's being thorough. Well, let's get this over with. Just so I’m clear, you're not feeling unwell, he just wants a check-up before you move into this facility?
PATIENT: No, no, I don’t feel sick. Old, yes. But not sick. My son, he worry too much. But is good, I think. Is good he care. So, you want to check me? What you need to check?
DOCTOR: Standard things, Ms. Abdollahi. Blood pressure, heart, lungs… a little bit of everything. We'll talk about your medications, any allergies you have… and just generally how you've been feeling lately. You said you're not feeling sick, but sometimes things are brewing under the surface. Let's start with medications. What are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think… I take… the little white pill for my water, yes? The doctor give me… many years ago. And sometimes, when my knee hurt very bad, I take the orange one. Is for the pain. Is that all? I forget easily.
DOCTOR: "The little white pill for my water…" Right. And the orange one… when your knee hurts?
PATIENT: Yes, when my knee is… ouch. Very bad sometimes. My son, he help me with the pills. He put them in the box every week. I not so good remember the names. Is for the water, and is for the pain. And maybe… sometimes… a little blue one for sleep? But not every night. When I very worry.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, we have… something for blood pressure, something for pain, and possibly something for sleep. This is... less than ideal. Do you know who prescribed these medications?
PATIENT: Prescribed? What that mean? The doctor... I see many doctors over the years. In Honduras, and here. The one before, and the one before that. I think… maybe Dr. Ramirez gave me the white one? But I not sure. They all look the same after a while, yes?
DOCTOR: Right, right. Well, that's… helpful. Okay. Let's try something else. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I eat everything when I was young. Mango, fish, everything! My mother, she make good food. I get a little… itchy sometimes. But is the sun, maybe? Or the soap. Not… a bad thing, just… itchy. I don’t think is allergy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past… medical? I have been sick, yes. When I was little, I have… the fever. Very bad fever. And I have the babies, three times. Is hard work, that. I think that is all. Nothing… serious, after that. Just old age, now. But not sick old age. Just… tired old age.
DOCTOR: Right. No major illnesses… You’ve had children, three of them. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam then. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knee. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can stand. But be careful, Doctor. My balance is not so good today. My son say I wobble a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, just hold onto the chair if you need to. Let's start with your blood pressure. 150/90… not great. Okay, let’s listen to your heart. A little bit of a murmur… fairly common at your age. And lungs… Clear, but some diminished breath sounds. Now, let’s take a look at that knee. Can you bend it for me?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… Is sore. Very sore today. And is… clicky. You hear it? Click. Is bad, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, I hear the crepitus. There’s some swelling and tenderness here, and a limited range of motion. It's likely osteoarthritis, Ms. Abdollahi, which is wear and tear on the joint. It’s common with age. We should get an X-ray to confirm. So, we’ve established some baseline information. Now… Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: X-ray? Is that… hurt? And osteoarthritis… is that… serious? Will I have to… stop walking? My son, he want me to be okay for the nice place. I don’t want to be a problem.
DOCTOR: The X-ray won’t hurt, it’s just a picture of your bone. And osteoarthritis… it’s not immediately serious, but it can cause pain and difficulty moving. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have to stop walking, but we need to manage it. Look, I’m going to order that X-ray. In the meantime, I'll write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever. We’ll discuss the results and other options when we have them. Frankly, I think your son is being overly cautious, but let’s just get this done so you can both have peace of mind. Here’s the prescription. Take this to the pharmacy. Any other questions right now?
PATIENT: The pharmacy… is down the street? And… what about the nice place? Will they… let me in if my knee is bad? I don’t want to be a trouble. My son, he work so hard to find it.
DOCTOR: The pharmacy is two blocks that way. As for the nice place… Look, I’ll put a note on the X-ray report stating your condition. They’ll have to decide if they can accommodate you. Frankly, I’m not qualified to make that judgement. I'm a doctor, not a social worker. I’ve done what you asked. Now, if there's nothing else, I have other patients waiting. Have a good day, Ms. Abdollahi.
PATIENT: Oh… Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I hope… I hope they will let me in. I don't want to be a trouble. .
