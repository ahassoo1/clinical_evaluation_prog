DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you as well. Thank you for having me. Well, to be frank, it is… the gas. Too much gas, you understand? It is… embarrassing, really. I am not sure what to do about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Goodstein. It can be quite bothersome, and you're right to seek it checked out. Many things can cause increased gas. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it happens many times during the day. Not just after meals, though it is worse then. Sometimes it happens… just when I am standing, or walking. It does not hurt, exactly, but it is… loud. And the smell is… not good. I work at the burger place, you see, and I worry it bothers the customers. It started, maybe, three months ago? I do not recall anything special happening then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been happening for about three months, multiple times a day, and is worse after meals but occurs even when you're not eating. You mentioned it’s loud and has an unpleasant odor, and you’re concerned about it affecting your work. That's all very helpful information. Now, could you describe your typical diet?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. My diet… well, I eat fairly simply. I work at the burger place, so… I have a burger for lunch most days. Sometimes fries with that. For breakfast, usually just toast and coffee. Dinner… varies. My neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, she brings me food sometimes, very kind of her. Soups, mostly. And I like potatoes. I drink a lot of water. Not much soda, maybe one small glass a week. I do not eat many fruits or… what are they called… vegetables? Not often, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fairly simple diet, primarily consisting of burgers, toast, potatoes, soups, and water. Limited fruit and vegetable intake. That gives me a better picture. Now, aside from the gas, have you noticed any other changes in your digestion?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. My… stool, it is normal. Not too hard, not too soft. No pain in my stomach, usually. Sometimes… a little bloating, after I eat. But not always. And I go to the bathroom… regularly. Every day, you understand. Nothing has changed there. Just the gas. It is truly… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no changes in bowel habits, no abdominal pain, just occasional bloating and the increased gas. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any foods or medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. Never had a reaction to anything. I do not take any medications, just a little something for my blood pressure, but that is all. The doctor at the clinic, he gives it to me. A small white pill, every morning. I do not recall the name. Never had a problem with allergies, though. Not that I know of, anyway. I like pickles, and I eat them often, and those do not bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let me just confirm that medication for your blood pressure… Ah, yes, Lisinopril. That’s good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of things, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, other than high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Only the blood pressure, that is all. I have never been to the hospital, except when I broke my arm when I was a little boy. That was many years ago, though. And I do not have any… what do you call them… chronic illnesses? Nothing like that. I have been a fairly healthy man, until this gas problem, you understand. I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, but it does not bother me too much. Mostly just stiff in the mornings. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no other significant medical history, just the high blood pressure and some mild arthritis in your hands. And you've never had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never any surgeries. Not even… the appendix, or anything like that. I have been very lucky, I think. My mother, she had her gallbladder removed, but I have not needed anything like that. Just the blood pressure medication, and I take that every day, like the doctor tells me. Nothing else. I worry sometimes about this gas, if it is… something serious? But you seem to know what you are doing, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Goodstein. I appreciate your trust. It’s good to know you haven’t had any surgeries. And I understand your concern. While it can be embarrassing, increased gas is rarely a sign of something serious, but it’s good we're checking it out. To help me narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to ask about your family history. Do you know of anyone in your family who has had digestive problems like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That is a difficult question. My mother… she had a sensitive stomach, I think. She often complained of… indigestion, and she did not eat many spicy foods. My father… he was a very strong man, and he never complained of anything. I do not recall anyone having… Crohn's disease, or celiac disease, or anything like that. My sister, she lives in Budapest, and I have not seen her in many years. I do not know about her health. It is difficult to say, Doctor. I do not think so, but I am not sure. We did not talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Goodstein. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history in detail. Knowing your mother had a sensitive stomach is helpful. Now, just a couple more questions, and then I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I do not smoke. Never have. I do not like the smell of it. And I do not drink alcohol. My father, he liked a little bit of wine with his dinner, but I do not. And I certainly do not use any… recreational drugs. I am a very simple man, you see. I like my coffee in the morning, and my soup at night. And I try to be healthy, despite this gas problem. It is… unsettling, to have so much gas. But I do not partake in any of those things.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Goodstein. Thank you for being so open with me. Okay, well, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen with a stethoscope, and I'll also gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I am a little nervous, to be honest, but I want to find out what is causing this gas. Please, do whatever you need to do. I hope it is nothing serious. I am ready when you are. I will try to be still.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Please lie back on the examination table. It might be a little cool, so let me know if you’d like a blanket. Now, just relax and take some deep breaths. Okay, everything sounds normal so far. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That does not hurt. A little bit of pressure, but no pain. It feels… normal, I think. Just a little bit of… fullness, maybe? But nothing alarming. I am trying to relax, as you asked. It is difficult, to be honest, but I am trying. Just a little nervous, that is all. I hope it is nothing serious, like… an ulcer, or something like that. But I trust your expertise, Doctor. Please, continue.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant tenderness anywhere. I'm not feeling any masses or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft, and there's no guarding. And the tympany—that’s the sound when I tap—sounds normal. It doesn't suggest a significant buildup of gas, although everyone has some. Everything feels normal on physical examination, Mr. Goodstein. That's reassuring. Now, based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, my initial suspicion is that this is likely related to diet and the way your digestive system is processing certain foods.
PATIENT: That is… good to hear, Doctor. So it is not something serious? Just… my diet? I do eat a lot of burgers, you are right. And not many fruits or vegetables. So what do you recommend? Should I stop eating burgers altogether? That would be… very difficult. Perhaps just eat smaller ones? I am willing to try anything, to get rid of this gas. It is truly disruptive, as I mentioned. And embarrassing. What do you think, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's unlikely you need to stop eating burgers altogether, Mr. Goodstein. A complete dietary overhaul isn’t usually necessary, and I understand that would be difficult. However, making some adjustments can likely help. I recommend we start with a few changes. First, let’s try to increase your intake of fruits and vegetables. Even adding a side salad with your burger, or having a piece of fruit with breakfast, can make a difference. Second, consider smaller portions. Eating a large meal can overwhelm your digestive system. And third, pay attention to foods that seem to trigger the gas more. Some common culprits include beans, onions, garlic, and carbonated beverages. We could also try an over-the-counter medication called simethicone. It helps break up gas bubbles and can provide some relief. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I can try to eat more fruits and vegetables. My neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, she brings me soup with vegetables sometimes, so I can ask for more. And smaller portions… yes, I can definitely do that. I suppose I do eat rather large burgers. Simethicone… is that a pill? I do not want to take too many pills, if possible. But I am willing to try it, if you think it will help. And what about pickles? I eat a lot of pickles. Do pickles cause gas? I enjoy them very much. I am a little worried about giving up pickles. Perhaps I can eat fewer of them? Is that a good idea? And thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so clearly. You have put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Simethicone comes in pill form, but it also comes as a liquid. The pills are small, and you only take them as needed when you're experiencing gas. As for pickles, they can cause gas in some people. They're fermented, and that process can produce gas. It’s not a universal trigger, though. You could try reducing your pickle intake and see if that makes a difference. Let's start with the fruits and vegetables, smaller portions, and the possibility of trying simethicone if you need it. We can also discuss a referral to a gastroenterologist if these measures don't provide enough relief. However, I think we can likely manage this with some dietary adjustments. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. Smaller portions, more fruits and vegetables, and maybe less pickles. And simethicone, if needed. You have been very helpful. I feel much better now, knowing what to do. I will try my best to follow your advice. And if it does not improve, then I will consider the gastroenterologist. Thank you again, Doctor Giganti. You are very kind and patient. I appreciate your time and expertise. Is there anything I need to do before I leave? Any paperwork, or… anything like that?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could help. No, there’s no paperwork needed today. I’ll just make a note of our discussion in your chart. And I’ll provide you with a printed summary of our recommendations, including information on simethicone. Just remember to pay attention to how different foods affect you, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. And enjoy your pickles in moderation!
PATIENT: .
