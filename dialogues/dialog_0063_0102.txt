DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, try to be concise. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's just this breathing. I find myself sighing a lot. Deep breaths, you know? Not painful, not really. Just… a lot of it. Happens all day, I think. Hard to say for sure, my memory isn't what it used to be. I just thought I should mention it.
DOCTOR: Sighing. Yes. And when did you first begin noticing this… excessive sighing, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tough one. It feels like… a while now. Maybe a few months? It started slowly, I think. Just a little more than usual. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when, you see? Things… blur together these days. I mostly notice it when I’m resting, or just sitting. Not when I'm... busy, if that makes sense. Though, I don't do much busy work anymore.
DOCTOR: A few months. And has this sighing been… worsening progressively, or has it remained relatively stable?
PATIENT: Hmm... stable, I think? Yes, that sounds right. It hasn't gotten worse, exactly. Just… always there now. Before, it would come and go. Now, it's pretty consistent, you know? Not every single breath, but… often. It doesn’t keep me up at night or anything. It just… is. Does that make sense, Doctor? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this… sighing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I get a little tired, maybe. But I’m eighty years old, Doctor! A little tired feels normal, doesn’t it? My appetite isn’t what it used to be, either. But again, getting older... I don't know if that's related. Nothing major, if that's what you're asking. No chest pain, no cough, no… well, nothing like that. Just…tired and the sighing. My wife… she used to worry about everything. I wish she was here to remember these things.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not really. Not anymore. The doctor took me off everything a few years back. Said it was better for me. Something about… interactions? I can’t quite remember. Just a little pill for my blood pressure before, but that was stopped. So, no, no medications. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I ate all sorts of things when I was a boy in Cambodia... things you wouldn't believe. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. My wife always said I had a cast-iron stomach. So, no, I don’t think so. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Vantine… and again… Alright. Your lungs sound… reasonably clear. Breathing appears normal, despite the sighs. Pulse is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. What is your approximate height and weight, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Oh… height and weight. That's another tricky one. I used to be taller, of course. I’m… maybe five foot? A little shorter now, probably. And weight… oh, goodness. I haven't weighed myself in ages. Maybe… 120, 130 pounds? Something around there. I'm a small man, Doctor. Always have been. My wife used to say I was “pocket-sized.” Is that helpful? I'm not very good with numbers.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your age and the absence of any acute symptoms… this sighing is likely due to… deconditioning. Common in individuals your age. A little exercise, if you're able, would likely be beneficial. Though, realistically, at your age, we can only do so much. I will document this, and recommend… maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I will also prescribe a multivitamin. Just to be on the safe side. Take this to your pharmacy. Any other concerns today, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Oh. Exercise… I suppose that makes sense. It’s been a long time since I did much of that. A multivitamin… alright. My wife always said I didn't eat enough greens. No, Doctor, I don't think so. That’s all, really. Just the sighing. Thank you for listening. It’s good to have someone look at me, even if it’s just sighing. I… I appreciate it. Is there a cost for this visit? I don’t have… insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Given your… situation, we can offer a reduced fee. Fifty dollars. Please settle that with them on your way out. And try to remember to take the multivitamin daily, Mr. Vantine. Next patient.
PATIENT: Oh… fifty dollars. Alright. Yes, alright. Thank you, Doctor. I… I will try to remember the vitamins. Thank you again for your time, Doctor. .
