DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I'm one of the family medicine doctors here. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Lahn. It is nice to meet you. Oh… um… well, it’s a bit… difficult to explain, honestly. I’ve been having some pain… down there. It's... in the… testicular region, you said? It’s just… uncomfortable. I don't recall exactly when it started, but it's been a little while now, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's perfectly alright to find this difficult to discuss, and you're doing the right thing by coming in to get it checked out. Just to clarify, you mentioned the “testicular region” – and I want to be absolutely sure I understand correctly – are you experiencing pain in your lower abdomen, or are you referring to pain as if you were experiencing testicular discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. You see… I… well, I haven't… I don't think I have testicles. I mean, not that I remember. It feels… like where they would be, if that makes any sense? It’s a dull ache, mostly, but sometimes it gets sharper. I apologize, I’m not very good at explaining things. Is that… unusual?
DOCTOR: Noelani, thank you for clarifying, and please don't apologize at all. It's important to me that you feel comfortable, and that I understand everything as clearly as possible. What you're describing is certainly something we need to investigate further. It sounds like we need to explore your medical history a bit more deeply. To start, do you happen to know why you might not have testicles?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. I… truly, I don’t. It’s… a bit of a blank. I have… fragments of memories, things here and there, but nothing concrete about that. I know I’ve been to doctors before, of course, but I don’t recall anyone ever… mentioning anything like that. It’s possible… maybe it was a surgery? Or… a condition I was born with? Honestly, Doctor, I wish I could be more helpful. My memory… it's not what it used to be. It feels like looking through a fog sometimes. Is there a way to… find out? Perhaps records somewhere?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Noelani. It’s very common for patients to have gaps in their medical history, and it's my job to help piece things together. We'll do our best. Let me see what information we have on file. …Okay, it looks like you have been a patient here before, several times over the last five years. There are notes from Dr. Ramirez, but unfortunately, they don’t seem to detail any specific surgeries or congenital conditions. It does mention a general check-up in 2022, and a visit for… elevated blood pressure in 2023. Do you remember seeing Dr. Ramirez, or anything about the blood pressure check-up?
PATIENT: Dr. Ramirez… the name sounds familiar. A kind face, I think… but that could be anyone. And the blood pressure… I do recall something about that. I remember feeling a little worried, and Dr. Ramirez telling me to watch my salt intake. But… that’s all. It’s just… flashes, really. Very fleeting. I wish I could give you more details, Doctor. It’s frustrating for both of us, I’m sure. Is there perhaps another doctor who might have more information? Or a hospital I may have visited?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Noelani, we’ll get to the bottom of this. You’re not alone in this, and it's okay that your memory is hazy. …Okay, it looks like you were briefly admitted to St. Jude’s Hospital in 2018 for… abdominal pain. The notes are quite brief, mentioning a possible gastrointestinal issue, and a CT scan. Do you remember anything about being at St. Jude’s Hospital in 2018?
PATIENT: St. Jude’s… oh dear. That… that feels… different. A little frightening, actually. I remember being very unwell. A lot of nausea, and… pain. Sharp, twisting pain in my abdomen. I remember bright lights, and… and a lot of confusion. I think… I think they gave me something to make me sleep. And… there were tubes. Yes, tubes going into my arm. But… that’s all I can recall, Doctor. It’s very fragmented. Like a bad dream, almost. It doesn't feel like it happened to me, if that makes any sense. Do you think… do you think they would have looked at… everything, if I was in the hospital?
DOCTOR: It’s very likely they would have, Noelani, especially given the severity of the pain you’re describing. We’ll need to get a copy of those reports to see what was found. I’m going to put in a request for those records now. It may take a few days for them to arrive. In the meantime, let's go over your current symptoms a bit more thoroughly. You mentioned a dull ache in your lower abdomen, sometimes sharper. Can you describe the location of the pain more precisely?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… difficult. It’s sort of… centered, low down. But it radiates, you know? It feels like it spreads out. It’s not just one spot. More to the left side, I think, but not always. And it changes with… movement. If I stand up too quickly, or twist around, it gets much worse. It’s… a deep ache, like something is… bruised, perhaps? It’s not a sharp, stabbing pain all the time, more of a… pressure, a heaviness. And… sometimes, it feels like it goes through to my back. Is that… helpful? I apologize if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Noelani, thank you. It sounds like the pain is quite complex, and we're taking the right steps to understand it. The radiation to your back is particularly noteworthy. Now, aside from the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… hmmm… Well, I’ve been feeling rather fatigued lately. More tired than usual, even after a full night’s sleep. And… my appetite hasn’t been very good. I haven’t been eating as much as I normally do. And… …my bowel movements have been… irregular. Sometimes constipated, sometimes… the opposite. Is that… too much information? I apologize. I haven't noticed any fever, or nausea, or anything like that, thankfully. It's mostly just the fatigue and the digestive issues, along with the pain, of course.
DOCTOR: No, that’s all very useful information, Noelani. Please don’t apologize at all. It’s important to me that you feel comfortable sharing everything, so we can get a clear picture of what’s going on. Fatigue, appetite changes, and bowel irregularities are all things we need to consider. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I've never knowingly had a reaction to any medication, as far as I recall. I’ve taken antibiotics in the past, and some pain relievers, and I don’t remember any issues. But… my memory is so unreliable. It's possible I've forgotten something. Perhaps my family doctor had a record of it? I haven't seen a regular doctor in… well, quite a while, actually. Is it okay if we just assume I don’t have any known allergies for now? And perhaps check with the hospital records when they arrive?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Noelani. We’ll proceed under the assumption of no known allergies for now, and we’ll definitely verify with the hospital records when they arrive. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking anything at the moment. Not a single thing. I haven’t needed to, thankfully. I try to… eat healthy, and get enough rest. But… lately, it’s been difficult. I used to take a multivitamin, a few years ago, but I stopped. I don’t really have a good routine anymore, to be honest. I haven’t felt… well, I haven’t felt like myself lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… hmm. Doctor Ramirez did mention my blood pressure was a little elevated a few years ago, like I said. She recommended I watch my salt intake, but she didn't say anything about it being a full-blown condition. Apart from that… I don’t believe so. I’ve always been relatively healthy, thankfully. I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries, as far as I can recall. But… That hospital stay in 2018… that was the closest I’ve come to a serious medical issue, I think. But I don’t remember the diagnosis, or what they did to treat me. It’s all so frustratingly vague.
DOCTOR: Okay, so elevated blood pressure noted, but no other chronic conditions as far as you recall. And a hospital stay in 2018 with an unknown diagnosis. That’s alright, Noelani, we’re going to try and piece everything together. Now, have you ever had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I… honestly, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had any major operations. Nothing that I can recall, anyway. Perhaps a tonsillectomy when I was a child? But I don’t have a clear memory of it. It’s possible my parents had records of it, but… I haven’t been in contact with them for a long time. It’s all so hazy. I wish I could give you more concrete answers, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Noelani. It’s okay that your memory is hazy. We’re doing the best we can with the information you have. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members have any chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a difficult question. I haven't been close to my family for a very long time. I lost contact with them years ago. As far as I know, my mother was healthy. She was a very active woman, always gardening and cooking. My father… I don't remember much about his health. He passed away when I was young. I don't recall any specific illnesses or conditions that ran in the family, but… I honestly don't know. It's possible there was something, but I don't have any information to confirm it. I apologize, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Noelani. It’s perfectly understandable. You’re not responsible for knowing things about your family history if you haven’t been in contact with them. Now, let's talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I've never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while, but that's it. And I definitely don't use any recreational drugs. I've always been very careful about my health. I try to live a clean and healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. It's just… lately, it's been difficult to maintain that. With everything going on.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Noelani. And it’s perfectly understandable that it’s been difficult to maintain your routine lately. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. As far as I recall, no. I've never had a reaction to any medication, food, or anything like that. I don’t have any known environmental allergies either – no pollen, no dust, no animals. I’ve always been very fortunate in that regard. But… like I said before, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s possible I’ve forgotten something. But to the best of my knowledge, no, I don’t have any allergies. Is that… everything?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now, Noelani. Thank you for being so open and honest with me. It sounds like you’ve had a somewhat challenging time, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling frustrated. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s alright. A physical exam sounds… good. I want to figure out what’s going on, and if that’s what it takes, then yes, please. But… I apologize in advance if I… if I’m difficult. I just… I get nervous easily. And I’m a little worried about what you might find. But… let’s get it over with. What will you be doing?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Noelani. We’ll take things at your pace, and I’ll explain everything as we go. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Finally, I’ll do a quick neurological assessment. It shouldn’t be painful, but please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your blood pressure is 135/85. Slightly elevated, but not overly concerning. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 and your respiration rate is 16. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. …There's some mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. It's not overly sharp, just… uncomfortable. Is this where you've been feeling the most pain?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s it. That’s where it hurts the most. It’s not… a sharp, stabbing pain, more of a dull ache. But it definitely hurts more when you press there. It feels… like a heavy pressure. And… it radiates. It goes through to my back sometimes. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: The tenderness in the lower left quadrant is consistent with your description of the pain. The radiation to your back is also noteworthy. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it does warrant further investigation. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This will just involve tapping on your knees and ankles with a small hammer. Your reflexes are normal bilaterally. I’m also going to check your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a little difficult. It hurts a little in my lower back when I bend like that. And… it feels like something is pulling. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… strain. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Noelani. Limited range of motion and discomfort with bending forward are consistent with some muscle strain, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Okay, that completes the physical exam for now. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the exam, there are several possibilities we need to consider. It could be a muscle strain, a gastrointestinal issue, or something more serious. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. Blood work and a CT scan… yes, that’s alright. But… Will the CT scan… will it show everything? And… will it be painful? I’m a little worried about being in a closed space. I get… claustrophobic sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Noelani. It’s okay to be worried. The CT scan will give us a detailed look at your abdominal organs, and help us rule out any serious conditions. The scan itself isn't painful. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. You'll need to lie very still for a few minutes while the images are taken. We can discuss options to help with your claustrophobia, such as a mild sedative, or an open CT scanner if one is available nearby. We can also take breaks during the scan if you need to. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, and rule out any signs of infection or inflammation. It’s a standard procedure, and shouldn’t take long. Would you like me to explain the risks and benefits of the CT scan in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Explain the risks and benefits… I want to know everything. And… about the sedative… how would that work? Would it make me… sleepy? I have some appointments next week, and I don’t want to be… out of it. This is all a little overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. Let’s start with the benefits. The CT scan will allow us to visualize your abdominal organs – your liver, kidneys, spleen, pancreas, intestines, and uterus – in detail. This can help us identify any abnormalities, such as tumors, infections, or blockages. It’s the most accurate way to diagnose the cause of your pain. Now, let’s talk about the risks. There is a small risk of radiation exposure with a CT scan. However, the amount of radiation is relatively low, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis usually outweigh the risks. There is also a small risk of an allergic reaction to the contrast dye, which we may use to enhance the images. We will ask you about any allergies beforehand, and take precautions to minimize the risk. Finally, let’s talk about the sedative. If you’re feeling anxious about the scan, we can give you a mild sedative to help you relax. It won’t knock you completely out, but it will make you feel sleepy and less anxious. You'll still be able to respond to instructions, but you may not remember much of the scan afterward. The effects usually wear off within a few hours. If you choose to have a sedative, you'll need someone to drive you home afterward. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A sedative… and someone to drive me home. That sounds… good, actually. But… what if I can’t find anyone to drive me? I don’t really have many friends nearby, and my family… well, it’s complicated. And… what if the scan does find something serious? What then? I’m a little scared, Doctor. I don’t want to be… sick.
DOCTOR: That’s a valid concern, Noelani. It’s okay to be scared, and it’s understandable that you’re worried about the possibility of a serious diagnosis. If you’re unable to find someone to drive you home, we can explore other options, such as arranging transportation through a medical transport service. We don’t want your lack of transportation to prevent you from getting the care you need. And if the scan does find something serious, we’ll discuss your options with you in detail. We’ll refer you to a specialist, and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. You won’t be alone in this. We’ll be with you every step of the way. Right now, let’s focus on getting the scan scheduled. Do you want me to go ahead and order it, and we can discuss the transportation and sedative options later?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. Order the scan. Let’s just… get it over with. And… thank you, Doctor. For being so patient, and understanding. It’s… it’s a relief to talk to someone who isn’t… rushing me. What’s the next step? Do I need to do anything to prepare for the scan? Or… is there anything I should bring with me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. It’s my job to make you feel comfortable, and to provide you with the best possible care. Okay, I’ve ordered the CT scan. The radiology department will contact you within the next few days to schedule an appointment. You’ll need to fast for at least four hours before the scan, and you may need to drink a contrast dye beforehand. They’ll give you specific instructions when they call. You should bring your insurance card and a list of any medications you’re taking. You can also bring a friend or family member with you for support, if you’d like. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We’re here for you. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Lahn. For everything. I feel… a little better, knowing what’s going on. And… I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I guess… I’ll just wait for the radiology department to call. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day.
