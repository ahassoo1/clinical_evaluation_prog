DOCTOR: Hi Lytisha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, honestly, I mostly just gettin' this done 'cause they said I needed it. Some kind of… check, right? For things? My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I don’t really recall all the details. It’s somethin' about… drugs, I think? But I don’t even… well, I mostly drive big machines. Paving, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. A general check-up is a great place to start, and it's very common for things to be a little fuzzy when it comes to remembering the specifics of why you're scheduled. It sounds like this might be a preventative screening, possibly related to your work and potential exposures. Let's start with a quick overview of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been seeing another doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, a regular doctor… hmm. Not really. Not for a long time, anyway. After… after my husband passed, things got a little… scattered. I mostly just go when somethin’ really hurts. I got Medicare, so I can usually find someone who’ll see me. I don’t think I’ve seen anyone consistently, though. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Lytisha. Life happens, and it’s completely understandable to not have a consistent doctor when you’re dealing with a lot. And don’t worry about rambling at all – I’m here to listen. Okay, so no regular physician. Have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! Years ago, I had my gallbladder taken out. Must have been… oh gosh, twenty years ago or more? And… I think I had somethin' on my knee when I was younger, some sports injury, but it wasn’t a big deal. Just a little scope, I think. Nothing recently, though. Definitely not recently. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Both of those are good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, family… hmm. My mother had… I think it was high blood pressure. And she had some trouble with her heart later in life. My father… he was a smoker, and he… well, he had lung problems, naturally. That's all I can really think of right now. We weren't a family that talked a lot about health stuff, if I'm bein' honest. Does that help any? I'm sorry if this is all very vague.
DOCTOR: No, not at all vague. It's very common for families not to discuss medical history openly. High blood pressure and heart issues in your mother, and your father’s smoking history are both important pieces of information. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk about any medications you’re currently taking. Do you have a list with you, or can you tell me what you take regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… let me see. I take somethin’ for my arthritis in my hands, it's a little white pill, I think it's naproxen… or something like that. And sometimes, when my back flares up, I take somethin’ for the pain, but that’s not every day. Mostly just when it’s really bad. I don't really keep track of the names, honestly. It’s all kind of a blur. Do I need to know the names? I can ask my pharmacist, maybe?
DOCTOR: No, you don’t need to know the names right now. It’s perfectly fine if you don’t. We can get the exact list from your pharmacy if you'd like. And that's good to know about the arthritis and occasional back pain. Now, just to cover all the bases, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. No reactions to any pills, as far as I remember. I might get a little itchy sometimes, but I always figured that was just the weather. Or maybe somethin' I touched. I haven't really had a bad allergic reaction, not ever. So, I guess not? I really don’t think so. It’s hard to remember back that far, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No known allergies. Alright, Lytisha. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. A physical exam… okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s gonna be… uncomfortable. My old bones aren't as flexible as they used to be!
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate, and then I’ll listen to your lungs and check your abdomen. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but we can keep an eye on that. Heart rate is 78, nice and steady. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. A little bit of fullness, but nothing concerning. Now, let's just check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Reflexes… okay. I used to be pretty good at volleyball, if that means anything. My knees aren't what they used to be, though. Go ahead, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just try not to poke too hard, alright? These old bones bruise easy.
DOCTOR: No worries, I’ll be very gentle. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age, but nothing to be concerned about at this point. Pulses are good and strong in all extremities. Alright, Lytisha. Everything seems fairly stable, but your blood pressure is a little elevated. To get a better understanding of your overall health, I'd like to order some routine blood work. That will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and some other important levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… okay. That sounds… sensible. If you think it’s best, Doctor. I don’t mind getting poked, I suppose. As long as it tells you somethin’. Where do I go to get that done? Do I need to… fast beforehand? I always forget these things. It’s just… hard to keep track, you know? I don’t have anyone to remind me anymore. So, just tell me exactly what I need to do, alright? Step by step?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll write down everything step by step for you, and we can go over it together. You’ll need to go to the lab at Suburban Hospital – I’ll give you the address and phone number. And yes, you do need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks – just water is okay. Here's the requisition – you'll need to take this to the lab. And this sheet has detailed instructions, including the fasting requirements and the lab’s hours. They’re open Monday through Friday, 7 AM to 4 PM. You can eat normally after the blood draw. And we’ll get the results back in about a week. I'll have my nurse call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… Fast for 12 hours… Suburban Hospital… Monday through Friday… Okay, I think I can manage that. My nurse will call… to schedule an appointment… Got it. It’s a lot to remember, but I’ll try my best. Thank you for writin’ it all down, Doctor. That helps a lot. It’s just… things get muddled sometimes, you know? But I’ll do what I can. So, this is all just… routine? Because of my blood pressure? It's not somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: Exactly. It’s all routine, Lytisha. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and the blood work will help us determine if it’s something we need to address with medication or just lifestyle changes – like diet and exercise. It’s very likely it’s not something serious, but it's always best to be thorough. Do you have any other questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You’ve been very patient with me, Doctor. I appreciate you writin' everything down and explainin' it so clearly. I really do forget things easily. I guess… just thank you. For takin’ the time. And for not makin’ me feel… silly about forgettin' everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lytisha. It's my job, and I'm happy to help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. And please, don't worry about forgetting things – it happens to everyone. Have a good day, and I’ll talk to you soon. .
