DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. It’s been happening on and off, but it’s worse now. The doctor told me a while back it was somethin’ with my heart beatin’ funny… atrial… somethin’ or other. Is that right? I don’t remember all the big words.
DOCTOR: Okay, swollen leg, and a history of… an irregular heartbeat, we’ll get that documented properly. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I’d say, about a week ago. Not too bad at first, just a bit bigger than usual. But the last couple of days, it’s gotten much bigger. It feels… tight, almost. And a little achy, if I stand for too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is the swelling just in your calf, or does it extend higher up or down your leg?
PATIENT: Mostly in my calf, I think. It’s hard to tell exactly. It goes a bit up my shin, but not very far. And it doesn’t go down to my foot, no. It’s just… sort of concentrated in the middle part of my lower leg.
DOCTOR: Okay. We're going to do a quick measurement of both of your calves, just to see how much difference there is. That'll help us track things. Could you lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Is there anything special I need to do? Should I keep my leg straight, or…? I don't want to get in the way.
DOCTOR: No, just relax. Don't worry about a thing. I’m just going to measure the circumference of both calves at their widest point. This won’t be uncomfortable. Just let me know if anything feels strange. Right calf is… 38 centimeters. Now the left… 42 centimeters. Okay, a four centimeter difference. Noted. Now, I’m going to palpate your leg to check for tenderness and warmth. Just tell me if anything is painful.
PATIENT: Alright. Palpate…? Is that like… pressing? It doesn't hurt too bad just from you touchin' it, but when I press on it myself, it’s a little uncomfortable, yes. Mostly around here.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness noted. And is there any redness or warmth to the touch in that area?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me feel. It doesn't feel warmer, no. And I don't see any redness, not that I can tell. It just feels… tight. And a little bit achy, like I said before. Not terrible, but noticeable. Is that normal, with this… atrial thing? I keep forgettin’ what the doctor called it. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s understandable to forget the specifics, these things can be complex. We need to determine if the swelling is related to your heart condition or something else. Do you have any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no. I haven't had any trouble breathin', and my chest feels fine. And I haven’t felt dizzy, no. I do get a little tired, but I thought that was just… bein’ my age, maybe. It has been hotter than usual lately, so I figured it was just the heat gettin’ to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had any recent injuries to your leg?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. I haven't fallen or bumped it or anything. I've been tryin’ to be careful, you know? With my heart and all, I don’t want to take any chances. Is this somethin' serious, Doctor? I’m a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re being cautious. We're going to take this step by step. The swelling needs to be investigated. Given your history, we need to rule out a few things. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now, and then we'll discuss some possible next steps. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. Anything you think is best, Doctor. Just tell me if there's anything I need to do. I just want to get this sorted out. It's hard enough tryin’ to remember everything as it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath in… and out… Good. And again… deep breath in… and out… Okay. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Heart rate is a little rapid, but rhythm is irregular, as documented previously. I'm also going to check your pulses in your feet. Pulses are present, but a little weak on the left side. We're going to need to order some blood work and an ultrasound of your leg.
PATIENT: An ultrasound? What will that show, Doctor? And blood work… is it somethin' serious? I'm not very good with needles, I must admit. I understand you need to do what you need to do, but it’s makin’ me a bit anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound will allow us to visualize the veins in your leg to rule out a blood clot. That's what the swelling could indicate. As for the blood work, it will assess your kidney function and check for markers of inflammation. It’s a routine test, nothing overly invasive. And I understand your apprehension about needles. We can use a numbing cream if that would help. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and it will be over before you know it. I’m going to order these tests now. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye…? I… I don't think so. I've never had an ultrasound before, so I wouldn't know. I don’t have any known allergies, no. I'm a little allergic to pollen, if that counts, but that’s it. Just a bit of a runny nose and itchy eyes in the spring. Is this somethin' you see often, Doctor? With people with… atrial whatchamacallit?
DOCTOR: Pollen allergy noted. Yes, swelling in the legs can sometimes be a complication of atrial fibrillation – that’s what your heart condition is called. It can be caused by decreased blood flow, or even blood clots, as I mentioned. That’s why we need to rule those things out. It's not necessarily common, but it’s important to investigate. I'm going to write you a requisition for the blood work and the ultrasound. The ultrasound center is located at… [provides address]. You'll need to schedule an appointment. Once you have the results, please bring them back to me, or have them sent directly to the clinic. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… right. The address… Yes, I can write that down. And they’ll send the results… that’s good. No, I don't think so. Just… try to stay calm, I suppose. It's all a bit much to take in at once. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll get the appointment scheduled as soon as I can. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. Take your time. And don’t hesitate to call if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – increased pain, redness, or shortness of breath. I’ll see you when you have the results.
