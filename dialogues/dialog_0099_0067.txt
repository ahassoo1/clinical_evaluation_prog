DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… well, it’s this pain. When I take a deep breath, it kinda… hurts. Not all the time, just when I really breathe in. It’s been happening for a little while now, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Pain with deep breaths. And you said “a little while now”… can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. Let me think. Maybe… a few months? Or was it longer? I honestly can’t say for sure. It’s not getting worse, not that I’ve noticed. Just… there. It's a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Ruocco, though being more precise would be helpful. A few months is… broad. But we’ll work with it. Dull ache with deep breaths. Is it on one side more than the other, or is it all across your chest?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… I think… maybe a little more on this side. But it’s hard to tell, really. It kind of spreads around. It's not like a bad pain, you know? Just… uncomfortable. I don’t remember anything specific causing it, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Right. Uncomfortable, dull ache, primarily on the right side, spreading around, no specific injury. Have you noticed it getting worse with any particular activities?
PATIENT: Activities… Not that I recall. I don’t do much these days, to be honest. Mostly just… around the house. Maybe a little bit of work in the garden, but nothing heavy. It doesn’t seem to bother me when I'm resting. Just… when I take a big breath. I really don’t remember anything specific making it worse, though. Sorry I can’t be more helpful. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any other symptoms along with this pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think… No cough, I don’t think. No fever. I’ve been a little tired lately, but I’m always a little tired. Hard to say if that’s connected. I haven't lost any weight, that I know of. Honestly, Doctor, I mostly just feel… old. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Well, getting older can come with its own set of discomforts, Mr. Ruocco. But let’s focus on this pain for now. No cough, no fever, no weight loss. Just the pain with deep breaths and general fatigue. Alright. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, and then I'll do a quick exam of your chest wall. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. It’s just… worrying, you know? Even if it’s not much. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit back and relax. I'm going to listen to your breathing first. Just breathe normally. Okay. Breathing sounds… a little diminished on the right side, but not dramatically so. Now I'm going to listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Now, I’m going to gently press on your chest wall to see if I can pinpoint any tenderness. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Right there. That’s a little tender. Not awful, but… yes, that’s where it hurts. The rest feels okay. It's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable when you push.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation on the right chest wall, mid-ribcage. Alright, Mr. Ruocco. Based on what you've told me and what I've found in the exam, it's possible this is costochondritis. That’s inflammation of the cartilage where your ribs meet your sternum. It can cause pain with deep breaths and tenderness to the touch. It’s usually not serious, but it can be quite uncomfortable. However, given your age and the fact that you're not insured, I want to rule out anything more serious. We need a chest X-ray to be sure. Would you be able to get that done?
PATIENT: A chest… X-ray? Oh dear. How much does that cost? I… I don't have much money, Doctor. I haven’t really been to the doctor in years, and I don't have insurance. I don’t know if I can afford that. Is it really necessary? I just thought it was maybe a pulled muscle or something.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ruocco. And you're right to ask about the cost. A chest X-ray can be expensive. Unfortunately, given your symptoms and your age, it’s the responsible thing to do to rule out things like pneumonia or other lung issues. I’ll see if the clinic has any assistance programs or if there’s a lower-cost facility nearby we can utilize. Let me check… Okay, there’s a mobile X-ray service that comes to town on Wednesdays, and they offer a sliding scale based on income. It might be more affordable. Would you be willing to explore that option?
PATIENT: A sliding scale… that sounds… better. Yes, please, Doctor. If that’s possible, that would be wonderful. I really appreciate you looking into that for me. I just… I don’t want to get into a lot of debt over this. What happens if… if it is something serious? What then?
DOCTOR: If it is something serious, we’ll address it accordingly. We'll discuss all your options, and I'll help you navigate the resources available, regardless of your insurance status. There are programs to assist with medical bills and treatment costs. We'll take it one step at a time. First, let’s get the X-ray done and see what it shows. Okay, I’m scheduling you for an X-ray with the mobile service next Wednesday at 10 AM. They’ll come directly to the clinic. Here’s the information. Do you have any questions about the appointment?
PATIENT: Wednesday at 10… yes, that should work. I think so. Will I need someone to drive me? It’s a bit of a walk, and my knees aren't what they used to be. And… what should I wear? Do I need to change? Oh dear, I’m asking so many questions. I just get anxious about these things. I appreciate your patience, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions, Mr. Ruocco. It’s good to be prepared. You don’t need someone to drive you, it’s right here at the clinic. And you don’t need to change; just wear comfortable clothing, nothing with metal on your chest, like zippers or underwire bras. In the meantime, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with the discomfort. Follow the dosage instructions on the bottle, of course. Do you have any allergies to those medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I used to take ibuprofen for my back, years ago, and I didn’t have any problems. But it’s been so long, I can’t really remember. My memory is… I suppose I could try a little bit, if it helps. But I worry about side effects, you know? I’m an old man, and I don’t heal like I used to. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or avoiding?
DOCTOR: Given your age, it's wise to be cautious. If you've taken ibuprofen before without issue, a low dose – 200mg every 6-8 hours – is probably safe. But if you experience any stomach upset, heartburn, or unusual symptoms, stop taking it immediately. As for other things, try to avoid strenuous activity that worsens the pain. Gentle walking is fine, but don’t push yourself. And get plenty of rest. We’ll know more after the X-ray. Do you have any questions about the appointment itself?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Wednesday at 10… I’ll try to remember. It's just… hard to keep track of things these days. Thank you, Doctor. Really. You've been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man like me. I guess I’ll see you next Wednesday then. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. It's my job. And please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before Wednesday. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. Goodbye.
