DOCTOR: Bula Christen! And good afternoon. I’m Dr. Kimm. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, to be frank, I've been awfully thirsty lately, no matter how much I drink. And I seem to be hungry all the time as well, even after a good meal. It’s… rather bothersome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Increased thirst and hunger, even after eating… that is bothersome. Let's try to figure out what's going on. To start, when did you first notice this increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… It started, oh, about a month or so ago, I’d say. Maybe six weeks. It wasn’t sudden, just… gradually getting worse. I didn't pay much attention at first, figuring I was just busier than usual. But now it’s… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradually increasing over the last six weeks. And is this happening all day, or are there certain times it's worse?
PATIENT: It’s pretty consistent, to be honest. All day long. Though, if I'm being truthful, it's perhaps a little worse in the evenings. After work, mostly. I find myself reaching for another glass of water or a snack almost immediately after dinner. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. And besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. I've been needing to go to the bathroom… more often. Especially at night. It wakes me up a couple of times, which is rather irritating, I must say. I hadn’t really connected it to the thirst and hunger before, but now that I think about it… yes, that’s been happening too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased urination, especially at night – that’s important information. Are you feeling more tired than usual, or experiencing any blurred vision?
PATIENT: Blurred vision, no. But… yes, actually. I am quite tired. More tired than usual, certainly. I put it down to the disrupted sleep from getting up to use the bathroom, but perhaps it’s more than that. It’s a… dragging sort of tiredness. Difficult to explain, really. It's not like I've been working any harder than normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dragging tiredness along with the increased thirst, hunger and nighttime urination. I’m noting all of this. Do you have any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. My mother’s side, yes. My grandmother, I believe, had it. Type 2, I think it was. She needed injections. That was… a long time ago, though. I don’t recall the specifics, I was quite young. But yes, there's a history of it in the family, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And what about any other medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, thankfully. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, that’s about it. Otherwise, I'm generally quite healthy. No high blood pressure, no heart problems… I see the dentist regularly, have my yearly check-ups. Nothing serious to report, really. I do get the occasional headache, but nothing a bit of paracetamol can’t fix.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed as a child, otherwise generally healthy. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Nothing at all. Just the occasional paracetamol for a headache, as I said. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I prefer to… let my body handle things itself, if possible. I don’t really believe in relying on pills unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. No trouble with bee stings, pollen, dust… nothing. I'm quite fortunate in that regard, I suppose. My wife… she was allergic to everything, poor thing. But I’ve never had any issues myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I only drink very occasionally. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but that’s about it. I'm not much of a drinker, to be honest. Prefer a cup of tea, myself. A strong, Scottish breakfast tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol. And what about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat a balanced diet. Lots of fruit and vegetables, plenty of protein. I do enjoy a good steak now and then, but I don’t overdo it. I cook most of my meals myself, so I know what’s going into them. I’m not one for fast food or processed foods, if I can avoid it. Just… normal, healthy eating, really. I wouldn't say I'm on any sort of strict diet, but I do try to be mindful of what I'm consuming.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. And finally, what do you do for work, and would you describe it as physically demanding?
PATIENT: I work as a Shipping, Receiving, and Inventory Clerk. Mostly office work, really. A bit of lifting and moving boxes sometimes, but nothing too strenuous. It's not a particularly physical job, no. More… mentally demanding, I suppose. Keeping track of everything, making sure orders are correct, that sort of thing. It's a bit stressful at times, but nothing I can't handle. I've been doing it for about ten years now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Thank you for sharing all of that information, Christen. Based on what you’ve told me – the increased thirst, frequent urination, hunger, tiredness, and family history of diabetes – it would be prudent to run some tests to check your blood sugar levels. I’m going to order a fasting blood glucose test and an HbA1c test. The HbA1c gives us an average of your blood sugar control over the past 2-3 months. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. If you think it's best, then please do. I'd rather know one way or the other, to be honest. I just want to get to the bottom of this. What does that involve, exactly? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a bit of a schedule to keep, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. For the fasting blood glucose test, you’ll need to abstain from eating or drinking anything – except water – for at least eight hours beforehand. We can usually do that first thing in the morning. We'll take a small sample of blood from your arm. The HbA1c test also requires a blood sample, and can be done at the same time. It doesn’t require fasting. The results usually take about 24 to 48 hours to come back from the lab. We can call you with the results, or you can check them online through our patient portal if you're signed up. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds manageable. First thing in the morning is fine. And I haven't signed up for the patient portal, no. A phone call would be best, if you don't mind. I’m not terribly tech-savvy, you see. Just a straightforward phone call is perfectly fine. Thank you. Is there anything else I need to do, or prepare for?
DOCTOR: No, nothing else at all. Just come in tomorrow morning, having fasted overnight, and we’ll get the blood samples taken. After that, just relax and carry on as usual until you hear from us. I’ll make a note to call you directly with the results, as soon as they become available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – for example, if you become excessively thirsty, confused, or experience blurred vision – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Does that all sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, Doctor. Thank you very much for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your time and attention. I’ll see you tomorrow morning, then. I suppose that’s all for now? I do hope it’s nothing too serious. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Christen. I understand your concern. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Don’t worry too much until we have the results. Yes, that’s all for now. I’ll see you tomorrow morning. Have a good evening, and try to get some rest. Sláinte!
