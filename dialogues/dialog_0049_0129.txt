DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let's just get right to it. It’s my… well, my stool. It’s black. And I take those pills, you know, for the aches. The red ones. Been taking ‘em for years. Is that what this is about? It’s probably just those pills, honestly.
DOCTOR: Black stool, you say. And you’re taking red pills for aches… could you tell me the name of those pills, if you recall?
PATIENT: Honestly, I have no idea what they're called. I just ask the pharmacist for “the red ones for my arthritis.” They've always given me the same thing. I've been getting them at Schmidt's Pharmacy since… well, a long time. Look, are you going to tell me if it’s serious or not? I don’t do well with guessing games.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard. It's difficult to say definitively without knowing what you’re taking. Black stool can be caused by certain medications, but it can also indicate something more concerning, like bleeding in the digestive tract. To be thorough, we need to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any other changes in your bowel movements – diarrhea, constipation, anything unusual besides the color?
PATIENT: Bleeding?! Oh, for goodness sake. Look, I haven't noticed bleeding, if that's what you're implying. Just… dark stool. And no, nothing else different. Maybe a little… slower, I guess, going to the bathroom lately. But that’s just getting older, isn’t it? Honestly, I just want a prescription if it's something simple. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. "Slower" is good to know. And I understand your desire for a quick resolution. However, skipping steps to avoid a proper examination would be irresponsible. To proceed, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, including checking your abdomen and listening to your bowel sounds. It won’t take long. After that, I'll need to order a stool test to check for blood, and possibly some blood work. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, fiddlesticks. A test? Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know if I'm dying! Is that too much to ask? Look, poking and prodding isn’t going to magically tell you what’s going on. And blood work? That means needles! Fine, fine. But make it quick. And explain everything before you do it, alright? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed methodically. First, the abdominal exam. I’m simply going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope and gently feel for any tenderness. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful. Then, we’ll discuss the stool test and blood work. It’s important to rule out any serious causes for the black stool, and these tests are the best way to do that. If you could lie down for me, please?
PATIENT: Honestly. Fine. But don't expect me to be comfortable. It's getting harder to get up and down these days, you know. And be gentle, alright? I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. I'm not hearing any unusual sounds, and your abdomen is soft to the touch, though slightly tender in the lower quadrants. No masses or significant distention. Your pulse is regular, and your blood pressure is within normal limits. However, the tenderness is a little concerning. The stool test is vital. And I do recommend a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel just to get a full picture. We'll need a sample first thing in the morning, and the blood work can be done here in the clinic after that. Does that sound doable?
PATIENT: First thing in the morning?! Honestly, this is ridiculous. Look, are you sure it's not just the pills? I've been taking those pills for years! And tenderness… well, I'm an old woman! Things hurt. But fine, I'll give you a sample. But if it turns out to be nothing, I'm sending you the bill for all this fuss. And don't tell me it will only take a "minute" if it takes longer.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard. I assure you, I am not dismissing the possibility that the pills are the cause. However, we have a professional obligation to investigate thoroughly. We'll send the sample to the lab immediately. The results typically take 24-48 hours. In the meantime, please avoid taking any iron supplements or bismuth-containing medications, like Pepto-Bismol, as these can also cause black stool. I'll give you a collection cup and instructions for the sample. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for three days from now to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Three days. Don’t you have anything better to do? And bismuth… what? Look, just give me the cup and tell me what to do. I’m not a scientist, alright? And if it is just the pills, you’re hearing about it. Honestly, this whole thing is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Here you are. The instructions detail exactly how to collect the sample. It’s best to collect it first thing in the morning, before you eat or take any medications. Bring it back to the lab window as soon as possible. And if you have any questions, the lab technician can assist you. I understand your impatience, Ms. Hatchard, but due diligence is crucial for your well-being. Now, do you have any other concerns or medications you would like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, no other concerns. Just get it over with. Honestly, you young doctors make such a fuss over everything. Don't bother calling me unless it's something serious. I have better things to do than sit around waiting for test results.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hatchard. I will contact you if the results indicate a cause for concern. If you experience any new symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
