DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Hembrey, good to meet you too. It’s just… paperwork, really. I need to get some forms filled out for Medicare, and I figured it’d be easier to do it here if there were any questions. I don’t really have a health issue, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: I see. While I am happy to assist with clarifying any medical questions for your Medicare forms, this appointment is for a medical evaluation. It's not appropriate to utilize a physician's time solely for administrative tasks. However, since you are here, and it's my professional responsibility to ensure a basic level of wellness assessment, I will ask a few standard questions. Then, if you have specific medical queries related to the forms, we can address those. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, I’m so sorry! I didn’t realize… I just assumed since it was easy to get an appointment here, it was okay for forms. Yes, absolutely, asking a few questions is fine. I didn’t mean to waste your time. Please, ask away. I'll answer as best I can.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's begin with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I know of. My mom had high blood pressure, but I haven’t been told I do. I get winded sometimes when I’m working, but I figured that was just from the physical work, you know? I install and repair valves, it can be pretty strenuous. I had really bad pneumonia when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Pneumonia is relevant, yes. And your mother’s hypertension does place you at a slightly increased risk. “Getting winded” is rather vague, however. Can you describe that more precisely?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I can't do the work, if that makes sense. It's just… after a long day, or if it's really hot outside, I feel like I'm breathing harder than I should. And sometimes my chest feels tight. It goes away when I rest, though. I've never really told anyone about it, honestly. I just figured it was part of the job. It hasn’t gotten worse, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. When my son was born, I was in the hospital, of course, but that wasn’t for me, you know? Just… normal delivery, everything went fine. Other than that, no. I’ve broken a few bones here and there working, but never needed to be admitted. Just a cast and some time to heal.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. And I haven't had a reaction to any medicine I've ever taken. I haven’t taken a lot of medicine, but nothing’s ever bothered me. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Um… nothing. Not a single thing. I don’t take vitamins, supplements, or anything like that either. I try to eat healthy and get enough rest, and that's about it. I'm pretty old-fashioned that way, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… My grandma on my mother’s side had diabetes, I think. And like I said, my mom had high blood pressure. My uncle, on my dad’s side, had… something with his heart, I think he had a bypass surgery. He’s doing okay now, though. Honestly, I don’t know a whole lot about it. My family doesn't really talk about health stuff much. It's kind of a taboo subject.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean by that? Like… what I do for fun?
DOCTOR: That is part of it, Ms. Fabing, but I’m referring to things like smoking, alcohol consumption, and drug use. Also, your occupation and living situation. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh! Okay, I understand now. No, I don’t smoke, never have. And I hardly ever drink. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a blue moon. And no, definitely no drug use. I work as a control and valve installer and repairer, and I live with my husband in town. We've been married for fifteen years now. We have a small place, nothing fancy. It's peaceful, though.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to perform a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 138/86. Slightly elevated, but not critically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though your breathing does seem a little labored. Ears are clear, throat is unremarkable. Your weight is 70 kilograms, and your height is 171 centimeters, giving you a BMI of 23.9, which is within the normal range. Do you experience any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little sore after a long day at work, you know, muscles aching and stuff, but nothing constant or severe. Just the normal work aches, I guess. The breathing thing… that’s the only thing that’s ever bothered me, and even then, it's not always there. It's more when I’m tired, or working hard in the heat.
DOCTOR: Given your reported symptoms and the physical exam findings, it’s difficult to determine a definitive cause at this time. Your slightly elevated blood pressure could be a contributing factor to the labored breathing, as could underlying mild asthma, especially given your family history. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any structural abnormalities. We should also get a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. I also recommend a spirometry test to assess your lung function. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a lot. Is it… serious? I just came in for paperwork, honestly. I didn't expect all this. I guess if you think it’s necessary… Yes, okay. Do what you think is best. I trust your judgment. But could you explain a little about what those tests are for? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Fabing. It is a lot, and I apologize if this is overwhelming. However, it’s important to investigate these symptoms, even if they seem minor. The chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and rule out any infections or structural problems. The complete blood count will check for signs of inflammation or infection, and the basic metabolic panel will assess your kidney and liver function. The spirometry test measures how much air you can inhale and exhale, which can help determine if you have any underlying lung disease. As for the timeline, the lab results should be back within a few days. We can schedule the X-ray and spirometry test today or tomorrow. Once I have those results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. It’s important to note that these tests don't automatically mean you have a serious condition. They're simply a precaution to rule out any potential problems. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule those tests for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Go ahead and schedule them. I… I don't want to worry about it hanging over my head. And if it turns out to be nothing, that’s fine. Just… get it done. I appreciate you explaining everything, Dr. Hembrey. It makes me feel a little better. Now, about that paperwork… Can we get back to that when we have the test results?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fabing. We can address the paperwork once we have the test results. My nurse will schedule the X-ray and spirometry test before you leave. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Dr. Hembrey. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate your time. I’ll see what the nurse says about scheduling those tests.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow my nurse to the scheduling desk. Have a good day, Ms. Fabing.
