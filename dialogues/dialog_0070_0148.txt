DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepro. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Abady. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh, goodness… well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been having some pain… down there. In, um… well, the groin area, I suppose. It’s been on and off, and honestly, I’m not quite sure why it’s happening. It's a bit embarrassing to talk about, if I'm being frank.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Stepro. Many things can cause pain in that area, and you've done the right thing by coming in to discuss it. It’s perfectly alright to feel embarrassed, but please don’t let that prevent you from telling me everything you’re experiencing. The more information you provide, the better I can understand what’s going on. To start, could you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. You’re very kind. Um… well, it’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it feels heavy, like… like something is weighing down. And like I said, it comes and goes. Some days I barely notice it, and others… well, others it’s quite uncomfortable. It doesn’t really radiate anywhere, as far as I can tell – it stays mostly localized. Though… now that I think about it, I might have felt a slight discomfort in my lower abdomen a couple of times. But I could be imagining things, honestly. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, sometimes a heavy feeling, coming and going, localized to the groin area, with occasional slight discomfort in the lower abdomen. That’s helpful, thank you. And when did this start?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the when is… tricky. I’m not very good with dates, I’m afraid. It’s been… several weeks, I think? Maybe a month or so? It’s hard to pinpoint, because at first it was so mild I barely noticed it. It’s definitely gotten worse recently, which is why I finally decided to come in. I wish I could be more precise! I’m so sorry. Everything feels a little… hazy, lately.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry about being precise, Ms. Stepro. "Several weeks" is a good starting point. It’s perfectly alright to not remember exact dates. The fact that it's been gradually worsening is important information. Now, are there any specific activities that seem to make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I do seem to notice it more after… gardening. I enjoy gardening very much, but it involves a lot of bending and… well, getting up and down. That certainly seems to aggravate it. And… walking long distances, perhaps? But I haven't been doing much walking lately, to be honest. I haven’t been feeling very energetic. Other than that… no, not that I can recall. Just the gardening, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gardening and potentially long walks seem to worsen the pain. And you mentioned not feeling very energetic. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the pain and fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well… I’ve been… more irritable, I think. My daughter says I haven’t been myself, that I snap at her easily. I don't mean to, of course. And… I’ve noticed I’m going to the bathroom more frequently. Just… needing to urinate more often, especially at night. That’s been a bit disruptive to my sleep, which isn’t helping the fatigue, I suppose. Other than that… I don’t think so. No fever, no nausea… just the pain, the irritability, and the frequent urination.
DOCTOR: Okay, irritability and increased urinary frequency, particularly at night. Thank you for sharing all of this, Ms. Stepro. This is all very helpful. Before we move on, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… That’s a… personal question, Doctor. Well… no, not really. Everything seems… normal in that department, if you don’t mind me saying so. No constipation, no diarrhea… nothing out of the ordinary. I apologize for being so… blunt. It’s just a bit awkward to discuss.
DOCTOR: You have absolutely no need to apologize, Ms. Stepro. It is my job to ask these questions, and you are perfectly within your rights to feel awkward discussing them. I appreciate you answering honestly. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it's usually well-controlled with medication. And… oh, yes! I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, but I haven't had any problems with that since. Other than that… I don't think so. I’ve always been quite healthy, for the most part. Nothing major, anyway. My mother had… something with her heart, I think, but I don't remember the details. It was a long time ago. I’m so sorry, I wish I could be more helpful! My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stepro. High blood pressure, well-controlled with medication, and gallbladder removal fifteen years ago. That is very helpful. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is a good question. I’m afraid not, Doctor. I just… I have my daughter refill it for me every month. I take a little white pill, that's all I know. I’m terribly sorry. I really should pay more attention to these things. Perhaps my daughter knows? She’s very organized. Would it be alright if I asked her?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stepro. It's perfectly alright. It’s often helpful to have family members assist with medication lists. We can certainly document that your daughter manages your refills, and we'll ask her for the name of the medication when she's able. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. Just… occasionally, I take a pain reliever for my arthritis. It's just ibuprofen, over-the-counter. Nothing regularly, only when it flares up. And… I used to take a vitamin D supplement, but I stopped a while ago. I don’t remember why, exactly. Honestly, I’m terrible at keeping track of these things. Is there anything else I should be thinking of? I feel so disorganized!
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen for arthritis and previously took vitamin D. No need to worry about being disorganized, Ms. Stepro. We're just trying to get a complete picture of everything. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, good question! No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. I sometimes get a little bit of a rash with poison ivy, but that's not an allergy, is it? Nothing serious, anyway. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. So, no, no allergies to speak of. I think. I hope I’m not forgetting anything!
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Ms. Stepro. Don't worry about forgetting things, we'll get there. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's it. And absolutely not with recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I lead a very quiet life, mostly gardening and spending time with my daughter. I’m not much of a partier, if you know what I mean. I value my health too much!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Stepro. Now, and this may be a bit personal, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… Well, my mother, as I mentioned before, had some heart trouble, but I don’t recall the specifics. She passed away several years ago. My father was generally healthy, but he had… prostate problems, I think? It was a long time ago. And my brother… he’s alive and well, as far as I know, but we don’t keep in close contact. He lives in another country. I don’t recall any other significant illnesses in the family, to be honest. It’s all a bit hazy. I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stepro. Maternal history of heart trouble, paternal history of prostate problems. We can always try to gather more detailed information later if needed. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment completely. Just… please be gentle? This is all a little nerve-wracking, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stepro. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to palpate your abdomen. If you feel any discomfort during the examination, please let me know immediately. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. This may be a little uncomfortable, but please tell me if you experience any pain. I notice some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, on both sides. Nothing alarming, but it's worth noting. And I don't feel any masses or enlargements.
PATIENT: Oh… yes, I do feel a little bit of discomfort there. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like I mentioned before. It's more noticeable when you press on it, of course. It’s… a little unsettling, to be honest. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Ms. Stepro. Tenderness is often associated with inflammation or muscle strain. Given your description of the pain and the tenderness I'm feeling, it's consistent with a few different possibilities. I’d like to check your reflexes and perform a brief neurological exam, just to rule out any nerve involvement. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. I do worry sometimes. This pain… it’s been making me a bit anxious. My daughter says I should come to the doctor, and I’m glad I did. Please, go ahead with the exam. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal, and your muscle strength and sensation appear intact. Everything seems to be functioning as expected neurologically. Based on the physical exam and your history, there are a few possibilities we should consider. It could be a muscle strain, inflammation in the pelvic region, or possibly a referred pain from a hip or lower back issue. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few blood tests to check for inflammation and a urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract infection. I also recommend a pelvic ultrasound to visualize your uterus and ovaries. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary, Doctor. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your expertise. Blood tests, urinalysis, ultrasound… yes, please. Let's do whatever we need to do. I just… I hope it’s not something too serious. Is an ultrasound… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Ms. Stepro. We'll take things one step at a time. The ultrasound isn't usually uncomfortable, but it does involve placing a probe on your lower abdomen, which may feel a little cool. The technician will use a gel to help with the image quality. It's a non-invasive procedure, and it shouldn't cause any pain. I'm ordering the blood tests and urinalysis now. I'll also schedule the pelvic ultrasound for you. We should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed. Avoid strenuous activity and try to get plenty of rest. We’ll review the results together when they come in, and we can discuss the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate your patience. The tests… the ultrasound… yes, I'll do that. I just… thank you. It’s a relief to finally be getting some answers. When should I expect to hear about the results? And… who should I call if the pain gets worse before then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stepro. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. The lab results should be back in approximately three to five business days. The ultrasound facility will contact you directly to schedule the appointment; they usually book within a week of the order. If the pain gets significantly worse – if it becomes unbearable, if you develop a fever, or if you experience any unusual bleeding – please don't hesitate to contact our office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. We have an after-hours number listed on our website and on your new patient paperwork. I'll also send a summary of today's visit, including the test orders and a list of things to watch out for, to your primary care physician. Do you have any other concerns or questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything. You’ve been very kind and thorough, Doctor Abady. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Thank you again. I feel… a little better now, knowing we’re getting this checked out. I’ll wait for the ultrasound facility to call. And I’ll remember the after-hours number, just in case. I hope it’s nothing serious. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stepro. I understand your concerns, and we'll do everything we can to get you a diagnosis and treatment plan. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. Have a good day, Ms. Stepro.
