DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, it’s about this…procedure. My daughter insisted I come get cleared. Says I’m too old to just decide these things on my own. Honestly, it's a bit of a nuisance, taking time out of my day for this. Just want to get it over with.
DOCTOR: A procedure, you say. Alright. And what procedure are we discussing, exactly?
PATIENT: It’s…a face lift. Though I don’t see what all the fuss is about. A little sagging, that's all. I’ve seen worse, working with stone all these years. It’s not like I’m trying to look like one of those…Hollywood types. Just want to look presentable, is all. My granddaughter's wedding is coming up, and I'd like to be in the pictures. Not looking like a melted snowman.
DOCTOR: A facelift. I see. And your daughter felt a medical clearance was necessary before scheduling this?
PATIENT: Well, she made the appointment and scheduled the clearance. Said the surgeon wants a check-up first. Thinks I'm too frail, probably. Honestly, I’ve been laying terrazzo longer than she’s been alive. A bit of pulling and stitching isn't going to be the death of me. Though, truthfully, I haven't been to a doctor in…oh, goodness, decades. So, I suppose it’s good to get things checked. Just hurry it along, if you would. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. We'll do our best to be efficient. Decades since your last check-up... that does mean we need to cover a fair amount of ground. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious conditions?
PATIENT: Serious conditions? Goodness. Let me think. Back in…oh, 1968, I broke my wrist falling off a scaffold. That's about it, really. Nothing major. A bit of arthritis, of course, but what old man doesn’t have arthritis? And my blood pressure…the pharmacist mentioned it was a little high once, but I stopped going to that particular pharmacy. They tried to sell me too many creams. I've always been a healthy fellow. Strong as an ox, I was. Still am, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the wrist. Set it, put a cast on. No fancy business. I wasn’t about to let them poke around if it wasn’t absolutely necessary. A good plaster cast and a bit of time is all it needed. And I’ve had all my shots, naturally. Polio, tetanus…the usual. Back when they made you get them. Don’t see much point in those now, though. Everyone's too worried about things these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my wife, bless her soul, passed away five years ago. Lung cancer. Terrible thing. Had a daughter, Ingrid, she's the one who dragged me here. And a granddaughter, Elina. Elina’s the one getting married. Ingrid and Elina are both…fine, I suppose. They worry too much. My father, he lived to be 92. Worked on the railways. Healthy as a horse right up until the end. Mother…she passed when I was young. Scarlet fever, I think. Not much to say about that. Healthy family, mostly. A bit of high blood pressure on my side.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I mean, I don't go eating strange things. A bit of a sensitive stomach if I have too much coffee, but that's not an allergy, is it? Used to get a rash from poison ivy when I was a boy, but I learned to avoid it. Mostly, I just eat what's put in front of me. Plain food. Simple. No need for fancy spices or anything like that. Honestly, all these new foods these days…give me a good piece of fish and potatoes any time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for my arthritis when it flares up. Ibuprofen, sometimes. Nothing regularly. And a bit of a sleeping pill now and then, if I can’t get to sleep. Ingrid keeps a bottle in her car, just in case. But honestly, I prefer to just read until I’m tired. Much better than those pills. They leave me feeling groggy in the morning. She worries I won't get enough rest, but I sleep just fine when I need to. Mostly, I avoid doctors and pills whenever possible. They just cause more problems than they solve, in my opinion.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam then, just to get a baseline. Nothing extensive, just a quick look. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. I used to be able to lift a half-ton of stone without breaking a sweat, but I suppose I'm a bit creaky these days. Just don’t expect me to do any gymnastics. And be quick about it. I have a garden to tend to later.
DOCTOR: If you could step up on the table for me, please. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated. I'll listen to your heart and lungs now. Breath sounds are a bit quiet in the lower parts of your lungs. No murmurs detected. Your abdomen feels okay, but a little tender when I press here. Reflexes are a bit slow, but seem equal on both sides. I'll take a look at your throat and ears now. Throat and ears look clear. Finally, I'll check your extremities. Some swelling in your ankles and your wrists are a little stiff. Alright, that's all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Well? What's the verdict? Am I about to keel over, or can I still manage a few more years? Honestly, all this poking and prodding…it’s unnecessary. I told my daughter I was perfectly healthy. What did you find, exactly? Don't beat around the bush, Doctor. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Orvin, while you appear reasonably functional for your age, your examination revealed a few areas of concern. Your blood pressure is elevated, which needs to be addressed. Your breath sounds are diminished, which could indicate some underlying lung issues, potentially from years of…exposure, shall we say. And you have some mild swelling in your ankles and stiff wrists, suggestive of arthritis, which you already mentioned. Now, I’m not saying you’re about to “keel over,” but you're not as robust as you seem to think. Getting a facelift while ignoring these underlying issues isn't a smart idea. Frankly, it’s a bit irresponsible, and potentially dangerous. I recommend further investigation. We should start with a chest X-ray to assess your lungs, and some blood work to check your kidney function, cholesterol, and overall health. We also need to discuss controlling your blood pressure, likely with medication. And, truthfully, you should probably reconsider this elective surgery until we get these other issues sorted out.
PATIENT: Medication? You mean pills? Absolutely not. I told you, I avoid those things like the plague. And a chest X-ray? Honestly, Doctor, are you trying to frighten an old man? I’ve been working with stone for sixty years! A little dust never hurt anyone. As for the blood work…I don’t need to have my insides poked and prodded to tell me I’m perfectly fine. Look, I appreciate your…concern, but I’m not interested in becoming a medical experiment. I came here for a clearance, not a full-body overhaul. If you won’t sign off on this, I’ll find a doctor who will. This is my body, and I’ll decide what to do with it. I don’t need a lecture from someone half my age. Now, are you going to clear me, or not? I have a wedding to attend.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand you’re frustrated, but as a physician, I cannot in good conscience clear you for an elective surgery when you have these significant underlying health concerns. It would be unethical, and potentially harmful. I am documenting my refusal to clear you for surgery. I strongly recommend you reconsider my advice and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss these issues further. However, I will not be party to a procedure that could jeopardize your health. You are free to seek another opinion, but I will not be signing off on this surgery.
