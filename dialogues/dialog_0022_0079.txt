DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Tosca. Good to meet you too. Um, it’s my bruising. It's just… been worse lately. I’m on a blood thinner, and usually it’s okay, but I’ve been bumping into things and getting these big bruises that don’t go away quick. It's kinda worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bruising more easily when you’re on a blood thinner is definitely something we want to look into. So you've noticed this worsening recently – can you tell me roughly how long it's been happening, and how it compares to bruising you’ve experienced before starting the blood thinner, or even shortly after?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Before the medication, I maybe got a bruise if I really whacked my knee or something. Now… it feels like just a little knock and boom, a purple spot. It's been getting worse for maybe the last month, I'd say? Definitely more noticeable in the last couple of weeks. I even had one just from… carrying groceries, I think. It's a bit silly, really.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Ms. Hainley. Any change in bruising pattern while on medication is worth investigating. So, a month ago it was more like the occasional bruise with significant injury, and now it's happening with minimal trauma… Okay. Are the bruises in usual places, or are you noticing them appearing in areas you wouldn’t normally expect?
PATIENT: They’re… mostly on my arms, I think? And my legs. I haven’t really noticed any on my stomach or back, thankfully. But yeah, it’s mostly where I'd expect – like, if I bang my shin on the coffee table, it’ll bruise there. Just… bigger bruises. And they stick around longer than they used to. I don’t think I’ve noticed anything weird places, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: That does make sense. So, primarily on your arms and legs, with increased size and duration compared to before. Let’s talk a bit more about the blood thinner itself. Do you know the name of the medication you're taking?
PATIENT: Um… let me see… I have the bottle here somewhere… Aha! It's called… Warfarin. Is that right? Warfarin. Yes, that’s it. I've been taking it for about… two years now, I think. For my heart, the doctor said.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin. And you've been on it for approximately two years for a heart condition. Good. Are you having regular blood tests to monitor your Warfarin levels – what’s called an INR?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I do. Every month. They prick my finger and send it off. I usually get a call back with the numbers, but honestly, I don't really pay attention to what they mean. They just tell me if I need to adjust my dosage. I think it's been pretty stable for a while, though. Last time, the lady on the phone said it was “good.” Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, monthly INR checks and they last reported it as "good." That's helpful. Sometimes "good" isn't specific enough, but we can look at your records here to see the exact numbers. … Alright, I see your recent INR results. They have been fairly stable, but there was a slight dip about three weeks ago. It wasn't drastically low, but it’s something to note. Now, beyond the bruising, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… I don’t think so. No nosebleeds, no bleeding gums… Nothing like that. I’ve been feeling pretty normal, just a little tired sometimes, but I always am, to be honest. Oh! Wait… sometimes my ankles feel a bit achy, but I thought that was just from standing too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, no unusual bleeding, just occasional fatigue and some ankle achiness. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture. I'll take your blood pressure and pulse first, and then I’d like to take a look at the bruising on your arms and legs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do, Dr. Tosca. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let's take a look at your arms and legs. I’m noting several ecchymoses – that’s the medical term for bruising – on both arms and legs. They range in size from about 2 to 5 centimeters. The coloration is varied – some are newer and more purple, others are resolving and more brownish. There’s no swelling or warmth to the touch. I don’t see any signs of active bleeding. Do you notice any lumps or bumps under the bruising?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t felt anything like that. It just feels… sore, sometimes. Like a really bad bruise. Not hard or anything. Just… ouch. It’s probably nothing, right? I just don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me how you feel, Ms. Hainley. You're not a bother at all; that’s what I’m here for. The fact that these bruises are changing, and you're noticing them more frequently, is worth investigating. While it could be something simple, we want to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a coagulation panel – which will give us a more detailed look at your clotting factors – and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever tests you think I need. I just want to know what’s going on. So, blood tests… will I need to come back another day?
DOCTOR: Yes, blood tests. And no, we can do those right here today. The lab is just down the hall. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. While we wait for the results, I’m also going to ask about your medical history, just to get a more complete picture. Would you mind telling me about any other medical conditions you have, besides the heart condition you mentioned?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I'm glad it can be done today. Um… let me think. I have… high blood pressure, I think. The doctor told me, but I don’t take anything for it, just try to eat healthy. And I had a really bad bout of the flu a couple of years ago, but I’ve been okay since. Oh! And my knees are kinda achy sometimes, the doctor said it's arthritis, but it's not too bad. Is that everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of hypertension, a past episode of the flu, and some arthritis in your knees. That’s helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Um… let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid. And… oh! I had a C-section when my daughter was born, but that was… a long time ago. Almost 30 years ago now. That's all I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a C-section approximately 30 years ago. Now, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, besides the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Just the Warfarin. I don’t really take anything else. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees if they're really bad, but not very often. Maybe once a month, if that. And I take a multivitamin, but that's it. Really. I try to stay away from pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin, occasional ibuprofen for your knees, and a multivitamin. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or latex?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had any reactions to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. I've been stung by bees before, but I'm not allergic. I can wear latex gloves without a problem. I think I’m pretty lucky, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, um, okay. I work as an Information Security Analyst, so I sit at a computer a lot. I try to walk when I can, but it's hard with the job. I live alone, and my daughter lives a few states away, so I don't see her as often as I’d like. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Pretty boring, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you work a sedentary job as an Information Security Analyst, live alone, and have limited physical activity. You don't smoke, and you occasionally drink wine. That gives me a good overview. Okay, I’ve entered all of that into your chart. Now, we'll get those blood tests done, and we should have the results back within a couple of hours. Once we have those, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything. I guess… I'm just worried about what it could be, you know? But I trust you to figure it out. Can I just go and get the blood tests done now?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hainley, and it’s good you’re asking questions. We'll get to the bottom of this. It's more likely to be something straightforward. Yes, please, let’s get those blood tests done. I’ll have the nurse escort you to the lab. She’s just outside the door. She’ll let me know when you’re finished, and I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Dr. Tosca. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hainley. Don’t hesitate to let the nurse or me know if you have any concerns while you’re waiting.
