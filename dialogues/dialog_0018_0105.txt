DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, it’s about getting surgery. Weight loss surgery, that is. My wife, she helped me make the appointment. I… honestly, I don’t really remember all the details why exactly, just that it’s supposed to help. It’s a… pre-surgery thing, right? To check if I can have it?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are quite right. This is a pre-surgical evaluation. We want to ensure you are a suitable candidate for weight loss surgery, and to discuss all aspects of the procedure and recovery. It’s very good that your wife is supporting you through this process. To start, could you tell me a little more about your journey with your weight?
PATIENT: Um… journey. Right. It’s been… a long time. I’ve always been… bigger, I guess. But it’s gotten worse over the years. I work a lot, standing on my feet at the store… and honestly, I eat when I’m stressed. Which is… a lot. I don't really keep track of how much, or what exactly. It just… happens. I just know it’s gotten harder to do things. Harder to breathe, harder to walk... Stuff like that. I really don’t remember when it started getting this bad, though. Sorry. It's kinda fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s common for people to have difficulty pinpointing the exact timeline when discussing long-term health concerns. The important thing is that you've recognized this is impacting your quality of life and are seeking help. Could you tell me a bit more about the difficulties you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Well… Like I said, breathing gets short sometimes. Especially going up stairs. And my knees… they ache. A lot. Makes it hard to stand for long periods at work, even though I have to. I get tired really easily too. And… I get really hot, sweating a lot, even when it’s not that warm. My wife says I snore really loud, too. She has to sleep in the other room sometimes. Mostly, it’s just… everything feels like a lot of effort. Even simple things. And it makes me feel… down, sometimes. Not always, but… yeah.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Kochubey. Those are all very important things to know. It sounds like your weight is indeed impacting several aspects of your health and well-being. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… sometimes, yeah. Not all the time. Especially at the end of the day, after work. I figured it was just from standing so long. My wife has mentioned it a couple of times, said my shoes look tighter. I haven’t really paid much attention, to be honest. Is that… bad? I don’t really know what’s normal and what’s not.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re mentioning it. Swelling can be related to several things, and it’s something we want to investigate further. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. The doctor… a few years back, he said my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on a pill for it, but I… I don’t really remember taking it consistently. Honestly, I think I ran out and didn’t bother getting it refilled. And… I think he mentioned something about my cholesterol being a little off, too. But I don’t remember all the details. I haven’t really been to the doctor much lately. I don’t like going to the doctor, if I'm being honest. Does that make sense? It's all kinda a blur.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. It’s not uncommon to feel that way about doctor visits. And it's helpful to know that you were previously diagnosed with high blood pressure. We will need to check your current blood pressure and cholesterol levels today. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football. Had to get a cast. That was a long time ago. And… I had my tonsils out, I think. When I was little. But… that's about it. No major surgeries, no hospital stays that I can remember. Nothing recent, anyway. I think. My wife might know more, she’s got a better memory than me. But I haven’t really been sick enough to need anything serious. Not until now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or obesity?
PATIENT: Oh boy… family history. That’s a tough one. My dad… he had a heart attack when he was pretty young. And he was… a big guy. My mom, she had diabetes. She had to take shots every day. And… my brother, he’s also pretty heavy. He’s always trying different diets. I think my grandma had high blood pressure too, but honestly, I don’t really know. We weren’t really close. It seems like… a lot of us have problems with our weight and… things like heart problems and diabetes. It's kinda scary when you think about it.
DOCTOR: It is concerning, but knowing your family history is important. It helps us understand your risk factors. Now, could you tell me about your current medications?
PATIENT: Uh… like I said, I used to take a pill for my blood pressure, but I stopped taking it a while ago. I don’t take anything else regularly. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, especially after work, but that’s it. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that. I really don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. That’s pretty much it. I try to stay away from medication as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I mean, I get a little stuffy nose sometimes during pollen season, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. No food allergies, no skin allergies, nothing like that. I can eat pretty much anything. My wife always jokes that I have an iron stomach. But no, no allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kochubey, thank you for providing me with all of this information. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature – as well as listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… try not to poke too much, okay? I don't really like being poked and prodded, but I understand it's necessary. Just let me know what you're doing before you do it, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kochubey. I will explain everything as I go. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, and take a few deep breaths. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 160 over 95. We’ll need to monitor that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. I’m hearing some mild crackles in your lungs, which could indicate some fluid buildup. We’ll want to investigate that further. Now, let’s examine your abdomen. Your abdomen is a little tender, especially in the upper right area, and it feels slightly enlarged. Do you experience any pain in that area?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. It's kinda… a dull ache. It comes and goes, but it's been worse lately. Especially after I eat something heavy. I figured it was just indigestion, or something. My wife said it might be my gallbladder, but I didn't really pay much attention. It’s not excruciating pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a heavy feeling. Does that make sense? It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information, Mr. Kochubey. Tenderness in the upper right quadrant, especially after eating, could indeed be indicative of a gallbladder issue. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and liver function tests. We’ll also need to do an ultrasound of your abdomen to visualize your gallbladder and other organs. Based on what you've told me and my examination, and considering your family history, I would also like to refer you to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: More tests? A specialist? It's a lot, Doctor. I just… I want to get this sorted out. I want to be able to breathe easier, move around without hurting, you know? So, yeah. Okay. Do the tests. See the specialist. Whatever it takes. Just… please explain everything to me, okay? I don't want to be surprised by anything. And can my wife come with me to the appointments? She's better at remembering things than I am.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I promise to explain everything thoroughly. I understand it can be overwhelming, and having your wife with you is a wonderful idea. She is more than welcome at all appointments. I’m referring you to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly respected gastroenterologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, the lab results should be available within 24-48 hours. My nurse will call you with the results. For now, I recommend continuing to eat a healthy diet, avoiding fatty foods as much as possible, and getting moderate exercise if you are able. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or nausea, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening, for not making me feel like I’m crazy, and for taking this seriously. I appreciate it. And… thank you for letting my wife come with me. She’ll be relieved to hear all this. It’s just… been a long time coming, I guess. I hope we can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m glad I could help. It takes courage to seek medical attention, and I commend you for taking this step. We will work together to get to the bottom of this, and I am optimistic that we can find a solution. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. Have a good day, Mr. Kochubey, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: .
