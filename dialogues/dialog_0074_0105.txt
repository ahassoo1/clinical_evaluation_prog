DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here about getting surgery, I think? For… losing weight. My wife helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, I don’t remember all the details. It’s… a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be overwhelming, especially when it involves significant decisions like surgery. No need to worry about remembering everything at once. We'll take it step-by-step. So, you're considering weight loss surgery. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me a little bit about how long you've been thinking about this, and what led you to explore this option?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time, I guess. Years, probably. It’s… hard to say exactly. My wife has been worried about my health for a while now. I get tired easily, and… well, things just aren’t as easy as they used to be. Climbing stairs, playing with my grandkids… even just walking around the store at work is getting tough. That's probably why I’m here. She said something about it being a good option, and I trust her. I don’t really remember making the decision myself, to be honest. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like you've been experiencing some significant limitations in your daily life, and your wife is very supportive, which is wonderful. It’s not uncommon for patients to consider surgery when their quality of life is impacted this way. Before we discuss surgery specifically, let's get a better understanding of your overall health. Could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… right. Um… I don’t really have much of one, I don’t think. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time. Years. I usually just try to push through things. I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox, maybe? But nothing major. I don’t really remember any serious illnesses or operations. I’ve always been pretty healthy, until… well, until recently, I guess. I don’t take any medications regularly, either. Does that help? I'm really sorry I'm not more helpful. It's just... hard to recall.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It's very common for patients to have gaps in their medical history, especially if they haven't seen a doctor in a while. Don’t apologize at all. We’ll work with what we have. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Nobody ever told me I had any of those. I’ve never had to take medicine for anything like that. My wife sometimes checks my blood pressure at home, I think, but she never said anything was wrong. I honestly don't remember. It's frustrating, isn’t it? I feel like I'm letting you down by not knowing.
DOCTOR: You’re not letting me down at all, Mr. Kochubey. We’re just gathering information. It’s perfectly normal to not remember every detail, and your wife checking your blood pressure at home is helpful. Now, regarding your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My dad, he had… heart problems, I think. He died when I was pretty young, so I don’t really remember the details. My mom, she's still alive, but she's got arthritis, I think. And… maybe high blood pressure? It’s… again, it's fuzzy. We didn't really talk about health much when I was growing up. It wasn't really a thing. I'm sorry. I wish I could be more precise. It feels like my brain is just… empty when it comes to this stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. It's common for families to not discuss health details openly. Knowing about your father’s heart problems and your mother’s arthritis is helpful. We can always try to obtain more specific records later if needed. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't smoke, and I don't use any tobacco. My wife doesn’t either. We both try to be healthy in that regard. She’s really good about that sort of thing. I… I drink sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe a glass of wine on the weekends. Nothing crazy. But not every day, and not a lot. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. Occasional alcohol consumption is not a major concern. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Oh boy. That’s… a hard one. I work at a convenience store, so… there’s a lot of temptation around. I probably eat too much fast food. Burgers, fries, that sort of thing. My wife tries to get me to eat healthier, but it’s difficult. I like… comfort food, I guess you could say. Big portions. I snack a lot, too. Chips, cookies… whatever’s easy. I know it’s not good, but… it’s just… convenient. And I’m tired, so I don’t always have the energy to cook. I feel bad admitting this. I know I should be better.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s very common for people to struggle with their diet, especially with a busy lifestyle and readily available convenience foods. It's good that you're aware of it. We're not here to judge; we're just trying to understand your current habits so we can create a plan that works for you. Now, before we discuss potential surgical options, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. I just… hope it doesn’t take too long. I get a little anxious when doctors poke around. But… yeah, go ahead. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kochubey. We'll take things at your pace. I’ll explain everything as we go, and you can let me know if you feel uncomfortable at any time. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do detect a slightly elevated heart rate. Your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 150/90, which is elevated. Your pulse is 88. Now, I’ll quickly palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I note some fullness. Do you experience any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn't hurt, exactly. Just… feels a little full, like I’ve eaten too much. Which, usually, I have. It's comfortable, I guess. I mean, as comfortable as a full stomach can be. It feels… normal, unfortunately. Is that bad? Does that mean something's wrong? I worry a lot. My wife says I do.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s good you’re aware of how your body feels. The fullness is likely related to your dietary habits. I'm not necessarily concerned at this point, but it’s helpful information. Now, let's check your height and weight. Okay, your height is 155 centimeters, and your weight is 139 kilograms. That gives you a BMI of 58, which falls into the category of severe obesity. Finally, I’ll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Okay, that completes the physical exam. I’m going to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health, including your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. It's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could affect your suitability for surgery. Would you be able to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw?
PATIENT: Twelve hours… Yeah, I think so. My wife can help me with that. She’s good at keeping me on track. Is it a lot of blood? I don’t do well with needles, you know. I get… lightheaded. But… if it's important, I'll do it. I trust you, Doctor. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to prepare for. And… maybe I should sit down for it? Just in case.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good idea, Mr. Kochubey. We can definitely have you sit down during the blood draw, and a nurse will be there to assist you. It’s not a huge amount of blood, but we need several vials for the tests. Fasting is important, so please try not to eat or drink anything except water for 12 hours before the appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss potential surgical options in more detail and determine if you are a good candidate. We’ll also talk about the risks and benefits of each procedure. I want to ensure you have all the information you need to make an informed decision. In the meantime, I'm going to write up a referral for a consultation with a registered dietitian. They can help you develop a healthier eating plan, regardless of whether you decide to pursue surgery. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A dietitian… that would be helpful. My wife has been trying to get me to eat better for years, but… it’s hard. Maybe a professional could help. And… yeah, the surgery stuff. I’m still a little scared, to be honest. But… I want to feel better. I want to be able to play with my grandkids without getting tired. So… whatever you think is best. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It’s perfectly normal to feel scared. We'll take things one step at a time, and I'll be here to answer any questions you have along the way. I'm going to print out a list of instructions for the blood draw and the referral to the dietitian. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results of the blood work in about a week. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. A week… gives me time to think things over. And… to get used to the idea of needles. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate it. And… please, let me know if I can do anything to help. I know you’re busy, but… I want to make this as easy as possible for you.
DOCTOR: You're very kind, Mr. Kochubey. Just focus on following the instructions for the blood draw and attending your follow-up appointment. That's all I ask. I’ll see you next week. If you have any urgent concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and please give my best to your wife. .
