DOCTOR: Hi Lamark, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Just need a quick check-up for… well, a sports team tryout. Gotta make sure I’m not too old to be running around, I guess. Hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-participation physical for a sports tryout – that's perfectly reasonable. And 62 is certainly still active! To get a good picture of things, let's go through some questions. First, what sport are you trying out for, and how intense is the training usually?
PATIENT: Uh, it’s… Mongolian wrestling. Bukhuu. And intense? It’s pretty intense. Lots of grappling, pushing, lifting… you know, the usual. It’s not like running a marathon, but it takes a lot out of you, especially at my age.
DOCTOR: Right, Bukhuu. I'm familiar with it – very demanding, definitely more than just running. Okay, so let’s talk about you specifically. Have you been training consistently for this tryout?
PATIENT: Yeah, for a few months now. I’ve been going to a local training hall three times a week. Mostly technique, some strength work. Nothing crazy, I don’t want to pull a muscle before I even try out.
DOCTOR: Good, smart to ease into it. Now, have you had any injuries recently – even minor ones – while training or otherwise?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing serious. My shoulder’s been a little achy sometimes, after a particularly rough grappling session. Old age, probably. But nothing that’s stopped me from training, you know? Just a little soreness.
DOCTOR: Okay, shoulder soreness. We'll definitely take a look at that. And just to be thorough, have you had any problems with your heart or lungs – shortness of breath, chest pain, things like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I get a little winded sometimes, but that’s just… being 62. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit about twenty years ago. Haven’t had any trouble with my breathing since.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the smoking history, and that you haven't had breathing issues since quitting. Twenty years is excellent. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife used to make me try all sorts of things, but I was always fine. She’s… gone now, so I mostly just eat what I can manage. But no allergies, definitely.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife. That must be difficult. Okay, so no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Old-fashioned, I guess. Just a little ginseng sometimes, for energy. But that's it. Don't really believe in all that fancy medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, just a little ginseng. And lastly, before we move on to a quick physical exam, do you have any history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, never been diagnosed with any of those. Doctor always said I was healthy as a horse… back when I used to see a doctor, that is. Haven't been to one in… well, a long time. Hopefully, I still am.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. Alright, well, let's do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks good. We'll check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and take a look at your shoulder. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sounds fine. Get it over with, eh? The sooner I know if I’m too old for this, the better. Don’t want to waste anyone’s time.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice deep breath for me… and again… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs that I hear. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Now let's check your blood pressure… 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Feels a little… dizzy, maybe? Must be the excitement. Old age, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little dizziness is not uncommon with a quick position change, especially if you haven't been moving much. We'll take it slow. Now, let’s examine that shoulder. Can you point to where it's been bothering you?
PATIENT: Right here. It’s not constant, just… aches after a good wrestle, you know? And sometimes when I lift something heavy. It feels stiff. See? A little bit of pain there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel some tenderness here, at the front of your shoulder. And I notice a slight limitation in your range of motion, particularly with outward rotation. It doesn't seem to be acutely inflamed, but it does suggest some possible rotator cuff irritation or early arthritis. Now, I'm going to ask you to perform a few simple movements to assess the strength and stability of your shoulder. Can you lift your arm straight out to the side, like you're trying to hug someone?
PATIENT: It's… hard. Feels weak. Not as strong as it used to be. There. That's about as high as I can get it without too much pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And now, can you push your palm against the wall, like you're trying to resist someone pushing back?
PATIENT: It’s… not easy. I can feel it in my shoulder. It’s a little painful, but I can do it. It feels… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Alright, based on what you’ve told me and the quick physical exam, it seems like you’re experiencing some shoulder impingement or early rotator cuff tendinitis, potentially exacerbated by your wrestling training. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated as well, but not a cause for immediate concern. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on with your shoulder, I recommend getting an X-ray to rule out any bone issues. And I would like to discuss some strategies for managing your blood pressure – lifestyle changes and possibly medication if needed. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: X-ray, huh? Sounds… expensive. And medication? I really don’t want to take pills. What about just… resting it? Maybe slowing down my training? Can I just do that? I don't really want to spend a lot of money on tests if I can avoid it. And I'm not keen on taking more medicine. What do you think? Is it serious serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about tests and medication, and that’s perfectly reasonable. Rest and slowing down your training could help, and that's a good first step. However, without an X-ray, we can’t rule out other possibilities, like a small fracture or significant arthritis. Continuing to train aggressively with an undiagnosed issue could potentially worsen it and lead to more significant problems down the line. As for “serious serious”, it’s not an emergency. It doesn't sound like a dislocated shoulder or broken bone. But ignoring it or pushing through pain could lead to chronic pain and limit your ability to do the activities you enjoy. The X-ray will give us a definitive answer and help us create a proper treatment plan. It's relatively inexpensive, compared to the potential cost of long-term care if the condition worsens. I can give you a referral to a local imaging center. They often have payment plans or can work with insurance, even if you're uninsured. In the meantime, I recommend using ice on your shoulder for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, and avoiding any movements that cause pain. We can also explore some gentle range-of-motion exercises to maintain flexibility. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Ice, I can do. And gentle exercises… maybe. Okay. An X-ray… fine. But just one. And I don’t want any fancy, expensive treatments if it’s just a little bit of arthritis. Just tell me what I need to do to get back to wrestling, eh? And keep the costs down. You got a referral place you recommend?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. One X-ray to start, and we’ll go from there. No pressure for any fancy treatments. My goal is to get you back to wrestling safely and comfortably, and we’ll absolutely work within your budget. I recommend "Radiology Associates of the Rural Clinic," just down the street. They are very good, and they have a reputation for being patient-friendly and working with uninsured patients. I'll write you a referral slip. Here’s the slip, and a sheet outlining gentle shoulder exercises you can start. And here’s a list of things to watch out for - if your pain gets significantly worse, if you experience any numbness or tingling in your arm, or if you have trouble lifting your arm, please come back immediately. Once you have the X-ray results, schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we’ll discuss the findings and create a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s not too bad. I really want to get back to wrestling. I’ll go get that X-ray done. I think that’s all for now, right?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lamark. I understand your desire to get back to wrestling, and we’ll do everything we can to make that happen. And yes, that’s all for now. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and good luck with the X-ray. .
