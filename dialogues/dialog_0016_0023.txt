DOCTOR: Hi Aron, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my chest… it hurts a little. Not all the time, but sometimes. It’s… in my chest, you know? Like… where a woman would have… the milk things. But I’m a man. It just hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Chest pain can be concerning, so it's good you came in to get it checked out. And you’re right to point out it's not where you'd typically expect pain if you were a woman, but that doesn't make it any less important. Let's try to pinpoint exactly what this pain feels like. Can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Um… it’s not a sharp pain. More like… a heavy ache? Like… when you use your muscles too much. But I haven’t been doing much heavy work. It’s… hard to explain. Sometimes it feels like… a fullness? I don't know if that makes sense. And it's not always on the same side. Sometimes left, sometimes right.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy ache, sometimes a fullness, and it shifts around...left and right side. That is a bit tricky. And it's good you can tell me it's not a sharp pain; that helps narrow things down. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Not all the time. Like… maybe a few times a week? It’s worse when I… lay down, I think. And maybe after I… shower? Hot water… it feels more then. Not bad bad, just… more aware of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a few times a week, worse when lying down and after a hot shower. That’s helpful. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… nothing really makes it better. Maybe… if I just… don’t think about it? But that’s not really a fix, is it? Just… ignoring it. I try to move around. That doesn't help, but it doesn’t make it worse either, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no specific relief with movement, and ignoring it isn’t a solution, understandably. Just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Um… no. Not really. I feel… tired sometimes, but everyone feels tired, right? No… no bumps or… anything weird. Just the pain. And it’s… embarrassing to talk about, to be honest. It feels… wrong, a man having chest pain like that.
DOCTOR: I understand it can feel strange to talk about, especially when it’s not what you'd expect. It’s good you came in, and you're not alone in experiencing unusual symptoms. Chest pain is something we always take seriously, regardless of gender. Let's go through some standard questions just to be thorough. Do you have any history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. My family… my dad had problems with his legs, but not his heart. I’ve never been told I have high anything. I don’t really go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no family history of heart problems and you haven't been diagnosed with high blood pressure or cholesterol. Good to know. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. My wife… she used to, but she stopped years ago. I don't like the smell.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And what about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just a little sometimes. Maybe a beer with dinner on the weekend. Not much. My wife likes wine, she has a glass or two. But I don’t really drink much.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol use. And finally, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Um… no, not that I know of. I haven't had to take much medicine, thankfully. A little for a headache sometimes, but nothing special. I think I took some… antibiotics once, a long time ago for a cut, but I don’t remember feeling sick or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Aron, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your chest to see if I can identify anything specific that might be causing the pain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, rate is within normal limits. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Alright, now I’m going to feel your chest. Just tell me if anything hurts when I press here. There’s some tenderness to palpation here, on the left side. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache when I press. No obvious swelling or masses. Okay, Aron. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing costochondritis – inflammation of the cartilage that connects your ribs to your breastbone. It can cause chest pain that comes and goes, and is often worse with movement or pressure. It's not usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Costo… what-itis? Is that… bad? Like, does something need to be fixed? I’m not sure I understand. And… is it because I’m a man? Is that why I'm having chest pain?
DOCTOR: Costochondritis. It just means inflammation of the cartilage here – where your ribs connect to your breastbone. It’s a common cause of chest pain, and it’s usually not serious. It’s often caused by overuse, strain, or sometimes even a minor injury. And no, it's not because you’re a man. Anyone can get costochondritis – men, women, young, old. It just means your chest wall is a little irritated.
PATIENT: Okay… irritated. So it’s not… my heart? That's good. What can I do about it? Will it just… go away? I have work, you know? I’m a roofer. I need to be able to climb.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and a very important one, especially given your job. We always want to rule out more serious causes of chest pain first, and everything does point towards costochondritis right now. But to be absolutely sure, I'd like to order a chest X-ray just to rule out anything else. It's a quick and simple test. As for what you can do about it, it usually resolves on its own with time and rest. We can also try some things to help manage the pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce inflammation and pain. Heat packs or ice packs can also be helpful. And it’s important to avoid activities that aggravate the pain, if possible – but I understand that's difficult with your job. We can discuss some ways to modify your activities to minimize strain on your chest wall.
PATIENT: Okay. An X-ray… that sounds okay. I guess. I don’t like too many tests, but if you think it’s best. And ibuprofen… I think my wife has some. I’ll try that. Is there anything else? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The X-ray is just a precaution. And no, you shouldn't be worried. We've discussed the most likely cause, and it's usually not serious. However, there are a few things to watch out for. If you experience any new symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, or pain that radiates to your arm or jaw, you need to seek medical attention immediately. Those could indicate a more serious problem. Also, if the pain gets significantly worse despite treatment, let me know right away.
PATIENT: Okay. Shortness of breath… dizziness… I’ll remember that. That sounds… scary. My wife will help me. She’s good at remembering things. So, the X-ray… when can I do that? And… is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you have support. And yes, you can get the X-ray done at the imaging center across the street. I’ll send the order electronically to them now. You don’t need to do anything to prepare – just wear comfortable clothing and let the technician know if you’re pregnant or think you might be. Once they have the results, they’ll send them to me, and I’ll review them and let you know what we find. In the meantime, try the ibuprofen and see if that helps manage the pain. And I'll write you a note for work explaining your visit and recommending modified duty while we investigate this further.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything really clearly. And the note for work is a good idea. My boss… he can be… difficult. I think that’s everything. Is there anything you need from me before I go?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aron. I’m glad I could help. And yes, that note for work should help. No, I think we’ve covered everything for now. Just try to rest as much as possible, take the ibuprofen as directed, and keep an eye out for those symptoms we discussed. If you have any questions or concerns at all, don’t hesitate to call the office. I’ll be in touch as soon as I review the X-ray results. Get well soon, Aron.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Bye.
