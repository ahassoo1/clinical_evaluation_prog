DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in… how I smell, lately. My body odor, I guess. It’s different than usual, and it’s got me a little worried.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to be concerned about changes in your body, and it's good you brought it to my attention. Changes in body odor can sometimes indicate an underlying medical issue, so it's wise to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe what's different about the smell?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. It’s…hard to explain. It’s not just stronger, it’s… different. Sweeter, maybe? And a little bit…musty? It’s not like the usual sweat smell, that’s for sure. I always smelled… clean, you know? Normal. This is… not normal. I’ve tried different deodorants, even some stronger ones, but it doesn’t really help.
DOCTOR: Okay, “sweeter and a little musty” is helpful. And you’ve noticed this despite trying different deodorants. Has this change been sudden, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It wasn’t like one day it was there. More like… I started noticing it a few weeks ago, maybe a month? It got a little stronger each week, so I figured I just needed a better deodorant. But it hasn't gone away, even with trying a couple different brands.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this odor constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty constant, actually. It’s there all day, even if I haven’t been doing anything strenuous. It doesn't seem to be worse after exercise or anything like that, which is weird. Usually, I’d smell more after working, you know, laying floors and all. But this is… always there.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant odor, not related to activity. Have you noticed any other changes along with this – any changes in your skin, like rashes or irritation, or any unusual fatigue, weight loss, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No rashes or irritation, thankfully. And no weight loss, definitely not! If anything, I've been eating more lately. And I’m usually pretty tired after work, but that's normal. No extra fatigue, and I haven't been having night sweats or anything like that. Just this smell. It's just… unsettling. I don't want people to notice.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Purtee. It’s good that you haven’t noticed any other symptoms. Let’s go through some other routine questions to help me get a better picture. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I’ve never had an allergic reaction to a medication. I did have a bad reaction to a mosquito bite once, swelled up pretty bad, but that was just a mosquito bite! No true allergies, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just Medicare covers my usual stuff, nothing new. I take a multivitamin every day, and sometimes ibuprofen for aches after work, but that's it. No prescriptions, no herbal supplements, nothing regular besides those two things.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Now, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Let's see... I had pneumonia when I was younger, maybe in my twenties, but I recovered fully. And I had a gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy. No diabetes, no heart problems, no high blood pressure. I try to stay active, even with the work being physical. And I had a pretty normal delivery with my son, years ago. I don't think there's much else. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, pneumonia in your twenties, gallbladder removal ten years ago, and a normal delivery. Thank you. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some heart trouble later in life. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. And my son is healthy too. Nothing major on either side of the family, though. No cancer, no diabetes, nothing like that. Mostly just the usual aging stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Well, I'm divorced, been that way for about fifteen years. I live alone, and I work pretty much all the time laying floors. I don’t really have a lot of free time, honestly. I don’t smoke, never have. I drink maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not often. I don’t use any recreational drugs. Pretty simple life, really. Mostly just work and taking care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Ms. Purtee. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d also like to take a look at your skin to see if I notice anything unusual. It’s a routine check, just to rule out any obvious causes for the change in odor. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. I'm ready whenever you are. It's a little embarrassing, but I'd rather know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or irregularities. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Your skin looks normal overall, no rashes, lesions, or obvious signs of infection. I don’t see any unusual discoloration or anything that immediately stands out. However, I do notice a faint, slightly unusual odor on your skin, as you described. It's subtle, but present. Given your symptoms and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be something relatively benign, like a change in your body chemistry. However, we also need to rule out some less common causes. To do that, I'd like to order a few blood tests. These will help us check your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Blood tests are fine. Whatever it takes to figure this out, honestly. I'm just glad you're taking it seriously. It’s just… unsettling to feel like something is off, you know? So, yes, please, do the blood tests.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Purtee. It's always best to investigate when something feels off. Okay, I'm ordering a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These will give us a good baseline. The lab results should be back in a few days. I'll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I would also recommend avoiding any heavily scented soaps or deodorants, as these can sometimes mask symptoms and make it harder to diagnose the problem. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… when you say “a few days,” roughly how long? I’m just trying to manage my expectations. And is there anything I should be looking for in the meantime? Any symptoms that are new or getting worse that I should call about?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. “A few days” usually means 3-5 business days, but lab turnaround times can vary. I’ll expedite the order as much as possible. I will call you as soon as I have the results. As for what to look for, if you develop a fever, any unusual fatigue, weight loss, or any new skin rashes or lesions, please call the office immediately. Also, if the odor becomes significantly worse or is accompanied by any other symptoms, don’t hesitate to call. Otherwise, just continue with your usual routine and avoid heavily scented products. Do you have any other concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and not just dismiss it as… nothing. I feel a little better just knowing we’re looking into it. I’ll keep an eye out for those symptoms, and I’ll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Purtee. I understand your concern, and I'm glad I could help. It's important to me that all my patients feel heard and validated. Here's a summary of our plan: you’ll avoid heavily scented products, monitor for any new or worsening symptoms , and I will call you with the lab results in 3-5 business days. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, Ms. Purtee.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
