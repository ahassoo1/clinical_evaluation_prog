DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. The usual? Honestly, I don’t really keep track anymore. Been a while, hasn't it? Medicare said something about needing it done.
DOCTOR: “The usual,” is rather vague, Mr. Croonquist. And yes, it has been a while. According to the records, your last comprehensive metabolic panel was almost two years ago. We need to be more specific than “the usual” to ensure we're addressing your current health needs. Do you have any particular concerns you wanted to discuss today, or are you experiencing any new symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… no, not really. Just… old. Everything feels old, if that counts. I work at the plant, you know? Power plant. Lots of… things. But I feel alright. Honestly, I just want to get this over with so I can get back. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s not a problem, Mr. Croonquist, but “feeling old” isn’t a diagnosis. And working at a power plant does expose you to potential hazards. We need to rule out anything serious, regardless. To clarify, are you experiencing any pain, fatigue, changes in your appetite or weight, difficulty breathing, or any other new or unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: New symptoms… hmm. My hands ache sometimes, but that’s just from… well, everything. And I guess I haven’t been eating as much lately. Not really hungry. But I chalked that up to the heat, to be honest. August, you know? Makes you lose your appetite. Everything’s just… a little slower these days.
DOCTOR: “A little slower,” is also rather vague, Mr. Croonquist. Are you referring to your physical energy levels, your cognitive function, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, both, I suppose. Just… takes longer to get going in the morning. And I forget things easier. Names, mostly. Faces. Little things. Nothing important, I’m sure. Honestly, Doctor, is this going to take long? I've got a shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, I understand you are concerned about your work schedule, but dismissing potential health issues as simply “getting old” is not acceptable. Memory loss and decreased energy levels can be normal signs of aging, but they can also indicate more serious underlying problems. I need to perform a basic physical exam and order some blood work to properly evaluate your condition. It’s standard procedure, and it’s the best way to ensure your health and safety. We’ll start with your vital signs, then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment. Will that work for you?
PATIENT: Ugh. A neurological assessment? Look, I just need the lab work done for the plant. Is that all we can do? I don't understand why we have to go through all this. It's just a formality, right?
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, with all due respect, I am not here to simply rubber-stamp a request for lab work. My responsibility is to you and your health. The power plant requires these tests for a reason – to ensure you are physically and mentally capable of performing your job safely. A cursory exam does not fulfill that requirement, nor does it fulfill my ethical obligations as a physician. I understand your frustration, but I need to gather information to determine the best course of action. If you refuse a basic physical exam, I cannot in good conscience sign off on these lab requests. Now, are you willing to let me proceed, or would you prefer to seek another physician who will simply fulfill your request without proper evaluation?
PATIENT: … Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. But don't expect me to remember any of this.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s begin with your vital signs. Please remove your shoes and socks. I’ll take your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate first.
