DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I am Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's… muscle weakness, really. It's been getting worse for a few weeks now. It's just… harder to do things, you know? Lifting, even walking sometimes.
DOCTOR: "Muscle weakness…" Yes, I see. And how long precisely has this been progressing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably around the middle of July. Maybe the 15th? It was subtle at first, just feeling a little tired after normal stuff. But it’s definitely more noticeable now. I’d say it’s been steadily getting worse each week since then.
DOCTOR: Steadily worsening… alright. And can you describe where you’re experiencing this weakness?
PATIENT: Mostly in my legs, I think. Both of them, but my right one feels… weaker, if that makes sense. And it’s kinda creeping up into my arms now, too. Not as bad, but… yeah. It's not like I can’t use them, just… harder. It takes more effort.
DOCTOR: "Creeping up..." I see. And is this weakness accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I’ve been feeling more tired than usual, definitely. And… now that you mention it, my hands feel a little… numb sometimes. Not all the time, just… off and on. It’s hard to explain. Like when they’re cold, but not actually cold. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Numbness… Interesting. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… no, not really. Everything seems normal there. Sorry, that's a bit of a personal question, isn't it? No changes at all. I haven't noticed anything different, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Standard questions, Mr. McKinnon. Just trying to gather a complete picture. Now, any recent illnesses, infections, or injuries?
PATIENT: No, nothing recent. I had a cold, maybe a month ago, but that was it. Just a normal cold, cleared up quick. No injuries… I haven’t fallen or anything. I’m usually pretty careful. I haven’t been sick or hurt, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any significant medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing the doctors have ever told me about, anyway. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. High blood pressure maybe, a few years back, but it went down with diet and exercise. Nothing ongoing.
DOCTOR: Family history then. Are there any neurological conditions, muscle diseases, or similar problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a tough one. My… my father had some problems with his hands when he got older. Arthritis, I think. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… something with her nerves, maybe? It was a long time ago. I don't really remember the details. Nobody talked about it much. I’m not sure if that helps, really. It wasn’t anything major, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, before we proceed with a physical examination, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just… water and trying to eat right. That’s it. I don’t take anything regularly, no.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'd like to perform a brief neurological examination, if you don't mind. This will involve checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation. It shouldn't take long. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… alright. Yeah, let’s do it. I'll lie down on the table then. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat, and I’ll begin. I'm going to test your reflexes in your arms and legs. Relax your limbs as much as possible. First, let's start with your arms. Keep them relaxed, palms up.
PATIENT: Okay, palms up. I’m relaxed. Go ahead. This isn’t going to be… unpleasant, is it? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Hmm. 2+ bilaterally. Now your triceps. Also 2+ bilaterally. Now let’s check your legs. I will test your patellar and Achilles reflexes. Please keep your legs straight and relaxed.
PATIENT: Okay, straight and relaxed. I’m trying to stay still. Just let me know if I need to do something different. This is a little nerve-wracking.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes are 2+ on the left, but 1+ on the right. And Achilles reflexes are 2+ on the left, diminished to 1+ on the right. Now, I'd like you to squeeze my hands as hard as you can. I will resist.
PATIENT: Okay, squeezing. I’m squeezing as hard as I can. Is this enough? It feels… a little weak, honestly.
DOCTOR: Weakness noted in right hand grip. Now, please push against my hands with your feet. I'll provide resistance. Start with your right foot. Alright, and now your left foot.
PATIENT: Okay, pushing with my right foot. I’m pushing… it feels harder than it should. Okay, now my left foot. And now my left. I feel like my right side is weaker. Is that what you’re seeing?
DOCTOR: Mild weakness noted in right foot. Now, I’d like you to close your eyes, and tell me where I am touching your arms and legs. This will help me evaluate your sensation.
PATIENT: Okay, eyes closed. Go ahead. I'll try my best to tell you where you're touching me. Just let me know if I need to focus on a specific area.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Some diminished sensation in the right extremities. Alright. Based on this brief examination, there are some findings of mild weakness and diminished sensation on the right side. Now, to get a better understanding, I recommend some further testing. Specifically, I want to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. This will help rule out several possibilities. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An MRI? That sounds… serious. And expensive. What are we looking for, exactly? And is this something I should be really worried about? It's just… I don't have insurance. I'm a little… overwhelmed right now. What are my options?
DOCTOR: Mr. McKinnon, it is important to investigate these findings. The MRI will help us visualize your brain and spinal cord, looking for any abnormalities that could be causing your symptoms. It is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without it. As for the cost, I understand your concerns. I will have our financial counselor contact you to discuss potential options, including payment plans and possible assistance programs. We can also explore alternative, less expensive tests, though they may not provide as much information. Now, regarding your question about whether you should be worried, it is too early to say definitively. These findings could indicate a variety of issues, ranging from relatively benign to more serious conditions. That’s why the further testing is crucial. I do not want to alarm you, but we must rule out potential issues like nerve compression, multiple sclerosis, or even a structural abnormality. I recommend we proceed with the MRI, but I will also order the blood work as a first step. While we await results, I advise against any strenuous activity. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s a lot. Nerve compression… multiple sclerosis… I don’t… I don’t even know what to ask. Okay. Blood work first, that sounds… less scary. And the financial counselor, yes, please. I definitely need to know about costs. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood work? And how long will that take to get results? I just… I really don't want to wait too long. I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll write an order for a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel. You can have that done at the lab across the street. They accept walk-ins, but I recommend calling ahead to verify their hours and any specific preparation instructions. Typically, you'll need to fast for 8-12 hours prior to the test. Results usually take 24-48 hours. I will have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I'll also have the financial counselor reach out to discuss payment options. I understand your anxiety, Mr. McKinnon. We will do our best to expedite the process and provide you with answers as quickly as possible. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
