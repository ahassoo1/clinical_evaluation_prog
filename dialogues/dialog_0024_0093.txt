DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. Please tell me, in concise terms, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Doctor, is it? Mutnick. Look, honestly, it's… everything feels a bit off. Been sleeping alright, I suppose, but not good. And, well, getting older, isn’t it? Not what it used to be. I thought maybe… a tune-up, you could say. Like one of my instruments. Just… optimize things. Is that what this visit is for?
DOCTOR: "Optimize things," you say. A rather… vague description, Mr. Redfern. While I appreciate the… analogy, medicine is not quite instrument repair. Let’s attempt a more focused approach. You mention not feeling “good” despite adequate sleep. Can you elaborate on what feels off?
PATIENT: Ugh. See, this is what I mean. Elaborate… it's just… sluggish, I guess? Like I'm wading through mud. And tired, even with sleep. I don't… I don't really feel anything specific, you know? Just… not sharp. Not like I used to be. Honestly, I don't even know when I used to be, it's all a bit fuzzy these days. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: “Fuzzy,” “sluggish”… these are not particularly useful descriptors, Mr. Redfern. It appears you're experiencing a constellation of non-specific symptoms. Let’s attempt to categorize them. When did this “sluggishness” begin?
PATIENT: Categorize… right. Look, dates aren't my strong suit. Probably… after… well, after my wife, honestly. Everything kind of blurred together after that. A year? Maybe two? I really couldn’t say. It wasn’t sudden, more… a slow fade, like a poorly tuned violin losing its resonance. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: A year or two… following the loss of your wife. I see. While grief can manifest in various physical symptoms, we must rule out other potential causes. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. I eat. Sometimes. Not much of a cook, you see. Used to be my wife did all that. Weight… probably lost a bit. Clothes feel a little looser. Not actively trying to lose weight, just… not as hungry, I suppose. It’s not like I’m wasting away, though. Still a big fella, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Height 190 centimeters, weight 105 kilograms. That places your BMI at… acceptable, though trending towards the lower end of the healthy range. Have you experienced any difficulty with concentration, memory lapses, or changes in your mood?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re looking at numbers, are you? Well, numbers don't tell you everything, Doctor. Look, the memory… that's been a bit off, like I said. Fuzzy. Can’t recall things like I used to. Names, dates… appointments, sometimes. And the mood… well, what mood should I be in? It’s not exactly a party around here, is it?
DOCTOR: Right. Memory lapses and… a generally subdued mood. Have you noticed any fatigue beyond what one might expect given your circumstances?
PATIENT: Fatigue… is that different from just being… tired? Because, yes. Always tired. Even after a full night. It’s like… pushing through cotton wool, all the time. It's not a crash, you understand, just… persistent. Like a low hum you can't quite get rid of. It's just there.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Honestly, not really. A little bit of stiffness in the mornings, but that’s just getting old, isn’t it? Sometimes I get a little… winded, walking up the stairs. But I’ve always been a big fella, so that’s probably just… me. No headaches, no dizziness, no… anything dramatic. Just… this general feeling of being… off-key.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a basic physical examination. We will start with your vital signs, then I will listen to your heart and lungs. Please undress down to your waist and have a seat on the examination table. It will be a quick assessment.
PATIENT: Right. A quick assessment. Sounds sensible. Undress, you say? Very well. Hope I don’t smell of varnish. Spend all day around instruments, you see.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130/85. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Temperature is 36.8 degrees Celsius. Respiration rate is 16. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Examination unremarkable. Given your history and physical findings, I suspect you may be experiencing symptoms related to mild depression and/or chronic fatigue. However, to rule out other potential causes, I recommend a basic blood panel, including a complete blood count, thyroid stimulating hormone, and vitamin D levels. Would you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh. Right. Blood panel. Always more tests, isn't there? Depression… well, I wouldn't exactly call it a party around here, as I said. Chronic fatigue… sounds about right. Look, if it gets to the bottom of things… yes, alright. Do the tests. Might as well, I suppose. Just… try not to poke too much, alright? Don’t need a puncture on top of everything else.
DOCTOR: Very well. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw the samples. Please remain seated. I will review the results as soon as they are available, typically within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a regular sleep schedule, engaging in light exercise if you are able, and ensuring adequate hydration. We will discuss further treatment options once the test results are in. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Questions…? No, I don’t think so. Regular sleep, light exercise, hydration… sounds sensible, I suppose. Like tuning an instrument, really. Just… I hope it’s not anything too… complicated. I’m not good with complicated. .
DOCTOR: We will address whatever the findings may be. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly. Please let the front desk know if you experience any discomfort after the blood draw.
