DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you. Look, I ain't got all day, Doc. Just need a… a paper signed. Something 'bout gettin' somethin' done. A procedure, they call it. The young lady on the phone said you were the one to see. Don't rightly remember all the details, to be honest. It’s… cosmetic. That’s all I know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. I understand. It sounds like you may be referring to a procedure for skin tags or perhaps a mole removal. To ensure I have the correct information and can properly assist you, could you tell me a little more about where on your body this procedure would be performed?
PATIENT: Now hold on a minute. Skin tags? Moles? I don't know nothin' 'bout that! It’s… on my face. Yes, my face. Ain't nobody wantin' somethin' lookin'… unsightly on their face, now do they? Look, I just want the okay to go ahead and have it taken care of. Don't need a lecture 'bout blemishes, or whatever you call 'em.
DOCTOR: I certainly don’t intend to lecture you, Mr. Honcoop. It’s simply my responsibility to understand the specifics before authorizing any procedure. Could you describe this… area on your face?
PATIENT: Look, it's... a bump. A small bump. Been there a while, I reckon. Don’t bother me none, usually. But... well, a fella I work with said it looked… old. Made me think, you know? Don't want to look too old. That's all. It’s just… there. On my cheek, I suppose. Left side. Small, brown-ish…ish. Honestly, Doc, I don’t pay it much mind.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Honcoop. A small, brownish bump on your left cheek. To get a better understanding and determine the best course of action, would you mind if I took a quick look?
PATIENT: A look? You need to look? I told you what it is! What's lookin' gonna change? It's a bump, Doc. A harmless bump. But... alright. Fine. Look if you must. But be quick about it. I got things to do, you know. Important things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. I just want to take a moment to examine it myself. It's standard procedure, and it will only take a minute. Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I’ve had a look. It is as you described, a small, brownish bump on your left cheek. However, given its slightly irregular border and firm texture, I would like to get a closer look under magnification. It's a simple procedure and will help me determine if a biopsy is necessary to rule out anything concerning. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… biopsy? Now you're talkin' crazy, Doc. I came here for a signature, not a… a whatchamacallit. A biopsy sounds serious. I ain’t sick! I just want this little thing gone. Look, I don't trust all these fancy tests and procedures. Seems like you doctors just wanna poke and prod and find somethin' wrong so you can make more money. No. Absolutely not. Sign the paper and let me be.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your reluctance, and I assure you I am not trying to cause any unnecessary alarm or expense. However, as a physician, it’s my ethical responsibility to thoroughly assess any skin lesion, even if it appears minor. A biopsy is a very simple procedure where we take a small sample of the tissue and send it to a laboratory for analysis. It’s the only way to definitively determine what this bump is and if it requires any further treatment. While it may very well be benign, it's crucial to rule out any possibility of skin cancer. Skin cancer, especially if detected early, is highly treatable. I want to assure you I am committed to your well-being and will explain every step of the process. If we determine a biopsy isn't necessary, we can certainly discuss other options. However, proceeding without a proper assessment would be irresponsible on my part. Could we at least discuss the biopsy procedure in more detail so you can make an informed decision?
PATIENT: Skin… cancer? Now you're scaring me for nothin’. I told you, it's just a bump! Been there for years! You're tellin’ me it could be somethin' serious? Fine. Explain your… procedure. But don't expect me to like it. And I ain’t makin' any promises. Still think this is a waste of time, but… alright. Talk. But keep it simple, Doc. I don't understand all that fancy medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being open to discussing it, Mr. Honcoop. I understand your apprehension, and I promise to keep it as simple as possible. The biopsy procedure itself is very straightforward. First, I would clean the area around the bump with an antiseptic solution. Then, using a small, local anesthetic—a numbing medication—I would inject a small amount into the skin around the bump to ensure you feel no discomfort. Once the area is completely numb, I would use a specialized tool—it looks like a tiny cookie cutter—to remove a small sample of the tissue. The entire process typically takes less than 15 minutes. After the sample is collected, I would apply a small bandage to the area to stop any bleeding. We'll provide you with instructions on how to care for the wound to prevent infection. The sample will then be sent to a laboratory for analysis by a pathologist, a doctor who specializes in examining tissues. We typically receive the results within 5-7 business days. During the analysis, the pathologist will determine the type of cells present in the sample. If it’s benign—meaning it’s not cancerous—we can discuss options for removal, if you still desire that. If it’s determined to be cancerous, we can discuss appropriate treatment options based on the type and stage of the cancer. Does that make sense, Mr. Honcoop?
PATIENT: So… you poke me with a needle, cut out a piece of my face, send it off somewhere, and then call me back later? Sounds… unpleasant. And you’re sayin’ it could be… bad? Five to seven days… that's a long time to be worryin’ about somethin’ cuttin' outta my face. Look, I appreciate you explainin' it, Doc, but I still don’t like the sound of it. Is there… anything else we can do? Some kind of… cream, maybe? Or somethin’ to just… make it go away? I really don't want to get cut. And I definitely don't want to wait a week to find out if I got… what was it? Cancer?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Honcoop. It’s perfectly natural to feel apprehensive about any procedure, especially one that involves cutting. Unfortunately, with a lesion that has irregular borders and a firm texture, a cream or other topical treatment is unlikely to provide a definitive diagnosis or effective treatment. Creams are often useful for superficial lesions, but they don’t penetrate deep enough to assess the cells within a firmer bump like the one you have. Trying to treat it without a proper diagnosis could potentially delay appropriate treatment if it were to be something concerning. While the chances are good it’s benign, we need to rule out the possibility of skin cancer, and that requires a tissue sample. I can assure you, the biopsy itself is a relatively minor procedure, and we take every precaution to minimize discomfort and scarring. We'll provide you with detailed aftercare instructions to promote healing and prevent infection. Before we proceed, perhaps it would be helpful if I could document your concerns in your chart and consult with a dermatology specialist?
PATIENT: A specialist? Now you’re sendin’ me to another doctor? This is gettin' ridiculous. I came here for a simple signature, and now I’m lookin’ at needles, cuts, and consultin' with a whole team of people! Look, Doc, I’m an old man. I ain’t got time for all this. And honestly? I don’t feel comfortable lettin’ a bunch of doctors poke and prod at me. If you can't just sign the paper, then… then I guess I’ll just have to live with the bump. It's been there for years, hasn't bothered me none. Thank you for your time, Doc. But I think I’ve wasted enough of both our days.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration and respect your decision. I want to reiterate that my primary concern is your well-being, and I would never pressure you into undergoing a procedure you’re not comfortable with. However, I also have a professional responsibility to inform you of potential risks, and in this case, given the characteristics of the lesion, I strongly advise against proceeding without a proper diagnosis. I’m happy to document your refusal of the biopsy in your chart. If you change your mind at any time, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. I would be happy to discuss your concerns further. In the meantime, I recommend regularly monitoring the bump for any changes in size, shape, or color. If you notice anything unusual, please seek medical attention immediately. I wish you all the best, Mr. Honcoop.
