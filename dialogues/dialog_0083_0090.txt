DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe I’m here for… a check-up before that? It’s all a bit… hazy, truthfully. My husband usually handled these things, and… well, it’s been some time. I apologize if I seem a bit disorganized.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. It can be a lot to manage, especially with a planned surgery. We'll take things at your pace. Just to clarify, you are hoping to have a surgery – do you recall what type of surgery it is scheduled to be?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is the part I struggle with, I’m afraid. I think it’s… something to do with my face? To improve… how it looks? It was a long discussion with the specialist, and I was still… grieving, at the time. I remember wanting it, very much, but the specifics… they’ve slipped my mind. I do have paperwork somewhere, I assume, with all the details? Perhaps you have a record of it here? I truly apologize for this confusion.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Brightful. It’s quite common to feel overwhelmed, and we can certainly look everything up. Ah, yes. I see here you have a scheduled rhinoplasty with Dr. Ramirez on August 15th. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Rhinoplasty… yes! That sounds right. A nose job. Yes, that’s it. Thank you so much for finding that for me. I was beginning to feel quite foolish. Dr. Ramirez is… very good, I understand. I just… sometimes my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s good to have it confirmed. So, this is just a routine check-up before the surgery, to make sure I'm healthy enough, is that correct?
DOCTOR: Exactly. It's a standard pre-operative assessment to ensure you are in optimal condition for surgery and to minimize any potential risks. We'll review your medical history, do a physical exam, and potentially order some lab work, depending on your overall health. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Um… let’s see. I’ve always been… fairly healthy, I think. No major illnesses, thankfully. I had the usual childhood things – measles, mumps, rubella – but nothing serious. I haven’t been hospitalized, not since… well, not for anything significant. I do have some allergies, though. Mostly seasonal – pollen, dust… things like that. And I wore braces when I was younger. Oh, and I had my appendix removed when I was about ten, I believe. Is that enough for now? I feel like I’m forgetting something crucial…
DOCTOR: That's a very helpful start, Ms. Brightful. Don't worry about forgetting things; we'll get everything we need. Allergies and your appendix removal are good to know. We'll circle back if anything else comes to mind. Now, regarding those seasonal allergies – do they cause any significant problems, like difficulty breathing or a severe rash?
PATIENT: Not usually, thankfully. It’s mostly just… sneezing, a runny nose, itchy eyes. Nothing that requires medication, normally. I just try to stay indoors when the pollen count is high. Sometimes I get a bit of a headache, but that’s it, really. I’ve never had any… anaphylactic reactions, or anything like that. Just the typical, annoying allergy symptoms. My husband used to always make sure I had tissues and eye drops during allergy season. It’s silly, but I miss those little things.
DOCTOR: Those little things do matter, Ms. Brightful. It’s understandable to miss them. And it sounds like your allergies are generally well-managed. Good. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I was taking something for my blood pressure, a few years ago, but my doctor took me off of it. He said my numbers were good enough on their own. I don’t take anything regularly now, not that I can recall. I sometimes take ibuprofen for headaches, when they’re particularly bad, but that’s it. And… occasionally, a multivitamin, but very sporadically. I really try to eat a healthy diet, so I don’t think of it as essential. No herbal supplements, definitely. I’m a bit wary of those, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, no regular medications currently, just occasional ibuprofen and sporadic multivitamins. Now, could you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is… difficult. My family… we aren’t very forthcoming about health matters, traditionally. I know my mother had… some kind of heart condition, I believe. She passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t know many details. My father was generally healthy, I think, but he was a very private man. He smoked for many years, which concerned me, but he never seemed to get seriously ill. As for my siblings… I have a brother, but we haven’t spoken in years. I don’t know anything about his health, unfortunately. It’s not something we discuss. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Brightful. Family history can be difficult to obtain, and it's perfectly common to have limited information. We'll proceed with what you do know. Knowing about your mother's heart condition is helpful. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he used to smoke, but he quit years ago, thankfully. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I’ve always been very… cautious about those things. I prefer a quiet evening at home, with a good book.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Brightful. That’s very good to hear. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me about any previous surgeries you've had, besides your appendix removal?
PATIENT: Let me think… besides my appendix, I had… um. Oh! I had my tonsils removed when I was a teenager. It was quite common back then, I believe. And… I had a small mole removed from my back a few years ago, just as a precaution. The doctor said it wasn’t anything serious, but he wanted to be safe. Other than that… I don’t think I’ve had any other surgeries. No, I’m fairly certain. I tend to remember those things, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy and mole removal. Good to know. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your nose and throat, just to get a baseline before your surgery. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment completely. I suppose I should have worn a nicer blouse… it’s just a simple cotton one.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry about your blouse at all, Ms. Brightful. Simple cotton is perfectly fine. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 120/80. Now, I'm just going to take a quick look at your nose and throat. Please open your mouth for me. Nasal passages are clear. Throat appears healthy, no obvious signs of infection. Everything appears to be within normal limits. Which is excellent.
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. I’m glad everything looks good. So, what does this mean? Are there any further tests I need to take before the surgery? Or… is everything okay to proceed as planned?
DOCTOR: Based on the information you've provided and the physical exam, you appear to be a good candidate for surgery. However, as a standard precaution, I would like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. These tests will help us assess your overall health and ensure there are no underlying issues that could affect your recovery. It’s routine, and nothing to be concerned about. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. If it’s routine, and helps to ensure everything goes smoothly, then please do. I’d much rather be safe than sorry. Where would I go to have those tests done? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here's a lab requisition form. You can have these tests done at the lab located just across the street, at 123 Main Street. They accept your insurance. It usually takes about 24-48 hours for the results to come back. Once we have them, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and finalize the pre-operative preparations. Do you have any questions about the lab tests or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That sounds perfectly clear. Across the street, 24-48 hours… I’ll make an appointment first thing tomorrow morning. Thank you so much for your time, Doctor. And for being so patient with my… forgetfulness. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Brightful. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, don’t worry about the forgetfulness. It's perfectly normal, and we're here to help. Here's a copy of the lab requisition form for your records. Have a wonderful day, and we'll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Alanes. You as well. .
