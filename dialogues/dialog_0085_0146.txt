DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. McKinnon. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Thanks for having me. It's… muscle weakness, mostly. Been getting worse the last few weeks, and it's starting to make things difficult. I don’t really know how to explain it beyond that.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle weakness… and it’s been progressively worsening over the past few weeks. I understand that can be concerning. Can you tell me a little more about where you're experiencing this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. It started in my legs, I think. Like, just feeling a bit tired after walking, you know? Now it’s… well, it's in my arms too. Not all the time, but when I try to lift something, or even just hold something for a bit, it feels like they're going to give out. It’s mostly on both sides, if that makes sense. Not just one arm or one leg.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Both sides, starting in the legs and now in your arms as well. And it’s a feeling of giving out, or just fatigue with use?
PATIENT: It’s… both, I guess. Like, sometimes it's just really hard to even start lifting something, like there’s no power. Other times, I can start okay, but then it just… fades. Like the battery's running down. And yeah, fatigue is a good word for it too. Just… tired muscles, even after not doing much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a feeling of weakness with initiation and with sustained effort, with a sense of fatigue. Has this weakness been interfering with any of your daily activities?
PATIENT: Yeah, it has. I work as an insurance appraiser, mostly looking at car damage. That means a lot of walking around, bending, lifting things to get a good look. It’s getting harder to do that without getting completely wiped. And honestly, even simple things like carrying groceries are becoming a pain. I had to ask a neighbor to help me with a bag the other day. It's… embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand that’s frustrating and concerning, Mr. McKinnon. It sounds like it’s significantly impacting your work and daily life. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No, not really. No pain, thankfully. No numbness or tingling. No fever or anything like that. I have been feeling a bit more tired overall, just… generally run down, but I figured that was from working long hours. Oh! Actually… my hands have been shaking a little bit sometimes. Just a slight tremor, mostly when I’m trying to do something precise. It doesn’t happen all the time, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, numbness, or tingling, no fever. Increased general fatigue, and a tremor in your hands, particularly with precise movements. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed anything that makes the weakness better or worse?
PATIENT: Good question. Resting definitely helps. If I sit down and put my feet up for a bit, it eases up. Not completely gone, but better. And… honestly, I don’t think anything really makes it worse, specifically. It's just… consistently there, at varying levels. Like, it’s always a little bit weak, and then it fluctuates from there. I haven’t noticed anything I do that suddenly makes it flare up.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting provides some relief, and there doesn’t seem to be any specific activity that reliably worsens the symptoms. Now, let's go over some medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the flu a couple of years ago, and a bad sprained ankle when I was younger, but nothing major. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I don’t really go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. I try to stay healthy, you know? Mostly just eat reasonably well and try to get enough sleep. My mom had high blood pressure, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior major medical diagnoses, just a history of the flu and a sprained ankle, and your mother had high blood pressure. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had surgery. Not even a tonsillectomy or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Look, is this going to be a long process? I have a pretty busy schedule.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, that’s good to know. And I understand your concern about your schedule, Mr. McKinnon. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. To get a better idea of what's going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. We’ll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. It won’t be painful. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, that sounds… fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I just… I have a couple of appointments later today, and I really need to get back to work tomorrow. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I’m going to gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. This is perfectly normal and shouldn't hurt, but let me know if it does. Okay, reflexes are… a little diminished, but not absent. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that okay? It feels a little weak, honestly, but I’m trying.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, grip strength is… somewhat reduced bilaterally, meaning on both sides. And now, I'd like to check your muscle strength in your arms and legs. I'm going to ask you to push against my hands as I provide resistance. We'll start with your arms. Can you push against my hand like you're trying to straighten your elbow?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… harder than it should be, I think. I feel like I’m having to really concentrate to push.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, and now, let’s check your legs. Can you push your leg against my hand like you’re trying to straighten your knee?
PATIENT: Here. It’s… definitely harder than it used to be. My leg feels pretty tired already.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, thank you, Mr. McKinnon. That was helpful. Your muscle strength is reduced in both your arms and legs, and I noticed some diminished reflexes as well. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, it’s difficult to pinpoint a specific diagnosis at this point. There are several possibilities, ranging from vitamin deficiencies to neurological conditions. To help narrow down the cause, I’d like to order some blood tests. We'll check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and some markers that can indicate muscle inflammation. I also recommend an electromyography and nerve conduction study. This test measures the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves, and can help us determine if there's any nerve damage. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… what was the other thing? EMG and… nerve conduction? Look, is that going to be a long process? And… does it hurt? I really need to know. And how much is all this going to cost? I don’t have insurance, so… that’s a big concern. I just… I'm starting to get worried now. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. McKinnon, and it's completely valid to feel worried. The EMG and nerve conduction study involves inserting small needles into your muscles to record their electrical activity. There can be some mild discomfort, similar to a quick pinch, but it's generally well-tolerated. It usually takes about an hour. As for the cost, without insurance, the blood tests will likely be around $200-$300, and the EMG/nerve conduction study can range from $400-$600. I will have the billing department contact you with a more precise estimate. We can also discuss potential financial assistance programs available at the clinic. Based on your symptoms and the initial exam, it's too early to say definitively whether it's something serious. The tests will help us rule out several possibilities and determine the underlying cause. It could be something relatively minor, like a vitamin deficiency, or it could be something more complex. We need more information before we can make a diagnosis. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity that exacerbates your weakness. I’ll write you a note for work explaining the situation, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the test results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay. $600… that’s… a lot. But… I guess I don’t really have a choice, do I? I need to know what’s going on. And yeah, a note for work would be great. I'm already worried about losing my job. Okay, so blood tests and the EMG thing. And then follow-up appointment. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results. I don’t want to be left wondering. And I appreciate the note for work. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. McKinnon. I understand your concerns, and we will prioritize getting the results to you as quickly as possible. The lab usually takes 3-5 business days to process the blood tests, and the EMG results will be available shortly after the test is completed. My staff will contact you as soon as they’re available. I'll write the note for work now, and we’ll get the lab orders and EMG scheduled for you. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Thank you for coming in today. .
