DOCTOR: Hi Aeisha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply… I feel like I need a bit of a… reset. Or a jumpstart, perhaps. I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately, and I was hoping you could help me figure out what that means.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a “reset” or “jumpstart,” I understand. That’s a good way to put it. Can you tell me a little more about what “not feeling yourself” means?
PATIENT: It’s difficult to explain precisely. It’s not one specific thing. Just… a general lack of energy, I suppose. And I've been having trouble sleeping, even though I am tired. Little things feel harder than they used to. Like, remembering names, or focusing on a task. Nothing terribly serious, but enough to be… unsettling. I used to be very… vibrant, you see. And now… less so.
DOCTOR: Okay, a general lack of energy, trouble sleeping despite being tired, and some difficulty with memory and focus. That does sound unsettling. And you feel like this is a change from how you normally are?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. A definite change. I used to be able to juggle… well, a lot. Work, family, hobbies… everything felt manageable. Now, it’s like I’m wading through… something. It’s hard to describe. And it’s been going on for… oh, a couple of months, I’d say. Maybe three? It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when it started, it was gradual. I do apologize for being so vague, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Aeisha. It sounds like it was gradual, and those things are often hard to pinpoint. A couple of months of feeling this way… Okay. Let's try to get a little more specific. When you say “trouble sleeping,” are you having difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early?
PATIENT: It's mostly staying asleep, I think. I can fall asleep alright, usually. But then I wake up… several times during the night. And then it’s difficult to get back to sleep. I’ll lie there… just thinking. Sometimes for hours. It’s not every night, but often enough to feel very tired in the morning, even if I’ve been in bed for a reasonable amount of time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Waking up frequently during the night and struggling to fall back asleep. Okay. And when you wake up, what’s going through your mind?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. It varies, really. Sometimes it's just… worries. About family, about work. Nothing catastrophic, just the usual things. Other times… it's like my mind is racing, but I can't actually focus on any particular thought. Just a lot of… fragments. It’s frustrating. And then, of course, I start thinking about not being able to sleep, which makes it even worse. A bit of a vicious cycle, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Right, a vicious cycle. That’s very common with sleep issues. Okay. Let's broaden things a bit. Aside from the sleep and the fatigue, have you noticed any other changes in your body or how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My appetite hasn’t been quite the same. I’m not not hungry, exactly, but I don’t enjoy food as much as I used to. And… I’ve noticed I’m a little more irritable, I suppose. Not with anyone in particular, just… quicker to frustration. My husband has mentioned it a couple of times. He says I seem… preoccupied. And… oh, this may be nothing, but I’ve felt a bit… achey, generally. Just a dull sort of ache in my muscles, nothing specific. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all very helpful, Aeisha. Loss of appetite, increased irritability, and general muscle aches… Okay. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you had any recent illnesses, surgeries, or major life changes?
PATIENT: No major illnesses, thankfully. I had a bad cold last winter, but nothing serious. No surgeries, either. As for life changes… well, my daughter just started university last fall, which was a big adjustment, I suppose. It’s wonderful, of course, she’s always been a bright girl. But it is different, having an empty nest, even if it’s just temporary. And… work has been a bit more stressful lately, with a new project taking up a lot of time. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s definitely relevant. A big life change like your daughter starting university and increased work stress can absolutely contribute to how you're feeling. Okay. Before we move on to a physical exam, let's talk about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox… but nothing chronic. My doctor always said I had a strong constitution. I do have slightly high blood pressure, diagnosed about five years ago, but it's well-controlled with medication. Other than that… I’ve never had any serious health problems. I’m on Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Well-controlled high blood pressure is good. And Medicare is relevant for billing, yes. Now, any past surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve never had any surgeries. I’ve been very fortunate in that regard. My mother always said I had a low pain threshold, so I tended to avoid anything that required a procedure if at all possible. A bit silly, perhaps, but there you have it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Aeisha. And what about any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve been told I’m quite lucky in that regard as well. My husband does have several food allergies, so we’re always careful when we’re cooking, but I don’t have any restrictions myself. I can’t think of anything else, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, just the one for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And occasionally, an over-the-counter pain reliever, ibuprofen, if I have a headache. But that’s very infrequent, perhaps once or twice a month. I try to avoid it whenever possible. It doesn't seem to help much anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril 20mg daily and occasional ibuprofen. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, type 2, diagnosed later in life. And my father had heart disease. He had a stroke about ten years ago. My brother is healthy, as far as I know, but he doesn’t talk about his health much. My maternal grandmother had arthritis, quite severe. And… that’s about it, I think. Nothing else particularly significant that I’m aware of. It's difficult to know for sure, as my family isn’t very forthcoming about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis in the family. And finally, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I've never smoked a day in my life. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps a couple of times a week, but nothing excessive. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. My husband and I prefer a quiet evening at home to going out, truthfully. We enjoy gardening and reading. A very peaceful life, all in all.
DOCTOR: Okay. That gives me a good overview, Aeisha. Thank you for sharing all of that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a quick neurological exam. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary. I trust your judgment completely.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your blood pressure. 130 over 80. Not bad. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. And finally, I'm going to quickly check your cranial nerves. Follow my finger with your eyes... All good. Overall, your physical exam is fairly unremarkable. No obvious abnormalities. I do detect some mild tenderness to palpation in your upper back and shoulders, but that could be due to stress.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, in a way. Although, I suppose, I was hoping for a more definitive answer. The tenderness in my back and shoulders doesn’t surprise me, I do spend a lot of time hunched over my work. Still… it doesn’t explain everything, does it? The fatigue, the trouble sleeping… it feels like something more than just stress.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Aeisha. A normal physical exam doesn’t rule everything out. The tenderness could be a contributing factor, but it doesn’t explain all your symptoms. Given your fatigue, trouble sleeping, loss of appetite, and irritability, along with your family history of diabetes, I think it's prudent to run some blood tests. We’ll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a comprehensive metabolic panel, including a blood glucose test to rule out diabetes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. I completely agree. I would feel much better knowing for certain what’s going on. Blood tests are perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. Do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. We can schedule that for first thing tomorrow morning if that works for you. Once we have the results, which usually takes a couple of days, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to establish a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends, and engaging in some stress-reducing activities like yoga or meditation. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Fasting overnight is no problem at all. And I will certainly try to improve my sleep schedule and find some time for relaxation. It’s easier said than done, but I will make an effort. First thing tomorrow morning is fine. And thank you, Doctor. I already feel a little better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aeisha. I'm glad I could help. We'll get those tests scheduled. The lab is just down the hall, and the receptionist will give you the instructions for fasting. I'll have them fax the results to me as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And remember, it's important not to jump to conclusions. We'll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I feel much more optimistic now. Thank you again for your help. I look forward to hearing from you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aeisha. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. It was a pleasure meeting you. Get some rest, and I’ll see you tomorrow. Take care.
