DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bartok. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon to you too, Doctor. Well, they… someone told me I gotta have this check-up. For… the team. Yes, the team. I think it’s for the team. It’s… baseball, I believe. Or maybe softball? It’s hard to keep track these days. They just said I needed a look-see before I… play.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. A “look-see,” as you put it. And this “team”… is this a professional organization, or a recreational league?
PATIENT: Recreational, I think. Definitely not the big leagues. My nephew, he… he signed me up. Said it would be good for me. Keeps me active, you know? Though, honestly, I haven’t been very active lately. More… watching. A lot of watching. But it's a nice thought, I suppose. He's a good kid, that nephew. A little pushy, maybe.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a recreational league. And you are being encouraged to participate despite… a lack of current activity. Very well. Let’s proceed with a basic examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Examination, yes. Sounds good. What exactly does this… involve? I don't like surprises, Doctor. And I'm not very flexible, if you were wondering. Old bones, you see. They creak a bit. I hope it won't take too long. I have… appointments later. Though I can't recall what they are exactly.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard check-up, Mr. Bartok. I will listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and briefly examine your abdomen. Nothing… strenuous. We’ll need to take your height and weight as well. Please, step onto the scale. And try to stand still. This won’t take all day.
PATIENT: Scale, alright. I hope this thing is accurate. I haven’t weighed myself in… well, a long time. It's probably not a good number. Everything's bigger these days, you know? Food, cars... even people. Is that right? That seems… a bit high. Are you sure that's correct, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The scale appears to be functioning correctly, Mr. Bartok. 124 pounds. And your height is… 160 centimeters. That puts your BMI at… well, let’s not dwell on that at present. Now, please step off the scale and we will proceed with the blood pressure reading. Arm out, please.
PATIENT: Blood pressure, right. I always get nervous around these things. Makes it go up, you know? I read somewhere that thinking about it raises it. So, now I'm extra nervous. Is there a way to… relax? Maybe a nice cup of tea? No, wait. That would make it worse, wouldn't it? Oh dear. Just get it over with, I suppose.
DOCTOR: 138 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, if you'll just take a deep breath… and exhale. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds. Have you had any recent coughs or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Coughs? Shortness of breath? Hmm… Now that you mention it… maybe a little. Just when I walk up hills. Or… stairs. Or… if it's windy. It's probably nothing. Just old age, I figure. I don't remember having a bad cough, though. A little tickle sometimes. But everyone gets a tickle, don't they? Especially in the winter. Is that… bad, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: A persistent cough, even a mild one, warrants attention. And diminished breath sounds are… concerning. Do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Asthma… bronchitis… pneumonia… Oh, goodness. That's… a long time ago. My mother had something… I think it was bronchitis. Bad coughing, she had. I was just a boy then. I think I had a fever once, a long time ago. But pneumonia… I don’t think so. No, definitely not pneumonia. I remember being… healthy as a horse when I was younger. Always running around. But that was… a long, long time ago. Everything's blurry now. Honestly, Doctor, I can't rightly say. It was… decades.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… Oh! I have these. These are for… well, for general health. My nephew said I should take them. Boost the immune system, he said. They don’t seem to be doing much, though. Besides those… no. Nothing else. I used to take something for… my stomach, I think. Years ago. But I stopped. It didn’t really help. I mostly just try to eat healthy. Though, as I said, I can't quite remember what appointments I have later today. It's frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… Well, I get a bit of a sniffle in the spring, sometimes. Pollen, I think. My nephew says it’s pollen. And… I think I broke out in a rash once, a long time ago, after eating… shrimp? Maybe. Or lobster. Something shellfish, I'm pretty sure. But it was just a little rash, nothing serious. It went away on its own. I don't really think I have any bad allergies, though. I eat pretty much everything. Unless it's spoiled, of course. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Bartok, based on what you've told me – and frankly, it’s not a great deal – I recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying pulmonary issues. Your diminished breath sounds are concerning, and your history is… vague, to say the least. I’ll write you a referral to the imaging center. And I suggest you try to recall any further medical history you may have forgotten. It would be helpful. Do you understand?
PATIENT: X-ray? Oh dear. Is something… wrong? I thought it was just a check-up for the team! I don’t like X-rays. Are they… dangerous? And I told you, I can’t remember much! It was decades ago. Do I have to get an X-ray? Maybe it’s just… a little bit of dust? I was helping my nephew with some construction work last week. Lots of dust… Honestly, Doctor, I think I'm alright. I just need a good night’s sleep. I don’t understand why I need an X-ray.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your apprehension, but it’s standard procedure to investigate concerning findings. Diminished breath sounds warrant further investigation. It's a precautionary measure. I am recommending this to ensure your wellbeing, not to cause you distress. The X-ray will provide valuable information. Refusing it will only delay proper diagnosis. I will write the referral. The imaging center is located at… . Please schedule the appointment as soon as possible. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Alright. An X-ray, then. Just what I needed. More appointments. And I still don’t remember what the other ones are. No, I don't think so. That’s… all, I suppose. Unless… Oh! Could you… write down the address for me? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. And I wouldn’t want to get lost. Honestly, it’s just one thing after another these days. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you. I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. I expect you to schedule that appointment promptly, Mr. Bartok. And if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or high fever, go to the emergency room immediately. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Emergency room? Oh dear. It's all so much. Yes, alright. Thank you, Doctor. .
