DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Meigs. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you. It’s my back. It’s been really bad lately. Worse than usual, and… well, you know why I’m here, right? About the… the other thing? It feels connected, I think.
DOCTOR: Connected, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… it’s not just an old back acting up. It feels…different this time. I had pain before, of course, but it wasn’t this kind of pain. It’s…sharp. And it goes down my leg now. Not all the way, but…enough to bother me. Do you…understand? I don’t know how to explain it good.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I understand. “Sharp” pain radiating down the leg… we’ll get to the bottom of it. Let's start with a proper history. You’ve experienced back pain before – for how long, precisely, and can you quantify the severity on a scale of one to ten, one being minimal discomfort and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I’ve had back trouble… probably since I was in my twenties. Just aches, mostly. From working, you know? Lifting things. But the really bad pain… maybe five years now? It comes and goes. And…ten being the worst… right now, I’d say… a seven, maybe an eight when I try to stand up straight. It’s hard to say exactly. It makes me breathe funny, too, sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Breathes funny”...vague, but noted. Seven to eight, intermittent, exacerbated by standing. And you attribute this to…lifting at work?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. I work at the factory, packing boxes. Lots of bending and twisting. And… well, it’s not easy work. But this pain… this new pain… it started about a month ago, I think. It didn’t start with the lifting, if that makes sense. It started… just a dull ache, and then got sharper and sharper. I didn’t think much of it at first, thought I just pulled something, but it hasn’t gone away. It’s…scaring me a little.
DOCTOR: "Scaring you..." Understandable. We need to rule out anything serious. I see here you have a history of… several visits for musculoskeletal complaints. Have you had any imaging – X-rays, MRIs, anything of that nature – performed on your back?
PATIENT: Yes, I had an X-ray about two years ago. The doctor said it was just a little arthritis, normal wear and tear. And… I had a scan, a big one, when they found… the cancer. That was last year. They looked at my bones then, but didn’t say anything about my back being bad then, just… other places. I don’t know if that scan showed my back good, though. It was a lot going on. Do you see that on here? About the scan?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Meigs, I see the report from last year's scan. It does indicate evaluation of the bony structures, but… it was primarily focused on… other areas, as you stated. We’ll need to review the complete images to be certain. Now, let’s move onto your current medications and allergies, if you don’t mind. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: Yes. I take something for the… the cancer. A pill. It's a small white one. And I take a painkiller sometimes, when it hurts too much. Just ibuprofen, over the counter. Nothing special. And… no allergies. I can eat anything. I don't have problems with medicine. The doctor gave me that one time, the shot, to see if I was allergic to something, and I wasn’t. Does that help? What kind of help does knowing what I’m taking do? I just want to know if my back pain is…connected to the other thing, you know? Is it getting worse?
DOCTOR: "Connected..." Ms. Meigs, I appreciate your concern, but we must proceed systematically. The medication you take for the cancer, and the ibuprofen… noted. Now, before we get ahead of ourselves, let me perform a quick physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table, and we’ll begin. This will help me assess the range of motion and identify any specific areas of tenderness. This is standard procedure.
PATIENT: Okay. All right. If you tell me what you’re doing first, that would be good. I don’t like surprises, if that’s okay. And… be gentle, please. My back is really sore today. Just tell me if it's going to hurt a lot.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will explain each step before I perform it. We'll start with palpation – gently feeling your spine and surrounding muscles to identify any areas of tenderness or inflammation. Then, I will assess your range of motion – asking you to bend, twist, and extend your back. I will also perform a neurological exam to check your reflexes and muscle strength in your legs. It shouldn’t be excessively painful, but if you experience any sharp or radiating pain, please inform me immediately. Now, if you’ll lie face down, please.
PATIENT: Okay. I’m laying down. Be careful. It hurts when you push on my back, even just a little. And… my legs feel funny sometimes. Not weak, exactly, just…tingly. Mostly at night. Do you need me to move my legs or anything? I don't know what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: "Tingly" legs… noted. We're assessing for nerve impingement. Now, can you tell me specifically where you feel the pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ow! Right there! And… it goes around a little bit, to the side. Not just right on the bone. It’s…a deep ache, when you press there. And it makes my leg tingle a little bit more. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain, it’s not a sharp pain, just… a bad ache. And… please be gentle, Doctor. It really hurts.
DOCTOR: Right lumbar region, deep ache radiating with tingling sensation… noted. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I will gently tap on your knee and ankle with this small hammer. This is routine, Ms. Meigs. If you feel any pain, please let me know.
PATIENT: Okay. I'm trying to relax. But it makes me nervous when you tap with that thing. It feels like when the doctor checks if you’re sick, but I’m not sick. Just… nervous. Do I need to move my legs? Are you going to ask me to lift them up? Because it hurts to lift them up, a little. It’s not a lot of pain, just… discomfort. Can you tell me what you’re looking for? What do reflexes tell you?
DOCTOR: Reflexes indicate the function of your nerves. Reduced reflexes can suggest nerve compression or damage. Now, your reflexes are… diminished bilaterally, but more pronounced on the right side. Now, can you lift your right leg while keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Ow! That hurts. I can’t lift it very high. It feels like it's pulling on my back. And… it tingles a lot when I try to lift it. I can lift my other leg a little bit better, but it still hurts, just not as much. Does that… mean something bad? Is it connected to the other thing, the cancer? I’m really scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, please. We need to remain calm. Your diminished reflexes and pain with leg elevation could indicate nerve impingement, but many factors can contribute to this. We need imaging—a more detailed MRI—to determine the exact cause of your symptoms. As for the "other thing," it is premature to definitively link this back pain to the cancer at this stage. However, given your history, we will proceed cautiously. I’m ordering an MRI of your lumbar spine and will have my assistant schedule you for an appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any further questions right now?
PATIENT: An MRI… okay. But… how long will that take? And… will it show if it’s… spread? To my back? I just want to know what’s happening, you know? I don't want to keep guessing and worrying. And… what if it is bad? What then? What do you do if it’s… gone to my back? Please just… tell me honestly. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, I understand your anxiety. The MRI will take approximately 30-45 minutes. As for your other questions, I cannot provide definitive answers without the imaging results. Speculating is unhelpful and frankly, unethical. If, and this is a big if, the imaging reveals concerning findings, we will discuss all treatment options available, including referral to oncology and potentially other specialists. Right now, we need to focus on obtaining the MRI. My assistant will provide you with instructions regarding preparation and scheduling. I believe that is all for today. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you experience any sudden changes in your condition.
