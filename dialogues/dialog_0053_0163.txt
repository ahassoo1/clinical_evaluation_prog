DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you. Well, it’s rather… embarrassing, to be frank. I’ve been attempting a new diet, shall we say, and I thought it best to have a professional opinion before I… continue much further. It’s one of these rather extreme things, you see, and I'm not entirely certain it's sensible.
DOCTOR: An extreme diet, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, quite. It’s called the… well, the “Sunlight Diet,” I believe. The principle is rather simple, actually – one subsists almost entirely on sunlight and very minimal supplemental fluids. A rather eccentric young man convinced me it would “recharge the cellular batteries,” as he put it. I’ve been at it for… eleven days now. Eleven days, precisely. Though, I confess, I did have a small biscuit yesterday.
DOCTOR: Eleven days… relying almost entirely on sunlight. And a biscuit. Right. Mr. Vantine, with all due respect, that sounds… profoundly unwise. Before we get into the specifics, could you tell me exactly what this entails?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s rather meticulous, actually. The young man – name of Alistair Finch – insisted on precise timings. Six hours of direct sunlight exposure, broken into three two-hour sessions. No cloud cover allowed, naturally. And apparently, one must visualize the energy being absorbed into the… solar plexus, he called it. It's all quite New Age, really. As for fluids, he recommends a single glass of water with a squeeze of lemon each day. He claims it assists in “conducting” the solar energy. I thought it sounded a bit… fanciful, but he had a very convincing manner, and I do enjoy a good experiment.
DOCTOR: I see. And what have you been feeling during these eleven days?
PATIENT: Well, initially, a rather pleasant lightness, I must admit. A sort of… invigorating sensation. But that has rather faded. Now, I'm experiencing a persistent headache, a good deal of fatigue – more than usual for my age, certainly – and a rather alarming bout of dizziness this morning. I also find myself… somewhat irritable, though that is not entirely novel. My appetite, naturally, is almost entirely absent, which, while expected, is becoming a bit… disconcerting. And I seem to be perpetually cold, despite the summer heat.
DOCTOR: Right. And before you started this “Sunlight Diet”, were you on any other dietary restrictions, or experiencing any of these symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. My diet was… rather conventional, I suppose. A good deal of fish, vegetables, the occasional roast. I’ve always been rather fond of a good pudding, but I refrain from it excessively. And no, I wasn't experiencing any of these symptoms beforehand. The headache, fatigue, and coldness all appeared within the last few days, coinciding with the… intensification of the diet, you might say. I did notice a slight reduction in my usual energy levels in the days before starting, but I attributed that to the weather. It was rather damp, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, with all due respect, this is not a healthy experiment. Sunlight provides Vitamin D, which is beneficial, but it is not a substitute for food and adequate hydration. You're experiencing symptoms consistent with malnutrition and dehydration. I need to ask some further questions. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, that is a rather delicate subject, isn’t it? Indeed, I have. There has been… a significant reduction in frequency, naturally. And what has been produced… is rather… solid. A rather unpleasant experience, to be frank. I attributed it to the lack of… bulk, I suppose. I haven’t consumed much of anything to produce anything, if you understand my meaning. It’s been… a concern, naturally, but I was hoping it would resolve itself.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you been monitoring your weight at all during these eleven days?
PATIENT: I have, Doctor. I always keep a rather precise record, you see. I weigh myself each morning, promptly after rising. I’ve lost… seven and a half pounds. Seven and a half pounds in eleven days. Which, while seemingly a dramatic reduction, Alistair Finch assured me was entirely normal. He claimed it was merely… “toxin release.” I must confess, it did seem a rather rapid rate of loss, even for me. I'm typically quite… stable in my weight.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, with all due respect, Alistair Finch is clearly not a qualified medical professional. You are experiencing significant weight loss, dehydration, and likely electrolyte imbalances. This is dangerous. We need to run some tests to assess the extent of the damage. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a urine analysis. And I need you to stop this diet immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly. I confess, I was beginning to suspect as much. I simply… enjoy a good intellectual challenge, and Alistair Finch presented a rather compelling argument. But you are quite right. Seven and a half pounds is rather excessive. I will cease the diet immediately. And, of course, I shall cooperate fully with the tests. What exactly does this entail? And... will I require hospitalization?
DOCTOR: The tests are relatively simple, Mr. Vantine. Just a blood draw and a urine sample. As for hospitalization… not at this stage, if we catch this early enough. We’ll review the results, and based on those, we’ll determine the best course of action. Likely, it will involve rehydration and a carefully managed reintroduction of food. But we need those results first. Nurse Davies will be in shortly to draw your blood. And please, no more “intellectual challenges” involving starvation. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Perfectly understood, Doctor. No more “challenges,” as you put it. I shall stick to my fish and vegetables, and perhaps indulge in a small pudding from time to time. Nurse Davies, you say? Very good. I trust she is… proficient with a needle? I confess, I am not particularly fond of them. But I shall endure, for the sake of my health, naturally. And thank you, Doctor, for your… frank assessment. It is most appreciated.
DOCTOR: Nurse Davies is excellent, Mr. Vantine. And you're welcome. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see. Please, just try to rest until the nurse arrives. And if you feel dizzy or faint, let her know immediately.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. I shall do precisely that. Thank you once again.
