DOCTOR: Right, Deloris Wrye. 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, it’s about…a letter. For a pet, you see. A little…paperwork thing. My niece needs it, for her landlord. I don’t rightly recall why she needs it, but she said I needed to come here. It's something about owning a… what was it now? A chihuahua, I think. A tiny one. Honestly, these young people and their…animals.
DOCTOR: <stage>I sigh, tapping a pen against the chart. A letter?
PATIENT: Yes, a letter! It's for…emotional support. That’s what she called it. Something about needing to have the little dog with her, even though the building doesn't allow pets. I just need you to write something saying I…approve? Or something. I really don’t follow all this newfangled nonsense. I’ve had pets before, perfectly normal ones, and no one ever needed a letter. It’s a bit ridiculous, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right. An emotional support animal. Well, I suppose there are… protocols for these things. Do you see this chihuahua regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Hmm… Not exactly. My niece lives in the city, you see, and I'm...well, I'm out here. We talk on the phone, sometimes. She sends pictures. It’s a very…small dog. A bit yappy, if I’m being honest. Does that count as 'seeing' it? I suppose I’ve seen pictures of it, dozens of them. It’s always dressed up in little outfits. Honestly, it’s a bit much. But she seems happy.
DOCTOR: <stage>I tap my pen again, a little harder this time. Pictures don’t really count, do they?
PATIENT: Well, I don't know what counts anymore, dear! Everything is different these days. She says it helps with her…anxiety. Apparently, having a tiny dog run around is very calming. I’m not one to question it, really. She's a grown woman. I just…don’t understand why I need to be involved. Surely, her therapist could write something? I didn't even meet the dog! This whole thing feels…odd.
DOCTOR: Well, legally, an emotional support animal requires a relationship with a healthcare provider. I understand your niece's therapist could write a letter, but she's asked you, her aunt, to be involved. And frankly, I’m not sure I can ethically write something stating a patient-provider relationship when… you haven't actually seen the animal, or assessed your niece’s need for it. Do you have any idea why she specifically asked you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Healthcare provider? I haven't been a provider of anything since…well, a long time ago. Honestly, she just called and said I needed to come get a letter. Something about needing my… “official confirmation.” She can be very persuasive, my niece. Always was. She said something about me always being the calm one in the family, so she thought I’d be a good person to vouch for her. It's probably because she knows I won't say no to her. Really, I just want to get this over with so she'll stop asking. I don't understand all this paperwork, I just want to help her out. Is there something else I need to do?
DOCTOR: Well, I'm very hesitant to provide a letter in this situation. It goes against medical best practices to attest to something I haven't personally assessed. It could create legal issues for both of us, really. I can, however, document that your niece requested a letter for emotional support, and that you’ve declined to provide one due to a lack of a patient-provider relationship and lack of assessment. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Document it? You mean just…write it down? That sounds…reasonable. I suppose that’s better than nothing. And it gets her off my back. Yes, please. Write that I came in, and you said I couldn’t write a letter because I haven’t actually seen the dog or anything. And I don't know anything about her anxiety, or whatever it is. Just…write it all down. Honestly, the whole thing is just silly. A tiny dog… it’s not going to solve anyone’s problems.
DOCTOR: “Patient, Deloris Wrye, presented today with a request for documentation supporting an emotional support animal for her niece. Patient reports niece requested letter for housing purposes. Patient states she has not personally assessed niece’s need for an emotional support animal, has no established patient-provider relationship with niece, and has not observed niece with the animal in question. Due to these factors, patient declined to provide documentation. Discussed ethical concerns and best practices with patient. Patient understands and agrees to documentation of this encounter.” Is that an accurate reflection of the conversation?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that sounds… perfectly accurate. A bit long, perhaps, but accurate. All those big words… Honestly. Yes, that's what happened. Just write it down, and let's be done with it. I have a luncheon to get to, you know. And I need to find my good hat. Really, this whole thing has been rather… stressful. Thank you for not just handing me a blank piece of paper. I appreciate your…caution.
DOCTOR: Alright, here you are. This details our conversation. It’s important you keep this for your records. And I understand your frustration. I’m glad we could come to a reasonable solution. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, dear, I think that’s everything. Thank you. Really. Just…getting this all sorted. I’ll be going now. And honestly, I still think it's ridiculous. A tiny dog and a letter… the world is changing too fast.
DOCTOR: Have a good day, Deloris. And enjoy your luncheon. .
