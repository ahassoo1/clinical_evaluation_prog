DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It's good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s about my skin. It’s… discolored. Not a nice color, really. It’s quite bothersome, and my husband insisted I come get it checked. He worries too much, if you ask me, but better safe than sorry, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Discolored” can mean a number of things, of course. Can you describe the discoloration for me?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not like a rash, or anything. It’s… patches, really. Sort of a brownish hue. Not a deep brown, but noticeable. And it’s mostly on my arms and chest. Though, I think I’m seeing a little bit on my face now, too. It’s subtle, of course. I have very fair skin, so things show easily. It just doesn’t look…right. And it wasn't there a month ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, patches of brownish discoloration on your arms and chest, appearing within the last month, with possible spread to the face. And you say you have fair skin. Has this discoloration changed in size or shape at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It has gotten a bit bigger. Not dramatically, mind you. But if I really look, especially in good light, I can definitely see it’s… expanded. It’s not itchy, or painful, or anything like that. Just… there. And growing, however slowly. Honestly, it’s probably nothing. My grandmother had similar things, age spots she called them. But my husband… well, he's very cautious.
DOCTOR: I see. And your grandmother's "age spots" – did she ever have them medically evaluated?
PATIENT: No, she didn't. Honestly, she barely went to the doctor for anything. Stubborn woman. She just… ignored them. Said they were a sign of a life well-lived. Which is a lovely thought, I suppose. But I'm not sure I want to rely on that as a diagnosis. Though, she lived to be 95, so… perhaps ignoring things is the answer? Still, it's better to be certain.
DOCTOR: While a long life is certainly a positive sign, it doesn’t necessarily preclude a medical evaluation. It's good you are getting this checked out. Now, Ms. Bartock, let’s move on to some other questions. Have you noticed any other changes to your skin recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Nothing else. It's just the discoloration. No bumps, no itching, no dryness, no peeling, nothing like that. Though… now that you mention it, my skin does feel a little more sensitive to the sun lately. I always wear sunscreen, of course, but I seem to be burning a bit faster. A very slight pinkness, nothing alarming. But it's something I’ve noticed in the past few weeks.
DOCTOR: Increased sun sensitivity is worth noting. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, infections, or fevers?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Perfectly healthy, as far as I know. I had a cold last winter, but that was months ago. And I get my yearly flu shot, always. I’m very careful about these things. I wouldn’t want to be laid up in bed. It’s… disruptive. And my husband would fuss something terrible. Honestly, he worries more than I do about everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just my blood pressure medication. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. I’ve been on it for about five years. And I take a multivitamin every day. Nothing else, really. Though… I did try a new hand cream last month. Lavender scented, from a little shop downtown. But I stopped using it a couple of weeks ago when I noticed it didn’t seem to be doing much. I doubt that could be causing anything, though. Just a bit of a waste of money, really.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril and a multivitamin. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My husband always asks, of course, because he's so cautious. But I can eat shellfish, I’ve had penicillin… everything. I pride myself on having a strong constitution. Honestly, I think he worries too much about everything. It’s… tiring. Still, better safe than sorry, I suppose. Though, I really don't think it's anything serious. It's probably just… something that happens with age.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let's talk about your family history. Are there any instances of skin cancer, or other skin conditions, in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had some moles removed, years ago. Just a few, nothing dramatic. She didn’t have skin cancer, as far as I know. My father… he had some sort of rash when he was a child, but it cleared up on its own. Honestly, my family isn’t very forthcoming about their medical history. It's… a bit of a sensitive topic. My mother was very private, and my father… well, he wasn’t one for talking about these things. So, I don’t really have much information. I doubt it's relevant, though. It’s probably just… nothing. Still, I suppose it’s good to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. Thank you for providing that information. Now, if you'll permit me, I’d like to take a closer look at the discoloration. Please have a seat on the examination table, and we'll begin. I’ll need you to change into a gown, and we’ll start with an examination of your arms and chest.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. I suppose a closer look is necessary. It’s just… I do dislike changing in these little rooms. It’s rather…drafty, usually. Still, if you think it’s necessary. I'll be right back. Just let me know when you’re ready. And, please, do try to be quick. I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I will be as efficient as possible. I’ll just be here preparing. Take your time. I will let you know when I’m ready.
