DOCTOR: Good morning, Margret. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Well, I have been… how you say… wheezing. It makes it hard to breathe sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, “wheezing,” and difficulty breathing… that’s good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when it started… let me think. It was maybe… two, three weeks ago? It began slowly. I thought it was just a little cough at first. But then the wheezing came. It is worse when I walk fast, or when it is very hot.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started gradually about two to three weeks ago, beginning as a cough and then progressing to wheezing. And it seems to be aggravated by exertion—walking quickly—and heat. Do you notice it at any other times?
PATIENT: Not really… not any other times. It is better when I am resting. And it does not bother me when I sleep. Usually. Sometimes, if I have been walking a lot during the day, it will start a little when I lie down. But not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s better with rest and doesn’t usually bother you at night, but can occasionally start when lying down after a busy day. That gives me a little more to work with. Now, when you say “wheezing,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh… how to explain? It is like… a whistling sound. When I breathe out, there is this whoosh noise. And it feels tight in my chest. Not painful, just… constricted. Like something is squeezing. It makes me stop and catch my breath sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, a whistling sound on exhale with a tight, constricted feeling in your chest. That definitely sounds concerning. Have you had anything like this happen before, Margret?
PATIENT: No, never before. I have been very healthy, usually. A little arthritis in my knees, but nothing like this breathing trouble. I have never had this… wheezing before. It is new.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know it's new. Let's talk about any other symptoms. Have you had a cough along with the wheezing?
PATIENT: Yes, I did have a cough. At the beginning, like I said. It was dry, mostly. Not much… you know… phlegm. It has gotten better now. Mostly just the wheezing bothers me now. Sometimes a little tickle in my throat, but not a bad cough.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dry cough that’s improving, leaving mostly the wheezing and a slight throat tickle. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not at all. And no chills. I feel… normal, really. Except for the breathing. No aches or pains, just this tightness in my chest when I wheeze. I have been eating and sleeping alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or body aches, and your appetite and sleep haven't been affected. That's good. Now, let's briefly go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, never. The doctors always said my lungs were very strong. I used to walk a lot in the mountains in Bhutan. They said I had very good breathing. No asthma, no… what you call it… bronchitis? Nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of asthma or other lung conditions. That’s helpful. Have you ever had pneumonia, or been hospitalized for breathing problems?
PATIENT: No, never been in the hospital for breathing. And no pneumonia. I have been very lucky, usually. Just a few colds over the years. Nothing serious. I try to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees. For the arthritis. It is called… glucosamine. And chondroitin, I think? I take one tablet every morning. That is all. No other pills, no creams, nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, just glucosamine and chondroitin for your knees. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can eat anything. And I have never had a bad reaction to any medicine. My daughter always asks, but I always say no. I am very lucky that way, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s excellent. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – had asthma, COPD, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. My mother, she had a little cough sometimes when she was old. But nothing serious. And my brother, he smoked a lot when he was young, but I don’t think he had any… lung problems. No one that I know of, really. It is not something we talked about much in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant family history of lung conditions. Finally, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I live alone now. My husband passed away many years ago. I try to stay active. I walk most days, but not as far as I used to. I do some gardening. I like to cook. I eat healthy foods, mostly vegetables and rice. I do not smoke. I never have. And I only drink a little wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. You live alone, stay active, eat a healthy diet, and don’t smoke or drink excessively. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Please, go ahead. I hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me... and out... again... and out. I'm hearing some wheezing on both sides of your chest, particularly when you exhale. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little bit low, but not critically so. Your pulse is 88 beats per minute, which is slightly elevated. Your chest sounds clear to percussion, which means there's no fluid buildup. Overall, the exam is consistent with some airway obstruction causing the wheezing, but we need to rule out other potential causes. It's likely something is irritating your airways.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That does not sound very good. What does that mean, Doctor? What could be irritating my airways? Is it serious? I am a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Margret. Let's not jump to conclusions yet. “Irritating your airways” can mean a lot of things, and it doesn’t necessarily mean something serious. It could be a few different possibilities. The most common causes of wheezing include allergies, a recent cold or viral infection, or sometimes, exposure to irritants like dust or pollution. Less commonly, it could be a sign of something like asthma, even if you haven’t had symptoms before. It's also possible, though less likely given your history, that there’s some mild inflammation in your airways. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any infections or other problems. I’d also like to do a simple test called spirometry, where you blow into a tube to measure how much air you can exhale and how quickly. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. An X-ray and a test… alright. I trust you, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to be able to breathe normally again. Will the test be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Margret. I understand wanting to breathe normally again, and we’ll work towards that. The spirometry test is not uncomfortable at all. It just involves taking a deep breath and blowing as hard and as long as you can into a tube. A technician will guide you through it, and it takes only a few minutes. You might feel a little lightheaded afterwards, but it’s usually very mild. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw some blood for a basic allergy panel as well. It's just to see if there are any common allergens that might be contributing to your symptoms. Once we have the results of the X-ray, spirometry, and blood tests, we can make a proper diagnosis and come up with a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any potential irritants, such as dust or strong smells. Would you be able to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, I can avoid dust and smells. I keep my house very clean. And I don’t use strong chemicals. That is not a problem. The nurse will draw blood? Oh dear. I do not like needles. But… if it will help me breathe, I will try.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Margret. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. The nurse is very skilled and gentle, and it will be quick. We’ll have you lie down if you prefer, and she can distract you while she takes the blood. It’s just a small sample, and it will give us valuable information. Alright, I’ll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology department. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and explain the next steps. I’ll also have her schedule you for the chest X-ray and spirometry test. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Worsening breath, chest pain, or fever… go to emergency room. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind and… thorough. I feel a little better knowing we are trying to find out what is wrong. I will wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Margret. I’m glad I could reassure you a bit. It's my job to be thorough and make sure we’re doing everything we can to get you feeling better. Please don't hesitate to let me know if any questions come to mind while you wait. And again, if anything changes—especially if your breathing worsens—don’t hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, just relax and take it easy. .
