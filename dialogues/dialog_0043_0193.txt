DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Kalinski. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… a bit embarrassing, actually. I have… a lot of gas. More than usual. It’s been happening for, oh, I would say, almost a month now. It’s just… excessive, you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Goodstein. There’s no need to be embarrassed. Digestive issues are quite common, and we can certainly explore what might be causing this. “Excessive gas” is a good starting point. To help me understand the situation better, could you describe the gas a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, it’s not painful, thankfully. More… disruptive. And the smell… sometimes it's quite strong, if I’m being honest. It happens throughout the day, really. After meals, definitely, but also just… randomly. I haven’t changed my diet much, I don’t think. I eat mostly simple things. Soup, bread, sometimes a little chicken. Nothing too fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, “disruptive” and not painful is good to know. And the odor is something we can consider. You mentioned it happens throughout the day, after meals and randomly, and you haven’t noticed any significant dietary changes. Could you tell me approximately how many times a day you’d say this is occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. Let me think… on a good day, maybe six or seven times? But on a bad day… perhaps ten or twelve? It really varies. It’s… it’s hard to go anywhere, Doctor. I feel very self-conscious.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open, Mr. Goodstein. Six to twelve times a day is certainly a significant increase. And I appreciate you sharing how it's affecting your daily life. To get a better picture, let's delve into a bit more detail about your typical diet. You mentioned soup, bread, and chicken. Could you describe a typical day’s meals for me, starting with breakfast?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, breakfast is usually quite simple. A bowl of oatmeal, with a little bit of sugar. And a cup of tea. Nothing special. Lunch… that depends. Sometimes I have a small bowl of chicken soup. Other times, just a slice of bread with a little cheese. And then dinner is often the same as lunch, maybe a bit more chicken. Or… sometimes just a piece of fruit. I try to eat healthy, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. Oatmeal, tea, soup, bread, chicken, and fruit. Sounds like a fairly bland diet, which is good. Now, have you noticed any specific foods that seem to worsen the gas, even within those generally simple meals?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Hmm… well, I think the bread sometimes makes it worse. Especially if it’s… a darker bread, like rye. But it’s hard to say for sure. It happens regardless, really. But yes, perhaps the darker bread. And sometimes, the fruit… apples, I think. They seem to cause a little… extra disturbance.
DOCTOR: Okay, rye bread and apples are potential triggers. Now, let’s move on to some other questions. Have you experienced any other digestive symptoms along with the gas?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, yes. Sometimes, I feel a little bloated. Not always, but often after eating. And… occasionally, a little cramping. But it’s not severe. Just… uncomfortable. And… my stomach sometimes gurgles a lot. It’s rather embarrassing to explain.
DOCTOR: Not at all embarrassing, Mr. Goodstein. It’s helpful information. Bloating, occasional cramping, and stomach gurgling are all relevant. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, actually. I… I go to the bathroom more often than I used to. Not diarrhea, exactly, but… looser stools. And… more frequently. Perhaps two or three times a day, where I used to go only once.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency of looser stools. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I don’t think so. I had a little trouble with my heart a few years ago, but that was sorted out. Nothing serious, the doctor said. And… I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that’s all. I’m on Medicare, if that helps. Otherwise, I’m generally quite healthy.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And to clarify, the heart trouble was addressed and resolved?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. It was a small arrhythmia, they said. I had some tests, and they put me on a medication for a short time. It cleared up after a few months, and I haven’t had any problems since. The doctor said I didn’t need to take any medication anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything, as far as I know. I can eat anything, and I’ve taken many medications over the years without any problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. I don’t take anything regularly. Just… occasionally, if I have a headache, I might take a little aspirin. But that’s it. I try to avoid medications whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to live a very clean and healthy life.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or colon cancer, in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult question, Doctor. My mother had some stomach problems when she was older, but I don’t know what exactly. She never went to the doctor much. And my father… he was generally quite healthy. I don’t recall anyone in my family having anything serious like Crohn’s disease or colon cancer. But my aunt… she had some issues with bloating, I think. But I’m not sure. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to her.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing what you recall. That gives me something to work with. Now, Mr. Goodstein, based on what you've told me – the excessive gas, bloating, loose stools, occasional cramping, and changes in your diet and bowel habits – it sounds like we’re dealing with a possible case of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. However, it's important to rule out other potential causes first. Would you be amenable to a physical examination?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If you think that’s necessary, I’m happy to have an examination. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel better, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I appreciate your trust, Mr. Goodstein. Let's start with listening to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. I’m going to listen in a few different areas to check for any unusual sounds. Afterwards, I’ll gently palpate your abdomen to check for tenderness or any masses. I'll also check your reflexes. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Okay, I’m listening now… sounds are a bit… hyperactive, but no immediate signs of obstruction. Now, gentle pressure… any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That doesn’t hurt. A little uncomfortable, perhaps, but not painful. Here… no, not there either. Just… a bit of pressure, like you said. It’s… hard to explain. Everything feels a little… unsettled, you see. But not specifically painful in any one spot.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Unsettled” is a good way to describe it. No significant masses or tenderness. Your reflexes are normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs just to ensure everything is stable, given your history of arrhythmia. Heart sounds are regular and lungs are clear. Based on the exam, everything appears stable and within normal limits. To further investigate, I would like to order a stool sample test to check for any infections or inflammation. We may also consider a blood test to rule out celiac disease or other underlying conditions. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. If those tests will help determine what’s wrong, I’m happy to have them done. A stool sample and a blood test… I can manage that. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll give you the instructions for the stool sample collection. It’s a fairly straightforward process. You’ll need to collect a small sample in the provided container and bring it to the lab within 24 hours. I’ll also write a requisition for the blood test. You can have that done at any lab, but I can provide a list of convenient locations nearby. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend keeping a food diary to track what you eat and any associated symptoms. It may help us identify potential triggers. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That all sounds very clear. A food diary, stool sample, and blood test. I can do all of that. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns. It’s… embarrassing to talk about, you see. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. It’s my job to listen and help you feel better, and there’s absolutely no need to be embarrassed. Digestive issues are quite common, and we’ll work together to find a solution. If you have any questions or concerns arise before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here are the instructions for the tests and the list of local labs. I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
