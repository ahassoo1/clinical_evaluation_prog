DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is good to meet you too. I have… problem with my ear. Some liquid is coming out. It is not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Liquid coming from your ear isn’t ideal, you’re right. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It started… maybe three days ago? I wake up and see it on pillow. It is… clear. Not blood. Not… thick. Just water, almost. I try to clean it, but it keep coming.
DOCTOR: Alright, three days ago, clear fluid, like water, and it’s happening while you sleep. That helps. Has there been any pain with it?
PATIENT: No, no pain. That is good thing, yes? Sometimes… feel little bit full in ear. Like when airplane take off. But no sharp pain. And I can still hear. Not so good maybe, but I hear.
DOCTOR: That is good that there's no pain. The fullness you describe, like when an airplane takes off, is also helpful to know. And you haven't noticed any changes in your hearing besides it being a bit muffled?
PATIENT: No, not much change. Maybe little… quieter. But I am old man. Maybe just getting old, yes? I not hear so good like when I young. But this… this is new. The liquid. That is new thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're aware of what's normal for you, and that the liquid is new. Okay, let's take a quick look at your ear. It will just be a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is good. I let you look. Is okay. I hope you find what is wrong. Is… bothering me a little. Not much, but is there.
DOCTOR: Okay… I see some clear fluid in the ear canal, as you described. The eardrum itself looks intact, but it's a little cloudy. I don’t see any signs of infection or a ruptured eardrum, which is good. It looks like you might have a small effusion – a bit of fluid build-up – in your middle ear. Do you have any allergies, or have you had any recent colds, or sinus infections?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know. I never have trouble with flowers or anything. And… colds. I had little cold maybe two weeks ago. Not bad, just… sniffle. And cough little bit. But I get those sometimes. It is summer, is hot and cold. Maybe that? Sinus… I do not know what is sinus. Doctor told me once I have… something in nose. But I forget now. Is long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, a mild cold about two weeks ago, and a history of something in your nose in the past. That's helpful. And just to be sure, are you currently taking any medications, or have you had any ear surgeries or problems in the past?
PATIENT: No medicines. Just… sometimes I take something for my knee. Is old injury. And… no surgery on my ear. Never. No problems before this. Is new thing, like I say. Just this liquid. I hope is not serious. I need my ears. I am teacher. I must hear students.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Radillo. Being a teacher, your hearing is very important. It doesn’t sound like anything immediately serious, but we should figure out what’s going on. Given the history of a recent cold and the fluid build-up, it’s likely this is related to a bit of fluid in your middle ear. It sometimes happens after a cold, especially as we get older. I’m going to recommend a course of decongestant and a nasal steroid spray. It will help to dry things up in your nose and ears. We'll also monitor it closely. If it doesn't improve within a week, or if you develop any pain, fever, or significant hearing loss, please come back to see me right away. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sound good, Doctor. Decongestant and spray. I can do that. One week you say? And if pain, or fever, I come back. Is good. Thank you. You are very helpful. Can you write down the names for me? My memory is… not so good, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Radillo. Absolutely. Here you go. This is a decongestant, pseudoephedrine, take it three times a day for five days. And this is a nasal steroid spray, Fluticasone, two sprays in each nostril once a day. I've also written down some instructions on how to use the spray. I also want to give you a note for your work, just explaining you may have some mild hearing difficulty for a few days. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Very kind. I see the names. Pseudo… and Fluti… I can read that. And note for work, is good. Maybe students will understand. Um… no, I think that is all. Just… thank you again. You make me feel better. I hope is just… cold. And not something bad. I will follow your instructions.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. It very well could be just a lingering effect of the cold, and we're taking good care of it. Don’t hesitate to come back if anything changes, or if you're not feeling better within a week. Get well soon, and have a good day.
