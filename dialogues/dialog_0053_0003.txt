DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Doyle Pitmon, Internal Medicine. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, can we just get this over with? It’s… a tremor. My hand shakes. Been happening for a while now, honestly. Not sure why I'm even here, the wife – God rest her soul – always said I should just toughen up. But the grandkids insisted.
DOCTOR: Right. A tremor. “Been happening for a while” isn’t terribly specific, Mr. Baide. But alright. Let’s try to be a little more precise, shall we?
PATIENT: Precise? What do you want, a calendar entry? It… comes and goes. Worse when I’m trying to, you know, do something. Like… holding a fork. Or trying to sign a check. It’s just annoying, really. I used to have steady hands. Directed whole films, you know. Steady as a rock. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing” is rarely the case, Mr. Baide, though I appreciate your… optimism. When did you first notice this tremor?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Honestly? Years. Maybe… five, six years ago? It started small, I didn't even pay attention. Thought I was just tired. I was always busy, you know? Filming, editing… always something. It's gotten worse lately, that's why I'm here, if you must know. But I still think it's just old age.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean? Everything changes when you get old! My knees ache, I forget where I put my glasses, the news is depressing… What specifically are you asking about? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I’m asking about any new medications, any recent illnesses, any changes in your diet or exercise routine. Anything at all that might be contributing to this. It's important to rule things out, Mr. Baide. And it helps me understand the bigger picture.
PATIENT: Medicare covers my pills, whatever they are. The usual, I suppose. High blood pressure, cholesterol… the things old men get. Haven't been sick. Just… tired. And I don’t exercise. Never have. Always preferred being behind the camera, telling other people what to do. As for diet... I eat. What does that tell you? Honestly, this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam, then. I’m going to check your reflexes, coordination, and look at your hands a bit more closely. It won't take long. Could you extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. And be gentle, will you? My arthritis is acting up today. Honestly, this whole thing is… unnecessary. I’ve lived a long life. A good life. A shaky hand isn't going to change that.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is a tremor present, as you've noted, and a slight rigidity. Your reflexes seem a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Can you try to tap your finger to your nose repeatedly, with your eyes open, and then with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: There. Happy? Now with my eyes closed. See? This is pointless. I’m not a lab rat. What’s this going to prove, anyway?
DOCTOR: It helps me assess your coordination and rule out other potential causes, Mr. Baide. It’s not about proving anything, it’s about gathering information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I told you, I'm tired! And my knees ache. Is that enough? Honestly, you doctors always want a list. I feel… normal. Except for the shaking. And the aches. And the tiredness. And… Now that you mention it, maybe a little bit slower thinking sometimes. But that's just age, right? It's just… getting old. .
DOCTOR: “Slower thinking”… can you elaborate on that?
