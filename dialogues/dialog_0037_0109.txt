DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. To start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… my head hurts. Back of the head. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache. Is that… okay to say?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, “dull ache” is a very good way to describe it. Three days, coming and going… alright. Can you tell me a little more about when it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It’s worse when I… when I stand up too fast. Or if I bend over to pick something up. And… and when I’ve been working. I still do a little work at the rail yard, you know? Not like before, but… helps me keep busy. But after a few hours, the ache comes back. When I sit still, it's not so bad. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be related to activity, particularly standing, bending, and work at the rail yard. And relieved with rest. That gives us a good starting point. Is there anything else that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Well… the heat makes it worse. We’ve been having some hot days, you know? Makes my head feel… heavy. And… drinking water helps a little. Not much, but a little. I try to drink plenty of water. My wife… she always told me to drink plenty of water. She knew best. But no, not much else makes it better or worse, I think. Just the heat and… resting.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it's good you’re mindful of staying hydrated, especially with the heat. You mentioned it feels heavy... is that heaviness accompanied by any other sensations?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… sometimes it feels like… pressure. Like a tight band around my head. Not a sharp pain, just… pressure. And… sometimes, when it's really bad, everything looks a little blurry for a few seconds. But that doesn't happen often. Just sometimes, when I stand up too fast, like I said. And… no, that's it, I think. No dizziness, no… nothing else. Just pressure and blurriness sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure and occasional blurriness with standing. No dizziness. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently, other than this temporary blurriness?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. I always have to have my glasses for reading, you know. Been needing them for a long time. But no, nothing different with my glasses lately. Everything looks… normal, when I have them on. Except for that blurriness when I stand up, but that goes away quick. I see the doctor for my eyes every year, regular. He says I just need stronger glasses every few years, normal for an old man like me.
DOCTOR: That's good that you keep up with your eye exams. And you mentioned needing glasses for reading—has that need changed recently, or have you noticed any difficulty with other types of vision, like distance vision?
PATIENT: No, no change to the reading glasses. They still work fine. Distance vision… well, I don’t do much distance seeing these days. Mostly I’m inside, reading or watching the television. But when I go outside to the garden… things look okay. Maybe a little blurry without the glasses, but that's always been the case. I don't drive anymore, you see. Not for many years. So, no, no changes to my distance vision. Just the reading, and needing the glasses for that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high a few years back. He gave me some pills to take, but… I stopped taking them. Didn’t feel good, you know? Made me tired. So, I just watch what I eat, try to stay active. Nothing else, really. No diabetes, no heart problems. Just the blood pressure, and I don't take the pills anymore. I go to the doctor every year for a check-up, regular. He always tells me to watch my salt. But I like salt, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re generally mindful of your health, and that you see a doctor regularly. And it’s important to address why you stopped taking the blood pressure medication. We can discuss that later. For now, let's move on to past surgeries or hospitalizations. Have you ever had any surgeries or been in the hospital for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! When I was a young man, maybe sixty years ago, I broke my arm. Fell off a roof. They fixed it right up, though. That's the only surgery I’ve ever had. And… no hospital stays, except for that. Maybe a few times when my children were little, they caught something. I had to take them to the hospital, but I never stayed overnight. Nothing else. Never had any serious illnesses, you know? Just… a few colds, a few aches and pains. Old man stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm many years ago, and no other surgeries or significant hospitalizations. Now, regarding your family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she died when she was old, from… I think it was her heart. Something with her heart, I think. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. He lost his leg, because of it. And… my sister, she had cancer. A long time ago. But… that’s all I can really remember, you know? My family… they didn’t talk much about their health. It was… different back then. Just heart trouble, diabetes, and cancer, I think. But I'm not sure, really. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble, diabetes, and cancer in the family. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: No, no. Never smoked. Never liked it. My wife… she hated it too. Always told me it was bad for me. And she was right, you know? Always right. I drink a little beer sometimes, though. Just a few bottles on the weekend. And I like a little coffee in the morning. But that's it. No smoking, no… nothing else. Just a little beer and coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and a little coffee. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat anything. Never had a problem with food. And… the doctor gave me some pills for my blood pressure, but I stopped taking them, like I said. Didn't make me feel good. Never had a reaction to any pills before that, though. And no allergies to… plants, animals, nothing. I'm a pretty simple man, you know? Don't have much trouble with allergies. Lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum, thank you for that thorough information. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll do a brief neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead. I'll just sit here, and do whatever you need me to do. I'm an old man, but I can still follow directions!
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, as we discussed. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs sound… a little quiet in the lower parts, but nothing concerning right now. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms, and I'll tap your tendons with this little hammer?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Arms out. Go ahead, Doctor. Whatever you need. I used to work with tools all day, you know. My reflexes should still be alright!
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are good and symmetrical. Your balance is a little unsteady with your eyes closed, which is common at your age. Alright, everything seems… within normal limits for your age, but the elevated blood pressure and slightly diminished breath sounds are things we should address. Given your history of headaches, elevated blood pressure, and the diminished breath sounds, I'd like to order a few tests. I want to do a complete blood count to rule out any infection, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Tests…? Oh. Yes, that sounds… alright. Is it expensive? I don’t have… insurance, you know. My wife… she had insurance, but… after she passed… I couldn’t afford it. I just pay out of pocket. Will it cost a lot of money? I don't want to be a burden. And what will the tests… tell you? What are you looking for, exactly?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Brum, and I understand your financial situation. Let’s talk about that first. The complete blood count and basic metabolic panel will each be around $80, and the chest X-ray around $150. We can also see if there are any local assistance programs or payment plans available to help with the cost. I’ll have my staff look into that for you. As for what we’re looking for, the complete blood count will check for any signs of infection or anemia. The basic metabolic panel will assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels, which can be affected by high blood pressure. The chest X-ray will give us a better look at your lungs to see if there's any sign of pneumonia or other lung problems that might be contributing to the diminished breath sounds I heard. It’s a way to get a clearer picture of what's going on, and determine the best course of action. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes… more sense. $80, $150… I can probably manage that. If my staff can look into… help, that would be good. Anemia, kidneys, lungs… okay. So, it's just… to see what’s causing the headache and… the quiet lungs. And to make sure everything is alright. My wife… she always said I worried too much. Okay. Yes. Let's do the tests. I trust you, Doctor. Just… let's get it done. I want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Brum. And you are right to want to get to the bottom of this. My staff will get the lab orders ready and help you schedule the tests. We’ll also look into those assistance programs for you. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you start taking it easy and avoid strenuous activity. Continue to stay hydrated, and if your headache gets worse or you develop any other symptoms, like fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please come back to the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. You’ve been very… kind. Taking it easy, drinking water, come back if it gets worse… okay. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. And… thank you to your staff, too. For looking into the help. I appreciate it. I really do. I guess… I’ll see you when the tests are done?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. It was my pleasure to meet you. My staff will contact you to schedule the tests and let you know the results as soon as they are available. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before then. We are here to help. Take care, Mr. Brum. And please, don't worry too much. We'll figure this out together.
PATIENT: It's good to meet you too, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I will. I’ll try not to worry. You have a good day, Doctor. And… goodbye. .
