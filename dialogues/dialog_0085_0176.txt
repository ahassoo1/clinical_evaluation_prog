DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just…won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and it's really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for over two days. That is quite persistent. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. They come and go, really randomly. Not after eating or drinking anything specific that I’ve noticed. They just…start. Sometimes they’re little ones, and other times they’re big, forceful ones. It’s exhausting, honestly. I haven't been sleeping well because of them.
DOCTOR: I understand. Intermittent hiccups disrupting your sleep – that is exhausting. Are they constant, or do they come in bursts?
PATIENT: Bursts, definitely bursts. It's not like every second is a hiccup, thankfully. But they’ll come on strong, maybe five or six in a row, then stop for a little while…maybe an hour, maybe only ten minutes. Then they start up again. It’s hard to predict. And sometimes they make my chest hurt a little when I get a really bad bunch.
DOCTOR: Okay, bursts of hiccups with periods of relief, and some associated chest discomfort. When you say chest discomfort, can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: It's not like a sharp pain, you understand? More like…a soreness. Like I've been coughing a lot. It's right here, in the middle of my chest. And it happens after a really long string of hiccups. Not during, afterwards. It doesn't last long, just a few minutes, then goes away until the next bad bout.
DOCTOR: Okay, soreness in the mid-chest after a bout of hiccups, not during. That's helpful. Have you tried anything to stop them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, have I! Everything my mother told me, and then some things I found online. Holding my breath, drinking water upside down, eating a spoonful of sugar…you name it. None of it’s worked for more than a minute or two, if that. I even had someone scare me, which usually works, but not this time! I’m starting to feel a bit silly trying all these things, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’ve tried things, but don't feel silly – hiccups can be incredibly frustrating. Let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let's see. I had my gallbladder out about fifteen years ago, and I had a really bad bout of bronchitis last winter. That kept me in bed for a week. Otherwise, not much, really. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I do have high blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. I take Lisinopril, 20mg, once a day. Oh, and I had a hysterectomy about twenty years ago. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very helpful, thank you. Lisinopril for high blood pressure, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, bronchitis last winter, and a hysterectomy twenty years ago. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything and taken all sorts of things over the years without any problems. I’ve always been lucky that way. I might get a bit of a stuffy nose from pollen sometimes, but that’s just seasonal, nothing serious. I can eat shellfish, peanuts, everything. I've tested negative for all sorts of things with the doctor over the years, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just to complete the picture, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had diabetes, type 2, and she had heart problems later in life. My father…he was pretty healthy, actually, lived to be 85. My sister has arthritis, but that's about it. Nothing major on either side, really. We're a pretty long-lived family, generally. I guess that's good news, if you think about it.
DOCTOR: That's good information, thank you. A family history of diabetes and heart problems, but generally long-lived. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I’m retired now, used to work as a…well, an entertainment manager, mostly planning events. I don’t do much heavy lifting these days! I live alone in an apartment. I try to walk a little bit most days, maybe half an hour, but sometimes I just don't have the energy. I don't smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I used to be a bigger coffee drinker, but I cut back when my blood pressure went up. I eat…pretty normally, I guess? I try to eat healthy, but I do like my sweets. I’m not very active, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired entertainment manager, walking when able, no smoking, occasional wine, reduced coffee intake, and a fairly normal diet. Alright. Let’s just do a quick exam, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, take some deep breaths for me, please. Your breathing sounds clear, and your heart sounds regular, though a bit of a normal murmur. Now I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Soft, no tenderness. Now, I'm just going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Your pulse is 78 and your blood pressure is 140/90. And finally, let's just take a look at your throat. Your throat looks clear. Everything seems normal physically. It doesn't seem to be anything obvious causing the hiccups.
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds…reassuring, I guess. But if everything is normal, why are these hiccups still happening? It’s so frustrating! It's just been going on and on. Do you have any ideas what it could be? Or what we should do next? Perhaps some tests?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's definitely concerning when something is persistent without an obvious cause. Physically, everything appears normal, which is good. However, persistent hiccups can be caused by a number of things, even without any other obvious symptoms. Sometimes it’s a nerve irritation, or something affecting the diaphragm. Given the length of time this has been going on, and the fact that it’s interfering with your sleep, I do think it would be prudent to do some basic blood work to rule out anything underlying. I’d like to check your electrolytes, a complete blood count, and your kidney function. That will give us a better picture of your overall health. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. I'd be very comfortable with that. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you know? Blood work sounds good. Will I need to come back again for that, or can we do it today? And how long does it usually take to get the results? I hope it’s not too long. It's just…driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can draw the blood today. It's just a standard blood draw, and it shouldn’t take long. The lab is right next door, and usually, the results come back within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a medication called Baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant that sometimes helps with hiccups. It doesn’t work for everyone, but it’s worth trying. We can see if that provides any relief. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a plan. Baclofen…muscle relaxant. I’ll try anything at this point. Thank you, Dr. Lahn. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate. I’m hoping this will finally put an end to these awful hiccups! Will the nurse call me on my mobile number?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I understand how disruptive hiccups can be. Yes, the nurse will call you on the mobile number we have on file – is that still 123-4567?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct. 123-4567. Perfect. Thank you again, Dr. Lahn. I feel a bit better knowing we’re at least doing something. I’ll go and get the blood work done now.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please let the nurse know if you have any questions while you’re getting the blood work done. And don’t hesitate to call if you don’t hear from us within 48 hours. I hope you find some relief soon, Ivette. Have a good day. .
