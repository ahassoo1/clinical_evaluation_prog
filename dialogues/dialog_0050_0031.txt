DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kreckel. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you are 18 years of age. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, eighteen. Um, well, my left leg is… quite swollen. It’s been getting bigger these past few days, and it’s a bit worrying. I also… I have a heart thing, the doctor told me about it a while back. Something about it fluttering? They said it was atrial… something.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right! Atrial… fibrillation. That's the word. It's been… well, I don’t really know much about it, to be honest. The doctor just said to keep an eye on things. But now my leg is so big, and I thought I should come in. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Kreckel, it is prudent you’ve come in. A rapidly swelling leg could indicate a number of things, and given your history of atrial fibrillation, we need to be thorough. Now, let’s start with this leg. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It was… maybe three days ago? It started just a little bit, I thought it was just from walking a lot, maybe. But then yesterday it got much worse, and this morning… well, you can see. It’s mostly in my calf, I think. And it feels… tight, and a little bit achy.
DOCTOR: And has this been accompanied by any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any redness or warmth to the leg?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. And I can breathe just fine, thankfully. No redness, either. It just feels… puffy, and a bit sore if I poke it. It’s not… hot, no. I haven’t noticed any fever or anything like that, either. Just… big. And a bit uncomfortable. I’m a bit worried it’s a blood clot, I overheard someone talking about those once.
DOCTOR: Now, Ms. Kreckel, it's best not to self-diagnose based on overheard conversations. While a blood clot is a possibility, it's just one of many potential causes. We need to perform a proper examination to determine the source of the swelling. Now, let's have a look at the leg. Could you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Sorry, I didn’t mean to… worry you. I just… I get a bit anxious sometimes. Is it alright if I keep my shoes on? They’re quite comfortable.
DOCTOR: It would be preferable if you removed your shoes, Ms. Kreckel, to get an accurate assessment. However, if that is causing you undue anxiety, we can proceed with them on, though it may slightly impede the examination. Please position your leg so I can get a good look.
PATIENT: Okay, alright. If you think it’s best. There we go. Is that okay, Doctor? It feels a bit silly, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there is definite edema present, extending from the ankle to approximately mid-calf. Skin temperature is normal to the touch. No visible signs of trauma or infection. Dorsalis pedis pulse is palpable, but slightly diminished. Capillary refill is approximately three seconds. Now, tell me, Ms. Kreckel, have you experienced any recent injury to this leg?
PATIENT: No, no injury at all. I haven’t fallen or bumped it, or anything like that. I’ve been walking to the library a lot, because of my studies, but that’s all. Nothing out of the ordinary. I’m a bit worried about this pulse thing, though… is that bad?
DOCTOR: A slightly diminished pulse isn't immediately alarming, Ms. Kreckel, but it does warrant further investigation. We'll need to rule out a few possibilities. Now, I’m going to auscultate the leg to listen for any abnormal sounds. Please remain still. Sounds normal. Alright. Now, given your history of atrial fibrillation, we really need to investigate whether this swelling is related to a potential blood clot. I’m going to order a D-dimer test and a venous ultrasound of the left leg. The D-dimer will help us assess for blood clot activity, and the ultrasound will provide a visual assessment of the veins in your leg.
PATIENT: A… a D-dimer test? And an… ultrasound? What does that involve? Will it hurt? I’m a bit scared now, Doctor. I didn’t expect so many tests. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Ms. Kreckel, it's best not to jump to conclusions. These tests are standard procedure given your symptoms and medical history. The D-dimer is a simple blood test, just a small prick of a needle. The ultrasound is non-invasive; it uses sound waves to create an image of the veins in your leg – it won’t hurt at all. A technician will apply a gel to your leg and move a device over the skin. It's quite painless. We need to determine the cause of the swelling, and these tests will help us do that. Now, I'm also going to order an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Given your history of atrial fibrillation, it's prudent to ensure your heart is stable. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Um… I don’t think so. I’ve never had any tests like that before, so I don’t think I’ve ever been exposed to it. I’m a little nervous about all these tests, Doctor. Will I need to stay overnight? And… will my studies be affected? I have an important assignment due next week.
DOCTOR: You won’t need to stay overnight, Ms. Kreckel. And while I understand your concern about your studies, your health is the priority. We'll get these tests done as quickly as possible. The EKG and blood test can be done here in the clinic, and we’ll schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. The doctor prescribed something for the heart thing a while back, but it made me feel… very strange, so I stopped taking it. I didn’t tell the doctor, I just… stopped. I know I should have, but I was scared to tell him. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Ms. Kreckel, it is highly inadvisable to discontinue any medication without consulting your physician. That can have serious consequences. What medication was it, and what were the side effects you experienced?
PATIENT: Oh… it was… Metoprolol, I think? The doctor said it was a beta-blocker. It made me feel very tired all the time, and my hands felt cold, even in the summer. And I felt… dizzy sometimes. It just made me feel awful, so I stopped taking it. I know I shouldn’t have, but I just couldn’t cope with the side effects. Is that why my leg is swollen?
DOCTOR: It is possible that discontinuing the Metoprolol has contributed to your symptoms, Ms. Kreckel, though we cannot definitively say so without further investigation. The medication is often prescribed to manage heart rate and prevent complications associated with atrial fibrillation. Now, before we proceed, do you have any known allergies to any medications or substances?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything before. I’m not allergic to any foods, or anything like that. Just… a bit scared of doctors, to be honest. Will these tests be very expensive? I don't have insurance, so I'm a bit worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Ms. Kreckel. We have a financial assistance program available for patients without insurance. We can discuss that with the billing department after the tests are completed. Now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. I’m going to order a complete blood count as well, to rule out any underlying infection. Alright, I’ve entered all the orders. A nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood for the CBC and D-dimer, and we’ll schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning. Please refrain from walking excessively until we have the results of the ultrasound. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… please hurry. I’m a bit scared, and I just want to know what’s wrong. And thank you… for trying to help.
