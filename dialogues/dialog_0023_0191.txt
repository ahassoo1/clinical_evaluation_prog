DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I decided it was time to get checked for… for HIV. I just wanted to know my status, really. It’s been on my mind.
DOCTOR: I see. And what prompted you to consider getting tested now, after…however long it's been?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s not that anything happened, exactly. It’s just… my husband and I were talking, and it felt like a responsible thing to do. We’ve been married a long time, and I suppose it’s better to be sure, isn’t it? Even if the chances are small. I just want peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Responsible, yes. Though statistically, given your marital status and presumed monogamy, the risk is quite low. However, I don’t dismiss patient concerns. Have either of you had any…unprotected encounters outside of your marriage at any point?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. My husband and I… we've been very faithful to each other. Always. I just… well, you hear things, don't you? Stories. And it made me think. It's not that I suspect anything, but… prevention is better than cure, as they say. I hope that doesn't sound foolish.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound foolish. It’s simply…prudent, I suppose. We’ll proceed with testing, then. To ensure accuracy, it’s important to understand the window period. Depending on when potential exposure may have occurred, the test may not be conclusive immediately. Now, have you ever had a previous HIV test?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. This is the very first time. I’ve always meant to, but… life gets in the way, doesn’t it? And then you put things off… and then more time passes. I hope that’s not a problem. Is it alright that it’s my first time?
DOCTOR: It's…not ideal, certainly. A baseline test would have been preferable for comparison. However, we’ll work with what we have. Now, do you have any known allergies to latex or any other materials that might interfere with the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I've never had a problem with rubber gloves or anything like that. My skin is usually quite good, actually. Though, I do get a bit squeamish around needles, if I'm honest. But I'll manage. I’m tougher than I look.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll need to take a blood sample. And, while we're at it, I’d like to run a full panel—a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. It’s good practice to have a comprehensive understanding of your overall health. It’s often…revealing. Now, before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. I take a multivitamin every morning, just a standard one. And sometimes, if my knees are acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. That’s about it, really. Nothing else. I try to keep things simple. I don’t like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, noted. Any allergies to medications generally?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to get penicillin as a child, but I haven’t needed it in years. I haven't really had much cause for medication, thankfully. I’m usually quite healthy, all things considered. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's… satisfactory. Now, I’m going to need to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses – diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve been very lucky, I think. My mother had high blood pressure when she got older, but I haven’t had any problems myself. I walk every day, try to eat a balanced diet… I’m fairly careful, you see. My husband always says I worry too much, but better safe than sorry, I say.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! Yes, I had my appendix removed when I was a young woman. That was a long time ago, though. And… and I had a hysterectomy a few years later. That’s it, really. Nothing major since then. Just the usual scrapes and bruises, you understand. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Appendixectomy and hysterectomy, noted. Now, family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family—heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, my father had heart problems when he was older, and he eventually passed away from a stroke. My mother’s side of the family… they’ve had a few cases of diabetes, but nothing serious. And… no, not that I know of, no one in my family has ever had… that. I don’t think so, anyway. We weren't very close, you see. It was a large family, and people didn’t talk about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, to proceed with the blood draw, please have a seat on the examination table. We'll take it from there.
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go, then. I do hope it doesn’t hurt too much. I really don’t like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: It will be a small prick. Try to relax. Now, which arm would you prefer?
PATIENT: Oh… um… left, I think. Yes, left arm, please. It doesn't feel as… prominent, if you know what I mean. Just get it over with quickly, please. I'm really not good with this.
DOCTOR: There we go. Just a little pinch… Alright, all done. Apply pressure to the site for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. Here's a bandage. Now, I'll send this sample to the lab. The results should be available within a few business days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions before I leave the room?
PATIENT: Oh… Thank you. That wasn’t as bad as I thought, actually. No, I don't think so. Just… what do I do if I start feeling dizzy or something? And… how will you let me know when the results are ready? Will I have to come back here?
DOCTOR: If you feel dizzy, lie down and elevate your legs. It’s a simple vasovagal response. Common. We'll contact you by phone when the results are available. You'll need to schedule a follow-up appointment then. The receptionist will assist you with that. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. .
