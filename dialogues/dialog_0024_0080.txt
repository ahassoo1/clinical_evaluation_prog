DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's not really bringing me in, you know? Just need to get some forms filled out. Medicare asked me to, and I figured it's easier to do it here with someone who can answer questions if I get stuck.
DOCTOR: Forms. Right. While I am a physician, my time is allocated for medical concerns, Ms. Fabing. However, I suppose we can address this. Which forms are proving…difficult?
PATIENT: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn’t mean to take up your time. It's just… there's a few questions about my employment history, and I wasn't sure how detailed I needed to be. I work with valves and controls, mostly out in the field, and it's a little complicated to explain sometimes. It's not a regular office job, you know?
DOCTOR: “Employment history.” Yes. Medicare requires a comprehensive record for billing purposes, Ms. Fabing. They are quite particular. What specifically is causing you pause?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, it asks for "current employer." I've been doing some work for a few different companies lately, kind of freelance. Should I list all of them, or just the one I've worked for the longest this year? And then there's a spot for “job duties.” How much detail do they need? I don't want to bore them with everything I do with a wrench, you know?
DOCTOR: Freelance work complicates matters, naturally. List all employers you’ve received a 1099 form from this year, Ms. Fabing. As for “job duties,” a general overview is sufficient. “Valve maintenance and repair, field service technician” – something along those lines. They are not seeking a detailed operational manual of your skillset. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. All employers with a 1099…and just a general overview. “Valve maintenance and repair, field service technician.” I can do that. I think I got it now. It’s just…a lot of boxes. Is there somewhere I can write more if I need to?
DOCTOR: There is a supplemental section for additional information, Ms. Fabing, though I strongly advise against unnecessary elaboration. Medicare is not interested in your life story. Concise answers, please. Now, let's proceed. Have you experienced any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Right, concise. Got it. No, I haven't really had any changes in my health, no. Just the usual aches and pains from crawling under things all day, you know? Nothing serious. I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think.
DOCTOR: “Usual aches and pains.” Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Not really. Just ibuprofen sometimes for those aches. And I take a multivitamin every morning, but that’s about it. Nothing a person couldn’t pick up at the grocery store, you know? I try to stay away from too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen. Understandable. Any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. And I spend a lot of time outdoors, so I’d know if I was allergic to something out there, you know? Bugs don't bother me too much, either.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, regarding your family history… have there been any significant illnesses – heart disease, diabetes, cancer – in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My grandpa on my mom’s side had heart problems, I think. And my aunt had diabetes, but she wasn’t very good about taking care of herself, you know? Other than that, not really. Everyone else is pretty healthy, for their age. It’s a pretty long family, so it’s hard to keep track sometimes.
DOCTOR: Heart disease and diabetes. Noted. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of that. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I maybe have a glass of wine once or twice a year with dinner, but that’s it. Definitely no drugs. I keep pretty busy with work, so I don’t really have time for any of that.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your stated health status and the purpose of this visit – completing these forms – I believe we have sufficient information. Please complete the remaining sections as accurately as possible. If any questions arise, I have a nurse who can assist you. I must attend to other patients now, Ms. Fabing. Thank you for your time.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. I appreciate you helping me with the tricky parts. I’ll just finish filling these out, and I’ll ask the nurse if I get stuck. Thank you, Doctor. Have a good day.
