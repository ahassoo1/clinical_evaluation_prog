DOCTOR: Talofa, Marija! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Yes, well. My husband, he suggested I come. He thinks I should have one of those… forms. An advance directive, he called it. Something about what happens… if I become unable to make decisions. Frankly, I find the whole thing rather morbid, but he is quite insistent. I suppose it’s better to be prepared, although I have always been perfectly capable of managing my own affairs.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Marija. It can feel a bit unsettling to think about these things, even though it’s a very responsible step to take. Your husband sounds like a thoughtful man. An advance directive – sometimes called a living will – is a really good way to make sure your wishes are known, should you ever be in a situation where you can't speak for yourself. Before we get into the specifics of that, though, is there anything else bringing you in today?
PATIENT: “Responsible”? I assure you, Doctor, I am a responsible person. I've taught literature for twenty years! One must be organized and forward-thinking to manage a classroom of young people. No, there is nothing else. My husband simply worries unduly. He reads too much online, I suspect. We are here for this… directive. Though, I must say, I’m not entirely clear on what it entails. Is it a great deal of paperwork?
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. I didn't mean to imply otherwise – teaching certainly requires a great deal of responsibility! My apologies if I came across that way. And you're right to ask about what it entails. It can seem daunting. It's mostly about outlining your wishes regarding medical care. Things like whether you'd want life-sustaining treatment if you were seriously ill, who you'd want to make decisions for you if you couldn't, and what your values are around end-of-life care. There is some paperwork, yes, but we'll go through it together, step-by-step. First, though, to make sure we have a complete picture, let me ask a few general health questions. Have you been feeling generally well lately?
PATIENT: “Generally well”? As well as one can be, Doctor, given the state of the world. The students these days… utterly lacking in discipline. But physically? Yes, I suppose. I have the usual aches and pains of getting older, naturally. My knees are not what they used to be. And I do get occasional headaches, but nothing a good cup of mint tea won't cure. Honestly, I don't see why this is relevant. We are here to discuss the form, not my… minor discomforts. Is it absolutely necessary to delve into these details before we address the matter at hand?
DOCTOR: You're right to question me, Marija. It's important to you that we focus on the advance directive, and I respect that. The reason I ask about your overall health is simply to have a fuller picture, should any questions arise during the process or if we need to consider specific scenarios. It helps me understand your baseline. But let’s absolutely focus on what you want to discuss. To start with the advance directive, do you already have any thoughts on who you would want to be your healthcare proxy – the person who would make medical decisions for you if you were unable to?
PATIENT: My husband, naturally. Who else would it be? He is… capable, if occasionally overly anxious. He handles all the finances, so I suppose he can manage this as well. Though, I do hope he listens to the doctors and doesn’t get any… outlandish ideas. He once insisted I try aromatherapy for a cold. Utter nonsense. Is there a form for designating a proxy? A simple, concise form, I hope. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Marija. Your husband sounds like a good partner to have. Yes, there's a standard form for designating a healthcare proxy. It’s fairly straightforward. Here’s the form. As you can see, it asks for his full name, address, and contact information, as well as your signature and the date. We also need a witness signature. It’s important to understand that he will be legally authorized to make decisions on your behalf, so it's good he is aware of this responsibility. Before we proceed, do you have any specific wishes you’d like to document regarding the types of medical care you would or wouldn't want in certain situations?
PATIENT: “Legally authorized”? Honestly, Doctor, I should think common sense would dictate his responsibilities. I’ve always made my wishes clear. He knows I disapprove of… excessive intervention. No prolonged life support, no feeding tubes. And absolutely no experimental procedures. I prefer a natural end, if it comes to that. Though I trust he would exercise good judgment. This form… it seems awfully clinical. Must it be so… detailed? Is there not a simpler way to express these preferences? A brief statement, perhaps? “Maintain comfort, no heroic measures.” Would that suffice? I really dislike all this paperwork. It's quite undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Marija. You're right, it can feel a bit overwhelming and impersonal. “Maintain comfort, no heroic measures” is a good starting point, and we can certainly include that as a general statement. However, the legal requirement for the proxy form is to ensure clarity in very specific situations, so we need to address those, even if it feels… detailed. This section here addresses life-sustaining treatment. It asks about things like mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration, and resuscitation. We can simply check the boxes that align with your wishes – “Do Not Resuscitate,” “Do Not Intubate,” and “Do Not Provide Artificial Nutrition.” This ensures your husband will know your preferences even in a stressful situation where clear communication might be difficult. Would you like me to go through each of these options with you, just to be sure everything is clear?
PATIENT: “Stressful situation”? Honestly, Doctor, my husband has a tendency to create stressful situations. But very well. Go ahead. But please, keep it brief. I have a faculty meeting this afternoon, and I’d rather not be late. And I certainly don't want to dwell on unpleasant hypotheticals. Just tell me what each box means, and I will indicate my preference. Quickly, if you please. And no medical jargon. I'm a literature professor, not a physician.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. No jargon, I promise. And we’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, the first option is “Mechanical Ventilation.” This refers to using a machine to help you breathe if you’re unable to do so on your own. Checking the box here would indicate that you do not want to be put on a ventilator in that situation. The next one is “Artificial Nutrition and Hydration.” This means receiving fluids and nourishment through a feeding tube if you’re unable to eat or drink. Checking this box would indicate that you do not want to receive artificial nutrition or hydration. And finally, “Resuscitation.” This refers to attempts to revive you if your heart stops beating or you stop breathing. Checking this box would indicate that you do not want to be resuscitated. Do those explanations make sense?
PATIENT: Perfectly. It's all rather morbid, but straightforward enough. Check all three boxes, please. And do ensure they are checked firmly. I wouldn’t want any ambiguity. My husband tends to… overthink things. He'll likely question every decision, so clear instructions are paramount. Is that all? Can we please be finished now? I really must be going. I have a rather important essay to grade, and frankly, the students’ work is… appalling.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. All three boxes are checked. Here is the completed form. You'll need to sign and date it at the bottom, and we'll need a witness signature as well. I can be your witness. Once it’s signed and witnessed, it's legally valid. I’ll make a copy for your records and keep the original in your file. Excellent. Here’s your copy. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, or are you all set?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all. I trust this… document will suffice to prevent any unnecessary drama. Honestly, the thought of my husband interfering with my final arrangements is… unsettling. Thank you for your assistance, though I must say, the entire process was rather unpleasant. I prefer discussing Proust to pondering mortality. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marija. I understand your feelings, and I'm glad we were able to get this completed. And I completely agree – Proust is far more enjoyable to discuss! Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future.
