DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. I am here for… the talk on the computer? My… son, he made the appointment for me. It is a check-up, yes? I feel… okay, but he worries.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here it’s a comprehensive wellness check-up scheduled by your son. That’s very thoughtful of him. It sounds like he's looking out for you, which is wonderful. “Okay” is good to hear! Still, a check-up is always a good idea. To get started, could you tell me a little bit more about why he was concerned enough to make the appointment?
PATIENT: He says I… slow down a little. And forget things. Not big things, you understand. Like… where I put my glasses. Or the name of the actor in the film. Small things. He worries it is… something bad. I tell him I am just getting older. But he is a good boy. Very insistent.
DOCTOR: He sounds like a very caring son. It’s good he's paying attention, and it’s perfectly normal for things like memory to shift as we age. We can definitely explore that today and see if there's anything we need to address. Could you tell me a bit more about when you started noticing these little changes?
PATIENT: Hmm. When… that is a difficult question. Maybe… six months ago? A little longer, perhaps. It is hard to say exactly. It was… gradual. Not like one day I suddenly could not remember anything. Just… little slips. Things taking a bit longer to come to mind. I still do everything, you understand. I cook, I clean, I garden. I just… pause sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know – gradual onset is important. And it’s reassuring to hear you’re still able to do all the things you enjoy. Let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Besides the memory slips your son mentioned, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling – physically or emotionally?
PATIENT: Hmm… physically… well, my knees are not as good as they used to be. But that is just age, I think. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little tired. Not all the time, but… more tired than before. Emotionally… I miss my husband, of course. He has been gone five years now. That is always sad. But… I am generally okay. I have my garden, my friends. I try to stay busy.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, and it’s understandable to still feel sadness after losing your husband. It sounds like you have a good support system and a fulfilling life, which is wonderful. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any significant medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… the doctor, he said my blood pressure was a little high, maybe ten years ago? I took the pills for a while, then he said it was okay, so I stopped. I do not have the sugar sickness, I think. And my heart… no, nothing wrong with my heart. Just… old. Like everything else! I had the flu, of course, a few times. And a broken wrist when I was young, but that is long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure that resolved with medication, no history of diabetes or heart problems, a past broken wrist, and the usual flu. That's good information. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a little pill for my knees. The pain sometimes, you understand. It is… acetaminophen, I think? And I take a vitamin D, in the winter. My son, he says I need it because I do not get enough sun. That is all. Very simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, acetaminophen as needed for knee pain and Vitamin D in the winter. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Nothing. I eat everything. I have been lucky, I think. No problems with that. Sometimes a little heartburn, but nothing serious. Just… a little spice, perhaps. Or too much coffee.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. No known allergies or serious medical problems is excellent. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few neurological checks. It will help me get a better picture of things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I do not mind. Just… be gentle with my knees, please? They are not as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be very gentle. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here. I try to relax, but… I am a little nervous, perhaps? I do not like doctors very much. But I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright to be a little nervous. We'll take things slowly. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. That’s a little elevated, but not significantly. It's good to know your baseline. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me, in and out?
PATIENT: Yes. Like this? I try to breathe normally, but it is difficult to relax. My heart is… beating fast, perhaps? Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and I’m hearing normal breath sounds. It is a little faster than I’d ideally like, but that can be common when you’re a bit anxious. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes and a little bit of your balance. Could you sit on the edge of the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Be careful, Doctor! My knees… they are not very good at standing.
DOCTOR: I will be right here. Just hold onto the sides of the table and try to relax as much as you can. I'm just going to gently tap a few places on your knees with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't hurt. Okay, good reflexes there. A little diminished, but that can be normal at your age. Now, could you please stand up slowly and try to stand with your feet together and close your eyes for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Oh… I am… a little unsteady. Please, hold my hand? I do not want to fall.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It's good you let me know. You're doing great. Just take a few deep breaths. I'm right here. Okay, that's good to know. A little bit of unsteadiness, but nothing alarming. Now, let's just do one quick memory check. I’m going to say three words, and I’d like you to repeat them back to me after I finish the exam. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Three words? Yes, I can do that. I hope I remember them! My memory… it is not as good as it used to be. But I will try my best. Please, say the words.
DOCTOR: Okay, here they are: apple, table, penny. Now, we'll finish up the physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs one more time, and then we can talk about what we’ve found. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Apple, table, penny… I repeat them in my head. Apple, table, penny. Yes. Please, listen to my heart. I will try to remember the words.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds clear. Your heart rate is a bit elevated at 88 beats per minute, but that’s likely due to your anxiety. Lung sounds are clear. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Let’s talk about what we've found, and then we can discuss a plan. Do you have any questions for me before we start?
PATIENT: No… not right now, I think. Just… tell me if something is wrong. I worry a lot, you see. My son, he says I worry too much. Please, just be honest with me, Doctor. Is everything okay?
DOCTOR: I understand. And I will be honest with you. Everything seems okay at this moment. However, your heart rate is slightly elevated, and you mentioned some recent memory slips and unsteadiness. These things, combined with your history of slightly elevated blood pressure, mean we need to investigate a little further. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it’s always best to be thorough. I want to order some blood work to check your overall health, including your thyroid function and vitamin levels. I’d also like to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? An EKG? What does that mean? Is something wrong with my heart? I do not like tests. My husband, he had many tests… and it was never good. Are you sure it is necessary? Perhaps it is just… old age?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests, especially with past experiences. I want to assure you that we're doing this as a precaution, to rule out any potential issues and give us a clearer picture of your health. An EKG – or electrocardiogram – is a simple, painless test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn't involve any needles or discomfort. The blood work will give us information about your overall health, including your thyroid function – which can affect your energy levels and memory – and your vitamin levels. It’s not necessarily that something is wrong, but it’s best to be proactive and rule things out. We want to make sure you stay healthy and happy for many years to come. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain the tests. And… what if something is wrong? What if it is my heart? My husband… he had a weak heart. Please, be honest with me, Doctor. I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk about the tests and what they can tell us. The EKG, as I mentioned, is a quick and painless test. We'll put some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs, and those are connected to a machine that records your heart's electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt at all. It helps us see if there are any irregularities in your heart rhythm or if there are any signs of a previous heart attack. The blood work is a little more involved, but still relatively simple. We'll take a small sample of blood from your arm, and that will be sent to a lab for analysis. It tells us a lot about your overall health, like your cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, and thyroid function. Now, about what if something is wrong… I want to be honest with you. It's possible we could find something that needs further attention. If we do, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a serious problem, but we would discuss all your options and create a plan to address it. If it is something heart-related, there are many treatments available, from medication to lifestyle changes to more advanced procedures. I understand your worry, especially given your husband’s history. But it's important to remember that everyone’s situation is different. We're taking these tests as a precaution, to get a clearer picture of your health and make sure you're getting the best possible care. I will be here to guide you through every step of the process and answer any questions you have. Before we order those tests, do you have any questions about them?
PATIENT: Okay… I understand. So, the tests will tell you about my heart and… my body. And if something is wrong, you will tell me. And then… we will do something about it. But… will it hurt? Will I be sick? And… how long will it take? I have my garden, you see. And my friends. I do not want to be sick and miss everything.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns. Let's address them one by one. The EKG itself is completely painless. You won't feel anything at all. The blood draw might be a little uncomfortable for a few seconds, like a small pinch, but it’s usually very quick. As for feeling sick, it's unlikely. Some people might feel a little tired or lightheaded after the blood draw, but that usually passes quickly. The results typically take a few days to come back – usually around 2 to 3 business days. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan if needed. And I understand your concerns about missing time in your garden and with your friends. We'll do everything we can to minimize any disruption to your life. If we do need to do any further testing or treatment, we'll work around your schedule as much as possible. I want to assure you that we're taking these tests as a precaution, to rule out any potential issues and give you peace of mind. It's not necessarily that something is wrong, but it's always best to be proactive and get a clearer picture of your health. Would you like me to go ahead and order those tests for you?
PATIENT: Yes… alright. Please, order the tests. I want to know. I want to be healthy. And… I want to go back to my garden. But… what do I do now? Do I go somewhere else? Do I need to bring something?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m ordering the blood work and EKG now. You’ll need to go to the lab at [Name of Lab], which is located at [Address of Lab]. The order will be sent electronically to them, so you won’t need to bring any paperwork with you. You don’t need to fast beforehand, but it’s a good idea to drink plenty of water. Just wear comfortable clothing. The whole process should take about 30-45 minutes. They’ll take a blood sample and then do the EKG. The technician will explain everything to you before they start. Once you've had the tests done, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the results. You can do that online or by calling the clinic. Here’s a printout with the lab information and instructions. Do you have any questions about the lab or the instructions?
PATIENT: Okay… [Name of Lab]. I write it down. No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very… kind. I was very worried, but you have made me feel better. I think I will go home now and… sit in my garden.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could help. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about these things, and I'm always here to answer any questions you have. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if anything comes up before your follow-up appointment. And yes, go and enjoy your garden. That sounds like a wonderful idea. I’ll see you in a few days when the results are back. Have a good day, Ms. Benites. And please try not to worry too much.
PATIENT:
