DOCTOR: Hi Liza, good morning. I'm Dr. Condray. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Condray. It’s very nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about… just finding a little more peace, I guess. I was hoping to talk about mindfulness or meditation, if that’s something you could help with? I’ve heard it can be good for… well, for a lot of things, and I’d like to try it.
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful idea, Liza. Absolutely, we can discuss mindfulness and meditation. It’s great you’re proactively thinking about your wellbeing. To get a better understanding of what might be helpful for you specifically, could you tell me a little more about why you're interested in mindfulness now?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let’s see. It’s not like anything bad happened, exactly. Just… life, you know? Work is… work. I fix signals and track switches, which is fine, but it can be stressful, always making sure everything's safe. And then there's just… everything else. Being alone, mostly. I just feel… scattered sometimes, like my thoughts are always jumping around. I thought maybe learning to focus, to be more present, could help with that. Does that make sense? I worry I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Liza. It sounds like you’re experiencing some stress and a feeling of being overwhelmed, and you're hoping mindfulness might help you find some calm and focus – that's a very valid reason to explore it. It’s completely understandable to feel scattered with a demanding job and feeling a bit isolated. To give you the best advice, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. Well, I wake up around 6:00 am, usually. I have a little coffee, check the news – which I probably shouldn’t, it’s mostly bad these days! – and then I get ready for work. My job… well, it’s early mornings a lot. Sometimes I’m working on tracks before the trains start running, other times it’s repairs during the day. It’s a lot of walking, a lot of checking, and a lot of making sure everything is perfectly aligned. I usually get home around 4:00 pm, make something simple for dinner, and then… honestly, a lot of the time I just watch television. I try to call my sister sometimes, but we both have busy lives. And then it’s bedtime. Not very exciting, really.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture, thank you. It sounds like a physically demanding job with a lot of responsibility, and then a relatively quiet evening routine. You mentioned checking the news – is that a significant source of stress for you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, it definitely is. It's just… everything is so negative these days. I try to limit it, I really do. But it’s hard not to look, you know? Then I end up worrying about things I can’t control. And it just… sits with me. It makes it harder to relax, even when I’m not working. It’s silly, I guess, but it’s true. I'm probably making a bigger deal out of it than I should.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not silly at all, Liza. It's very common to feel overwhelmed and anxious by the news, especially in the current climate. It absolutely can contribute to stress and make it harder to relax. Let's talk a little more about how this stress manifests. Do you experience any physical symptoms – headaches, muscle tension, difficulty sleeping, maybe?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. My shoulders are always tense, I didn’t even realize it until you mentioned it. And I do get headaches fairly often, usually in the evenings. And… I wouldn't say I have trouble sleeping, exactly, but I don’t sleep as soundly as I used to. I wake up a few times during the night, thinking about work or… just things. It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely not restful. I also get… a little bit of stomach trouble sometimes, especially when I’m really worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Liza. Shoulder tension, headaches, disrupted sleep, and some stomach upset… those are all common physical responses to stress. It sounds like the stress is affecting your body, which is why exploring mindfulness is a good idea. Just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Um… my appetite is probably a little smaller than it used to be. I don't really feel hungry as often. I still eat, but I don’t look forward to meals the way I once did. And… my energy levels are definitely lower. I’m tired a lot, even after a good night's sleep. It's not… debilitating, but I don't have the same pep I used to. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t really felt like doing that much lately. It's all… a little bit of everything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Liza, thank you for being so open with me. It sounds like you're experiencing a constellation of symptoms – physical tension, sleep disturbance, appetite changes, lower energy – that are very consistent with stress and anxiety. To rule out any other potential causes, I'd like to quickly review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. Just… the usual things. I had the flu a couple of times, a bad sprain in my ankle years ago. And I wear glasses, of course. But nothing serious. No chronic illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. I have Medicare, so I get regular checkups, and everything's always been… fine, I guess. They check my blood pressure and cholesterol, that sort of thing. Always normal.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Liza. No major medical history is helpful. And regular checkups with normal results are reassuring. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. Really. I prefer to just… deal with things, I guess. I know that’s not always the smartest thing, but… I’ve always been that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No current medications. And just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all. That’s one good thing, at least! I can eat anything, take any medication if I absolutely have to. Never had a reaction to anything. My sister is allergic to peanuts, but I’m perfectly fine. I always feel a little silly answering these questions, but I understand it’s important.
DOCTOR: You’re not silly at all, Liza, and you’re right, it is important to cover all the bases. Alright, now that I have a good understanding of your medical history, symptoms, and lifestyle, I think mindfulness and meditation could be very beneficial for you. Before we dive into specific techniques, I want to make sure everything is medically sound. Let me just do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything else that might be contributing to your symptoms. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that’s perfectly fine. I figured you’d want to do that. I appreciate you being thorough. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 128/78, which is excellent. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart and lungs sound clear. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Reflexes are normal. Your thyroid feels normal as well. I’m checking your range of motion in your neck and shoulders… … I do notice some tightness in your upper back and shoulders, which is consistent with what you described. Overall, the exam is unremarkable, and I don’t find anything that suggests another medical cause for your symptoms. This supports my initial impression that your symptoms are likely related to stress and anxiety. Now, let’s talk about mindfulness. Are you familiar with any mindfulness techniques, like deep breathing exercises or meditation?
PATIENT: Um… I’ve read a little bit about it, mostly online. I know there are apps you can download, and I’ve seen people talking about guided meditations. I tried one once, I think on YouTube, but I couldn't really… focus. My mind kept wandering. It felt a little silly, to be honest, just sitting there trying to clear my head. I didn't really know how to do it properly. That’s why I thought maybe talking to you would help. I need someone to actually teach me, I think.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly normal, Liza. It's very common for people to struggle with focus when they first start practicing mindfulness. It takes practice! And you're right, having guidance can make a big difference. There are a lot of different techniques we can try. We could start with a simple deep breathing exercise, and then maybe move on to a body scan meditation. We can also discuss strategies for managing racing thoughts. Would you be open to trying a quick breathing exercise right now?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. I'm willing to try anything. I’m probably doing it wrong already just thinking about it, but… go ahead, please. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Liza. Sit comfortably in your chair, with your feet flat on the floor. You can close your eyes if you’re comfortable, or just lower your gaze. Now, let’s focus on your breath. Don’t try to change your breath, just observe it. Notice the sensation of the air entering your nostrils… and then leaving. Notice how your chest and abdomen rise and fall with each breath. Now, let’s try to lengthen your breath slightly. Inhale deeply for a count of four… one, two, three, four… Hold your breath for a count of two… one, two… And exhale slowly for a count of six… one, two, three, four, five, six. Continue breathing in this way, focusing on the sensation of your breath. If your mind wanders – and it will wander – gently redirect your attention back to your breath. Don’t judge yourself, just notice the thought and let it go. Let’s do this for a few minutes. I’ll remain quiet, but if you need anything, just let me know.
PATIENT: It’s… harder than I thought it would be. My mind keeps going back to work, thinking about the tracks, and whether everything is safe. And then I start worrying about dinner, and… everything. It’s just… a lot. I'm not sure I'm doing it right.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly normal, Liza. It’s very common for your mind to wander, especially when you’re first starting out. It doesn’t mean you’re doing it wrong – it just means you have a lot on your mind! The key is to gently redirect your attention back to your breath without judgment. Think of your thoughts like clouds passing by in the sky – you notice them, but you don’t have to get caught up in them. Let’s try a little visualization exercise. Imagine a peaceful place – a beach, a forest, a mountaintop. Somewhere you feel safe and relaxed. Focus on the details of that place – the colors, the sounds, the smells. What do you see?
PATIENT: I… I used to go to a beach with my grandmother when I was a little girl. It was on the Black Sea. The water was so clear, and the sand was warm and soft. There were little seashells everywhere. And the smell of the sea… it was just… wonderful. There was a little café nearby, and we would always have ice cream. Strawberry, usually. It feels… peaceful just thinking about it. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: That's beautiful, Liza. It sounds like a very special place. Focusing on those positive memories can be a powerful way to calm your mind. Now, let’s bring that sense of peace back to the present moment. As you continue to breathe deeply, focus on the sensations in your body. Notice the feeling of your feet on the floor, the weight of your body in the chair. Notice any areas of tension, and gently relax them. We’ve just done a very brief mindfulness exercise, but it gives you an idea of what it’s like. This is something you can practice anywhere, anytime. It takes practice, but with time, you’ll find it easier to calm your mind and focus on the present moment. Would you like me to share some resources – apps, websites, or books – that can help you with your practice?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. I think I need a little bit of extra help, especially at first. Apps sound good, something I can use on my phone. And maybe a book, just so I can read about it in more detail. Thank you, Doctor Condray. This has been… helpful. I feel a little bit calmer already.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Liza. I’m glad you found it helpful. Here are a few resources I recommend. For apps, “Headspace” and “Calm” are both popular and well-regarded. They have guided meditations for beginners, as well as exercises for stress and anxiety. For a book, “Wherever You Go, There You Are” by Jon Kabat-Zinn is a classic introduction to mindfulness. It’s a bit philosophical, but very insightful. I can also print out a handout with some basic deep breathing exercises for you to take home. We’ve discussed your symptoms today – stress, anxiety, sleep disturbance, lower energy – and I think mindfulness is a great approach. I’m not prescribing any medication at this time, but we can reassess in a month to see how you’re doing. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That's all very helpful, thank you. A month sounds good. I'll try to practice every day, even if it's just for a few minutes. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, Doctor Condray. It's nice to talk to someone who understands. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Liza. It was my pleasure. Remember, be patient with yourself, and don’t get discouraged if your mind wanders. It takes time and practice. If you find your symptoms worsening, or if you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here's the handout with the breathing exercises, and the information about the apps and book. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to seeing you again in a month.
