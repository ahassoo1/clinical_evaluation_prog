DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fogelstrom. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you also. Um... well, I keep... belching. A lot. It's embarrassing, really. Not all the time, but... enough that I wanted to ask someone.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Fogelstrom, I understand. It's perfectly alright to seek medical attention for something that's bothering you, even if it feels a bit embarrassing. We'll get to the bottom of this. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about these belches?
PATIENT: Hmm... okay. Well, they don't hurt, exactly. Just... come up. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes not. It doesn't seem to matter what I eat, really. And sometimes... a lot will come out at once! I don't know if that makes sense. It just feels... gassy, I guess? Is that... a problem?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Fogelstrom, and yes, excessive gas can certainly be a problem if it’s impacting your quality of life. It sounds like it is, and we want to address that. You mentioned it doesn’t seem to relate to specific foods. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it a recent change?
PATIENT: Oh, not forever. Maybe... a few months? It started small, just a little after dinner sometimes. But it's been getting worse lately. I thought maybe it was just something I ate, you know? But now it's happening more, even when I try to eat carefully.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’ve been paying attention to when it happens and trying to identify any patterns. A few months is enough time to warrant investigating further. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day... okay. Well, I work at the factory, putting things together. It's not too hard, mostly standing and using my hands. I eat lunch at work, usually bring a sandwich or something. Then I go home, cook dinner – I like rice and beans a lot. And I watch TV. Nothing too exciting! Oh, and I drink a lot of water. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Fogelstrom. Knowing about your work and diet is good. And yes, drinking a lot of water can matter, although usually in a good way. Sometimes, though, it can contribute to gas if you're also swallowing a lot of air. Do you notice if you gulp down your water quickly, or perhaps drink carbonated beverages at all?
PATIENT: Oh! That's a good question. I do drink water pretty fast, I think. I get thirsty! And... sometimes I have a little bit of soda. Not every day, maybe a few times a week. I like the bubbly kind. I didn't think that would matter, honestly.
DOCTOR: It absolutely can matter, Ms. Fogelstrom. Both quickly drinking liquids and carbonated beverages introduce extra air into your digestive system. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time, to be honest. I usually just try to tough things out. Nothing serious, I don't think. Just… little aches and pains sometimes, like everyone. I don’t have any allergies that I know of. And I don’t take any medicine, regularly.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Fogelstrom. It's good to know you haven't been regularly seeing a doctor and don't have any known medical conditions or allergies. It’s also good you don’t take any regular medications. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a tough one. My mother... she had trouble with her stomach sometimes, always complaining of indigestion. And my grandfather... he had something with his heart, I think. But honestly, I don't really know a lot of details. We didn't talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Ms. Fogelstrom. Family medical history can be difficult to gather. Knowing about your mother’s indigestion and your grandfather’s heart condition is helpful, though. Before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, no. Definitely not. I don't smoke, I don't drink, and I don't do… any of that. Never have. I just... like to relax at home. That's all.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing, Ms. Fogelstrom. That’s very helpful to know. Okay, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope and gently press on your belly to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. It doesn't sound… scary, I guess. Just a little… strange. But go ahead.
DOCTOR: It won’t be scary at all, Ms. Fogelstrom. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. I’m listening to your abdomen now. I don't hear any unusual sounds – everything seems normal in that regard. And when I press on your abdomen, it doesn’t seem particularly tender, which is good. It’s slightly firm, but that could be normal. I don’t feel any masses or anything concerning. Everything feels normal structurally. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial physical exam, it sounds like you likely have what we call excessive gas, potentially exacerbated by swallowing air when you drink quickly and from the carbonated beverages. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Okay... that sounds… good, I guess? But what other possibilities are there? I'm a little worried now. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking, Ms. Fogelstrom, and it's perfectly normal to be worried. While it’s likely just excessive gas, we need to rule out other, less common possibilities, just to be safe. These could include things like irritable bowel syndrome , lactose intolerance, or, rarely, a more significant digestive issue. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few simple tests. A complete blood count can rule out any infection, and a stool test can check for any underlying digestive problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay... tests sound okay. I don't like them, but if you think it's best, then yes. What do I have to do for the stool test? Is it... difficult? I’m a little embarrassed to ask.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask, Ms. Fogelstrom. There’s no need to be embarrassed – we deal with these things all the time. For the stool test, I'll give you a collection kit and some instructions. Basically, you’ll collect a small sample of your stool at home and bring it back to the clinic. The instructions will explain how to do it properly. It's not difficult at all, and we have very clear instructions. The lab will analyze the sample to look for any signs of infection or other issues. It’s a very routine test. In the meantime, I recommend trying a few simple things. Try to sip your water slowly, and limit your intake of carbonated beverages. You might also consider avoiding foods that are known to cause gas, like beans, broccoli, and cabbage. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds reasonable. Slow water, less soda, and… try to avoid the beans. I like rice and beans, but… I can try. So, I just collect… a little bit of… you know. And bring it back? How long do I have to do that?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. You'll collect a small sample – about the size of a walnut is sufficient – and bring it back to the clinic. The lab prefers the sample to be fresh, so within 24-48 hours of collecting it is best. I’ll give you a collection container and detailed instructions on how to store it properly. I'm writing up the orders for the CBC and stool test now. It should take a few days for the results to come back. Once we have those, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool – please contact the clinic immediately. It's always best to err on the side of caution. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You explained it all very well, Doctor. Thank you for not making me feel silly about the belching. I was really worried it was something serious. I guess I’ll just… try the slow water and less soda, and collect the… sample. And wait for the results. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fogelstrom. It’s perfectly alright to seek medical attention for anything that’s bothering you, no matter how silly it may seem. I'm glad I could reassure you. I’m optimistic that we’ll be able to figure this out. Here are the lab orders and the stool collection kit instructions. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best, and I'll see you back here once the results are available. Have a good day, Ms. Fogelstrom.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
