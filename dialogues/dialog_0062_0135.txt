DOCTOR: Hi Gerhard, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is… a problem with my ear. There is… liquid coming out. It started maybe three days ago. It is not… painful, but… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gerhard, that's good to know. So, liquid coming from your ear for about three days now, and it’s uncomfortable, but not painful. Let me pull up your chart here… Alright, Gerhard Radillo, age 60. Can you tell me a little more about the liquid?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. My name is Gerhard Radillo. About the liquid… it is… clear. Sometimes a little… yellowish. Not much comes out, only when I… move my head, or if I… press on the ear. It does not smell. I have not… fever, or headache. Just the liquid.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear or slightly yellowish discharge that happens with movement or pressure, no fever or headache. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any hearing loss or ringing in your ear along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes. Maybe a little… quiet. Not much, but… sounds are… not as clear. Like… someone is… far away. No ringing, no. Just… soft sounds. It started… around the same time as the liquid, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some muffled hearing along with the discharge, starting around the same time. Have you experienced anything like this before, Gerhard?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never before. This is… new. I have… small colds sometimes, but… never liquid from the ear. I am… careful to keep my ears dry. I do not swim. I have not… injury to the ear. This is… unexpected.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information. And you haven't had any recent illnesses, injuries, or anything else that might be connected?
PATIENT: No, no. Everything… normal. Just… the usual. A little tired sometimes, but… that is just… age, I think. I eat… regular food. I sleep… okay. No travel… no new people… nothing different. I am… a teacher, you see. Very quiet life.
DOCTOR: A quiet life as a teacher, okay. That’s good to know. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your general health. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No. I… check my blood pressure sometimes at the pharmacy. It is… normal. I do not… take any medicine. My doctor… before, he said I am… healthy man. A little overweight, maybe, but… healthy. No heart problems. No… sugar sickness. I try to… walk every day.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never surgery. Never in hospital. When I was young… small sicknesses. Chickenpox, measles… but nothing serious. I recover… quickly. No operations. No… long stays in hospital. I am… lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, or hearing loss?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is… a good question. My mother… she had… trouble with her heart when she was old. My father… he was… strong man, healthy. My sister… she has… arthritis, in her hands. But… no one in my family… with ears problems. Not that I… remember, anyway. It is… difficult to say. We do not… talk much about health.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some heart issues with your mother, arthritis in your sister, but no known ear problems in the family. That's helpful. Now, just to be complete, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I… eat many things. No trouble with… shellfish, or nuts, or… anything. I have… sensitive skin sometimes, but… no serious allergy. I can take… pain medicine if I need, no problem. I have never… reaction to any medicine.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s good to know. Alright, Gerhard, let's take a look at your ear. If you’ll just sit up here, I'll use an otoscope to examine your ear canal. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will sit. Please… be gentle. I do not like… things in my ear. But I… trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Gerhard. I see a little bit of redness and some fluid in your ear canal. Your eardrum looks intact, which is good. It doesn’t appear to be a severe infection, but there’s definitely something going on. I'm going to check your hearing briefly with a simple test. I’ll put headphones on you and you’ll tell me when you hear a beep. Okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. A beep, you say? I will… listen carefully. Please… tell me what I must do. I… want to help you.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, the test shows a slight decrease in hearing in that ear, which we expected based on your symptoms. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it's most likely you have an outer ear infection, called otitis externa, or swimmer's ear, even though you don't swim. Sometimes it can happen with moisture or irritation. It’s not usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable. I’m going to prescribe you some ear drops with antibiotics to clear up the infection. I'll also recommend keeping your ear dry and avoiding putting anything in your ear. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds good. Ear drops, you say? And… keep it dry. No putting things in… I understand. What kind of… ear drops? And… how long must I… use them? And… are there… side effects? I… want to be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm going to prescribe you Ciprofloxacin ear drops. They're a common antibiotic used for ear infections. You’ll need to put 2 drops in the affected ear twice a day for 7 days. As for side effects, some people experience mild stinging or burning when they first put the drops in, but that usually goes away quickly. Very rarely, people have an allergic reaction, so if you notice any swelling, rash, or severe pain, stop using the drops immediately and contact me. I'll also write you a prescription for a pain reliever, ibuprofen, in case you need it. Here are your prescriptions. I want you to follow up with me in one week to make sure the infection is clearing up. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is… very helpful. Seven days… two drops… twice a day… I will… remember. Ibuprofen… if needed. One week… for follow up. Yes. I… do not think so. But… what if… the drops… do not work? What if… it gets worse? And… can I… still teach? My students… they need me.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. If the drops don't improve your symptoms after 3-4 days, or if the pain gets worse, please contact me immediately. It could mean the infection is more serious or you might need a different treatment. And yes, absolutely you can still teach! There’s no reason you can’t continue teaching as long as you feel comfortable. Just avoid getting water in your ear and try to minimize loud noises if possible. If you find it difficult to hear your students clearly, let them know and ask them to speak up. I’ll also give you a written handout with instructions on how to use the ear drops and what to watch out for. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: Ah… yes. You said… avoid getting water in my ear. What about… showering? Can I… wash my hair? I do not want to… make it worse. This is… important. I… value cleanliness. And… thank you, Doctor. You have… been very patient with me. I… appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: That's a great question. You can shower, but you need to protect your ear from getting water in it. You can use earplugs – you can get them at most pharmacies. Alternatively, you can put a small cotton ball coated in petroleum jelly – like Vaseline – loosely in your ear to create a waterproof barrier. Just be careful not to push it too far in! After showering, gently dry your ear with a soft towel. You’re very welcome, Gerhard. I’m happy to help. It’s important to me that my patients feel comfortable and informed. Do you think that answers your question about showering?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… is perfect. Earplugs… or cotton ball with… petroleum jelly. I understand. I… will be very careful. I… believe that is all. Thank you… again, for your… time, and your… assistance. I… feel much better now. .
DOCTOR: Excellent. You’re very welcome, Gerhard. If you have any concerns at all, don’t hesitate to call the office. Get well soon, and have a good day! .
