DOCTOR: Good morning, Chanz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, uh, right. Sleep, mostly. And...feeling a bit rubbish, to be honest. Not terrible, but definitely not what it used to be. Honestly, it's all a bit fuzzy what "used to be" even is these days. It's just…not great. I think that's the best way to put it. I saw an ad about…optimizing things. Fitness and sleep, that was it. Sounded better than lying around feeling like an old man.
DOCTOR: Right, "not great" and feeling older than you are… I understand. It’s good you’re taking steps to address it. Fuzzy is…a useful description, actually. Let’s try to get a bit more specific. When did you start noticing this… decline in sleep and how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Decline… yeah, that sounds about right. Hmm… honestly, it's hard to say. Things have been…well, a bit of a blur since…well, you know. It's been a few years, at least. Maybe three? Four? After… everything. It wasn’t sudden, it just sort of… crept up on me, I guess. I just started needing more coffee, then more naps, and then… well, here I am. Is that helpful? It feels like I’m just rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all rambling, Chanz. That's actually quite helpful. It sounds like it was a gradual process, which is common. “After everything”...is that related to a particular event or change in your life?
PATIENT: Right. Yes. My wife… she passed. A few years back now. Car accident. Bit of a mess. Look, I don’t really… talk about it much. It’s just… everything changed after that. I just… threw myself into work, fixing instruments. It kept me busy, I suppose. Didn't really stop to think about… anything else. And I suppose that catches up with you eventually, doesn't it? Is it…necessary to go into all the details?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Chanz. You are not required to share anything you’re not comfortable with. I just asked to see if that event might be connected to the changes you’re experiencing. Grief can manifest in many ways, and it's perfectly understandable if it's been impacting your sleep and energy levels. We can absolutely focus on what’s going on now, and how to improve things, if you’d prefer. Would you mind if I ask a few questions about your sleep specifically?
PATIENT: Right, okay. Sleep. Fine. Let's talk about sleep. Honestly, it’s a disaster. I wake up… a lot. Like, multiple times a night. And even when I am asleep, I don’t feel… rested. Like I haven’t even been asleep at all. And then I just lie there, staring at the ceiling. It’s… tedious, really. And the instruments… sometimes I wake up thinking about an instrument I need to fix, and then I can’t get back to sleep. Is that… normal? It feels ridiculous, even saying it.
DOCTOR: It’s not ridiculous at all, Chanz. It’s quite common for stress and worries to disrupt sleep, and it sounds like your work is clearly important to you, and on your mind. Waking up thinking about it makes perfect sense. So, multiple times a night… roughly how many would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know. It varies. Some nights it's just… a couple of times. Other nights it’s… feels like all night. I lie there, tossing and turning. I don’t even bother looking at the clock anymore, it just makes things worse. It’s… frustrating. Honestly, I just feel… exhausted all the time. And I’ve tried things, you know? Warm milk, less coffee… none of it seems to make a difference. Maybe I’m just getting old.
DOCTOR: You're not just getting old, Chanz. And it's good you've tried things – that shows you're motivated to feel better. “Exhausted all the time”...are you experiencing any daytime sleepiness?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely. I can usually drag myself through the day, but… I’m not really awake, you know? Just sort of… going through the motions. Especially in the afternoons. I’ll be working on an instrument, and then just… completely lose focus. And then I have to have another coffee to try and perk myself up. It’s a vicious cycle, really. Honestly, sometimes I just wish I could sleep for a week. Does that sound pathetic?
DOCTOR: Not pathetic at all, Chanz. It sounds… completely understandable. A week of uninterrupted sleep sounds wonderful. Now, just to get a fuller picture, outside of the exhaustion and difficulty sleeping, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… changes? Let me think. My appetite's been… off. Sometimes I don't feel like eating at all, other times I just… eat whatever's in front of me. Not particularly healthy things, usually. And… I don't really see my friends much anymore. Just haven't been feeling very social, I suppose. I used to enjoy going out for a meal or a drink, but… now it just feels like effort. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's definitely relevant, Chanz. Changes in appetite and social withdrawal can be connected to how you’re feeling. Are you experiencing any difficulty concentrating, or feeling easily irritable?
PATIENT: Irritable? Oh, absolutely. Everything gets on my nerves. Customers asking stupid questions, the radio playing annoying songs… everything. And concentrating… forget about it. I keep losing my train of thought, especially when I'm working on a complicated repair. I have to keep starting over, which… doesn't help my temper. It's… unpleasant, really. I’m not usually like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chanz. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like you've been dealing with quite a lot. Now, just a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Nothing major, anyway. The doctor… the one before… he checked me over a few years back, said my blood pressure was a bit high, but he put me on some pills. I think. I stopped taking them, honestly. Didn't seem to be doing much good. And… I had my appendix out when I was a kid. But that was ages ago. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy, usually. Well, I was healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, and an appendectomy as a child. Do you remember the name of the medication you were prescribed for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh… no. Honestly, I don’t really pay attention to those things. The doctor just… gave me a bottle of pills, and I took them for a while. I think it started with an 'A'? Or maybe a 'B'? I really have no idea. It was years ago. Sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I? I just don't remember details very well.
DOCTOR: You’re perfectly helpful, Chanz. It's common to forget details, especially about things from the past. No worries at all. Now, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat whatever I want, take any kind of pill… doesn’t bother me. Honestly, I’ve never even needed to take much medication, until those blood pressure pills. And like I said, I stopped taking those.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just coffee. Lots and lots of coffee. And sometimes a painkiller if my back's bothering me, from bending over instruments all day. But that’s it. Nothing regular. I don't really believe in all that vitamin stuff, honestly. Seems like a waste of money.
DOCTOR: Okay, just coffee and occasional painkillers for your back. And finally, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I fix instruments. I go to work, I come home, I try to sleep. I haven’t really got much of a lifestyle to speak of, to be honest. I used to go fishing with my wife, but… that was a long time ago. Now I mostly just… sit around. Not very exciting, is it?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s understandable that things have changed. No judgment at all. Okay, would you mind if I just listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure quickly?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with, I suppose. I haven’t got all day, you know. Though, frankly, it doesn't really matter what the numbers are. I already feel rubbish.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally for me, Chanz. Okay, your heart sounds a little fast, but I'm not hearing anything concerning. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is elevated, 150/90. Which is higher than we'd like. Okay, everything seems normal so far, Chanz. But the elevated blood pressure, and what you've been describing – the sleep difficulties, loss of appetite, irritability, fatigue – it could be a few things. It could be related to stress and grief, absolutely. It could also be a sign of something else. What I'd like to do is run some blood tests just to rule things out. And I’d also like to talk about some options for managing your blood pressure. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood tests. Fantastic. Just what I needed. Look, honestly, I’m not really a fan of doctors. It’s always bad news, or more tests, or pills I’ll forget to take. But… alright. Fine. If you think it’s necessary, do your tests. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And I still think it's just…everything. The whole situation. Not some fancy medical thing.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Chanz. We’ll keep it as quick and painless as possible. It's just a routine panel – cholesterol, blood sugar, thyroid, a complete blood count – to get a baseline and see if there’s anything obvious going on. And you're right, it could be a lot to do with everything you’ve been through. But it’s always best to rule things out, just to be safe. I’ll write up a requisition for the lab. They’re just down the hall. And while you're waiting, I’m going to give you a handout with some information about sleep hygiene – things you can try to improve your sleep naturally. Then, when we get the results back, we can discuss a plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sleep hygiene. Sounds…pleasant. Fine. Just…let me know when you're finished, and I’ll go get it done. Honestly, it all feels a bit pointless, but… alright. Get it over with. I’ve got instruments to fix, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, instruments are important. Here’s the requisition and the handout. The lab technician will walk you through everything. Don't hesitate to ask them any questions. I'll have a nurse give you a call in a couple of days when the results are back. In the meantime, if things get any worse – if you’re feeling overwhelmed, or having trouble breathing, or experiencing chest pain – please don't hesitate to go to the emergency room. Okay?
PATIENT: Right. Emergency room. Got it. Fine. I'll…try to remember that. Thanks. I suppose I should go get this over with. Thanks for…everything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chanz. Take care of yourself, and I'll be in touch.
