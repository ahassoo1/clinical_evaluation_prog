DOCTOR: Hi Nicky, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Though, frankly, I've seen better equipped offices. But never mind that. It's my patient, Mr. Henderson. He's been bruising…a lot. He’s on that blood thinner, you know, Warfarin. And it seems to be getting worse, despite keeping the dosage steady. It's quite concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising…and it’s worsening even with a stable Warfarin dose. That is concerning. Right, let’s get some more details. How long has Mr. Henderson been noticing the increased bruising?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been…let me think. Perhaps the last month or so. It started subtly, little things, bumping into furniture. Now, it's…well, a rather alarming sight, frankly. He gets a mark just from thinking about touching something. I’ve tried to get him to be more careful, but you know how these elderly patients are. No spatial awareness, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month of progressively worsening bruising despite a stable Warfarin dose. And you've noticed this despite encouraging caution. Has he had any falls, or any injuries that you’re aware of that might explain some of this?
PATIENT: No falls, thankfully. He’s fairly steady on his feet, for his age. No, he hasn’t told me about any injuries. But then again, he tends to downplay things. Thinks I won't take him seriously if he admits to a little mishap. It’s a whole thing. He's a bit…proud, shall we say. Honestly, it’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we're looking at unexplained bruising, worsening over a month, with the possibility he's not reporting all incidents. Has he noticed any bruising in unusual places?
PATIENT: Unusual places… hmm. Now that you mention it, yes. He mentioned some on his abdomen, which is…odd. He doesn’t recall bumping anything there. And, a little around his lower back. He claims it's just from sleeping, but I find that…unlikely. He sleeps on a perfectly good mattress. Not like he's roughhousing in his sleep!
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising on the abdomen and lower back without a clear explanation. That definitely warrants further investigation. And just to be thorough, has he noticed any bleeding from other areas?
PATIENT: Bleeding… let me see. He mentioned his gums bleeding a little when he brushes his teeth, but he’s always had sensitive gums. And, now that I think about it, he complained about a nosebleed last week. Nothing major, he said, just a little trickle. He stopped it with a tissue pretty quickly. But… now that you ask, it seems to be more than usual, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have increased bruising, easy bleeding from gums, and a recent nosebleed that seems more frequent than usual. And has his appetite been normal?
PATIENT: His appetite… well, he says it's normal. But he's a small man, always has been. And he’s a bit… picky. He'll eat his steak, but anything green, forget it. He’s lost a little weight, I think, but he insists it's just the summer heat. He always has an excuse.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible slight weight loss, but attributing it to the heat. Mr. Farson, based on what you've told me, it sounds like Mr. Henderson is experiencing some concerning bleeding issues. While he's on Warfarin, this level of bruising and bleeding, along with the possible weight loss, needs to be investigated. I'd like to do a full physical exam, and I'm going to order some blood work to check his INR levels, complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Finally. Someone with a little sense. Yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. About time, frankly. He's been complaining for weeks, and I'm sure his numbers are off. He’s not exactly the picture of health, you know. Though, I must say, I've always been a good judge of character…and something is definitely amiss. Get to it, Doctor. I have other patients to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get started then. Mr. Henderson, if you could just lie down on the table for me, please. We'll start with a quick look at your skin and then listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also need to check your abdomen. Do you have any pain anywhere in particular that I should be aware of?
