DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side… comes and goes, you see. And I keep getting these water infections. It’s been happening quite a bit lately, actually. The doctor before, he said something about my kidneys… something about lots of little bubbles on them. I can’t quite recall the name of it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Espinueva. Pain in your side and recurrent urinary infections… and a mention of something on your kidneys. It’s quite alright that you don’t recall the exact name; we can certainly look into that. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe the pain in your side?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a sharp pain, not usually. More of a dull ache, really. Feels like a heavy weight, pressing on me. It’s usually on my right side, but sometimes I feel it on the left too. And it comes and goes… some days it’s barely there, other days it’s quite bothersome. It doesn’t shoot through, if that makes sense. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Espinueva. A dull ache, a heavy weight sensation, mostly on the right side but occasionally on the left, and intermittent. Not a shooting pain. Thank you for describing that so clearly. Now, regarding these water infections, how frequently have you been experiencing them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It used to be maybe once or twice a year, but lately… it feels like every few months. Perhaps three or four times in the last year, I’d say. It's uncomfortable, of course, and I have to go to the doctor to get some medicine each time. I try to drink plenty of water, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. So, an increase in frequency to roughly three or four times in the last year, despite increased fluid intake. That certainly warrants further investigation. Could you describe the symptoms you experience during these infections?
PATIENT: Well, the usual things, I suppose. A burning sensation when I go to the toilet, a bit of discomfort… and I have to go very often, even if there’s not much there. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, just generally unwell. And sometimes… a little bit of a temperature, but not a high one. Nothing too severe, thankfully. It's just… inconvenient, and it makes me worry.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. Burning sensation with urination, increased frequency, general malaise, and occasionally a low-grade fever. Now, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, many years ago. And I have a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, it goes up and down sometimes. I take some tablets for that, a small dose. Other than that… not much, really. I try to stay active, go for walks when the weather is nice. I wouldn’t say I’m particularly ill, aside from this pain and the infections.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of appendectomy and managed hypertension. And you mentioned taking medication for your blood pressure – could you tell me the name and dosage of that medication, if you happen to know it?
PATIENT: Oh dear, I’m afraid I’m not very good with names. It’s a small, white tablet… I take one every morning with my breakfast. I get it from the pharmacy, they sort it all out for me. I haven’t needed to change it in quite some time, and the doctor before was happy with it. I could ask my daughter, she keeps a list of all my medicines. She’s very organised.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Espinueva. It’s common to not remember medication details. Knowing your daughter keeps a list is very helpful, and we can certainly confirm that later if needed. Now, are there any allergies we should be aware of – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat most things, and I’ve never had a problem with any medicines. I'm quite lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Espinueva. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you briefly tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well… my mother had some trouble with her kidneys when she was older, I remember that. She wasn't very well in her later years. And my brother… he had diabetes, but he passed away many years ago now. Other than that, I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. My family wasn't one for talking about such things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Espinueva. A history of kidney trouble in your mother and diabetes in your brother. That’s helpful information. Now, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, definitely not. Never smoked a day in my life, and I don't drink alcohol either. Never really had the taste for it, to be honest. And recreational drugs… goodness no! I’m a simple man, Doctor Bakan. I enjoy a good walk, spending time with my grandchildren, and a nice cup of tea. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Mr. Espinueva. A good, healthy lifestyle. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, I’d like to ask you a few general questions about your overall well-being. Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or bowel habits?
PATIENT: Well, my weight has been pretty steady, I think. Perhaps a little bit less lately, but nothing significant. My appetite is alright, I still enjoy my meals. And my bowel habits… well, they're regular enough, if you know what I mean. Nothing out of the ordinary there. I don’t want to bother you with too many details, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Espinueva, you’re not bothering me. It’s important to have a complete picture. Now, finally, are you currently experiencing any pain anywhere else in your body, or any other symptoms that we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My knees get a bit stiff sometimes, especially in the cold weather. And my back aches a little if I’ve been bending over for too long. But nothing major, just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Other than that… no, I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. That's very thorough. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. We'll start with checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and gently examine your abdomen, listening for any unusual sounds and checking for tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgement completely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s begin. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Just relax and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 148/92. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Pulse is 76 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Starting on your right side… any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yes… a little bit. Not sharp, just… a dull ache, like I was telling you. More when you press down firmly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about here, on your left side?
PATIENT: A little bit there too, but not as much as on the right. It’s a… a hard to describe. It’s not a pain, exactly. More like… pressure.
DOCTOR: And down here, lower right quadrant?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, that’s a bit more tender. A bit sharper, if I’m honest. Still not excruciating, but definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: And finally, lower left quadrant?
PATIENT: Not much there, Doctor. Just… a little bit of discomfort, but nothing like the right side. It feels… different.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Thank you for your patience. Based on this examination, there is tenderness in both lower and upper quadrants, with more pronounced tenderness in the lower right quadrant. I also noted some mild guarding of your abdomen, which suggests some underlying inflammation. I see from your records that you had a urine analysis performed three months ago, which showed evidence of a urinary tract infection. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a repeat urine analysis with culture to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We will also order a kidney ultrasound to investigate the cause of the pain and to further evaluate the "bubbles" on your kidneys that you mentioned. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds like a lot of tests, Doctor. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… what does all that mean? Is it something serious? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Espinueva. It does sound like a lot, but it's important to get a thorough understanding of what's going on. The tests will help us rule out any serious conditions and pinpoint the cause of your pain and recurrent infections. The complete blood count will check for signs of infection or inflammation. The comprehensive metabolic panel will assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. And the repeat urine analysis with culture will identify any bacteria causing the infection. The kidney ultrasound will provide a detailed image of your kidneys, allowing us to evaluate their structure and identify any abnormalities. The "bubbles" on your kidneys, as you described them, could be a number of things. It’s possible they are benign cysts, or they could indicate something more significant. The ultrasound will help us determine that. Typically, it takes a few days to get the results back – usually within 48 to 72 hours. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, please continue to drink plenty of fluids and monitor your symptoms. If you experience any fever, chills, or worsening pain, please contact the office immediately. Do you feel comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds alright. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It’s much less frightening when I understand what’s happening. So… just drink plenty of water and wait for the results. I can do that. And if anything gets worse, I’ll call. Thank you again, Doctor Bakan. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. That’s my job. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. Now, I will send the orders for these tests to the lab. The receptionist will schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the results are available. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I’ll just… wait for the phone call. Thank you again for your time and your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Bakan. You too.
