DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Pleasure to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… now let me see. My wife, bless her heart, she said something about… papers. Important papers. For work, I think? Something about needing time… or maybe… being unable to work? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Something about FMLA, she mentioned that name. Does that ring a bell? I’m Directors, Religious Activities and Education, you see. It’s… a lot of responsibility.
DOCTOR: Yes, FMLA – that stands for the Family and Medical Leave Act. It allows eligible employees unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons. It sounds like your wife is concerned about paperwork related to that. To clarify, are you seeking leave from your position as Director of Religious Activities and Education, or is your wife needing assistance with paperwork related to her potential leave?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… that’s helpful, thank you. No, no, it’s me. It’s definitely me needing the papers. Though… honestly, I’m not entirely sure why right now. It’s… something has been troubling me. A bit of a fog, you see. My wife just said I needed to get this sorted, and she handles most of the… details. She’s very organized. I just… feel a bit off, and I think it’s affecting my work. Is that… does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Limtiaco. It's very common to feel "off" or have trouble concentrating when something is troubling you. We can certainly explore what's going on and see if we can identify the cause. To start, could you describe what you mean by "feeling off"?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s… hard to explain. It’s not a pain, not exactly. More like… things don’t stick in my head like they used to. Names, dates… even what I had for breakfast this morning. It's frustrating, to be honest. I used to be very sharp, very organized myself, but lately… it’s like trying to hold water in my hands. And I forget things. Important things, sometimes. That’s why my wife insisted I come. She said I was repeating myself, asking the same questions. It’s… a bit embarrassing, to be frank. I’m still Directors, you know? I need to be… present.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds concerning, and it's good that your wife noticed and encouraged you to seek medical attention. It’s not at all embarrassing to address these things, Mr. Limtiaco, and it’s much better to identify the cause now. To get a clearer picture, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you experienced any recent head injuries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Head injuries… hmm. Not that I recall. Nothing major, certainly. I might have bumped my head a few times, you know, getting into the attic, things like that. But nothing serious enough to go to the doctor about. I was always pretty careful. It’s just… this fog came on gradually, over the past few months, I think. Not suddenly after an accident or anything. It’s… subtle, but persistent. It’s just… unsettling. Now that I think about it, I did have a nasty cold last winter. A bad one. Could that… could that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Limtiaco. A severe viral illness, like a bad cold, can sometimes be associated with cognitive difficulties, though usually those resolve as the illness subsides. The gradual onset you describe is also important. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, yes, I was diagnosed with that a few years back. I take medication for it, regularly. My doctor, Dr. Ahuna, he’s been good about it. Keeps it under control, thankfully. Diabetes, no. Never had that. Heart disease… no, not that I’m aware of. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and fruits. My wife is very strict about that! She’s a wonderful woman. We’ve been married a long time, you see. I can’t remember exactly how long… but a long time. It's just… frustrating not remembering things like that. Does that make sense? About remembering things? I’m rambling again, aren't I?
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Mr. Limtiaco. It's perfectly natural to feel frustrated, and it’s helpful for me to understand everything. And yes, I see that you're being treated for hypertension. That's good information. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just the blood pressure medication, I believe. Dr. Ahuna hasn’t added anything else recently. Oh! Wait… I take a multivitamin every morning. And sometimes, if I’m having trouble sleeping – which has been happening more lately, now that I think about it – I take a little bit of… something. My wife buys it for me. It’s… a natural sleep aid, she says. Something with… chamomile, I think? It’s in a little bottle. I can’t remember the name of it… honestly, I can barely remember what I ate for lunch. It’s a bit frightening, to be frank. I’ve always prided myself on my memory. It's just… slipping away. And it's affecting my work, you see. I'm forgetting important meetings, repeating myself to my colleagues… it's not a good look for Directors.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. It's very helpful to know about the sleep aid. It’s important for us to consider everything you’re taking, even over-the-counter medications, as they can sometimes contribute to cognitive changes. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I'm aware of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. A little bit of hay fever in the spring sometimes, but nothing serious. Just a little bit of sneezing and a runny nose. I don’t take anything for it, I just… try to stay indoors when the pollen count is high. My wife always tells me to wear a mask when I’m gardening, but I usually forget! Honestly, I forget a lot of things these days. It's… it's exhausting, to be frank. Trying to keep track of everything, trying to remember what I've already said… it's wearing me down. And I'm still Directors, you see. I need to be sharp, I need to be focused… I need to be present. But it's getting harder and harder.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your daily life and your role as Directors. Now, let’s move on to family history. Are there any instances of memory problems, dementia, or other neurological conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a tricky one. My mother… she had some trouble with her memory towards the end, yes. But we just chalked it up to old age, you see? She lived a long life. My father… he was always sharp as a tack, right until the very end. No memory problems that I recall. My siblings… they seem fine, as far as I know. We don't see each other very often, you see. A little bit of forgetfulness, perhaps, but nothing serious. I suppose everyone forgets things as they get older, right? But this… this feels different. This feels… deeper. It's not just forgetting where I put my keys, it's forgetting entire conversations, forgetting important meetings… it's frightening, to be frank. And I'm still Directors, you see. I need to be on top of things, I need to be present… but it's getting harder and harder. Honestly, I'm starting to worry about my job.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. That's helpful to know about your mother. We may need to gather more information about that later. Now, let's talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Social history… hmm. No, I don't smoke. Never have. My wife wouldn't allow it! And I don't use any recreational drugs, no. Never had any interest in those. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, yes. Red wine, mostly. But just one glass, maybe two on special occasions. I don’t drink every day, no. And I certainly don’t drink to excess. My wife keeps a close eye on me, you see! She's very responsible. Honestly, I’m a pretty simple man. I enjoy gardening, reading, spending time with my wife… and trying to remember what I had for breakfast this morning. It's just… getting harder and harder, you see. And I'm still Directors, you see. I need to be sharp, I need to be focused… but it's getting harder and harder. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m losing myself.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. That's helpful to know. Now, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief physical and neurological exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Honestly, I’m just glad to be talking to someone about this. It’s been weighing on me for so long. Just… getting it off my chest feels… good. A little bit scary, perhaps, but good. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you see. I just want to get back to being… myself. And I'm still Directors, you see. I need to be on top of things… but it's getting harder and harder. Just… please, let's figure this out.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. We will do our best to figure this out. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138 over 82, and your pulse is 76 and regular. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and assess your coordination and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course, Doctor. I can do that. It's a bit… challenging, to be honest. My eyes feel a little… shaky. It's not normally like this, you see. I used to have very steady hands, very good coordination. But lately… things have been a little off. I've been dropping things, bumping into things… it's embarrassing, to be frank. And it's getting worse, you see. It's affecting my work, it's affecting my life… it's starting to feel like I'm losing control. And I'm still Directors, you see. I need to be on top of things… but it’s getting harder and harder. Just… please, let's figure this out.
DOCTOR: I see. And that’s good information to have, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps forward, and then backward?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Oh… oh dear. That's… not very good, is it? I feel a little… wobbly. I nearly lost my balance there. It’s not normally like this, you see. I used to be very steady on my feet, very good coordination. But lately… things have been a little off. I've been bumping into things, dropping things… and now this. It's frightening, to be frank. I’m starting to worry about falling. And I’m still Directors, you see. I need to be on top of things… but it’s getting harder and harder. Just… please, let's figure this out. I feel a bit… embarrassed.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. That was helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief cognitive assessment, just a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A cognitive assessment… yes, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Honestly, I’m a little nervous about this. I’m afraid of what you might find, you see. But I want to figure out what’s going on, I need to know… I just want to get back to being… myself. And I’m still Directors, you see. I need to be on top of things… but it’s getting harder and harder. Just… please, let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. We’ll take it one step at a time. This isn't a test, just a way for me to get a better understanding of what’s going on. First, could you please tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. That’s… that’s a good question. Let me see… It's August… yes, August. But what day is it? Oh dear… It's… the 2nd, isn't it? Yes, the 2nd of August. 2025, of course. But I had to… think about that. I used to know these things automatically, you see. It’s just… slipping away. And I'm still Directors, you see. I need to be on top of things… but it’s getting harder and harder. Just… please, let's figure this out. I feel a bit… embarrassed.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where we are… hmm. Oh dear. This is… difficult. Is this… a doctor’s office? Yes, I think so. A doctor’s office… But what city? What state? Oh dear… I know I am at the doctor's... but the details... they're just... fuzzy. I know it's suburban... my wife mentioned that. But beyond that... I'm drawing a blank. It's just... slipping away, you see. And I'm still Directors, you see. I need to be on top of things… but it’s getting harder and harder. Just… please, let's figure this out. I feel very confused.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s alright. We are at a doctor’s office in a suburban area, yes. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words, and I’ll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple… table… penny. I think I’ve got them. But I’m worried I’ll forget them. Honestly, everything feels… uncertain. And I'm still Directors, you see. I need to be on top of things… but it’s getting harder and harder. Just… please, let's figure this out. I feel very anxious. It's just… slipping away, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your past. Can you tell me what year you graduated from high school?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a… difficult question. Let me see… High school… that was a long time ago. I think it was… the 1970s? Yes, I think so. But what year specifically? I’m just drawing a blank. Honestly, everything feels… fuzzy. And I'm still Directors, you see. I need to be on top of things… but it’s getting harder and harder. Just… please, let's figure this out. I feel very confused and frustrated. It’s just… slipping away.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, do you recall what three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Three words… hmm. Let me see… Oh dear. This is… difficult. Apple… table… something… penny? No… I can’t… I can’t remember the third word. I’m sorry. I can remember apple and penny… but the other one… it’s just… gone. I’m sorry. And I’m still Directors, you see. I need to be on top of things… but it’s getting harder and harder. Just… please, let's figure this out. I feel very defeated. It’s just… slipping away. It’s terrifying.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s alright. Based on your responses to these questions, and the findings from the physical and neurological exam, I am concerned about possible cognitive impairment. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but your difficulties with memory, orientation, and recall are significant. I want to order some further testing to help determine the cause of these issues. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a Vitamin B12 level, and a brain MRI to rule out any underlying medical conditions or structural abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, I need to understand… I need to get back to being… myself. And I’m still Directors, you see. I need to be on top of things… but it’s getting harder and harder. Just… please, let’s figure this out. A brain MRI… that sounds… scary, but if it will help… yes. Please. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… I just want my life back. I feel very anxious and scared. It's just… slipping away. What if… what if it’s something serious?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel anxious, Mr. Limtiaco. It is a scary thought, but it's important to remember that testing will give us answers, and we can develop a plan based on those results. Many conditions can cause cognitive difficulties, and some are treatable. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests and the MRI now. The blood tests can be done at the lab right down the hall. For the MRI, the scheduler will call you to arrange an appointment. They will explain the procedure and any necessary preparations. In the meantime, I would recommend that you continue with your daily activities as much as possible, but avoid any potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving long distances or operating heavy machinery. Also, I would like you to bring your wife to your next appointment so we can discuss these results together. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Yes, I think so. What… what could it be? What are the possibilities? And… will I be able to continue working? I’m Directors, you see… I have responsibilities. And… my wife. What if it’s something serious? What if… what if I forget her? Honestly, I'm terrified. I just… I just want to know what’s going on. And I’m still Directors, you see. It’s just… it’s just so hard to think straight. Is there anything I can do… anything at all… to help myself right now? It’s just… slipping away.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid questions, Mr. Limtiaco, and it's completely understandable to feel frightened. It’s important to be upfront that I cannot give you a definitive answer until we have the results of the tests. However, some possible causes of cognitive difficulties include vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, medication side effects, mild stroke, early stages of dementia, and depression. Regarding your work, it's too early to say whether you will be able to continue in your current role. We will need to assess the severity of your symptoms and the results of the tests to make a determination. It is possible that accommodations could be made, but that depends on the underlying cause. As for your wife, I understand your concern, and I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to help you manage your symptoms and preserve your cognitive function. Right now, the best thing you can do is focus on getting adequate rest, eating a healthy diet, and avoiding stress. It may also be helpful to engage in mentally stimulating activities, such as puzzles or reading, but don’t push yourself too hard. We will also discuss some resources for support groups and counseling at your next appointment. I know this is a lot to take in, and I want you to know that you're not alone. We will work through this together, step by step. Do you want me to write down those recommendations for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Write it down. Adequate rest… healthy diet… avoid stress… mentally stimulating activities… And… write down the resources for support groups and counseling. It’s just… it's hard to remember everything. And write down my wife’s name, so I don’t forget. Her name is… Leilani. Yes, Leilani Limtiaco. It’s just… it’s just so hard to think straight. And I’m still Directors, you see. I need to be on top of things… but it’s just… slipping away. It’s terrifying. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening. I feel… a little bit better, just talking to you. But still… very scared.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things, and I’m glad you did. Here you go. I’ve written down: Adequate Rest Healthy Diet Avoid Stress Mentally Stimulating Activities Leilani Limtiaco Support Groups: Counseling Services: Please remember that I’m here for you, and we will work through this together. You're not alone, and we will find answers. Your wife is your biggest supporter, and I highly encourage her to attend your next appointment with you. I’ve also scheduled a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, once we have the results of the tests. Please call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening. And thank you for writing everything down. I… I don’t know what I would do without that. It’s just… it's hard to remember everything. Two weeks… yes. I’ll remember that. I think. And… thank you for being so kind. It’s just… it’s terrifying. I think… I think I'll go home now. And… I’ll try to remember everything you said. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. And remember, you’re not alone. .
