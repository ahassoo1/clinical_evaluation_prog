DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. I'm Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um, well, it's my speech, I think. It feels... off. Like I'm not saying things clearly. It’s hard to explain, really. I just noticed it recently.
DOCTOR: I see. “Off,” you say. And you’ve noticed this recently – can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… it’s a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Maybe… the last week or so? It's not constant, though. Some days it's worse than others. I don't really remember when it started exactly. It just sort of… appeared.
DOCTOR: Right. “Sort of appeared.” And can you describe what you mean by “not saying things clearly?
PATIENT: It's like… the words get jumbled, I suppose. Or maybe I don't fully form the words before they come out. My husband pointed it out, said I was slurring a bit. I didn’t really notice it myself at first. It's not a lot of slurring, but enough for him to mention it.
DOCTOR: Hm. And is this difficulty with speech accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… not that I've noticed, no. I haven't had any trouble with, like, walking or anything. No headaches or dizziness. Just the speech, as far as I can tell. I haven’t been feeling unwell otherwise, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any recent illness, even a cold or the flu, prior to this speech issue starting?
PATIENT: Um… now that you mention it, I think I had a bit of a cold maybe two weeks ago? It wasn't anything major, just a sniffle and a cough for a few days. I didn't even bother going to the doctor for it. It cleared up on its own. Could that be related? I honestly don’t know.
DOCTOR: It’s possible. We'll need to consider all possibilities. Now, Ms. Swaby, I’m going to ask some questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… let me see. I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. Nothing major, no. I think just the usual childhood things, you know, chickenpox and such. I don’t really recall any serious illnesses or diagnoses. I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That is good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t believe so. Not that I can recall. I think I would remember something like that, wouldn’t I? I've never really been one for hospitals or doctors, to be honest. I try to stay away if I can.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… Well, my mother is still alive, she’s doing alright for her age, thank goodness. My father passed away a few years ago now. I don’t really know much about his medical history, to be honest. We weren’t very close. As far as I know, there wasn’t anything major on either side of the family, like… heart trouble or anything like that. But I'm not really sure. It's a bit hazy, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't take any pills or anything like that. I prefer to just... get on with things, you know? I try to stay healthy with good food and rest. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I don't think so. No known allergies, not that I'm aware of. I've never had any reactions to anything, thankfully. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. My husband always asks when we go to new restaurants, but I always tell him I’m fine. It’s just never been an issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Swaby. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your speech and neurological function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go right ahead. I just want to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit up there for me, please. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your cranial nerves – that involves some simple tests of your eye movements, facial strength, and tongue function. Finally, I’ll assess your reflexes and coordination. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to have you follow my finger with your eyes… Do not move your head… Look to the left… Look to the right… Look up… Look down… Good. Now, I want you to smile for me… and frown… Okay. Can you stick out your tongue?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? I'm following your finger. It's a little strange, but I can do it. I hope I'm not doing it wrong. Is everything alright so far?
DOCTOR: Good, good. No issues there. Now, can you say "hello" for me?
PATIENT: Hello. Is that alright, Doctor? It feels… a bit clumsy, I suppose. Hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I do detect a slight slurring. It's subtle, but it is present. Now, I want you to repeat after me: “Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.”
PATIENT: “Pee-ter... Pipe-er... pick-ed… a peck… of… pick-led… pep-pers.” Oh dear. That was harder than I thought. It feels like my tongue is… thick, or something. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. Now I am going to test your reflexes and coordination. Please place your hands in your lap. I’m going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. Good, reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, I want you to touch your nose with your finger, then touch my finger. And repeat. Now, close your eyes and tell me which direction I’m moving my finger.
PATIENT: Okay… I think so. Um… up? No… down? I’m not very good at this, Doctor. It feels… confusing. Like I can’t quite tell where your finger is. Is something wrong? I’m starting to get a little worried.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. Based on my examination, there are some subtle neurological findings – namely, the slight slurring of your speech, the difficulty with articulation, and the slight incoordination with the finger-to-nose test and localization. These findings, coupled with your recent history of a cold, raise some concerns. Now, I need to be upfront with you. It’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but these symptoms could indicate a number of things, ranging from a simple post-viral neurological issue to something more serious. To rule out anything concerning, I recommend we order a brain MRI to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Additionally, I’d like to order some blood tests to check for any underlying inflammation or infection. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A brain… MRI? Blood tests? Oh dear. Something serious, you say? Yes, Doctor, I understand. It sounds… frightening. If that’s what you think is best to find out what’s wrong, then yes, please. I want to know what’s happening, even if it’s not good news. What does an MRI involve? And will the blood tests be painful? I’m just… a little scared, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Ms. Swaby, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be anxious. Let me explain. An MRI – magnetic resonance imaging – is a painless imaging test that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the inside of your brain. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it will be noisy, but it doesn’t hurt at all. It typically takes about 30-60 minutes. The blood tests involve a simple needle prick in your arm to draw a small sample of blood. There will be some brief discomfort, but it’s usually very quick and well-tolerated. I also want to be clear – I’m not saying you have anything serious, but it’s important to investigate these symptoms thoroughly to rule out any potential causes. I’ll explain everything in detail once we have the results of the tests. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and ensuring you get plenty of rest. Do you have any questions about the tests or anything else I’ve said?
PATIENT: Okay… no strenuous activity, plenty of rest. I can do that. Thirty to sixty minutes in a noisy machine… and a needle prick. It doesn’t sound pleasant, but if it helps… yes, I understand. Um… will the MRI show everything? Like, can it see if there’s anything… wrong with my brain? And will I need someone to drive me to the hospital? I don’t think I should drive myself afterwards, should I? I’m sorry for all the questions, Doctor. I’m just… worried.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Ms. Swaby. That's what I’m here for. Yes, the MRI is very sensitive and should be able to detect any abnormalities within your brain, such as inflammation, lesions, or structural changes. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. And you are absolutely correct – you should not drive yourself to the hospital for the MRI. The hospital may administer a contrast dye during the scan, which can cause temporary drowsiness. It’s best to have someone drive you, and preferably stay with you afterwards. I will write you a referral for the MRI and a list of instructions. My office will contact you to schedule the appointment. We'll also schedule the blood tests for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as worsening speech difficulties, weakness, numbness, vision changes, or severe headache, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. No driving, MRI referral, blood tests tomorrow, and emergency room if anything gets worse. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I feel… a little better knowing what to expect, even if it is a bit frightening. Thank you, Doctor Hembrey. I think that's all my questions for now. I’ll wait for the office to call about scheduling the appointments. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. You're very welcome. I’m glad I could address your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if any questions arise before your appointments. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and try to rest. .
