DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly, it’s a bit of a blur why I’m here. Something about my… a patient of mine? Yellowing, I think? It’s all very hazy, dear. I do apologize, my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. It’s perfectly common for memory to change as we get older. It sounds like you're referring to jaundice – a yellowing of the skin and eyes. And you said a patient of yours?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A patient… a young man, I believe. He’s been… unwell for some time now. Liver trouble, wasn’t it? Or something of that nature. I… I used to handle the, the… the numbers, for his treatment. All very precise work. It’s just… the details escape me, you understand. I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately, either. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Annelle, thank you for mentioning that. It sounds like you were involved in a healthcare setting, perhaps as a medical biller or administrator?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear, not a biller. Much more… technical. I calculated the, the… dosage for radiation. Medical Dosimetrist, that’s what they called it. Very precise work, ensuring the right amount… for the treatment. Though, truthfully, it’s been years. And a great deal has happened since then. I worry I’m not making much sense. Is this young man still under your care? Or… am I remembering incorrectly?
DOCTOR: You are making perfect sense, Annelle. It’s very helpful to know you were a Medical Dosimetrist. That gives me a better understanding of your background. You mentioned a young man… and you're concerned about him?
PATIENT: Yes, very concerned. He came to me with… well, I think it was hepatitis. Or some kind of liver disease. His skin was terribly yellow, and he was so very tired. I’m afraid I don’t recall his name, and I haven’t seen him in… goodness, I couldn’t say how long. Months, certainly. Perhaps even years. I just… I feel responsible. Are you able to help him? Is that why I’m here? I feel terribly flustered; I truly wish I could remember more details.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to feel flustered, Annelle. We’ll take things slowly. It’s admirable that you feel responsible for your former patients. Do you recall anything about where you worked when you were treating this young man?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… difficult. It was a hospital, I believe. A rather large one. Lots of… shiny floors. And beeping machines. It wasn’t a local hospital, I don’t think. We… we travelled to get there. It was a modern facility, very clean. I seem to recall a lot of paperwork, endless forms. It wasn’t a pleasant place, to be honest. I… I really wish I could be more helpful. I’m quite useless, aren’t I? I apologize for wasting your time. Perhaps I should just… go home.
DOCTOR: You are not useless at all, Annelle, and you’re not wasting my time. Even small details can be helpful. Let’s try this: do you remember approximately when you were working at this hospital?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a challenge. It was… a long time ago. Before the internet was so prevalent, I think. Before everyone had those… mobile telephones. Perhaps the early 2000s? Maybe late 90s? I truly couldn’t say with any certainty. It feels like a lifetime ago. I had… other responsibilities then, as well. A sick mother, if I recall correctly. It’s all so muddled. I’m afraid I’m not being a very good patient, am I? I simply can't focus.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Annelle. It’s understandable that details are hazy after so much time. Given that you were calculating radiation dosages, and you're experiencing some memory difficulties, it might be a good idea to do a quick review of your current health. We can start with some basic questions about your medications and any other symptoms you’re experiencing besides the memory issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I suppose I should be checked over, given everything. I don’t take any medications regularly, no. Just… an occasional pain reliever for my arthritis. And, as I mentioned, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I also… I get tired very easily. And my appetite isn’t very good. Oh, and sometimes I feel a little… confused. But then, I always was a bit scatterbrained. Is that helpful? I’m ready to go home if you wish. I don't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Annelle. Thank you. The fatigue, loss of appetite, and confusion are all things we should investigate further. Before we proceed, I'd like to ask about your allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Let me think… I don’t think so. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything, not that I recall. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was many years ago. And I’m rather careful about what I eat. No shellfish, I don’t care for it. I can’t recall any specific allergies, no. Though, now that you mention it, sometimes my skin gets a little itchy after I use certain soaps… but it’s probably nothing. I truly wish I had a better memory for these things! Is this young man being cared for? That is my biggest concern, if you don't mind me asking again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern for the young man, Annelle. We will do our best to see if we can locate any records. Now, regarding your skin, that’s good to know. It may be worth noting whether any specific soaps cause the itchiness. Are there any family medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that’s another difficult area. My mother had… heart trouble, I believe. And my father… he worked very hard, a farmer. He didn’t have any specific illnesses, so far as I recall. We weren’t a particularly healthy family, to be honest. Lots of aches and pains. No history of anything serious like cancer or… or anything genetic, no. Though, my grandmother, on my mother’s side… she was a bit… eccentric. She had trouble remembering things, too. Perhaps it runs in the family? I wish I could be more precise, but my memory is simply dreadful. Is that young man… will he be alright? That is what I keep worrying about.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Annelle. You're doing your best. Knowing about your mother's heart trouble and your grandmother's memory issues is helpful. We will take everything into consideration. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no, no. Never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life, and I don't drink alcohol. I find it… unpleasant. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I was raised to be a respectable woman. I do enjoy a cup of tea in the evenings, and perhaps a small biscuit. But nothing stronger than that. I live alone, and I try to keep a tidy home. I don’t have many visitors, but I manage. I'm a simple woman, doctor. I truly wish I could provide more details about this young man… it’s terribly frustrating not to remember.
DOCTOR: You are providing all the details you can, Annelle, and that is perfectly sufficient. Now, I would like to do a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Go ahead. I suppose it can’t hurt. Though I warn you, I’m a bit ticklish. And my joints ache, so please be gentle. I just hope you can find out what’s wrong with me… and perhaps, if we’re lucky, locate this young man. He was a nice boy, if I recall correctly. A bit quiet, but very polite. Please be careful with my blood pressure, doctor. I get anxious easily.
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. I will be very gentle and take my time. I'll start by checking your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly so. It’s likely due to some anxiety, which is understandable. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. I’m hearing a slight murmur and your breath sounds are a little diminished. I'll check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is within the normal range. Now, let’s just take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Your ears and nose look fine. Your throat is a little inflamed, but nothing too concerning. Overall, your exam findings are fairly mild. Given your memory issues, fatigue, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order some blood work and a chest x-ray to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work and a chest x-ray. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, and perhaps, if it’s not too much to ask, find out what happened to that young man. He shouldn’t be left alone if he’s unwell. I… I’ll try to remember his name, if I can. This whole situation is terribly upsetting. Do you think the blood work will take long? I have… a small appointment later this afternoon. It's not important, really. Just a… a hair appointment. But I wouldn't want to keep anyone waiting.
DOCTOR: The blood work shouldn't take long at all, Annelle. We'll get the results back within a few days. The chest x-ray will also be relatively quick. We can schedule it for tomorrow morning. As for your hair appointment, we can certainly work around that. It’s not a problem. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work now. Do you have any preferences for where you’d like to get the tests done?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s kind of you to ask. There’s a lab just down the street, on Elm Street. It's called… Miller’s Lab, I believe. They’re very efficient there. And the nurse is quite nice. I go there for my annual checkups, when I remember to schedule them. Miller’s Lab would be perfect, if that’s alright. And thank you for being so patient with me, doctor. I truly appreciate it. I do hope you can find out something about this young man. He deserves proper care, if he's unwell. Perhaps you could check the hospital records? That is where I last saw him, I believe.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Annelle. I will put in a request to check the hospital records for any information regarding a patient matching your description. It may take some time, but we will do our best. Here you go. This requisition will allow you to get your blood work done at Miller’s Lab. Once you have the results, you can either bring them back here, or they can be faxed directly to our office. The number is on the form. I'll also schedule your chest x-ray for tomorrow morning. Does 9:00 AM work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, 9:00 AM is… perfect. Thank you for arranging everything so efficiently. I do appreciate it. I hope I haven’t been too much trouble. I truly wish I could remember more details about this young man… his name, his condition, anything that might help you locate him. But my memory is simply dreadful. I will go to Miller’s Lab first thing tomorrow morning. And then, I’ll come here for the chest x-ray. Thank you again, doctor. You’ve been very kind. I believe that is all I can do for now, correct? I can go home and… try to rest. Perhaps I will remember something overnight. .
DOCTOR: That is all for now, Annelle. Please don’t hesitate to call if you remember anything else, or if you have any questions. We will be in touch once we have the results of your blood work and chest x-ray. Have a good rest of your day and we'll see you tomorrow.
