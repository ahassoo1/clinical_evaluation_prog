DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Deschane, good morning! Well, I've been getting chills lately, and it's kind of worrying me. It's not like a fever chill, just… cold shivers. It’s been going on for a couple of days now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills for a couple of days. And you say it's not accompanied by a fever?
PATIENT: No, no fever. I checked my temperature a couple of times, and it’s been normal. That’s what’s weird about it, actually. It just… comes and goes. I feel okay otherwise, mostly. A little tired, maybe, but that could be anything, right?
DOCTOR: Right. "Little tired." And when you say "comes and goes," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay, let me think. It happens mostly in the evenings, I guess. Like, I'll be sitting and watching TV, and suddenly I get a shiver. Then it’ll pass in a few minutes. Sometimes it happens when I’m just relaxing, not even doing anything. It's not constant, definitely not. And it doesn’t seem to be linked to anything specific, like being cold or anything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these chills?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really. No cough, no sore throat, no aches or pains. My appetite is normal, I guess. I haven’t felt nauseous or anything like that. Oh, wait… actually, now that you mention it, I have been a bit more thirsty than usual. But I just figured it was because it’s been hot lately. Is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Increased thirst could be relevant. Let’s go through a bit more of your history, just to be thorough. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And I broke my wrist once, but it healed perfectly. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy. I try to eat well, and I go for walks when I can. Nothing major, honestly. Oh, and I was divorced about a year ago, if that matters? It was pretty stressful, but I'm doing okay now.
DOCTOR: Divorce is certainly a significant life event. Alright. Any family history of autoimmune diseases, thyroid problems, or anything like recurring infections?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had diabetes, but nothing like… autoimmune stuff. My grandma, on my dad’s side, she used to have a lot of colds, like, all the time, but that was when she was really old. And she smoked, so… I don’t know if that counts. I honestly don’t know much about my family’s medical history, to be honest. My parents weren’t really the type to talk about that stuff. Is there anything specific I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon for patients to not have a detailed family history, unfortunately. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. And I’ll take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but other than that, nothing regular. I really try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I prefer just getting rest when I'm not feeling well. Does the multivitamin matter? I’ve been taking it on and off for years.
DOCTOR: It's good to know. Now, allergies?
PATIENT: No known allergies, thankfully! No food allergies, no medication allergies, no seasonal allergies… I’m pretty lucky that way, I think. I can get a little sniffly sometimes during pollen season, but nothing a tissue can’t handle. Do you want me to go through anything else? I'm happy to answer whatever you need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Could you please step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Here we go…
DOCTOR: 70 kilograms. And your height is 153 centimeters, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right! 153 centimeters. I'm not very tall, I know. Is that… a lot of weight? I haven't weighed myself in a while.
DOCTOR: It's not about "a lot" of weight, Ms. Aslan. It's about what's healthy for you. Your BMI is 30.1, which falls into the obese category. However, BMI isn’t perfect and doesn’t take muscle mass into account. Let’s proceed with the exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your thyroid. Please take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… It feels a little cold in here, actually. Is it always this chilly in the office? And um, just so I know, what does checking my thyroid involve? I keep hearing about thyroid problems. Is that what you think might be wrong?
DOCTOR: The office temperature is often kept cool for comfort. And you're right to be aware of thyroid issues; they can sometimes present with vague symptoms. Palpating the thyroid allows me to feel for any enlargement or nodules. Right now, your thyroid feels normal in size and consistency. No nodules detected. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay… Oh! That's a little startling! Is everything okay? They seem fine, right? I don't have any… weird reflexes? I’m not very good at medical stuff, obviously.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Everything appears to be within normal limits so far. It's good you're asking questions – it shows you're engaged in your health. To rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. This will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough! A complete blood count, metabolic panel, and TSH… Um… will they take a lot of blood? I’m not a big fan of needles, if I’m being honest. And what exactly will these tests tell us? Is it something serious? I’m probably worrying too much, right?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be anxious about blood tests. They will require a standard vial of blood—nothing excessive. The complete blood count checks for infection or anemia. The metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function, and electrolytes. The TSH test specifically checks your thyroid hormone levels. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, Ms. Aslan, but these tests are necessary to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We'll get the results back within a few days, and then we can discuss them and formulate a plan. Do you have any other concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes a little more sense. So, it’s just to be sure, and rule things out. And it’s a standard amount of blood. Alright. No, I don’t think so. Just… can you tell me where I go to get the tests done? And do I need to fast beforehand? I always forget those things.
DOCTOR: Here’s the address for the lab. You will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw – that means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. You can schedule an appointment online or just walk in. Once you have the results, you can either have them sent directly to our office, or you can pick them up and bring them to your next appointment. Do you have any questions about scheduling the tests or the fasting requirements?
PATIENT: Okay, 8 hours fasting, got it. And they can send the results directly to the office, that’s easiest. I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Deschane. You’ve been very patient with my… worrying! I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I’ll schedule the tests as soon as I get home. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Like, should I be resting more or anything?
DOCTOR: Rest is always beneficial, but no specific restrictions are necessary while we await the results. Keep me informed of any changes in your symptoms, of course. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Now, if that will be all, Ms. Aslan?
PATIENT: Yes, that's everything, I think. Thank you again, Dr. Deschane. I’ll see you when the results are back. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: Good day, Ms. Aslan.
