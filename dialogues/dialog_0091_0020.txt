DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Avril. It is nice to meet you too. I am here for… the talk on the computer? My daughter, she make the appointment for me. I do not feel very good lately, but I not know exactly what is wrong. It is… everything feels slow, you know? Like I am tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Avril. It’s good to meet you as well. It sounds like your daughter scheduled this appointment as a general check-up because you haven’t been feeling well. I understand you’re experiencing a general sense of fatigue and things feel “slow.” To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me more about this fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. My daughter, she worry too much, but she is good girl. This tired… it is not like after work, you know? I work with cars all my life, so I know tired from work. This is… inside tired. Even when I sleep good, eight hours, I wake up still tired. And it is hard to… to do things. Even simple things. Like cooking. Or cleaning. It takes too much energy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this fatigue is different from the tiredness you experience after physical work, and it’s not relieved by a full night’s sleep. It’s affecting your ability to perform daily activities, even simple ones. Could you tell me approximately when you first started noticing this “inside tired” feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is good question. I think… maybe six months ago? It start slowly. First, I just feel a little bit more tired than usual. I thought it was because of the cold weather, you know? Winter is hard on the bones. But it did not get better when the weather get warm. It just… stayed. And then, it get worse, little by little. It is hard to say exactly when, but maybe six months, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately six months ago, with a gradual onset and worsening. That’s helpful. And besides the fatigue, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes. My memory is not so good anymore. I forget things. Small things, mostly. Like where I put my glasses. Or the name of a customer. My daughter, she say I repeat myself sometimes, too. I do not mean to! It just… the words, they get stuck. And sometimes, I feel… sad. Not very sad, just… empty. Like nothing is interesting anymore. I used to like gardening, but now… I do not have much energy for that.
DOCTOR: I see. So, in addition to the fatigue, you've noticed changes in your memory – forgetting things and repeating yourself – as well as a feeling of sadness or emptiness and a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. These are all important things to note. Do you have any difficulty with your sleep, other than feeling tired even after getting eight hours?
PATIENT: No, not really. I can sleep. But sometimes… I wake up in the middle of the night. Not every night, maybe two or three times a week. And I do not feel rested when I wake up. Just… still tired. I do not have trouble falling asleep, if that make sense. And I do not… I do not have bad dreams, or anything like that. Just… wake up.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. You can fall asleep without issue, but experience some awakenings during the night and don’t feel refreshed afterwards. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. I had… the high blood pressure, many years ago. The doctor put me on pills, and it was okay. I take the pills for a long time, but then he say it was okay, and I stop taking them. That was… maybe ten years ago? And I had the surgery on my knee, when I was younger, because of work. But that is all, I think. Nothing else important. Oh! And my daughter say my cholesterol is high, but I not remember taking any pills for that.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, a history of hypertension managed with medication in the past, a knee surgery from an injury, and your daughter mentioned high cholesterol. Do you recall when you were diagnosed with the high cholesterol?
PATIENT: I do not remember the exact time, Doctor. Maybe five years ago? She tell me after I go to the doctor for my check-up. She is very good with remembering things like that. I just… I do not think about it much. I feel okay, mostly. It is just this tiredness. And the memory… and sometimes, I feel a little bit dizzy. But that is not very often.
DOCTOR: Alright. Approximately five years ago for the high cholesterol. You occasionally experience dizziness as well. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take nothing now. No pills, nothing. I do not like taking pills if I do not need them. Sometimes, I take the pain reliever for my knee, when it is cold and wet. But not very often. And sometimes, I take the vitamin D, in the winter. But that is all. Really, nothing much.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional pain reliever for your knee and vitamin D in the winter. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything. And I not know about any allergies to pills. Never had a problem with that. I not think I have allergies, no. My daughter, she is allergic to cats, but I like cats! I do not have any.
DOCTOR: Very good. No known allergies. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, or children – have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… My mother, she had the heart problem when she was old. She was very sick for a long time. And my father, he had the diabetes. He had to take the pills for that. And my sister, she has the arthritis. Her hands, they hurt very much. But that is all I can remember right now. They are all old, you know? And I not see them very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your mother, diabetes in your father, and arthritis in your sister. That's helpful information. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Hmm… what do you mean? I work with cars. I own my own shop. I have been doing that all my life. I do not smoke. I do not drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I used to garden, but not so much anymore. I live alone since my husband… since he passed away. It is quiet, but I keep busy with work. I try to eat healthy, but sometimes it is hard when I am busy. I walk around the shop all day, so I get some exercise. That is… that is my life.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Avril. It sounds like you’ve had a long and active career, and you've been through some significant life changes. I see here that your daughter has indeed been diligent about scheduling your check-ups, and the notes corroborate what you've told me about your high cholesterol and blood pressure. I also see a recent lipid panel from about six months ago showing elevated cholesterol levels. Given your symptoms – fatigue, memory issues, occasional dizziness, and a history of high cholesterol – I'd like to perform a brief physical exam and order some additional lab work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I want to feel better. I just… I want to get back to normal. The shop is busy, and I need to be strong. So, yes, please do the exam and the tests. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please step onto the examination table, we will begin with your vital signs. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is regular at 78 beats per minute, and your lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Next, I’ll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Now, let’s check your neurological function. Your balance and coordination appear intact. Finally, I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Your ears, nose, and throat appear normal. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable at this time. However, based on your symptoms and medical history, I would like to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin D level. These tests will help us to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms. Would you like me to explain any of these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I do not understand all of those words. What do they… what do they do? I know I am getting old, but I still want to know what is happening with my body. Please, explain them to me like you explain to a child.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Avril. It's perfectly okay to ask questions – it's important to understand what's going on. Think of your body like a car. We need to check all the parts to make sure everything is running smoothly. The complete blood count is like checking the engine. It tells us how many of each type of blood cell you have – red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These cells are important for carrying oxygen, fighting infection, and stopping bleeding. If something is off, it could mean you have an infection, anemia, or another blood disorder. The comprehensive metabolic panel is like checking the fluids in the car – oil, coolant, and brake fluid. It tells us about your kidney and liver function, blood sugar levels, and electrolyte balance. It helps us to see if your organs are working properly. The thyroid-stimulating hormone test is like checking the fuel injection system. Your thyroid is a small gland in your neck that makes hormones that control your metabolism – how your body uses energy. If your thyroid is not working properly, it can cause fatigue, weight gain, and other symptoms. And the vitamin D level is like checking the battery. Vitamin D is important for strong bones and a healthy immune system. If you don't have enough vitamin D, it can cause fatigue, muscle weakness, and other symptoms. These tests are all simple blood draws, and the results will help us to figure out what's going on and develop a plan to get you feeling better. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes much more sense. Like checking the car! My husband, he was a mechanic too. He would say the same thing. So, we check the engine, the fluids, the battery… and the fuel. Okay. So, we do the blood draws. And then what? Do we wait for the results? And how long do we have to wait? I have customers waiting at the shop, you know. I need to know how long this will take.
DOCTOR: Exactly, we check everything! Yes, we will draw your blood and send it to the lab for analysis. The lab typically takes 2-3 business days to process the results. I will have my nurse contact you as soon as the results are available. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I would like you to continue to monitor your symptoms and let me know if anything changes significantly. Are there any specific questions or concerns you have right now before we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is all. Two or three business days… that is okay. I can manage. And my nurse will call me. Perfect. Let us do the blood draw, then. I trust you, Doctor. You explain everything very well. Like talking to my husband, almost. He would have liked you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Avril. That means a lot to me. Nurse Patel, could you please come in and draw Ms. Benites’ blood?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I am ready when she is. It is good to know someone is looking after me.
