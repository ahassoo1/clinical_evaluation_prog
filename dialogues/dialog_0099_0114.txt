DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this breathing. It gets…difficult when I try to lie flat. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so. I don't really know exactly. I just want to get it sorted out, if you don’t mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And it’s specifically when lying flat, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Sitting up is fine, walking is fine. But the moment I try to lie down…it feels like something is pressing on my chest. Not painful, exactly, but…uncomfortable. And I have to use more effort to breathe. It’s…vexing.
DOCTOR: "Vexing," is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Vexing. It interferes with my sleep, mostly. And a good night’s sleep is important, you know. I used to be able to just…lie down and drift off. Now I have to prop myself up with pillows. It’s not ideal. Are you writing all this down?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Vanderwiele, I am writing. It’s rather important, you see. Now, tell me, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me see……No, not really. They might be a little puffy sometimes, but I always thought that was just from the heat. It’s been so warm lately. I’m not usually one for complaining, but it has been a scorcher.
DOCTOR: Heat can certainly cause some swelling. But let's focus on the breathing. Do you experience any coughing with this?
PATIENT: Coughing…occasionally. Not a terrible cough, mind you. Just a little tickle in my throat, sometimes when I’m lying down. It's more bothersome than anything. I don't smoke, if that matters. Never have. I don't care for it. Is this going to take much longer, Doctor? I have an appointment at the library this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It takes as long as it needs to, Ms. Vanderwiele. We need to get this sorted, don’t we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. But efficiency is important, wouldn't you agree? Alright, alright. Let's see…the cough is worse when I’m trying to get comfortable. And sometimes, I feel a little…fluttering in my chest. Not painful, just…odd. Like a bird trying to get out. It’s rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: A "fluttering," you say. Alright. And do you have any history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No, Doctor. None whatsoever. My father lived to be eighty-five, and he had a very strong heart. Worked on a farm his whole life, you know. Strong as an ox. My mother, too, lived a long life. No heart trouble in the family. I've always been reasonably healthy, all things considered. I do watch my salt, if that makes any difference.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, Ms. Vanderwiele, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. I need to hear what's going on in there, despite your father’s…robust constitution.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. But please be quick about it. I really must be going soon. Just…let me know when you're finished.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me…and exhale. Good. Another one…and again. Hmm. I hear some…decreased breath sounds on the lower lobes. And a slight wheeze. Your heart sounds regular, though. No murmurs or gallops. It’s likely congestion, Ms. Vanderwiele. Perhaps some fluid buildup.
PATIENT: Congestion? Fluid buildup? Is that…serious, Doctor? And what does that mean exactly? Will I need…pills? Injections? I’m not fond of either, you know. I’m a simple woman with simple needs. Just want to be able to lie down without feeling like I’m suffocating.
DOCTOR: It could be serious, Ms. Vanderwiele, if left untreated. It sounds like you may be experiencing heart failure, which means your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should. That fluid buildup is what’s causing your breathing difficulties. We’ll need to run some tests—an EKG, a chest X-ray, and some blood work—to confirm my suspicions. And yes, it will likely involve medication, probably a diuretic to help get rid of the fluid, and possibly other things depending on the results. It’s hardly ideal, I know, but it's what we have to do.
PATIENT: Heart failure? Goodness gracious. That sounds…dreadful. My father never had heart failure. Are you sure? Perhaps it’s just a bad cold? Or allergies? I did go to the library yesterday and a lot of children were there… And medication…how many pills are we talking about? Will they make me drowsy? I have a book club meeting next week, and I must be alert. This is all very upsetting, Doctor. Very upsetting indeed. .
