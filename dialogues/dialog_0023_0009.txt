DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Alcorta is the name. It’s…well, it’s my vision. It’s simply not what it used to be. I’ve noticed a rather…diminishment, shall we say, in my ability to see things clearly. It’s quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A diminishment, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s…difficult to explain to someone who hasn’t experienced it, I suppose. Things aren’t blurred, exactly. More…washed out. Like looking through a dirty window, only I know the window is clean. It’s frustrating, to say the least. And I assure you, I've kept up with my hygiene.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Washed out" is… descriptive. And I appreciate you clarifying the cleanliness of the window, Mr. Alcorta. Let’s try to pinpoint this a little more precisely. Has this been a sudden change, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, Doctor, decidedly gradually. It wasn’t as if I woke up one morning unable to see. It's been…months, I should think. Perhaps even a year. It’s the sort of thing one doesn’t immediately notice, you see. Until it becomes…inconvenient. I've just been…putting it off, frankly. One has more pressing matters, typically.
DOCTOR: A year… alright. And has this affected your ability to perform your usual daily activities, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Well, yes. Though, I hesitate to equate my daily activities with… strenuous labor. I work in Human Resources, Doctor. Primarily paperwork and…interpersonal communication. But even that is becoming…taxing. Reading small print, discerning facial expressions…it requires a certain…focus, shall we say. And lately, it's been rather difficult. It’s nothing dramatic, mind you, but it's…wearing.
DOCTOR: Right. So, primarily close work becoming more difficult. And you haven’t noticed any flashes of light, floaters, or any pain in either eye?
PATIENT: Pain? No, certainly not. And…floaters? I’m not entirely certain what those are, Doctor. Small, dark specks, perhaps? I may have noticed something of that nature on occasion, but I dismissed it as…dust motes. Or perhaps simply a trick of the light. One doesn't concern oneself with every little fleck, you understand. It's…unproductive.
DOCTOR: I see. Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Let's do a quick visual exam. I'll check your visual acuity, your peripheral vision, and then take a look at the back of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. It's fairly standard, and shouldn't take long. Please, just read the smallest line you can on this chart.
PATIENT: An exam, you say. Very well. Though I must confess, I’ve always had excellent eyesight. Top of the class in marksmanship, you know. …E…F… perhaps a P? It’s rather…blurry. Is this the most modern chart you have, Doctor? The lighting in here isn't particularly helpful, either.
DOCTOR: This is our standard chart, Mr. Alcorta. And yes, I assure you, the lighting is adequate. Now, please try to focus and read the letters as clearly as you can. Don't strain, but do your best. Okay… now the next line. And one more. Tell me if anything is unclear.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is quite…discomforting. I can make out a few letters, but they’re…indistinct. I’m…I’m really not certain. It’s all rather…muddled. I suppose that’s why I’m here, isn't it? I wouldn’t subject myself to this otherwise.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your visual acuity is… significantly reduced, Mr. Alcorta. 20/70 in both eyes. Which confirms your subjective experience. Now, let's check your peripheral vision. I’m going to ask you to focus on this point and tell me when you see anything in your peripheral vision.
PATIENT: Peripheral vision, you say. Very well. Though I must point out, my situational awareness has always been exceptional. I notice things others simply miss. Is there a specific color I should be looking for, Doctor? Or are you simply expecting me to…sense something?
DOCTOR: No specific color, Mr. Alcorta. Just let me know when you see anything in your peripheral vision. Any shadow, any movement... anything at all. Focus on that central point and try to relax.
PATIENT: I…think I detect a…flickering. To the left, perhaps? It’s very faint, Doctor. Possibly just a shadow cast by the… foliage outside the window. Or a trick of the light, as I mentioned previously. I do find this test rather…unsettling, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your peripheral vision is slightly restricted, particularly on the left side. Now, I'm going to use an ophthalmoscope to look at the back of your eyes. It won't hurt, but it will be close. Just relax and look straight ahead. Hmm. I see some mild optic disc pallor and a slight narrowing of the retinal vessels. This is…not entirely unexpected, given your age and reduced visual acuity.
PATIENT: Optic disc pallor… retinal vessels… Doctor, are you attempting to intimidate me with medical jargon? I came here seeking a simple explanation, not a lecture on…ocular anatomy. Is this…serious? Or merely a…natural consequence of aging? I’ve always been a rather…refined individual, and I find these descriptions…distressing.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Alcorta, I’m not attempting to intimidate anyone. I’m simply documenting my findings. However, your vision loss is concerning. Given the reduced acuity, peripheral vision restriction, and the findings on ophthalmoscopy, I suspect you have primary open-angle glaucoma. It’s a condition where the pressure inside your eye gradually damages the optic nerve. It can lead to irreversible vision loss if left untreated. We need to get you referred to an ophthalmologist immediately for further testing and management.
PATIENT: Glaucoma? Preposterous. I’ve always had remarkably steady hands, impeccable focus. It’s simply…unthinkable. And “irreversible vision loss”? Doctor, you’re being rather…dramatic, aren’t you? I assure you, my family has always enjoyed excellent health. And frankly, I find your prognosis…insulting. I suppose this necessitates further…expense, does it? Another specialist, another battery of tests…
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, with all due respect, your subjective feelings about your health do not alter the objective findings of a clinical examination. I understand your skepticism, but dismissing a potentially serious condition based on family history or personal belief is… unwise. I’m not attempting to cause you distress, but early detection and treatment are crucial in managing glaucoma and preventing further vision loss. I will write you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly respected ophthalmologist in the region. She will perform a comprehensive evaluation, including tonometry, visual field testing, and optical coherence tomography, to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate course of action. Ignoring this could result in significant and permanent vision impairment. I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you insist. Though I maintain this is…overblown. Dr. Reed, you say? Fine. I’ll…consider it. But I expect a thorough explanation, and I assure you, I will not be subjected to any unnecessary procedures. Perhaps a second opinion is in order, as well. I’ve always valued…due diligence. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a rather pressing engagement. .
