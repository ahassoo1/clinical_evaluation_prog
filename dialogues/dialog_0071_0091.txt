DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, is just… I does be feeling awfully thirsty all the time. And hungry! Even after I eat a good plate of food, I feeling like I need more. Is really strange, you know? Is been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is strange. Thirsty all the time and still feeling hungry… hmm. About how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me see… is hard to say exactly. Maybe… about two, three months now? Is start slow, just a little bit more water after meals. But now… now I does be drinking a whole pitcher in a day! And the hunger, that come a little later. I thought maybe is the heat, but it still happening even when it cool out.
DOCTOR: Okay, two to three months. And it hasn't improved with cooler weather. Right. Have you noticed any changes in your… well, how often you're urinating?
PATIENT: Urinating? Oh… yes, now that you mention it. I does be going to the bathroom more often, yes. Especially at night! Is disturbing my sleep, sometimes. My husband, he does complain a little bit, too. Is not a big problem, but… is more than before, for sure.
DOCTOR: More frequent urination, particularly at night… alright. And when you urinate, do you feel like you're completely emptying your bladder, or do you feel like you have to go back shortly after?
PATIENT: Hmm… is a good question. Sometimes I feel like I not emptying it all the way. I does have to go back maybe ten, fifteen minutes later. Not every time, but… often enough to notice. Is like a little bit still left inside, you know? And then I have to strain a little sometimes to get the rest out. Is nothing painful, but… it not easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, incomplete emptying, and sometimes straining. Alright. Now, Bianca, have you noticed any other changes at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh! My eyesight does be a little blurry sometimes. Not all the time, but when I reading, I does have to hold the newspaper closer. And I does feel tired a lot, even after a good night sleep. I thought maybe is just getting older, you know? Is nothing major, but… is just a lot of things happening at the same time.
DOCTOR: Yes, a lot of things happening… alright. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes before?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, Doctor, never. My mother, she had high blood pressure, but not diabetes. My father, he was a strong man, healthy as a horse. I never have any trouble with sugar, as far as I know. I does eat a little sweet treat sometimes, but who doesn’t, eh? But never anything serious. Is that what you thinking about?
DOCTOR: It's good to know your family history. And yes, some of your symptoms could point in that direction, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, and then I think a blood test would be a good idea to check your sugar levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A blood test? Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. I don’t mind at all. Whatever you think is best. Is just… I want to know what is going on with me, you know? I feeling tired all the time, and the thirst… is really bothering me. So, yes, go ahead with the test. What does I have to do?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. We'll just need a small sample of blood. The nurse will be in shortly to draw it. It will only take a few minutes. Now, while we're waiting, let me just listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. I will just sit here and relax, then. My heart is usually strong, but sometimes I does feel a little fluttering, you know? Especially after I eat a big meal. But I not worrying too much about it. Go ahead, do what you have to do. Thank you for taking the time to see me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Bianca. It's my job. Now, just relax and breathe normally… 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs… …Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Any history of heart problems or murmurs from previous checkups?
PATIENT: A murmur? Oh, my goodness. No, Doctor, never. I never had any trouble with my heart before. I does see Doctor Ramdass every year for my checkup, and he never said anything about a murmur. He just always tell me to watch my salt intake, you know? That's all. This is… worrying me a little now, Doctor. Is it something serious? Is the heart murmur causing the tiredness?
DOCTOR: Now, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Many murmurs are harmless, what we call “innocent” murmurs. But because this is new, and you're experiencing fatigue, we'll want to investigate it a bit further. The blood test will help us rule out other things, and I'm going to order an EKG, which is a simple test to check your heart's electrical activity. That will give us a clearer picture. Now, while the nurse is drawing your blood, let's talk a little bit about your diet… What does a typical day of eating look like for you, Bianca?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, I understand. More tests, then. That's fine. A typical day… well, for breakfast, I does have some oatmeal with a little bit of sugar, and a cup of tea. Lunch, usually a plate of rice and beans with some fish, or maybe chicken. And for dinner… sometimes a roti, sometimes rice again, with vegetables. I does like to cook, you know? My husband, he loves my cooking. And I does have a little sweet treat after dinner, maybe a piece of cake or a biscuit. Not a big piece, but something. Is that alright? I try to eat healthy, but… I does have a sweet tooth.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a reasonable diet. The sugar in the oatmeal and after dinner is something we can discuss. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I not taking any medications. Never had any serious illness that needed medicine. And I don’t have any allergies. I could eat anything, as far as I know. I does get a little mosquito bites, like everybody in Trinidad, but that's all. No medicine for me, thankfully. My husband, he takes some pills for his pressure, but I not the one with troubles, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good. No allergies or medications to worry about. Just to recap: you're experiencing increased thirst, frequent urination , incomplete emptying of your bladder, fatigue, and a slight blurring of vision. You’ve never been diagnosed with diabetes, no family history, and a fairly typical diet with a bit of a sweet tooth. We're going to run some blood tests, and I’m ordering an EKG. The nurse should be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them and figure out the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Bianca?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you covered everything. I just… I hope it not anything serious, you know? I not a young woman anymore, and I don’t want to be sick. But I trust you, and I thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I will just sit here and wait for the nurse, then. Is that alright? And thank you again, Doctor Galena.
DOCTOR: Of course, Bianca. That's perfectly alright. We'll take things one step at a time. And I understand your concerns; we all want to stay healthy. Don't worry too much, and just relax. The nurse will be right in.
