DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MayHugh. Welcome to the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And my daughter, bless her, she’s the one who made the appointment. She worries about me. I… I don't always remember things clearly, so she helps. It's just… sometimes the hearing goes, and I get real dizzy. It's happened a few times now. And my husband… he had something similar, years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. MayHugh, that’s helpful to know. It’s good you have your daughter looking out for you, and it’s useful to know about your husband’s history. So, let's focus on these episodes with your ears, hearing loss and dizziness. When you say “acting up,” can you describe what that feels like specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… it’s like… everything just muffles. Like someone turned the volume way down, or put cotton in my ears. And then… whoosh. The room spins. Not always, but often. It doesn't last long, usually. Maybe a few minutes. But it's scary when it happens, you know? Especially if I'm doing something. I… I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it's been happening more lately, I think. Is that helpful? It's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. MayHugh. “Muffling” and the spinning sensation—that sounds like vertigo. And you’re right, the fact it’s happening more frequently is important. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if anything specifically seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A trigger… That's a good question. I don't think so. Not that I've noticed. It just… happens. Sometimes when I’m quiet, maybe? But mostly it feels random. I do spend a lot of time at the… well, at the place where I work. It’s a bit noisy there, lots of people. Could that have something to do with it? I really don't know. It’s just… come on when it wants to, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, random episodes, potentially linked to a noisy environment… that gives us something to consider. You mentioned where you work – could you tell me a little more about what you do there?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, it's... a gaming place. I help people with the machines. You know, the slot machines and things. It’s… it’s a bit of everything. Counting things, making sure things are running smoothly. It’s not a fancy job, but it keeps me busy. And I've been doing it for… oh, a long time now. A very long time. It’s a bit stressful sometimes, with all the money involved, but mostly it’s alright. Does that make sense? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. MayHugh, you’re perfectly clear. A busy gaming environment could definitely be a factor. The noise levels, the constant activity… Now, let’s talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the hearing loss and dizziness?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think… Sometimes I feel a little… off balance, even when I'm not having a proper dizzy spell. Just a bit wobbly. And… sometimes my ears ring. A faint ringing, like a high-pitched sound. It comes and goes. Oh, and… I get headaches sometimes. But I get headaches a lot, so I don't know if that's related. I get them at the back of my head. Honestly, I'm not sure what's normal anymore, Doctor. It all feels a bit jumbled.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have occasional imbalance, ringing in the ears – what we call tinnitus – and headaches. Knowing the location of the headaches – at the back of your head – is helpful. It's good you're telling me everything, even if it seems small. It’s perfectly alright that things feel jumbled; that's what we're here to sort out. Let's move on to some basic medical history. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a hard one. I… it's been a long life, Doctor. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but I recovered. And… I think I had my appendix out too, a long time ago. And a few operations for… well, for things women have done. But honestly, it's all a bit fuzzy. I don't remember the details very well. I'm sorry. Is my daughter here? Maybe she can remember better than I can.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. MayHugh. It's perfectly understandable that details are fuzzy over the years. We can always ask your daughter if she’s here, but we can also work with what you do remember. We'll get there. Okay, so gallbladder, pneumonia, and some gynecological surgeries. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions now, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, no. Nothing like that. The doctor… well, my old doctor, he always said I was healthy as a horse. A bit stubborn, maybe, but healthy. He kept me on blood pressure medication for a while, but he took me off it years ago. Said it was just a little high, nothing to worry about. And… I don't have any trouble with my heart, not that I know of. I get a little breathless sometimes, when I walk uphill, but that's just because I’m… well, you know. Getting old. Is that helpful? I hope I’m not wasting your time.
DOCTOR: You’re not wasting my time at all, Ms. MayHugh. It's very helpful to hear about your general health. So, no ongoing conditions, previous blood pressure medication, and a bit of breathlessness with exertion. Now, do you take any medications currently – even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a calcium tablet every day, for my bones. And sometimes, if my head is really bad, I take paracetamol. Just a couple, you know, for the headache. And… that’s it, I think. Oh! And I take something for my arthritis, a little brown pill. But it doesn't always help. Honestly, I forget the name of it. It’s a bit of a jumble, you see. I try to keep track, but… it’s hard. My daughter usually refills them for me, so I don’t always know what I'm taking.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. MayHugh. Calcium, paracetamol as needed, and something for arthritis - that gives us a good starting point. We can look up what you’re prescribed if needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to eat everything as a child! My mother always said I had an iron stomach. I haven't tried anything new in years, though. I’m a bit cautious now, you see. But no, I don’t think I have any allergies. Not to my knowledge, anyway. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m rambling again. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. MayHugh. You’re not rambling, and everything you’ve told me is helpful. No known allergies is good to know. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – had problems with hearing loss, dizziness, or ringing in the ears?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… yes. My husband… he had terrible dizziness. That’s how he ended up in hospital, years ago. They said something about his balance, and his ears. And… my mother, she lost her hearing as she got older. She didn't hear very well at all towards the end. And… I think my brother had tinnitus, ringing in the ears. But he didn't talk about it much. He was a quiet man. So, yes. Hearing loss, dizziness, ringing… it runs in the family, I think. That’s why I worry. I hope I’m not making you write too much.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. MayHugh. This is very important information. A family history of dizziness, hearing loss, and tinnitus is significant. Now, lastly, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle? Oh, it’s not very exciting, Doctor. I live on my own, since my husband passed. I like to keep busy. I do a bit of gardening. I go to the church sometimes. And… I like to watch television. I don't drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner. I don't smoke. And… I try to eat healthy, but it's hard sometimes. I mostly just try to take things easy. It's a quiet life, you see. But it suits me. Is that helpful? I hope I haven't bored you to tears.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. MayHugh. That’s very helpful to know. A quiet lifestyle, gardening, and generally healthy habits. Alright, Ms. MayHugh, that gives me a good overview of your medical history and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. We’ll check your ears, balance, and blood pressure. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive sometimes. And… I get a bit dizzy, you know. So, take your time. That’s all. Just take your time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. MayHugh. I will be very gentle. We’ll take everything slowly, and I’ll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. Please let me know immediately if you feel any discomfort or dizziness. Okay, looking in your ears now… there’s a little bit of wax build-up, but nothing concerning. The ear drums themselves look normal, no signs of infection or damage. Your nose looks clear, and your throat is… a little dry, but otherwise unremarkable. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, with good breath sounds. Now, let's check your blood pressure… Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, let’s do a quick balance test. Could you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Alright… careful now. My balance… it’s not what it used to be. Just… go easy, alright? I get a bit wobbly sometimes. It’s probably just my age. But… I do feel a little funny now. A bit lightheaded. Should I sit down?
DOCTOR: Yes, please sit down immediately. That’s perfectly alright, Ms. MayHugh. We’ll stop there. You’re right to tell me. That confirms my suspicion. You’ve experienced some postural hypotension – a drop in blood pressure when you stand up – which can definitely contribute to dizziness. Your blood pressure wasn’t significantly high while sitting, but it seems to drop when you stand. And combined with your family history and symptoms, I’m concerned about something called Meniere’s Disease. It's an inner ear disorder that can cause vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness in the ear. It can also cause those postural balance problems we're seeing now. However, we need to rule out other potential causes, too. We need to do some further testing. I want to order an audiogram – a hearing test – to assess your hearing levels. I also recommend a blood test to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And, I’d like you to see a specialist—an ENT doctor—for a more thorough evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Meniere’s Disease… that sounds… serious. A hearing test… blood tests… a specialist… It all sounds like a lot. But… if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then alright. Yes, I’ll do whatever you recommend. I trust your judgement. My daughter… she’ll be glad you’re taking this seriously. She’s been worried about me for a while now. But… what does all this mean? Will I go deaf? Will I keep falling down? I’m sorry… I’m getting a bit anxious. I just… I don’t like not knowing.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel anxious, Ms. MayHugh. It’s good that you’re asking questions. And I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly. Meniere’s Disease can be serious, but it’s also very manageable. It doesn’t necessarily mean you will go deaf. Many people with Meniere’s Disease can live full and active lives with treatment. The hearing loss is often fluctuating, and can be controlled with medication and lifestyle changes. The dizziness attacks can also be significantly reduced. The audiogram will give us a baseline of your hearing levels, so we know where we stand. The blood tests will help rule out other possible causes, like anemia or thyroid problems. And the ENT specialist is the best person to make a definitive diagnosis and recommend a treatment plan. They may recommend medications to control the dizziness and hearing loss, and may also suggest dietary changes or vestibular rehabilitation therapy. We’re going to take this one step at a time. I’ll write you referrals for the audiogram and the ENT specialist. I’ll also give you a list of websites where you can find more information about Meniere’s Disease. And, please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to support you. In the meantime, avoid caffeine, alcohol, and excessive salt intake. Get plenty of rest, and try to manage your stress levels. And, if you experience a severe dizziness attack, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… that sounds… more manageable, yes. Avoiding caffeine and salt… I can do that. And… getting rest… that’s a good idea. My daughter… she’ll be glad to hear that we have a plan. She worries so much. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen, and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little less scared now. And… I appreciate you writing those referrals. It’s… it’s a relief to know what to do next. I think… I think that’s everything for now. Is there anything else I should know? Or… are we finished here? I just want to go home and rest, if that’s alright. My daughter is picking me up. I’m a little tired now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MayHugh. I’m glad I could help. It sounds like a good idea to go home and rest. These are the referrals for the audiogram and the ENT specialist. And this sheet has some helpful information about Meniere’s Disease, including lifestyle modifications and warning signs to watch out for. I’ve also written a brief summary of our conversation for your daughter, so she knows what’s going on. And I've scheduled a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks, so we can discuss the results of your testing. I think that’s everything for now. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call my office. And please, get some rest. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. MayHugh. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
PATIENT: .
