DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Fazzina, you said? Let me see… it’s about my blood, I think. My daughter, bless her heart, she said I should find out what type I am. Something about… well, I can’t rightly remember why exactly. Just that it's important to know. It’s been a long time since I had any tests done, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, knowing your blood type is always a good idea. It can be important, especially as we get older. So, it sounds like your daughter suggested we check that out. Alright. We can certainly do that. Have you ever been told what your blood type is before, even roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, I don't believe so. Not that I recall, anyway. I've moved around a bit in my life, you see. Lived in Spain for a long time, then here… and there. Doctors came and went. It's all a bit… hazy. I worked with ropes, mostly, building and taking down things. Riggers, that was my trade. Didn’t need much blood testing for that, usually!
DOCTOR: Rigging – that sounds like demanding work! No, I imagine blood tests weren’t a common occurrence. Alright, well, we'll get a fresh one done today then. Just to be sure. Before we do that, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, it was demanding, yes. Kept me young, though! As for my health… well, I’m 79, so things creak a bit. My knees aren’t what they used to be, and I get tired easier now. I have a bit of trouble sleeping sometimes, but nothing too serious, I don’t think. I eat alright, mostly. My daughter makes sure of that. She worries, bless her. Do you need to know about… illnesses? I’ve had the usual colds and flu, I suppose. Not much else comes to mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, knees and a bit of trouble sleeping… that's common at your age. And that's good you have a daughter looking out for you. Any major illnesses that you do remember being diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Now, I think… years ago, when I was living near the coast, I had something with my lungs. A cough that wouldn't go away. The doctor gave me some medicine, and it cleared up. That was a long time ago, though. Before my husband passed. I don’t remember the name of it, sadly. Just that it made me very tired for a while. And… I had my gallbladder out, I think? Or maybe it was my appendix? It was one of those! Another one of those things… my memory isn't what it used to be. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize at all, Darl. It's perfectly understandable. Memories fade with time. A lung issue and possibly gallbladder removal… we can check your records to confirm those. Do you remember approximately when you had the lung issue?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that was a long time ago. Maybe… the late 1970s? Or early 1980s? I was still living in Spain then, near Valencia, I think. It was a cold winter, I remember that. Lots of dampness in the air. It’s so difficult to be precise. Everything blends together after a while, doesn't it? I was younger then, of course. Much more active. My husband and I used to dance… a lot.
DOCTOR: The 1970s/80s… alright. That gives us a starting point. We'll check your medical records for anything about a lung issue around then. And you mentioned dancing – that’s lovely. Do you currently take any medications, or have any allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… medications. I take a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill, once a day. And sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I take something for the pain. But that’s just as needed. Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, that I recall. Perhaps a little sniffly with some flowers, but nothing serious. No bee stings or anything like that. My daughter always checks my medications when she visits, so if I’m forgetting something, she'll let me know.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure medication and something for knee pain as needed. That's good you have your daughter keeping an eye on things. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. It's been a while since I had a proper check-up. Just don't poke too hard, alright? These old bones aren't as sturdy as they used to be!
DOCTOR: I’ll be as gentle as possible, Darl. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? It feels a little strange, I must admit. It’s been a long time since anyone listened to my chest. I used to be able to hold my breath for quite a long time, you know. When I was rigging, we needed to be very careful. Safety first, always.
DOCTOR: Your breathing is a little… wheezy, but not alarming. I hear some diminished breath sounds, especially towards the bases of your lungs. Alright, now I’m going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s funny, isn’t it? All these little checks and measurements. When I was rigging, we relied on our hands and eyes. Knowing how the ropes felt, how the wind was blowing. Much more important than numbers, really. Though, I suppose numbers are important for you!
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 78 and regular. Your abdomen is soft, but I feel a slight tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Alright, now I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please let your arms relax?
PATIENT: Alright… like this? It feels strange, having someone poke and prod at me. It’s been so long since I've been to a doctor. I suppose it’s a good thing, though. Getting checked out. Just in case. Though, to be honest, I feel alright. A little creaky, perhaps, but alright. Do you think this tenderness means something is wrong?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. The tenderness in your upper right quadrant could indicate a number of things, and it’s something we should investigate further. It could be something simple, or it could be related to your gallbladder, even if it was removed years ago. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order some blood work and an abdominal ultrasound. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ultrasound and blood work… alright. If you think it’s necessary, then yes, let’s do it. I trust your judgment, Doctor. It’s just… all this sounds a bit complicated. I just wanted to find out my blood type, you know? For my daughter. But I suppose getting a proper check-up is a good thing, even if it means a few tests. Will the ultrasound be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel a little overwhelmed, Darl. We're just being thorough. And no, the ultrasound shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. It's completely painless. You'll just lie on a table, and a technician will move a wand over your abdomen. It's like a gentle massage. The blood work will just be a standard panel to check your overall health and see if there are any abnormalities. We’ll get the results back within a few days. While we’re waiting, I can go ahead and order a copy of your medical records from your previous doctors. That might help us piece things together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A gentle massage… that sounds much better. And yes, please, get my medical records. I’m sure they have something about that lung trouble. You’re very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. It’s been a long time since someone took such good care of me. Alright, so blood work, ultrasound, and medical records… I think I have it all. When should I come back for the results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Darl. It’s my job. I'll have the lab draw the blood work today, and we can schedule the ultrasound for sometime next week. Once the results are back, and I've had a chance to review your medical records, I'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you. And please, don't worry too much about the results. I'm sure it's nothing serious. And just for the record… could you also just tell me my blood type today? Perhaps you already know it from the initial check? It’s just… my daughter is very anxious about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Darl. I can certainly tell you your blood type today. It’s O positive. I was able to get a quick preliminary result while I was listening to your heart. Your daughter will be relieved to hear that. And don’t worry, we’ll get to the bottom of everything. Now, is there anything else I can do for you today?
