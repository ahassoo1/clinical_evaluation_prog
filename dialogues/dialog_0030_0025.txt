DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I want to… how you say… find out more about where my family come from. I hear you can do tests for that now? With… DNA? I think that’s the word. I want to know… where my people really come from.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, I understand. You’re interested in genetic ancestry testing to learn more about your family’s origins. That’s certainly something we can discuss and arrange. It’s become quite a helpful tool for many people. Before we proceed with ordering a test, let's talk a little bit about your background. Do you know much about your family history – where your parents and grandparents were born, for example?
PATIENT: Well… my mama, she from Marshall Islands, of course. That’s where I born too. Small island. Very small. My papa… he work on boats, travel a lot. I think he from… maybe other island? I not so sure. He never talk much about it. I got brothers and sisters, but they not remember much either. Old times, you know? Things get forgotten.
DOCTOR: That’s very common, Mr. Scobie. Memories can fade over time, and it’s not unusual for family histories to be incomplete. The Marshall Islands… a beautiful place. And it sounds like your father travelled quite a bit. Just to clarify, when you say your mother is from the Marshall Islands, was she born there, and did she spend her whole life there, or did she travel as well?
PATIENT: She born there, yes. Lived there whole life, I think. Maybe go to other islands sometimes, with family. But mostly Marshall Islands. She always talk about the ocean, the fish, the… how you say… the breadfruit? She love that breadfruit. She make good food.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Mr. Scobie. It’s wonderful that she had such a strong connection to her home. And breadfruit is delicious. Let’s move on to your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: I go to doctor when I sick. Not regular, no. Old man, you know? Things break. I got… how you say… the water in my knees? Hurts when it rain. And my eyes, not so good anymore. But mostly okay. I take pills for my… heart, maybe? I forget the name. Little white pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, “water in your knees” – that sounds like some joint pain, likely arthritis. And the pills for your heart… that’s good you’re taking those. Do you happen to know the name of those pills, or perhaps the dosage?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I give the paper to the pharmacy. They give me the pills. I not remember the name. I just take one every morning. Small pill. White. That’s all I know. I not good with remembering names. I remember fish, though! I can tell you all the kinds of fish.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. We can certainly check with the pharmacy to find out what medication you’re taking. It’s important for us to have a complete list. And I’m glad to hear you’re knowledgeable about fish! That’s wonderful. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Hmm… one time, long time ago. When I was young man. I fall from the boat. Not very far, but I swallow a lot of water. They take me to hospital, keep me for one night. Check me over. I think I just scared, mostly. But they said I okay. That’s all. Long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a hospital visit for saltwater ingestion when you were younger. That must have been frightening. And they determined you were alright afterward, which is good. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Fish, breadfruit, rice… everything. Never have problem. Sometimes I get little itchy when mosquito bite me, but that’s all. No bad reaction to pills, no bad reaction to food. I eat what’s good.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Scobie. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history, beyond what you’ve already shared. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mama, she get old, you know? She just… stop eating. Get very weak. Doctor say something about… sugar? Maybe diabetes? I not so sure. And my papa… he get sick on the boat, one time. Very sick. But I not know what kind of sick. He just… stop working. They bring him home. That’s all I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some health issues in her later years, possibly related to diabetes, and your father became ill while working on the boat. That’s helpful information, even though we don’t have specific details. Now, before we discuss the DNA testing further, I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to get a general sense of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That’s good. You check me. I not so strong anymore, but I still okay. Just the knees, you know? And the eyes. You check the knees first?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. We’ll start with your knees. Please have a seat on the examination table. Okay, let’s take a look. Could you bend your knees for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… not so good. Hurts a little. Like… little rocks inside. And when I stand up… pop, pop. You hear that?
DOCTOR: Yes, I hear those pops, Mr. Scobie. And I feel some tenderness when I palpate around your knee joint. It sounds like you have some osteoarthritis in both knees. This is a common condition, especially with age, and it causes the cartilage in your knees to break down. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 85, and your pulse is 72. Your lungs sound clear, and your heart sounds regular. Now, let's take a look at your eyes. Could you read the letters on this chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay… I try. Hmmm… that first line… I can see… E… and… F… P… Oh… it’s blurry. The next line… I can’t see so good. I need my glasses for that.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Scobie. It sounds like your vision has declined. It’s good you wear glasses. We can document that you have some difficulty with your vision. Alright, Mr. Scobie, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, you have some osteoarthritis in both knees, some difficulty with your vision, and slightly elevated blood pressure. Now, regarding the DNA testing, are you still interested in proceeding?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I still want to know where my family come from. Even if my knees hurt and I can’t see so good. I want to know about my people. What do I need to do? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Scobie. I understand your desire to learn more about your heritage. The DNA testing itself is not painful at all. It involves a simple cheek swab – we’ll gently rub a small cotton swab inside your cheek to collect a sample of your saliva. It takes just a few seconds. The sample will then be sent to a laboratory, where they’ll analyze your DNA and provide you with a report outlining your ethnic origins. It can take several weeks to get the results back. The cost is around $200, and it's typically not covered by Medicare. Are you comfortable with that process and cost?
PATIENT: Two hundred dollars… hmm… that’s a lot of fish. But… I really want to know. Okay, I do it. I give you the money. You take the swab. I hope it tells me something good. Something about my people. What kind of people they were? Were they good fishermen?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. I understand it’s a significant expense. We’ll proceed with the DNA test. Okay, I’m going to gently rub this swab inside your cheek for about 30 seconds. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Alright, the sample is collected! We'll send this off to the lab. It should take approximately 4-6 weeks to receive the results. They will send you a report directly. It typically includes information about your ancestral origins, as well as potential relatives. Regarding whether your ancestors were good fishermen… the report won’t specifically say that! However, it will give you information about the regions your ancestors came from, and you can research the cultures and traditions of those areas to learn more about their way of life. Many Marshallese people have a strong connection to the ocean, and fishing is an important part of their culture.
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. I hope it says something about the ocean. And maybe… maybe I find cousins somewhere? I always wanted to know more about my family. Thank you. You help me a lot.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad I could help. It’s wonderful that you’re interested in learning more about your heritage. I hope the DNA test provides you with some valuable information and connects you to your ancestors. To summarize, we’ve discussed your interest in genetic ancestry testing and completed a physical exam. I’ve documented some osteoarthritis in your knees, some difficulty with your vision, and slightly elevated blood pressure. We’ll monitor your blood pressure at your next visit. We’ve also collected a sample for DNA testing, and you should receive the results in approximately 4-6 weeks. If you experience any concerning symptoms in the meantime, such as worsening knee pain or vision changes, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. You explain everything very good. Thank you again. I go home now and wait for the results. Maybe I catch a big fish while I wait!
DOCTOR: That sounds like a wonderful plan, Mr. Scobie! I hope you do catch a big fish. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your next appointment.
