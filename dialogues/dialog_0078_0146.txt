DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, to be honest, it’s my muscles. They've just been…weak. It’s hard to explain. It started a few weeks ago, and it’s getting a little worse each day, if that makes sense. I'd like to get it checked out quickly if possible, I have a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. “Weakness” can mean a lot of different things, so let’s try to narrow it down. Could you tell me more about where you’re feeling this weakness?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. It’s mostly in my arms and legs, you know? Like, lifting things feels harder than it used to, and I get tired walking even short distances. Not like can't walk, just…more effort. It’s in both sides, so it’s not like one arm is weaker than the other, if that helps. It’s…pretty even, I guess.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. So, it’s a symmetrical weakness, affecting both your arms and legs. Has this weakness been constant since it started, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s…pretty constant, yeah. It doesn’t really go away completely. Some days are a little better than others, but it’s always there, in the background. Like, I notice it when I’m doing things. Even just getting out of a chair takes more thinking than it used to. It’s frustrating, to be honest. I don't really understand why this is happening.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. McKinnon. It’s concerning when your body isn’t doing what you expect it to. When you say “more thinking,” could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Well, I mean, I have to focus on doing things now. Like, normally you just get up, right? But now I think, “Okay, push with your legs, swing your arms…” It's like I’m breaking down each movement into steps. It didn't used to be like that. It’s silly, but it’s tiring, even just thinking about it all the time. It’s… exhausting, honestly. And it’s been slowly getting worse, which is why I’m here.
DOCTOR: That’s not silly at all, Mr. McKinnon. It sounds like you’re experiencing a change in how you perceive and execute movements, and that’s definitely worth investigating. Has anything specific happened around the time this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Nothing major, not that I can recall. Work’s been stressful, as usual – auto damage claims, you know, people upset about their cars. But that’s normal. I didn’t fall or get sick, or anything like that. No new medications, no big changes to my diet… I honestly can’t pinpoint anything. I wish I could. Maybe it's just age catching up to me? I'm 38, but...I feel older sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s often hard to identify a specific trigger. Stress can certainly play a role, even if it’s not a direct cause. And 38 is still young; we don’t want to assume anything without looking into it further. Now, to get a better understanding, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t really been to the doctor much. Just the usual check-ups when I was a kid. I had chickenpox, but that was ages ago. No major illnesses or surgeries, nothing like that. I'm generally pretty healthy, or at least, I was. I haven’t got any ongoing conditions or anything I take medication for regularly. And as you probably noticed, I don't have insurance, so I avoid the doctor when I can. It’s expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. McKinnon. It's good to know you haven't had any significant past medical issues. We'll do our best to be efficient with the testing to keep costs in mind, given your lack of insurance. Have there been any similar issues in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My family’s… spread out, you know? I don’t see them much. My dad passed away a few years ago, he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother, she’s got arthritis, but that's pretty common, I guess. I don’t really know much about anyone else’s medical history. No one really talks about it. It wasn’t really a thing in my family, if that makes sense. We just… dealt with things. I wish I could be more helpful, but I don't really have any family medical history to share.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. McKinnon. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I work a lot, as I mentioned - insurance appraising. It’s mostly sitting in an office, looking at paperwork, sometimes going out to inspect cars. Not very physical, to be honest. I try to eat okay, mostly just normal food, nothing fancy. I don't smoke, and I don't drink much, maybe a beer every now and then. I don’t really have time for hobbies or exercise, to be honest. I get home tired, and just want to relax. Not exactly a healthy lifestyle, I know. I wish I had more energy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. McKinnon. It helps me get a better picture. Now, let’s talk about allergies and any medications you might have taken recently, even over-the-counter ones.
PATIENT: Okay. No known allergies, Doctor. Nothing I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. As for medications… I haven’t taken anything regularly. Just ibuprofen for headaches sometimes, maybe once or twice a month. And I took some cold medicine a couple of months ago when I had a little sniffle, but that was it. Nothing else. Really, that’s it. I try to avoid taking medication whenever possible, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No allergies and very minimal medication use. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Sounds good. The sooner we figure this out, the better, honestly. I have a busy schedule, so I appreciate you trying to be efficient. What exactly will you be doing? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll start by checking your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also check your reflexes, muscle strength and coordination in your arms and legs, and do a basic neurological exam. We’ll also check your gait, just to see how you walk. It’s a fairly standard exam. I'll also palpate your muscles to assess for tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Alright, go ahead. Just let me know if I need to do anything specific. I'm ready when you are. I hope it doesn't take too long. Just being honest, I have a lot on my plate. I'll try to relax, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. McKinnon, your blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is within the normal range. Your heart and lungs sound clear, no unusual sounds there. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you please relax your arm?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Relaxed. Just let me know if anything feels… weird. I always feel a bit strange when someone checks my reflexes. It’s probably just me being anxious, though. I'll try to stay still. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s a normal response. 2+ bilaterally, which is good. Now, I’m going to check your muscle strength. Could you please gently resist as I push down on your arm?
PATIENT: Okay, I'll try. Just tell me how hard you want me to push. I don’t want to hurt you, if that makes sense. I'm not very strong, to be honest, so hopefully it won’t be a problem. Just let me know when to stop. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your muscle strength is 5 out of 5 in both your arms and legs, which is normal. That's reassuring. Now, could you please walk a few steps for me, so I can observe your gait?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. There. Is that alright? I'm trying to walk normally, but I'm a bit self-conscious now, to be honest. It's hard not to think about it when someone's watching.
DOCTOR: That looks good, Mr. McKinnon. Your gait is normal. Now, one last thing. Could you close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Like this? Is that alright? It feels a bit silly, but… alright. I'm doing it. Is there anything else? I'm hoping we can wrap this up soon. I have a lot on my plate, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Your coordination seems fine. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears normal, which is good news. However, the weakness you're describing is concerning, and since the exam is normal, we need to investigate further with some blood work. I'd like to order a Complete Blood Count , a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel , a Vitamin D level, and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your weakness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay, blood work. Alright. That sounds… reasonable. It’s a bit frustrating that everything seems normal, but I guess that’s good, in a way. As long as it helps figure out what’s going on. Yes, that’s fine. Blood work is fine. How long will it take to get the results? And… how much will it cost? I need to be mindful of the cost, unfortunately. As I mentioned, I'm not insured.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. McKinnon. I'll do my best to keep things as affordable as possible. We can check with the lab for their pricing, but I estimate the tests will cost around $150-$200 total. We may be able to find a lower-cost option if needed. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Do you have any allergies to latex or any trouble drawing blood?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. And no trouble drawing blood, thankfully. I’ve always been okay with it, which is good, I guess. It's a bit annoying, but better than being afraid of needles. Okay, so $150-$200 and 2-3 business days. Alright. And then we schedule a follow-up? Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any specific things I should be looking out for, or anything I should avoid? I just want to be prepared. I really appreciate you trying to be efficient and mindful of the cost.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. I want to help you get to the bottom of this. In the meantime, try to maintain your usual activity level as much as possible. Avoid any strenuous activity that significantly worsens your weakness. If you notice any new symptoms, such as fever, numbness, tingling, or difficulty breathing, please contact us immediately. I’ll have the lab requisition form ready for you. Once you've had the blood work done, you can call the clinic to schedule your follow-up appointment. We can discuss the results and create a plan. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Okay, maintain usual activity, avoid strenuous activity, and watch out for new symptoms. Got it. I think that's everything. I don't think I have any questions right now, Doctor. I’m just relieved we’re getting somewhere, even if it’s just blood work. Thank you for your time and for being mindful of the cost. I really appreciate it. Hopefully, the results will give us some answers. I’ll get the blood work done as soon as possible and call to schedule a follow-up. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. I’m glad I could help. I’m optimistic we’ll get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day as well, and take care.
