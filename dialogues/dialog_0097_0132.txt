DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, lovely to meet you too, I suppose. Look, it's this heat, see? Absolutely dreadful. Can't take it anymore. Makes me sweat like a… well, you get the picture. And it's not just a little sweat, it’s constant. Never used to be like this, even back in Nepal. It’s just… unbearable now.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Coby. This heat has been brutal. And it's good you're bringing this up – constant excessive sweating can be bothersome, and sometimes it can be a sign of something else going on. When did you first notice this becoming a problem?
PATIENT: Problem? It is a problem! Honestly, Doc, I'm a practical man. Painter, construction, maintenance – I work outside. Always have. But this summer… it started, oh, maybe six weeks ago? Seemed to creep up on me. First just a bit more than usual, then… well, now I’m soaked through within minutes of stepping outside. It's ridiculous. And embarrassing. Used to be able to handle anything, you know? Now I’m thinking about staying indoors all the time. Not a life, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound like a life at all, Mr. Coby. And it's good you're not just trying to tough it out. Six weeks… that’s helpful. Has the sweating been all over, or is it concentrated in certain areas – like your armpits, your palms, your face?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doc. Everywhere. It's not just, you know, the usual places. Back, chest, even my legs get damp. And my face… forget it. Always shiny. Makes me look like a teenager, which is hardly dignified at my age. I’ve tried everything, you know? Different shirts, fans, staying in the shade… nothing seems to make a difference. Honestly, you younger doctors… you think we haven’t tried basic things before coming to you? It's just... constant. And it's getting worse.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me all of this, Mr. Coby. And you're absolutely right to point that out – people often do try a lot of things before seeking medical help. It’s important to rule things out. Since it’s all over and getting worse, we need to explore some possibilities. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the sweating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been… a bit more tired, I suppose. Not exhausted, but just… sluggish. And my appetite hasn’t been great. Lost a few pounds, but I figured that was just the heat. Not eating much when it’s this hot. Oh, and my hands… they shake a little sometimes. Not constantly, just now and then. Especially when I’m trying to do something precise, like painting a trim. Makes a mess, really. Is that important? Honestly, Doc, I'm not one for complaining, but it's all adding up.
DOCTOR: That’s all very important, Mr. Coby, thank you for sharing all of that. The fatigue, loss of appetite, and the hand tremors… those are definitely things we need to investigate further. Just to get a clearer picture, have you had any fevers, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fevers? No, not a fever. Definitely not. Chills, a little maybe sometimes when I get indoors after being in the sun, but that’s just from the change in temperature. Night sweats… no, not really. I sleep alright, as well as can be expected for a man my age. I don't wake up soaked, if that's what you mean. Look, I’m a pretty straightforward guy, Doc. I work hard, eat reasonably well, don't drink too much. It’s just… this heat is making me feel like I'm falling apart. And frankly, it's worrying. I've never felt like this before. Is it something serious? You younger doctors worry me sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Coby, and it’s good you’re being so open with me. It is good that you're normally so healthy, that helps narrow things down. Given your symptoms and the timeline, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be related to the heat, but the fatigue and tremors are things we should check out. I'd like to do a quick physical exam and then order some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work? Honestly, Doc, I hate needles. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose I can handle a little prick if it means figuring out what's going on. Just… be quick about it, alright? And try not to poke around too much. I’ve got things to do, you know? Painting doesn’t do itself. Just… get it over with. Is this going to take long? I’ve got a job to finish this week, and Mr. Henderson’s a fussy man. A very fussy man.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Coby. I understand completely. We’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. It’s just a standard blood draw, and it shouldn’t take long at all. And I’ll be as gentle as I can. First, let's do a quick exam – I’ll check your heart rate, blood pressure, and just generally take a look. Then we’ll head over to the lab. Sound good?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Let's get it over with, then. I don't like fussing, Doc. Just… tell me what you're doing as you go, alright? Don't want any surprises. And please, try not to use too many complicated words. I’m a painter, not a doctor. Now, where do I sit? And is there air conditioning in this room? It’s sweltering in here. Honestly, this heat… it’s making me dizzy.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Coby. Please, have a seat here. And yes, we do have air conditioning, although it seems to be struggling a bit today. I’ll explain everything as I go, and I’ll definitely avoid any complicated medical jargon. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. It helps me get a sense of how things are working. I'll just need you to take a few deep breaths for me. Then I’ll check your blood pressure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Deep breaths… easy for you to say. I've been breathing all my life. But go ahead. Just… be careful with that thing. Doesn't look very comfortable. And don’t press too hard, alright? My blood pressure’s probably up just from the heat, so don’t read too much into it. Honestly, Doc, you're making me nervous just standing there. Is it going to hurt? I really don’t like doctors. Too many poking and prodding. Just get it over with. And hurry up, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Coby, and I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'm just listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. 140 over 85. A little elevated, as you suspected, but likely due to the heat and your anxiety. Now, I'm just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Open your mouth and say “ahhh” for me. This is just to rule out any simple causes for your fatigue.
PATIENT: “Ahhhh…” Honestly, Doc, this is ridiculous. I feel like a child. All this poking and prodding for nothing. Probably just need a good rest and a cold drink. But alright, you’re the doctor. “Ahhhh…” Just… don’t stick anything down my throat, alright? I’ve had enough poking for one day. Are you seeing anything? Probably just a bit of dust from the painting. Always breathing in dust. It’s a hazard of the job, you know? A very hazardous job. Just tell me when we can get the blood work over with. Honestly, the sooner this is done, the better.
DOCTOR: Everything looks clear, Mr. Coby. No signs of infection or anything concerning. Just a little bit of normal wear and tear. Okay, let’s get that blood work done then. I’m going to send you over to the lab. They’ll just need a small sample, and it shouldn't take more than a few minutes. It will help us rule out some things and get a better understanding of what's going on. I’ll write out the request form for them now. Do you know where the lab is?
PATIENT: The lab? No, I don’t know where anything is in this… establishment. Just point me in the right direction, alright? And tell them I hate needles. Maybe they'll be gentle. Honestly, Doc, I'm starting to regret coming here. All this fussing and prodding for… what? Just to tell me I'm getting old? I've always been a practical man. But this… this is just ridiculous. Just get me to the lab, alright? The sooner I'm out of here, the better. And tell them to hurry up! I've got a job to finish, you know? Mr. Henderson’s waiting! A very impatient man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. The lab is just down the hall on your left. It’s the first door on the left. I’ll let them know you’re coming and that you’re not a fan of needles – I'm sure they'll be as gentle as possible. I understand your frustration, and I apologize if this has been unpleasant. We’re just trying to figure out what’s going on so we can get you feeling better. Once the blood work is done, we’ll have a better idea of the next steps. Do you have any questions before you head over?
PATIENT: Questions? No, I don't have any questions. Just get it over with. Honestly, Doc, you're a nice enough woman, but all this fussing… it’s just too much. "Complete Blood Count, Metabolic Panel…" What does all this mean? Probably just a waste of time and money. But alright, alright. I’ll go to the lab. Just… don’t expect me to be happy about it. And tell them to be quick! Mr. Henderson's waiting! A very fussy, very impatient man. .
