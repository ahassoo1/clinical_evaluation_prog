DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this… feeling full really quick, you know? I don't eat much these days anyway, but even a little bit of food and I feel like I could burst. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I guess. Not sure exactly when it started, to be honest. Old age, probably!
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling full quickly, even with small amounts of food… and you said this has been going on for a few weeks. It can be something simple, and you’re right, it can also be just a part of getting older. But we want to make sure everything is alright. Could you tell me a bit more about what you’re eating when you feel this way?
PATIENT: Well, I mostly have soup. Easy on the teeth, you know? And toast. Sometimes a little bit of fish, if my wife, Elsie, makes it. Nothing fancy. And like I said, it doesn’t matter what it is, really. Soup, toast, fish… a few bites and I'm done. Used to be able to put away a good plate of food, even when I was a young man. Now? Not so much. Elsie worries about me, thinks I’m wasting away.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've made some adjustments to your diet, which is good. And it’s very kind of Elsie to look out for you. Okay, so even with soup, toast, or fish – just a few bites, and you feel full. Do you experience any other symptoms along with this feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. Maybe a bit tired sometimes, but I’m 88, Doctor! That comes with the territory, right? No pain, no bloating… just… full. Quick. It’s just… strange. I can eat a few bites, then I have to sit there for an hour before I even think about another spoonful. It's making it hard to enjoy my meals, which, at my age, are one of the few pleasures I still have.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Obarr. It’s important to enjoy your meals, especially at any age. No pain or bloating, just the feeling of fullness quickly, and then fatigue. Now, have you noticed any change in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Elsie keeps an eye on that, I don't bother myself with it too much. I think… I think I've lost a little bit. Not a lot, mind you. Just enough for Elsie to start fussing. She's always saying I need to eat more, but like I said, I fill up so fast. It’s a bit of a cycle, really.
DOCTOR: It sounds like Elsie is very attentive, which is wonderful. So, a slight weight loss, noticed by Elsie. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had my appendix out when I was a young man, but that was ages ago. And my knees are acting up, arthritis, you know? Nothing serious. I’ve always been pretty healthy, though. Never smoked, didn’t drink much… just a little bit of beer with dinner sometimes. My wife keeps telling me about her sister’s heart trouble, but I don’t have anything like that. Nothing the doctors have ever said was wrong with me, anyway.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Obarr. Appendix removed in the past, and some arthritis in your knees… otherwise, you’ve been generally healthy. Now, have you ever had any surgeries other than your appendix?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. Just the appendix. Elsie might remember something, she has a better memory for these things. But I’m pretty sure it was just the one. Never had any trouble that needed cuttin’ open, thankfully. I always figured, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, you know?
DOCTOR: A very sensible approach, Mr. Obarr. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That’s a tough one. My mother lived to be 92, a strong woman, she was. Elsie’s mother had a bit of trouble with her stomach, always complaining. And her father… I think he had something with his heart. But it was a long time ago, and Elsie doesn't remember the details. We didn’t really talk about it much, to be honest. It’s not something we Haida people dwell on. We focus more on living, you know?
DOCTOR: That's a lovely perspective, Mr. Obarr. I appreciate you sharing that with me. So, your mother lived to a good age, Elsie’s mother had stomach issues, and her father had heart trouble, although details are limited. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with allergies. Elsie always checks when she gives me my pills, though. She's very careful. I think she worries I’ll forget to tell the doctor something important! She’s probably right.
DOCTOR: It’s good to have someone looking out for you. So, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees, the arthritis, you know? It’s called… uh… I forget the name. Starts with a ‘C’… Elsie gets it for me. And sometimes a little bit of something for my blood pressure, but not very often. Mostly just the knee pills. That's about it. Elsie keeps track of it all.
DOCTOR: Okay, something for your knees and something for your blood pressure, occasionally. We'll take a look at your records to confirm those medications. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm used to poking and prodding at my old body! Just try not to hurt me too much, eh? These bones ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Mr. Obarr. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Sounds good, normal rhythm. And I'm just going to feel your abdomen. Hmm, a little bit of tenderness here. Your extremities seem good, normal pulses. Now, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen again. Sounds normal, no unusual noises. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: A little bit, maybe. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It’s always a bit tender up there. Elsie says it’s probably just gas. I get a lot of gas these days! Old age, you know. But it doesn't really bother me. Just a little bit of discomfort when someone pokes around.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little discomfort with palpation, which you attribute to gas. I’m noting that. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I would like to order some blood work. This will help us rule out any underlying issues and get a better understanding of what’s going on. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and some liver function tests. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood work, eh? Well, I don’t love needles, but if it’ll help figure things out, I suppose. Elsie will be happy I’m getting it done. She always says I should go to the doctor more often. Complete blood count… metabolic panel… liver function tests… sounds complicated. Just tell me when and where to go, and I’ll show up.
DOCTOR: It does sound complicated, but we’ll take care of everything here. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will draw the blood for you. It shouldn’t take too long. We'll need you to fast for 8 hours before the blood draw, meaning no food or drink except water. I’m also going to order a stool test to check for any abnormalities. That can be done at home. The nurse will give you the instructions and a collection kit. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend continuing to eat small meals throughout the day and staying well-hydrated. And if your symptoms worsen—if you experience any severe pain, nausea, vomiting, or significant weight loss—please contact us immediately. Does that all sound clear?
PATIENT: Okay, small meals, stay hydrated, and watch for bad stuff like pain and sickness. Fast for eight hours before the blood work, and the stool test at home… Elsie will be writing all this down, I guarantee it. She's very organized. Yes, I think I understand. It's a lot, but Elsie will help me remember. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. And it's wonderful that you have Elsie to help. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they are available, usually within a few days. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You've covered everything pretty thoroughly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man like me. Elsie will be pleased we got this sorted out, or at least started to get sorted out.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Mr. Obarr. And please remember, it’s never a bother to listen. Taking care of you is what I’m here for. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions for the blood work and stool test. Have a good day, and please give Elsie my regards.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will, I will. Elsie always says you're a very good doctor. I'll see you again soon, I suppose.
