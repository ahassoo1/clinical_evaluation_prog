DOCTOR: Good morning, Chelise. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter saying my cholesterol is a little high, I think. Hyper… something? The numbers weren’t good, and they wanted me to come talk about it. I don’t really understand all that medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Right, yes. Hyperlipidemia, that's the fancy word for high cholesterol. Don’t worry about remembering that, though. It’s very common, and we can definitely sort this out. So, the letter just mentioned high cholesterol, or did it give you any specific numbers?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Yes, here it is. It says… total cholesterol is 240, LDL is 160, and HDL is 40. And… triglycerides are 180. Does that mean anything to you? I really don’t know what any of those are, but it seemed important.
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, those numbers are helpful. Thank you for bringing that in. You’re right to want to understand this. Basically, cholesterol isn’t bad – your body needs it, but too much of certain kinds can cause problems. Your total cholesterol at 240 is a little elevated. The LDL, that’s the “bad” cholesterol, is definitely higher than we’d like at 160. HDL, the “good” cholesterol, is a bit on the lower side at 40. And your triglycerides at 180 are borderline high. Do you have any family history of heart disease, high cholesterol, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. So, the higher numbers are… not good? Hmm, family history… my father had a heart attack when he was 68, I think. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… something with her blood pressure, I believe. Not cholesterol, though, as far as I know. She was always a bit frail, but I don’t remember exactly what the doctor said. It was a long time ago. And my mother, she lived to be 85, very healthy, as far as I know. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does help, thank you. Knowing about your father’s heart attack is particularly relevant. And even your mother's good health is useful information. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been a healthy person, really. I don’t drink much either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not every night. I try to eat well, mostly vegetables and lean protein. I do love my sweets, though. Can’t resist a good piece of chocolate!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent! It sounds like you’re doing a lot of things right. A little chocolate is perfectly fine – we don’t want to make things too restrictive. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Well, I used to walk a lot more. I retired a few years ago, and… it’s just gotten harder to motivate myself, I guess. I live in an apartment building, so I do walk up and down the stairs sometimes, but it’s not a regular thing. Maybe three or four times a week, if that. I should probably do more, I know. It’s just… tiring sometimes. I used to be very active, though, when I was working as an aerospace engineer, lots of walking around the facilities.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It can be challenging to keep up with activity levels after retirement. It sounds like you’ve been very active in the past, which is great. Okay, just a few more quick questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve had a few medications over the years, for minor things, but nothing serious. No reactions, as far as I can remember. I haven’t taken anything regularly in a long time, except for vitamins. And I’m not allergic to any foods either.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s all good to know. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and pulse, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead, please. I always get a little nervous at the doctor, but I know it’s important. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Chelise, I appreciate your trust. I'll be as quick as possible. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Blood pressure is 142/88, and pulse is 78 and regular. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which isn’t unexpected given your cholesterol levels, but we’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’d like to check your weight and height, if you don't mind.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Yes, go ahead. I haven't weighed myself in ages, to be honest. I’m rather tall, you know. 199 centimeters, I think. Or maybe it’s 200? I always forget! And I’m… around 124 pounds, I would guess. I'm usually pretty slim.
DOCTOR: Okay, your height is 199 centimeters, and your weight is 124 pounds. That gives you a BMI of 31.2. While you wouldn’t necessarily consider yourself overweight, your BMI is in the range considered overweight. It's important to consider this alongside your other measurements, of course, and we'll discuss it further. Now, based on everything we’ve talked about, your cholesterol is elevated, your blood pressure is slightly high, and your BMI is a little higher than we'd like. We need to address these factors to reduce your risk of heart disease. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I mean, I want to be healthy. It’s just… a little overwhelming, to be honest. I haven’t had to worry about this sort of thing before. Where do we even start? Do I need to take medication? I’ve always been a bit wary of pills, if you don’t mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, and you're right to be cautious about medication. Let's not jump to that immediately. We have several options, and medication would be a last resort if other things aren't effective. First, we can focus on lifestyle modifications. That means improving your diet, increasing your physical activity, and managing your stress levels. Small changes can make a big difference. We can start with a simple plan – perhaps walking for 30 minutes most days of the week and making a few adjustments to your eating habits, like reducing your intake of saturated fats and adding more fiber to your diet. I can provide you with some resources on healthy eating and exercise. We can also discuss strategies for managing stress. I’d also like to order some blood work to get a more complete picture of your cholesterol levels and rule out any underlying causes. We should also get a baseline EKG to assess your heart health. How does that sound as a starting point?
PATIENT: That… sounds much better. Small changes, yes, that I can do. Walking is good. And I’m happy to look at some resources on healthy eating. The blood work and EKG… well, it’s a bit scary, but if you think it’s important, I trust your judgment. What about the chocolate? Do I have to give up chocolate completely? Just kidding… mostly. But seriously, is a little treat okay?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely no need to give up chocolate completely! A small treat is perfectly fine. In fact, denying yourself completely can sometimes backfire. Everything in moderation. The goal is to make sustainable changes that you can live with long-term. Okay, so we'll start with lifestyle modifications. I'll give you a handout with some specific recommendations for diet and exercise. I'll also schedule you for blood work and an EKG. The lab results should be back in about a week, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel much better knowing we’re starting with small changes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I think I can manage this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chelise. And you absolutely can manage this. Remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here's the lab request form and the appointment card for your follow-up. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to seeing you then.
