DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, lately I does be feeling very thirsty all the time, even if I just drink something. And I feel hungry all the time too, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just don't seem right, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Bianca. Feeling excessively thirsty and hungry despite drinking and eating normally is certainly concerning, and I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. That’s a good observation on your part to notice something isn't quite right. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It start maybe… about two months ago, I would say? It wasn't sudden like, one day it just start. It build up slowly. First, I notice I was drinking more water than usual. Then, I start feeling hungry quicker after eating. Now, it's like… almost constant. It's tiring, you know? Always thinking about food and drink.
DOCTOR: I can certainly understand how tiring that would be, Bianca. Two months of gradually increasing thirst and hunger is helpful information. Have you noticed any other changes along with this, such as needing to urinate more frequently, any unexplained weight loss or gain, blurry vision, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, now that you mention it… I does be going to the bathroom more often, yes. Especially at night. It wake me up sometimes! And… I think I might have lost a little weight, but I haven’t really been weighing myself. My clothes feel a little looser, maybe? I haven't been feeling much energy either, just tired all the time. Everything feels like a strain. But I thought that was just from getting older, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re sharing all of this with me, Bianca. Frequent urination, especially at night, along with weight loss and fatigue… those are all important things to note. It's good to consider all possibilities, and attributing it to age is reasonable, but we need to investigate further to be sure. Do you have any past medical conditions that you're aware of, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. I had high blood pressure years ago, but the doctor say it was under control with tablets for a while. I stop taking them a few years back, 'cause I wasn't feeling well on them. But I haven't been to the doctor regular since then, to be honest. And no, I don't think I ever had anything with my kidneys. Nothing like that. My mother had arthritis, but that's all I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. A history of high blood pressure, even if previously controlled, is important to know. And no known kidney problems or family history of diabetes besides your mother’s arthritis. Now, Bianca, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins, Doctor. A multivitamin, you know, the regular kind. And sometimes I take a little ginger when my stomach does be troubling me. That's all. Nothing else. I don’t really believe in taking a lot of pills unless I really need them.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference, Bianca. Multivitamins and ginger occasionally aren’t usually a concern. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to figure out what’s causing all this thirst and tiredness. It's just wearing me down, you know? Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, at 148/92. Your heart and lungs sound clear, but your reflexes are a bit diminished. I’m also noting some mild dryness of your skin. These findings, combined with your symptoms, raise a concern for possible diabetes. To confirm this, I'd like to order a blood glucose test, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a Hemoglobin A1c test, which will give us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Diabetes… oh dear. My cousin had that, yes. It was bad. A lot of needles. Well, if you think it's best, Doctor, then yes. Do whatever you need to do. I just want to know what's happening. Blood tests are… alright. As long as it's not too much trouble. Is it going to be painful? And how long will I have to wait for the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Bianca. It’s natural to be anxious about the possibility of diabetes, and your cousin’s experience is likely on your mind. Modern diabetes management has come a long way, and many people live full and healthy lives with it. While some people do require insulin injections, there are also oral medications and lifestyle changes that can be very effective. The blood draw itself is usually just a quick pinch, and most people don’t find it very painful. You'll feel a brief sting, and then it's over. As for the results, the lab usually takes 24-48 hours to process the tests. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend trying to drink plenty of water, but not excessive amounts, and eating regular, balanced meals. Do you have any allergies to any medications or foods I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Nothing like that. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had any bad reactions to medicines before. I'm just… a little scared, to be honest. But I'll try and drink the water and eat properly. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Two days… alright, I'll wait.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to be scared, Bianca. It’s good to acknowledge those feelings. We'll take this one step at a time, and I’ll be here to answer any questions you have along the way. I'm going to have the nurse draw your blood now. After that, we’ll schedule your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms, such as blurred vision, excessive fatigue, or confusion, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all for now. Just the blood test, and then wait two days. I'll try not to worry too much. Thank you again for being so kind and explaining everything. It makes me feel a little better, knowing what's happening.
DOCTOR: Very good, Bianca. That’s a great attitude. I will have the nurse come in to assist you with the blood draw. .
