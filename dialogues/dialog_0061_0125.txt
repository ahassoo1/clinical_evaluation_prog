DOCTOR: Bula! Hi Jacquille, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Kimm. Thanks. Look, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest, but my wife and I... we decided it would be best if I just got tested for, you know... that thing. HIV. Just to be safe, really. She’s a sensible woman, my wife. Better to know, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No need to be embarrassed at all, Jacquille. That's a very responsible thing to do, and it's smart to be proactive about your health and your wife's. Testing is the best way to know for sure. So, just to clarify, you're requesting an HIV test as a precaution?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. A precaution. Look, we haven’t… done anything risky, if you catch my drift. But you read things, you hear things, and it's just… peace of mind, that’s all. My wife worries. And honestly? I’d rather just get it over with. It's not like I'm doing anything wrong, is it? I mean, being careful is just common sense.
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not, Jacquille. Being careful and wanting to know your status is very sensible, and definitely not wrong. It's good you're thinking about this. To help me understand a bit more, and make sure we do the right testing, can you tell me a little about your and your wife’s sexual history?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Sexual history. Look, Dr. Kimm, with all due respect, is that really necessary? We’re talking about a precaution here, not… a confession. We’ve both been pretty careful our whole lives. I mean, she's my wife! I trust her. And I trust myself. It feels a bit… intrusive, to be honest. I just want the test, not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Jacquille, and I apologize if that felt intrusive. You're right to question it. It’s not about mistrust at all. The reason I ask is because the recommendations for testing frequency depend on risk factors. Since you said this is a precaution, knowing if there's any possibility of exposure in the past helps me determine the best testing approach, and ensure we’re getting accurate results. It also helps me understand if any additional testing might be helpful. If you’re truly uncomfortable discussing details, we can proceed with a standard HIV test. However, it might be more reassuring to know if a more comprehensive test is needed. Would you prefer to just proceed with the standard test, or would you be willing to share a little bit about your past sexual activity – and I want to assure you this information is completely confidential?
PATIENT: Look, alright. Fine. But don’t expect a detailed autobiography. We’ve… both had previous relationships, before we got married. Nothing recent. Years ago. And honestly, they weren’t… significant. Casual, mostly. And that was a long time ago, before… you know, things were as much of a worry as they are now. Does that help? I just... I'm a private person, and I don't really like talking about this stuff. I’d just like to get this over with.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jacquille. Thank you for sharing that. Knowing there were previous relationships helps me understand the situation better. "Casual" is enough information for now; I don't need any details you’re not comfortable sharing. Just to be clear, when you say “years ago”, roughly how many years are we talking?
PATIENT: Let me think… my wife and I have been married for fifteen years. Before that, for me… maybe seven or eight years, maximum? So, almost twenty years ago, at least. It was a different world back then, honestly. People weren’t so… aware. And I wasn't exactly a saint, I'll admit, but nothing reckless. Look, is this really making a difference? I just want the test. Is it going to change something?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. Twenty years ago does put things into perspective. Yes, it does make a difference in terms of the type of test we should consider. Since it was so long ago and you haven't had any risky behaviors since marrying your wife, a standard antibody test is likely sufficient. However, to be absolutely sure, and given the concerns you’ve expressed, I would recommend a fourth-generation HIV test. It looks for both antibodies and the actual virus, and it can detect HIV a bit earlier than a standard antibody test. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Fourth-generation… sounds fancy. Look, if it's more thorough, then yes. Fine. Whatever it takes to get this done and put my wife’s mind at ease. Honestly, I just want to rule things out. Is it more expensive? Because I have Medicare, so I'm not sure what's covered. And is it a blood test? I’m not great with needles.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. It is slightly more expensive, but Medicare does typically cover HIV testing, including fourth-generation tests, as preventative care. We’ll double-check your coverage before proceeding to make sure there are no out-of-pocket costs. And yes, it is a blood test. We’ll just need a small sample from your arm. I understand you're not great with needles, and we can make it as comfortable as possible. We have numbing cream available, and I’m very experienced at drawing blood. I can also talk you through the process step-by-step, and we can take it slow. Before we proceed with the blood draw, I’d like to quickly review your medical history – just to make sure there’s nothing else that might impact the testing or results. Have you ever had a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: Blood transfusion? No. Never. I'm perfectly healthy, thank you very much. A bit stressed right now, maybe, but physically sound. Look, can we just get on with it? The longer we talk about this, the more anxious I'm getting. I have a busy week, you know. I need to get back to work. Is there anything else you need to ask, or can we finally do the test?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No history of blood transfusions. That’s helpful. No, that's all the questions I have for now. We can absolutely proceed with the test. If you're ready, we can head to the lab just down the hall. It will only take a few minutes. Once the sample is collected, it usually takes about a week to get the results back. We'll contact you as soon as they are available. Would you like me to explain the results process again before we go?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright. Let's just get it over with. A week? A whole week? That’s a long time to worry. But fine. Let’s go. Lead the way. Hopefully, this is as quick and painless as possible. And hopefully, it’s all negative. Honestly, that’s all I’m hoping for.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s go. The lab technician is very efficient. And you're right, a week is a long time to wait, but it's the standard turnaround time for accurate results. We can discuss some coping strategies for managing anxiety while you wait if you'd like. I’m confident everything will be alright, Jacquille. We're taking the right steps to ensure your peace of mind.
