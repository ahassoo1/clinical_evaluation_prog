DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Belan, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Belan. Jacquille Belan. Look, I just… I wanted to get tested for, you know… the HIV thing. Just want to be sure. It's a routine check, right? Shouldn't take long.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “routine” is a relative term, Mr. Belan. It's good you’re being… proactive. Though frankly, most people come in with symptoms. But alright. To be thorough – and it will take more than just a moment – can you tell me a bit about why you're concerned enough to get tested now?
PATIENT: Concerned? Honestly, it’s just… common sense. You hear things, you read things. Better to know, right? I’m married, very happily married, and my wife… she deserves to know I’m careful. It’s not like I’ve been… reckless, if that's what you’re implying. It's just… due diligence. A responsible thing to do. I don't need a reason, do I? People get tested. It’s normal.
DOCTOR: “Normal” is… subjective, Mr. Belan. And yes, you are correct, you don’t need a reason. However, understanding your risk factors helps me determine the appropriate testing protocol. Have you had any… recent changes in partners?
PATIENT: Recent changes? No! Absolutely not. I told you, happily married. Been with my wife for… ten years now. We don’t have other partners. Honestly, the question is a bit insulting, don’t you think? I’m just being sensible. It’s preventative. It's not like I’m… you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Of course. My apologies if the question seemed… impertinent. It’s standard procedure to assess all potential exposures. Have you ever shared needles, even for recreational purposes?
PATIENT: Needles? Are you serious? I’m a compliance officer! Do I look like the kind of person who… shares needles? What is this, an interrogation? Look, I understand you have to ask these things, but it’s starting to feel… accusatory. I’m a respectable member of society. This is about being responsible, not about… whatever you’re implying.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I assure you, I’m not making implications. These are necessary questions for a complete medical history. Let’s move on. Have you ever received a blood transfusion or had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Yes, actually. A few years back, I had my appendix out. And… let me think… I broke my arm when I was a teenager, so I had surgery to set it. Transfusion… no, never had a transfusion. Look, is this going to take all day? I have work, you know. This is becoming rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendix removed, fractured arm surgically repaired. And no blood transfusions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. Maybe a bit of a runny nose with some strong antibiotics, but nothing serious. I can take most things. Paracetamol, ibuprofen… standard stuff. I don’t go around needing an EpiPen, if that’s what you’re asking. Honestly, this is just a basic check-up, right? A quick test, and I’m on my way.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… vitamins sometimes. Multivitamins. Nothing regular. Definitely nothing prescribed by a doctor. I’m a healthy man! Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I explained I just want the HIV test. It shouldn’t require a life story.
DOCTOR: Right. I understand your… frustration, Mr. Belan. We can proceed with the HIV test. It will involve a blood draw. I will need to ask you to step into the examination room.
PATIENT: Finally. Good. Let’s get it over with. I hope it doesn't take long.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. And I'll need to briefly examine you. Just standard procedure. Blood pressure, pulse… nothing invasive.
PATIENT: Examining me? Seriously? I came in for a blood test, not a full physical! Is this some kind of… punishment for asking questions? Look, I’m perfectly healthy. I don't need to be poked and prodded. Just take the blood and let me go. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, a basic examination is prudent before any medical procedure. It’s for your safety and to rule out any underlying conditions that might affect the results. It will take less than five minutes. Blood pressure and pulse, listen to your lungs…standard. I assure you, it's not punitive. It is…responsible medicine.
PATIENT: Responsible medicine? Look, I work in compliance! I understand protocols. But this feels… excessive. Fine. Do your blood pressure thing, but that's it. No listening to my lungs, no prodding. Just the blood pressure. And then the test. Deal?
DOCTOR: Very well. Blood pressure is… 130 over 85. Slightly elevated, but not concerning. Now, please roll up your sleeve. We will proceed with the blood draw.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. This will sting for a moment. Try to relax your arm. The sample has been collected. You will receive the results in approximately one to two weeks. Now, if you have no further questions, I suggest you go home and try to lower your blood pressure.
PATIENT: One to two weeks? That’s ridiculous! I thought these things were quicker now. And lowering my blood pressure? You’re seriously lecturing me? Look, I'm perfectly capable of managing my own health. Just give me a number to call if there’s a problem. I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: The laboratory processing time is outside of my control, Mr. Belan. The results will be sent to your primary care physician, who will contact you. Here is the number for the lab if you wish to inquire about the status of your sample. And perhaps consider adopting a healthier lifestyle. It's simply… sound advice. .
