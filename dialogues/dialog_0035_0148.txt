DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Alzoubi. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s…difficult to explain exactly. I’ve been having some discomfort…down there. In, um, the groin area. It’s…painful. Though, not constantly. It comes and goes. I wasn't sure who to see, to be honest. It's rather embarrassing, and I apologize for having to bother you with such a personal matter.
DOCTOR: It’s no bother at all, Noelani. Many women experience these types of issues, and that’s what I’m here for. We’ll figure this out. When you say it comes and goes, can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Well, it started…sometime last month, I believe? It’s hard to recall dates precisely. It doesn't hurt all the time, like a constant ache. More like…a sharp twinge, or a dull pressure, and then it goes away. Sometimes it happens after I’ve been…working. I do a lot of woodworking, you see. Lots of bending and lifting. Other times, it seems to happen for no reason at all. I truly can’t pinpoint a specific trigger. And it doesn't feel like…a regular pain, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: That does make sense. It sounds like it’s intermittent, which is helpful to know. And you mentioned woodworking – bending and lifting…okay. Does the pain radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate…does that mean…does it spread? Hmm… sometimes, yes. I believe so. It’s not a strong sensation, but occasionally I feel a bit of discomfort in my lower stomach, and… perhaps my back? Though, I often have back pain anyway, from the work, so it’s difficult to tell if it’s related. It's…a very vague feeling. I’m terribly sorry I can’t be more precise. I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Noelani. It’s good you’re telling me everything you’re experiencing, even if it feels vague. Okay, so it can radiate to your lower abdomen and potentially your back. Is it worse with certain movements, like twisting or sitting?
PATIENT: Yes… now that you mention it, sitting can be uncomfortable. Especially on harder surfaces. And twisting… yes, definitely twisting. When I reach for tools or move wood around, it often makes it worse. It’s like…a pulling sensation, if that makes sense? Not sharp, but… noticeable. And bending, as I said before, it’s not ideal. I try to avoid it when I can, but with the woodworking, it's sometimes unavoidable. I do find that… resting helps. Lying down, keeping still… that provides some relief.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s exacerbated by sitting, twisting, and bending, and relieved by rest. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… I don't think so. No fever, no… discharge, nothing like that. I have felt a little more tired lately, but I assumed that was just from the work. It’s been a busy few weeks. And… my appetite hasn't been quite as good. But honestly, I’ve always been a bit of a picky eater. I truly can't say if that's related or not. It’s all rather perplexing. Is it possible this is simply a muscle strain? Perhaps I overdid it with the lifting?
DOCTOR: It could be a muscle strain, Noelani, but we need to rule out other possibilities. The fatigue and decreased appetite are good things to mention, and we’ll take those into account. Have you had any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… that's a rather personal question, isn’t it? No, Doctor. I don’t believe so. Everything seems… normal in that regard. No constipation, no difficulty urinating, nothing out of the ordinary. I apologize for being so… vague. It’s difficult to articulate these things. I hope I'm providing enough information. I wouldn't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: You're not wasting my time at all, Noelani. And you're doing just fine. It’s good you’re able to share this with me. Let's move on to a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… hmm. Let me see… I had high blood pressure a few years ago, perhaps five or six years back, but it was managed with medication for a while, and then… I stopped taking it. My doctor at the time said it had come down enough on its own with lifestyle changes. I haven't been regularly checked since, to be honest. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. I have always been relatively healthy. Just the occasional aches and pains from the woodworking, you see. And a bit of arthritis in my hands, but nothing major. I’m on Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of managed hypertension, now controlled with lifestyle changes. And some arthritis in your hands. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh! Yes, actually. When I was younger… about thirty years ago, I had my appendix removed. And… I had a hysterectomy as well, many years ago. Perhaps fifteen years ago. That’s all, I believe. Nothing else major. It’s hard to keep track of things, to be honest. It was quite some time ago. Does that… change anything?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't change anything drastically, Noelani, thank you for letting me know. Both the appendectomy and hysterectomy are good to have on record. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not to my knowledge. I can take most common over-the-counter medications without issue – ibuprofen, acetaminophen, things like that. I’ve never needed any strong prescription drugs, thankfully. I try to avoid them whenever possible. I’m not one for taking pills, you see. I truly don’t believe I have any allergies. It's good to know, though, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you mentioned you're on Medicare. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, regularly?
PATIENT: No, not at the moment. As I said, I try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. I occasionally take ibuprofen for aches and pains from the woodworking, but it’s not a regular thing. Perhaps once or twice a week, if that. And sometimes a multivitamin, but I've been rather forgetful about that lately, to be honest. I don't consider those “regular” medications, you see. Nothing prescribed, nothing I take every day. Just the occasional ibuprofen and a forgotten multivitamin. It's probably not very helpful information, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen, inconsistent multivitamin use. Thank you for letting me know. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have a family history of cancer – particularly ovarian, uterine, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a difficult one. My mother passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t have much information about her side of the family. I know she had some health problems, but I wasn’t old enough to understand what they were. My father… he lived to a good age, but he didn’t talk much about his family either. I believe my aunt, on my father's side, had colon cancer many years ago. But I’m not entirely sure. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to her. Other than that… no, I don’t recall anyone else having cancer. It’s not something we talked about much in my family. I apologize for not being more helpful. I wish I had more information for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible family history of colon cancer on your father's side. That's good to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I don’t drink alcohol very often, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but not regularly. I’ve always been rather health-conscious, despite my forgetfulness. I believe in taking care of myself, as much as I can. I suppose that’s why this discomfort is so worrying, you see. I usually feel quite well.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very occasional alcohol use. Now, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the woodworking. I’ve been doing it for… well, for a very long time now, almost thirty years. I mostly work with hardwoods – oak, maple, cherry. I build furniture, mostly – tables, chairs, bookshelves. I do a lot of custom work, so it involves a lot of bending, lifting, and twisting. It’s physically demanding, to be honest, but I enjoy it immensely. Though, lately, it has been… challenging. My back aches more often, and I've had to take more breaks. It's perhaps a sign I need to slow down, but I love what I do. It keeps me busy, keeps me active. I mostly work alone in my workshop, so I have a lot of control over the pace, which is nice. But it’s also quite isolating, to be honest. It's a bit of a double-edged sword.
DOCTOR: Okay, woodworking for 30 years, physically demanding, involving bending, lifting, and twisting. Thank you for sharing that. Alright, Noelani, let me just review your chart quickly. Okay, I see you've had your regular checkups, but it's been a few years since your last physical. Based on what you've told me, I'd like to do a physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment completely. Please, go ahead. I just want to find out what’s causing this discomfort, and hopefully get it sorted out. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and then I'll gently palpate your lower abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. It might be a little uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything is particularly painful. I'll also do a quick pelvic exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam… yes, I suppose so. If you think it's necessary, Doctor, then please proceed. I understand it’s part of a thorough examination. Just… please be gentle? I haven't had one in a very long time. I trust your care, Doctor. Just let me know what you’re doing as you go, if you don’t mind. It will help me relax.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Noelani. I will explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle as possible. I'll start with listening to your abdomen. Take some deep breaths for me. Your bowel sounds are normal. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your lower abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain anywhere. And please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or unusual. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It’s… okay so far. A little uncomfortable, but not painful. Ooh, there. That’s… a little tender. It's not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. It feels like…pressure, perhaps? And it’s more noticeable when you press there. It’s… definitely more sensitive on that side. Is that…bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That's helpful. It's not necessarily bad, Noelani, but it warrants further investigation. Now, I'm going to proceed with the pelvic exam. I'll ask you to lie on your back with your feet in stirrups. I'll use a speculum to gently visualize your cervix and vagina, and then I'll do a bimanual exam to feel your uterus and ovaries. This will also help me to assess the tenderness you’re experiencing. It might be a little uncomfortable, but please try to relax. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam… No, I don't think so. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please be gentle, as you said before. And explain what you're doing as you go, if you wouldn’t mind. It helps me to…feel more at ease. It’s been a long time. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Noelani. I will explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, I’m going to start by inserting the speculum. It's a plastic instrument that gently opens the vaginal canal so I can visualize the cervix. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Take a deep breath for me… Okay, I’m just looking at your cervix now. It appears normal, no obvious lesions or abnormalities. Now, I’m going to do a bimanual exam. I’ll insert two gloved fingers into your vagina and gently press on your abdomen to feel your uterus and ovaries. This may be a little uncomfortable, but please let me know if you feel any sharp pain. I’m just feeling your uterus now… it feels normal in size and position. Now, I’m going to feel your ovaries… Okay… there’s some tenderness on your right ovary. It's not dramatically enlarged, but it does feel a bit sensitive to the touch. Do you feel any pain with that?
PATIENT: Yes… that’s… uncomfortable. Not sharp, like a stabbing pain, but…a dull ache, and it’s…throbbing a little now. It’s definitely more sensitive on that side, as you said. It feels…fuller, perhaps? I don't know if that makes sense. It's… definitely not normal. It’s throbbing a bit more now, actually. What does that mean? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It's good you're describing everything so clearly, Noelani. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The tenderness and fullness on your right ovary could indicate a few things – a cyst, possibly, or potentially a sign of an ectopic pregnancy, although given your age and history, that’s less likely. It could also be related to something like pelvic inflammatory disease, though you don't have any other symptoms of that right now. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a transvaginal ultrasound. That will allow us to visualize your ovaries and uterus in more detail. I also want to order a blood test, specifically a complete blood count and a CA-125 level, which can help us rule out some other possibilities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… and blood tests? Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is necessary. It’s… frightening, hearing all of that. If it will help us figure out what’s going on, then please proceed. An ectopic pregnancy… that sounds…serious. Is it a definite possibility? What are the chances? And what are the next steps, if that’s what it is?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re frightened, Noelani. I want to assure you that we're just gathering information right now. An ectopic pregnancy is a possibility, but it’s less likely given your age and history. The ultrasound will help us determine if that’s the case. If it is an ectopic pregnancy, the next steps would involve medication or possibly surgery to remove the pregnancy. But again, let's not jump to conclusions. It could be something much less serious. I’m going to write you a referral for the ultrasound. It’s located at [Clinic Name and Address]. They should be able to get you in within the next 24 to 48 hours. I’ll also have the lab technician draw the blood samples before you leave today. Do you have any questions about the ultrasound or the blood tests?
PATIENT: Within 24 to 48 hours… that sounds… fast. No, I don’t think so. I just… I’m worried, Doctor. What are the chances it’s not an ectopic pregnancy? What else could it be? Is it possible it’s just a cyst that will go away on its own? And if it is a cyst, is it dangerous?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be worried, Noelani, and I want to assure you that the majority of the time, these types of issues are not ectopic pregnancies. Most likely, it’s a functional cyst, which are very common and often resolve on their own within a few menstrual cycles. If it is a cyst, it’s usually not dangerous unless it’s very large, causes significant pain, or ruptures. If it ruptures, it can cause some abdominal discomfort and bleeding, but it’s usually not life-threatening. The ultrasound will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. And the blood tests will help us rule out any other possibilities, like pelvic inflammatory disease. Let’s focus on getting those tests done first, and then we can discuss the results and come up with a plan. I’m confident we’ll figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better soon. Do you have any questions about the ultrasound procedure itself?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. It's just… I've never had one before. Is it painful? And what if they find something… serious? What happens then? I know I'm being a bit dramatic, but I'm just… very anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to be anxious, Noelani. It’s perfectly normal to feel this way. The ultrasound itself is not usually painful. The technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and then move a probe over your skin. You might feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t hurt. As for what happens if they find something serious… we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. If they find something that requires further investigation, we’ll discuss all of your options and come up with a plan that’s best for you. I will be there with you every step of the way. We'll start with the ultrasound, get those results, and then we'll talk about everything. It’s important to remember that we don’t have all the information yet. Let's not jump to conclusions. Are you able to schedule the ultrasound yourself, or would you like me to do it for you?
PATIENT: You could schedule it for me, if that’s not too much trouble. I just… I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed right now. I don’t think I can handle another phone call. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. And after the ultrasound… will you call me with the results? Or do I need to schedule another appointment?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Noelani. I’m happy to schedule the ultrasound for you. Just a moment… Okay, I’ve scheduled you for an ultrasound at [Clinic Name] tomorrow at [Time]. They’ll call you to confirm the appointment. As for the results, I will call you directly with the results as soon as they are available. It usually takes 24 to 48 hours for the radiologist to read the ultrasound. If there are any concerns, we will schedule an appointment for you to come back in so we can discuss the results and come up with a plan. Now, I’m going to have the lab technician draw some blood samples. That will help us rule out any other possible causes for your discomfort. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies. Okay, that’s good. All right. Let’s get the blood work done. I just want to know what’s going on, and get this sorted out. Is there anything else I need to do? Anything I should avoid before the ultrasound?
DOCTOR: No, there’s nothing special you need to do before the ultrasound. You can eat and drink normally. Just try to relax and get some rest. I’m going to go ahead and get the lab technician in to draw the blood samples now. “Maria, could you come in here for a moment, please?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I truly appreciate your patience and kindness. I just hope everything turns out okay.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on. Just try to stay positive. “Maria, this is Noelani. She needs a complete blood count and a CA-125 level drawn.”
