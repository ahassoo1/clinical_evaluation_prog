DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you. Well, it’s this tiredness… daytime tiredness, mostly. I’ve been using one of those machines at night – a CPAP, I think they call it – for a while now, and it should be helping, but I’m still dragging all day. It’s… frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It is frustrating when things aren’t working as expected. A CPAP should certainly make a difference. And you said daytime tiredness… is it just tiredness, or are you noticing anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s not just feeling sleepy, exactly. Sometimes I feel… foggy, you know? Like my brain isn't quite working right. And my wife – she says I still snore a little, even with the machine on. Not as bad, but she definitely notices it. Does that make sense? I used to be a very clear thinker, and now… well, not so much. It worries me a bit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. The “fog,” as you call it, is good to know. And your wife noticing some continued snoring… that’s important information too. It suggests the CPAP may not be fully optimized, or there might be other factors at play. Have you had any follow-up appointments with the sleep specialist who prescribed the CPAP to adjust the settings?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I did. About six months ago, I think. They checked the mask, made a few adjustments to the pressure… said everything looked good on the report. They said I was using it enough hours, too. Honestly, Doctor, it felt a bit like they were just checking boxes. They didn’t really listen to me when I said I wasn’t feeling much better. That’s why I thought I’d come see you – get a second opinion, maybe. I really value a good listener. It's important, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I understand your frustration. It’s important to feel heard, absolutely. And it sounds like you’ve been quite proactive in addressing this, which is good. Let’s go through some other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My appetite… it comes and goes, really. Some days I eat like a horse, other days I barely touch my food. And weight… well, I’ve probably put on a few pounds, if I'm being honest. Maybe five or ten. I used to be quite active, walking a lot, but… with the tiredness, it’s harder to get motivated. It's a bit of a vicious cycle, I suppose. I try to eat healthy, mostly Mediterranean, lots of fish and vegetables. But those extra pounds aren't helping, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let's see. I had my prostate enlarged a few years back, they treated it with medication, and that seems to be under control. High blood pressure too, but it's managed with a little pill each day. No diabetes, thankfully. Oh, and I had a bit of a bad fall last year, bruised a few ribs, but that healed up okay. Nothing major, really. I used to be very healthy, very active. That’s why this tiredness is so… unsettling. My wife keeps saying I need to slow down, but I don't want to slow down! I like being busy.
DOCTOR: Okay. And family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had heart trouble, ended up needing a bypass. My mother, she had arthritis, mostly. And my brother… he had sleep apnea too, actually. He used a CPAP for years, said it helped him a lot. That’s partly why I agreed to try it when the doctor suggested it. He said it changed his life. But like I said, it hasn’t really done much for me. Is that the kind of thing you’re looking for? Do you need to know about cousins and aunts and uncles, too? I can try to remember, but it gets a bit hazy after a while.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright for now. Parents and siblings is sufficient. Let's talk about any medications you're currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication. And any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Just the blood pressure pill – Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And… no allergies, as far as I know. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to garden a lot, handling all sorts of plants, and never had any trouble. I eat everything. My wife always jokes I have an iron stomach. She worries about me trying new foods, but I’m not afraid of a little spice! It's one of the joys of life, you know? Trying new things. But no, definitely no allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your throat. Just a routine check. It will give me a better picture of what might be going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’ve always believed in getting a good check-up. Can’t be too careful, you know? Especially at my age. Go ahead and do your thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll get started. Okay. Your heart sounds regular, but your breathing… it’s a little quieter on the left side than it should be. And your blood pressure is a bit elevated – 145/88. Not drastically, but something we should keep an eye on. I’m just going to take a look at your throat now. Your throat looks a little irritated, but nothing significant. Now, can you open your mouth and say “ah”?
PATIENT: Ahhhh… Is that alright? It’s a bit dry in here, actually. I haven’t had much to drink this morning, I suppose. I usually have a cup of coffee, but I skipped it today, thinking it might interfere with whatever you were doing. Was that a mistake? I always worry about doing things wrong when I come to the doctor.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. It’s good you skipped the coffee. It’s just a quick look. Your uvula is a little swollen, and the back of your throat is slightly red. It could be a minor irritation, but we’ll need to consider other possibilities. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, I suspect a few things could be contributing to your tiredness. It could be related to your sleep apnea not being fully controlled, a possible mild respiratory infection, or even just the effect of aging and a little bit of inflammation. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Order whatever tests you think are necessary. I want to get to the bottom of this, you know? This tiredness is really affecting my quality of life. I just want to feel like myself again. Whatever you recommend, I’m happy to do it. Tests are tests. Just let me know what’s involved, and I’ll schedule them. I’m a patient man. I've had a lot of patience practice in my 83 years!
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels, and a chest X-ray to take a look at your lungs. We'll also do a sleep study re-evaluation to make sure your CPAP settings are optimized. And I'm going to recommend you see an ENT specialist—an ear, nose, and throat doctor—to take a closer look at your throat and rule out any structural problems. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very thorough, Doctor. That’s exactly what I was hoping for. A comprehensive approach. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and consider everything. The sleep study re-evaluation is a good idea, I definitely want to rule that out. And seeing the ENT specialist… good thinking. It’s better to be safe than sorry, you know? I suppose it's a bit of a lot to do, but I trust your judgment. When would I be able to schedule these tests?
DOCTOR: Alright. The blood work and chest X-ray can be done at the lab just down the hall. They take walk-ins, so you can go whenever it's convenient for you. I’ll have the order ready for you. As for the sleep study, I’ll have my assistant schedule that for you. And I’ll write a referral for the ENT specialist, and she will call you to schedule an appointment. It should take about a week or so to get everything arranged. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding any strenuous activity. If you experience any fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please come to the emergency room immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, Doctor. Plenty of rest, stay hydrated, avoid strenuous activity… and watch out for fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain. I’ve got it. Thank you so much for your time and attention, Doctor Nooruddin. I feel much better already, just knowing we’re taking steps to figure things out. I really appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll review the results when they come back. If anything urgent arises, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Mr. Paske.
