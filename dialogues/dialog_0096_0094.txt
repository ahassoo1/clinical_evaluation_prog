DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. Welcome. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. The paper... the paper said something about learning? I don't really remember. My husband, he made the appointment. Something about... the doctor wanting to tell me things. I work with metal, you know? Very busy.
DOCTOR: Learning, yes. That was a… preventative health screening notice. It’s quite common, especially with certain occupations. Metal work, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, metal. Sheets. Big sheets. I cut them, bend them… make things. It’s hot work. And loud. Very loud. I wear… ear things, sometimes. Not always, though. Hard to hear the machines if you have too many things in your ears, you know? It’s important to know what the metal is doing.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you work with metal sheets, cutting and bending… potentially exposed to loud noises. And you don’t always wear hearing protection. We need to discuss that a bit later. But first, let’s focus on why you’re here today. Are you experiencing any specific health problems?
PATIENT: Health problems? Not really. I get tired, of course. Everyone gets tired. And my back… it aches sometimes. But that's from bending over the metal all day. It’s just… work. Is this about my back? Because I can just… take some pills. My husband has lots.
DOCTOR: Pills aren't always the answer, Ms. Fontanazza. We need to understand why your back is aching, not just mask the symptoms. And “tired” is very vague. Are we talking exhausted all the time, or just at the end of a long workday?
PATIENT: Exhausted… sometimes. Not every day. But… when I finish work, I just… sleep. A long sleep. And then I wake up and have to do it again. It’s… hard. My husband says I don’t rest enough. He says I push myself too much. But someone has to make the money, right? It’s not like he’s doing anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I don’t… I don’t know what you mean. I feel… normal. Maybe a little… hot sometimes. But it’s August, you know? Very hot weather. I drink lots of water.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's try this another way. Any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm… I eat. Yes. My husband cooks. He makes… noodles, mostly. And rice. Sometimes fish. I eat what he gives me. I don’t… not eat much less than usual, I think. Maybe not more either. It’s all… the same.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your weight?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh… I… I don’t really know. I haven’t… weighed myself lately. I think I’m… the same. Maybe a little bigger? It’s hard to say. My clothes… still fit. Mostly.
DOCTOR: The chart says you’re 136 pounds and 5 feet tall. That's… a bit higher than you should be, given your height. And you mentioned being tired, hot, and your husband has noted changes. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. It’ll help me get a better understanding of what's going on. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Physical exam? What… what kind of exam? I don’t… I don’t like doctors poking me. Is this going to take long? I have things to do. Metal doesn’t cut itself, you know.
DOCTOR: It's a basic exam, Ms. Fontanazza. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a quick look at your throat. It won't take long – perhaps ten minutes. It's important to rule out any underlying issues contributing to your fatigue and… other symptoms. And frankly, your weight is a concern. Please, just let me do a quick check. It’s for your own good.
PATIENT: Fine. But quick, okay? Very quick. And don’t poke too hard. My husband will be mad if I’m late. He’s… particular about dinner.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please sit back. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Your breathing sounds a little… congested. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Hmm. Slightly elevated. Your throat is a little red, but nothing alarming. Now, I'd like to feel your abdomen. Just relax, and let your stomach be loose. A little tender here on the right side… Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! A little. Not… bad pain, just… uncomfortable. It sometimes feels like… something is pushing. But it goes away. I thought it was just… the metal. All the bending and lifting, you know? It’s hard work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea? No. Not really. Sometimes… a little queasy after I eat too much noodles. My husband makes very rich noodles. But it passes quickly. Vomiting… no. Not for a long time. Not since… well, I don’t remember when. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Fontanazza, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, I’m concerned about a few things. Your weight, fatigue, slight congestion, and tenderness in your abdomen… they could be related to several issues. It’s possible you have a mild infection, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I want to order some blood tests and a urine analysis. And I’m also going to recommend an abdominal ultrasound to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in there. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ultrasound? That sounds… complicated. And expensive. My husband… he doesn’t like spending money. Can’t we just… take some pills? Like I said, I have lots of pills at home.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, simply masking symptoms with pills won’t address the underlying problem. We need to identify the problem first. And frankly, ignoring these symptoms could lead to serious complications down the line. The blood tests and ultrasound are necessary to get an accurate diagnosis. As for the cost… We can discuss payment options with the clinic’s financial department. I understand your concerns, but your health is the priority. I’m writing the orders now. They'll need a blood sample and a urine sample. The ultrasound will be scheduled at the imaging center across the street. It will take about 30 minutes.
PATIENT: Fine. But tell them to be quick, okay? I really need to get back to work. And… can you write down the instructions? My husband… he doesn’t listen very well.
DOCTOR: Here you are. This outlines the instructions for the blood tests and ultrasound. It also includes the contact information for the lab and imaging center. You'll need to fast for 12 hours before the blood tests – that means no food or drinks except water. And for the ultrasound, you'll need a full bladder, so drink plenty of water beforehand. I want to see you back here in one week to discuss the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: One week… yes. Fasting… no food. Water okay. Full bladder… drink lots of water. I think I understand. But… what if something is wrong? What if it's… bad? My husband will be very angry.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, it’s premature to worry about “bad” things. We haven’t even run the tests yet. And frankly, dwelling on worst-case scenarios won't help. We need to gather information first. If the tests reveal anything concerning, we will discuss it thoroughly and explore the appropriate treatment options. For now, focus on getting the tests done. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can determine what's going on and address it. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I… I think that’s all. Thank you… I guess. My husband will be expecting me. He doesn't like waiting for dinner. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let the clinic know if you have any difficulty scheduling the tests. .
