DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski, and I’m pleased to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's... it's been a bit of a bother, this feeling. I get sick to my stomach a lot, even if I haven't eaten much. And I just... don't feel hungry, you know? It's like I fill up after just a few bites. It's been going on for a little while now, and it's starting to worry me. I… I have that cancer, and I’m worried it’s related to that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Kelder, and it’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. It's certainly wise to investigate any new symptoms, especially given your history. You mentioned feeling nauseous and full quickly, even without eating much – and that it’s been going on for a little while. Could you tell me a bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… That’s a hard one. Everything’s a bit… fuzzy these days. Let me think… It wasn't right after the treatments, I don’t believe. Maybe… a couple of months ago? Perhaps three? It sort of crept up on me, it didn’t just happen one day. I remember feeling okay for a bit after everything, and then slowly… this started. It's hard to pinpoint, truly. I apologize. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. It’s very common for memory to be affected, and pinpointing exact dates isn’t crucial. “A couple of months ago” gives me a good starting point. And it’s good to know it wasn’t immediately after your treatments. Now, can you describe the nausea for me?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it’s not… violent, if that makes sense. It's not like I’m throwing up all the time. It's more of a queasy feeling. Like… a seasickness, maybe? But I haven’t been on a boat in years! It just kind of sits in my stomach and makes me not want to eat. Sometimes it happens before I even think about food. And it doesn't always go away. It comes and goes, but it's… persistent, you know? It’s just… uncomfortable. I’ve tried eating bland things, crackers and such, but it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it's a persistent queasiness, not necessarily vomiting, and it doesn't seem to be relieved by eating bland foods. It's good you've tried that. And it occurs even without thinking about food. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific things? That’s a good question. I don't think so, not really. I mean, sometimes strong smells bother me, like cleaning products. But it happens even if I avoid those. I… I don’t know. Maybe if I lie down for a while it feels a little better, but it always comes back. Honestly, Doctor, it's just… frustrating. I used to enjoy my meals so much, and now… it's just something I dread. I don’t want to lose any more weight, either. That’s a worry.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Ms. Kelder, and it’s good you’re bringing these concerns to me. Losing your appetite and enjoying meals is very important, and weight loss is definitely something we want to avoid. You mentioned that lying down offers some temporary relief, and strong smells can sometimes worsen it. Now, aside from the nausea and decreased appetite, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, goodness. Well, I’ve been… tired. More tired than usual, even for an old woman like me. And my stomach… it feels full really quickly, like I said, but sometimes it also feels… bloated. Kind of uncomfortable and gassy. Nothing painful, exactly, just… full. And… now that you mention it, I’ve been a little constipated lately. Is that… important? I’m sorry, I’m probably just rambling. It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Ms. Kelder, and every detail is important. So, to summarize: nausea, decreased appetite, feeling full quickly, bloating, increased gas, constipation, and increased fatigue. These symptoms can all be related, and it's good you're sharing them with me. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. You mentioned having cancer – could you tell me a little more about the type of cancer and the treatments you received?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, the cancer. It was… it was ovarian, I think. A few years ago now. They did surgery, and then… chemotherapy. A long time ago. It was… unpleasant, to say the least. I’ve been in remission for a while now, thankfully. The doctors said everything looked good at the last checkup, but… that was before all this started. I can’t remember all the details of the chemo, honestly. It was a blur. They gave me a lot of different drugs, and I was so sick. I just remember being tired all the time. I think… I think they stopped the chemo about two years ago now. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague. It's just… a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Kelder, thank you. Ovarian cancer in remission for about two years, treated with surgery and chemotherapy. It’s understandable you don’t remember all the specifics of the chemo; it’s a difficult experience. Now, have you had any other significant medical conditions or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Oh, I had my gallbladder removed years and years ago. That was… I don’t even remember when. Probably in my 50s? And… I’ve always had a bit of trouble with my arthritis. It’s mostly in my hands and knees. I take some medication for that, but it doesn't always help. Other than that… I don’t think so. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered, until… well, until the cancer. And now this. I apologize again for being so forgetful. It's just… frustrating for both of us, I’m sure. My daughter always says I should write things down, but I never do.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize, Ms. Kelder. It's perfectly alright. Gallbladder removal some years ago and arthritis – that gives me a good picture. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. For my arthritis, I take… naproxen, I believe. It’s a white pill. I take two of them every day. And sometimes, when my arthritis is really bad, I take Tylenol. Just as needed. And… I take a Vitamin D supplement. My doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. That’s about it, I think. I don't really take much else. I try to stay away from pills if I can. They never agree with me. Is that helpful? I hope I’m not forgetting anything important. My daughter manages most of my refills, so she’d probably know better than me.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Kelder. Naproxen and Vitamin D, with Tylenol as needed for arthritis. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. And I’ve tried a lot of different medications, too, mostly for my arthritis. Never had an allergic reaction. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. I don’t have any known allergies. Although… sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I use certain soaps, but that’s just a minor irritation. It’s not a true allergy, I don’t think. Is that helpful? I apologize again for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. No known drug or food allergies, just occasional skin irritation with certain soaps. That's good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Lifestyle… Well, I’m retired, so I don’t work anymore. I mostly stay at home. I enjoy gardening when the weather is nice, but I can’t do too much of that these days. My arthritis makes it hard. I live alone, unfortunately. My husband passed away a few years ago. I have a daughter who lives nearby, and she visits me often. She’s a good girl. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I try to eat healthy, but it’s hard when I don’t feel like eating. I mostly watch television and read books. It’s a pretty quiet life, honestly. Not much excitement. Is that helpful? I apologize again for being so vague. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Kelder, and gives me a good understanding of your situation. So, retired, living alone, daughter nearby, non-smoker, minimal alcohol consumption, enjoys gardening and reading. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I'd like to briefly review your symptoms one more time to ensure I haven't missed anything. You've been experiencing nausea, decreased appetite, early satiety, bloating, constipation, and increased fatigue for approximately two to three months. You've tried bland foods and lying down, with limited relief. You've also mentioned a history of ovarian cancer in remission, arthritis, and gallbladder removal. Does that accurately summarize your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… that sounds right. You’ve got it all. The nausea, not feeling hungry, filling up too quickly, the tiredness, everything. It’s just… frustrating. And I worry it’s something to do with the cancer. It’s always in the back of my mind. But you’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate that. Thank you for listening to me. It’s nice to finally talk to someone about it. I just want to feel better, you know? Is a physical exam going to help? What are you looking for? I apologize again for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You're not vague at all, Ms. Kelder. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious, especially with a history of cancer. A physical exam will help me assess your overall health and look for any physical signs that might be contributing to your symptoms. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen to check for tenderness or masses, and check your reflexes. It’s a standard part of the evaluation process. I’ll also check your weight and blood pressure. Would you be comfortable if we proceed with the exam now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If it will help, then yes, please. I trust your judgment. I'll do whatever you think is best. Just… be gentle, if you would. My arthritis makes things a little… tender. And… let me know if you find anything concerning. I'd rather know, you know? It’s better to be prepared. I apologize again for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kelder. I will be as gentle as possible. Please let me know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. Now, if you could please lie down on the examination table, we can begin. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here I am. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. It’s… a little cold in here, isn’t it? But that’s alright. I apologize again for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. It is a bit cool in here, I’ll adjust the temperature. Now, take some slow, deep breaths for me, please. Your breathing sounds clear, although a little shallow. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Deep breaths… Oh… that’s a little tender there, on the… left side, I think. But it’s alright. It’s just… my stomach hasn’t been feeling very good lately. But it’s not… painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. I apologize again for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. Tenderness on the left side, but not acutely painful. I’m not feeling any obvious masses at this time, but your abdomen is slightly distended. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This will just involve a gentle tap on your knees and ankles. Please let me know if that’s uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Go ahead. It’s… a little strange, but not… painful. My knees sometimes ache, but it's just the arthritis. It's nothing to worry about. I apologize again for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. That's all for the physical exam. Everything appears within normal limits, although you are slightly distended and your reflexes are diminished, which is common with age and arthritis. I also noted the tenderness on your left side. Now, based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying causes for your nausea, fatigue, and abdominal discomfort. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We will also check your Vitamin D levels.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Blood work… that sounds sensible. If it will help find out what’s wrong, then yes, please. I trust your judgment. I hope it’s nothing serious. What kind of things are you looking for in the blood work? Is it the cancer again? I hope not. I apologize again for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be anxious, Ms. Kelder. We're just being thorough. The blood work will help us rule out several possibilities, including anemia, electrolyte imbalances, thyroid problems, and Vitamin D deficiency. It will not specifically test for cancer recurrence at this time, but if anything concerning is found, we can certainly discuss further testing then. We’re looking for common causes of your symptoms first. I'll also order a stool test to check for any signs of infection or inflammation in your digestive system. This will just require a small sample that you can collect at home. I'll give you instructions on how to do that before you leave.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. So, blood work and a… stool test. It’s… a little embarrassing, but if it will help, then yes, I’ll do it. I trust your judgment. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel better, knowing what to expect. I just want to feel better, you know? It’s hard to enjoy life when you’re constantly feeling sick. I apologize again for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Kelder. It's perfectly normal to feel embarrassed, but these tests are routine and will help us get to the bottom of this. We’ll get you feeling better as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat small, frequent meals, even if you don’t feel hungry. Avoid greasy or spicy foods, and stay well-hydrated. If your nausea becomes severe, you can try over-the-counter anti-nausea medication, such as dimenhydrinate, but check with me if you’re taking any other medications first. We will review the results of the blood work and stool test when they come back, and discuss the next steps then. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Small meals, avoid greasy foods, stay hydrated… I can try that. And the anti-nausea medication… I’ll have to check with my daughter, she manages my pills. Um… yes, I do have a question. Will these tests take long? And… what if they find something serious? I worry about the cancer coming back, you know? I apologize again for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ms. Kelder. The blood work usually takes about 24 to 48 hours to come back, and the stool test may take a few days longer. We'll contact you as soon as we have the results. As for what if we find something serious, we will discuss all of your options thoroughly. If it is related to the cancer, we have many treatments available, and we will work together to create a plan that is best for you. It’s important to remember that we are taking things one step at a time, and we won’t know anything for sure until we have the results. My priority is to get you feeling better, and we’ll do everything we can to make that happen. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. One step at a time… that sounds sensible. I appreciate you being so thorough and patient with me. I’m just… worried, you know? It’s hard to think straight when you’re constantly feeling sick. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening to me and for taking the time to help. I apologize again for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It was my pleasure. And please, don’t apologize for being vague. It’s perfectly alright. I'm glad I could help. I'll have my nurse give you the instructions for the stool test and the lab requisition for the blood work. If you have any questions or concerns after you leave, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Now, let’s get you scheduled for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Next week sounds good. Whenever is convenient for you. I trust your judgment. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And… I apologize again for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I think that’s all for now. I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. Take your time. And don’t worry about apologizing, it’s no trouble at all. I’ll see you next week. Have a good day, and please call if anything comes up before then. .
