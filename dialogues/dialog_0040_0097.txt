DOCTOR: Right. Marija, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Marija Chilla. I have an appointment to discuss… well, preparing for the inevitable, I suppose. My husband suggested I look into these forms. He worries, you see. Though frankly, I find it a bit… morbid to be planning such things at my age. But here I am.
DOCTOR: "Inevitability," you say?
PATIENT: Precisely. One reads the papers, doesn’t one? And one has…observed life. It’s simply prudent to have one’s affairs in order. Though I must confess, I haven't the faintest idea which forms are required, or what they even do. My husband mentioned something about… a POLST? Is that the correct terminology? He does tend to use these… medical abbreviations. It's quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: A POLST… yes. People and their… anticipatory anxieties. Look, are you experiencing any current health concerns that prompted this sudden… organizational urge?
PATIENT: No, no current concerns at all. Perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I exercise regularly, I maintain a balanced diet… well, mostly balanced. It's simply… foresight. My husband, he’s a bit… dramatic. He worries about everything. He read an article online, I believe, about the importance of these documents. I’m merely indulging him to maintain peace in the household. Honestly, I find the whole exercise rather unsettling. It feels… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no complaints, no symptoms, just… husband-induced paperwork. Have you had a recent physical?
PATIENT: A physical… let me see. It was… last year, I believe. Dr. Abernathy, downtown. A perfectly standard check-up. Everything was… satisfactory. Though he did suggest I watch my sodium intake. Honestly, I find these doctors are always finding something to criticize. But yes, a recent physical. Perfectly healthy, as I said. Is this relevant? I thought we were discussing these… advance directives? Are those the same as a POLST? They sound dreadfully similar.
DOCTOR: Dr. Abernathy... right. Well, it's always relevant to know your baseline. And no, a POLST and advance directives are not precisely the same thing. Advance directives are the broad umbrella, the POLST is a specific medical order. Let’s just establish a quick history. Any major illnesses, surgeries, or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? My childhood illnesses, of course. Measles, mumps… the usual things. Nothing serious. As for surgeries… I had my tonsils removed when I was quite young, and a rather unpleasant appendectomy in my twenties. Nothing since, thankfully. As for hospital stays… a brief stay for observation after a particularly nasty bout of food poisoning in Morocco, many years ago. Really, it was nothing significant. And I assure you, I maintain excellent hygiene now. I’m not prone to illness. Is this all necessary? I’m starting to feel quite… interrogated.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mrs. Chilla. Family history?
PATIENT: Family history… a rather complicated affair, actually. My mother lived to a ripe old age, thankfully. Ninety-two, I believe. She suffered from… arthritis, towards the end. My father… he passed away rather suddenly from a heart condition. A shock, really. He was a very active man. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Though he lives in Casablanca, and we don't speak frequently. Frankly, a rather unremarkable family history. No predisposition to any serious illnesses, as far as I am aware. Are we getting anywhere with these forms, or are we simply cataloging my ancestors? It feels rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, occasionally. For… preventative measures, you see. My husband insists. He reads all sorts of articles about cardiovascular health. Really, it's more for his peace of mind than my own. Otherwise, no. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. A good cup of mint tea is far more effective than any pharmaceutical, in my opinion. Do I need to list the precise dosage? It's quite a trivial amount. And honestly, I fail to see its relevance to these… advance directives. I thought we were discussing end-of-life care, not my daily aspirin intake.
DOCTOR: It’s relevant, Mrs. Chilla, because medications can interact. Allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me see. Dust, of course. And… certain pollens. Nothing serious. I simply avoid them whenever possible. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. Though I rarely take them, as I mentioned. And I am quite careful about what I ingest. Now, are we finally getting to the point of this appointment? I find this preliminary questioning rather… tedious. Honestly, my husband is going to hear about this. He promised a simple form-filling exercise, not a full medical history.
DOCTOR: Fine. So, healthy, no allergies, low-dose aspirin. Let’s get this over with. You want to complete a POLST form. It’s a medical order specifying your wishes for life-sustaining treatment if you are unable to speak for yourself. Do you understand that?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, I believe I understand. A document outlining my preferences… in the event of incapacitation. My husband explained it, albeit in rather alarming detail. Though I must confess, I find the very concept… distressing. To contemplate such scenarios… it’s rather morbid. But yes, I understand. So, where do we begin? What sort of preferences are we outlining? And will this require a lengthy questionnaire? Because frankly, I have another appointment this afternoon. And I’d prefer to conclude this exercise as expeditiously as possible.
DOCTOR: These are the options. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition, hydration... we’ll go through each one. I’ll explain what each entails, and you tell me your wishes. It's a rather straightforward process, really, if you just focus. Do you have any initial preferences you want to state now?
PATIENT: Honestly? I simply want to be made comfortable. If it comes to that. No heroic measures, thank you very much. I’ve lived a full life. I don’t wish to be… prolonged artificially. No tubes, no machines. Just… peace and quiet. Is that an option? I refuse to be a burden on anyone. That is my initial preference, if that clarifies anything. And I would appreciate a concise explanation of each option, without the… medical jargon. I am not a physician, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. No CPR, no ventilation, no artificial nutrition. We'll document that. Do you have a designated healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy? My husband, of course. He is perfectly capable of making decisions on my behalf. Though he does tend to… overthink things. Still, he is a sensible man, generally. He’s quite insistent on these matters, actually. He already has the paperwork prepared, I believe. He's rather organized, for all his… anxieties. Is that sufficient? Do I need to provide his medical information as well? Honestly, this is becoming rather… bureaucratic.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need his name, date of birth, and contact information. Then we'll review the form together, just to confirm everything is documented correctly. Do you have that information readily available?
PATIENT: Yes, fortunately. He anticipated this, you see. Here you are. Omar Chilla. Date of birth… July 12th, 1978. And his number is listed there. He’s rather meticulous about his details, as I’ve mentioned. Now, can we finally conclude this exercise? I have a luncheon appointment I must attend. And frankly, this conversation is proving rather… draining.
DOCTOR: Right. Omar Chilla, July 12th, 1978… Okay, I’ve entered the information. Now, just a quick physical exam to document your current condition. Blood pressure, pulse, respiration… standard stuff. It’s just for the record. Do I have your permission to proceed?
PATIENT: Fine. Proceed. But please be quick. And gentle. I have a rather low tolerance for… medical intrusions. Honestly, I fail to see the necessity of this, given that I’ve already established my excellent health. But if it’s absolutely required… proceed. Just don't linger.
DOCTOR: 130 over 80. Normal. 72 and regular. Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Respiration unlabored. Overall, appears in good health for age. Do you have any other concerns before we finalize the POLST?
PATIENT: No. No further concerns. As I’ve repeatedly stated, I am perfectly healthy. And frankly, this entire exercise has been rather… unsettling. So, if you’re quite finished, I would appreciate it if we could finalize this document and be done with it. I have a luncheon appointment I must attend. And I’m beginning to lose my appetite.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've documented your wishes: No CPR, no ventilation, no artificial nutrition. Healthcare proxy: Omar Chilla. Current condition: Appears in good health. Here's a copy of the completed POLST for your records. Make sure Omar has a copy as well. Do you understand that this document can be reviewed and revised at any time?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. It’s all rather straightforward, isn’t it? I trust my husband will ensure it’s properly filed. Honestly, I’m relieved it’s finally over. I sincerely hope I won't need it. Thank you for your… assistance. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a luncheon appointment to attend. Good day.
