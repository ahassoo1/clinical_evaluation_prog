DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… just some lab work, I think? That’s what the lady on the phone said, anyway. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I just want to get it done and be on my way, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist, no problem at all. The scheduler did note a routine check-up with some blood work ordered by your primary care physician. Let's just confirm a few things to make sure we're on the same page. Do you know why your doctor ordered the blood work, or what they were looking for?
PATIENT: Looking for…? Honestly, no. I see Doctor… ah, what’s his name… Miller, I think. Nice man. But he just says things and I nod. I don’t really… recall specifics. It's probably just the usual old age stuff, I suppose. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It can be helpful to know, Mr. Croonquist, but not essential right now. We'll get the results and I can certainly explain them to you. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history. I see here you’ve been a patient of Dr. Miller’s for some time. Do you have any major medical problems—like diabetes, heart trouble, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Heart… no, not that I know of. I used to work at the power plant, you know. Lots of walking, keeping everything running. Kept me pretty fit, I think. Diabetes… maybe? My mother had something, but I don’t remember what. Honestly, Doctor, it's all a bit hazy. I just want these tests, please. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Croonquist. We can certainly do the tests. It just helps me understand your overall health picture when I'm interpreting the results. Okay. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any pills, creams, or anything else regularly?
PATIENT: Pills… Let me think. I take something for my… joints, I think. They ache, you know? Old age again. Little blue pill. And… maybe something for my blood pressure? Doctor Miller gave it to me, but I don’t really pay attention to names. I just take what he gives me. It's all a bit much to keep track of, frankly. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, a blue pill for your joints and something for blood pressure. That's helpful. Do you know the dosage of either medication?
PATIENT: Dosage…? Now you’re losing me, Doctor. I just take one of each, every morning. The bottles… they’re at home. I don’t memorize numbers like I used to. It's a bit embarrassing, really. I used to be a very sharp man, you know, working with all those machines at the plant. Now… well. Can we just get this over with? I have some errands to run.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist, no problem. We’ll proceed with the blood work. I understand your frustration. Just to be thorough, have you had any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No, not that I recall. I eat pretty much anything. Used to get a good curry every Friday, back in the city. Never had a problem. Latex… is that in gloves? The nurse used gloves when she took my blood pressure. Didn’t bother me. I think I'm pretty tough, to be honest. Just get it done, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Croonquist. Let’s do a quick physical exam first, just to get a baseline. It won't take long. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure again. Then we’ll do the blood work. Please have a seat here.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let's just get it over with. Hurry up, would you? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale. Good. Your heart sounds… a bit irregular. A little fast, but not alarming. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90. A bit elevated, but not unexpected given your report and the history. Let's get those labs drawn now. The phlebotomist will be right with you. Irregular heart rhythm noted, BP 140/90. Continue with labs. Consider EKG.
PATIENT: EKG…? Oh, for heaven's sake. Just… please, let’s just get the blood work done. I’m getting tired of all this poking and prodding. Is it much more? I really need to be going. I have appointments, you know. Important ones. Can’t remember what they are, but they’re important. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. I understand. I'm going to ask the nurse to draw a few extra vials of blood just to be thorough, given the slightly irregular heartbeat and elevated blood pressure. It will take a few more minutes, but it will give us a better picture of your overall health. It's best to be safe. The phlebotomist is ready for you. Please follow her. We'll have the results back as soon as possible.
