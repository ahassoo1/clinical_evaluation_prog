DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. And I have… a funny heartbeat sometimes. The doctors said it was atrial fibrillation, a while back. But this leg is new, or worse than usual, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, that gives me a good starting point. So, you’ve experienced atrial fibrillation in the past, and now you’re noticing significant swelling in your left leg. When did you first notice the leg swelling, and has it been getting progressively worse since then?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? It was just a little bit at first, I thought it was just from walking too much. But it has gotten worse. Yesterday it was really bothering me, and this morning it’s… well, you can see. It feels tight, too. Not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see some swelling. And you mentioned it feels tight. Is the swelling localized to your calf, or does it extend up towards your thigh or down towards your foot?
PATIENT: Mostly in my calf, I think. It's hard to tell exactly. It feels a bit puffy around my ankle too, but the main part of it is definitely in my calf. It doesn’t really go up into my thigh, not that I’ve noticed, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this swelling been associated with any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No, not really. I’ve been a bit tired, but I always am a bit tired. And my heart does sometimes feel like it’s fluttering, but that's just the… the fibrillation, I suppose. No pain, no redness, no warmth in the leg. Just the swelling and the tightness.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that’s alright with you. Have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Well, as you know about the atrial fibrillation. And… I had the flu a couple of years ago, quite bad it was. Oh, and I broke my wrist when I was little, but that’s hardly relevant now, is it? Nothing else, I don’t think. I haven’t been to the doctor much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. The atrial fibrillation is relevant, and good to know about the flu. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past, even the wrist fracture?
PATIENT: Just the wrist, when I was a child. It was a simple break, they put it in a cast and that was that. No other surgeries or… being in hospital, no. I'm generally a very healthy person, Doctor. It’s just this leg… and the heart, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather… he had something with his heart, but I don’t know what exactly. It was a long time ago, and no one talked about it much. No one else that I know of had any serious health problems. It’s not something we really discussed, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and certainly no. I don't smoke, I rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions – and I’ve never taken any recreational drugs. I am a teacher, you see. I need to be… sensible.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nixon. And what about your activity level?
PATIENT: Well, I walk quite a bit. I walk to work most days, and I enjoy a good walk in the park when I have the time. It’s not strenuous, but I try to keep active. Being on my feet all day teaching probably counts for something too, doesn’t it? But I haven’t been doing much walking the last couple of days, with this leg being sore.
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely counts! Now, last few questions about medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't take any regular medication at all. Not even vitamins, I'm afraid. I should probably take something for the heart, but the doctors haven't told me to. Nothing at all, no. And no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything and everything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. Thank you for that information, that’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature – and then I'd like to examine your leg more closely. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs as well. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to. I trust your judgement. And thank you for being so thorough. It puts my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130/80, your heart rate is 78 and irregular, as you know, and your temperature is normal at 98.6°F. Now, let’s take a look at your leg. I'm noting moderate pitting edema in your left calf, extending down to the ankle. The skin is warm to the touch and there is no redness or tenderness on palpation. Your pulses are present, but slightly diminished in your left foot compared to your right. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your lungs are clear. Your heart rate is irregular, and I’m detecting a murmur, which I’ll note. Based on what you've told me and the findings of the physical exam, the swelling in your leg is likely related to your atrial fibrillation. The irregular heartbeat can cause blood to pool in the legs, leading to edema. However, we need to rule out other potential causes, such as deep vein thrombosis, or DVT.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That all sounds… complicated. A DVT? Is that serious, Doctor? And is there anything we can do about the atrial fibrillation? It’s just… it feels so worrying. This leg swelling is making it hard to walk, and the fluttering heart… it’s frightening. What sort of tests will I need?
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Nixon, and it’s good that you’re asking questions. A DVT, or deep vein thrombosis, is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg. It can be serious, as the clot can travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism, which is a medical emergency. That’s why we need to rule it out. Regarding your atrial fibrillation, yes, there are several things we can do to manage it. Medications, such as blood thinners, can help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of stroke. We can also explore options to control your heart rate, such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers. To investigate further, I'd like to order a few tests. First, a D-dimer blood test, which can help rule out DVT. If the D-dimer is elevated, we’ll need to perform an ultrasound of your left leg to look for a clot. We'll also do an EKG to assess the rhythm of your heart and see how the atrial fibrillation is affecting it. Finally, I'd like to check your kidney function with a basic metabolic panel to make sure you’re a good candidate for blood thinners if they’re needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and an ultrasound, I can manage that. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. A pulmonary embolism sounds very frightening indeed. Beta-blockers… would those make me feel tired? I already feel quite tired, as you know. And what if the D-dimer is high? What happens then? I suppose I should ask all these questions now, while I have the chance. I don’t want to be caught off guard.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask all your questions now, Nixon. It’s important to be well-informed. Beta-blockers can cause fatigue as a side effect, but not everyone experiences it. We would start with a low dose and monitor your response carefully. If you do experience significant fatigue, we can adjust the dose or explore alternative medications. If the D-dimer is elevated, it means there's a higher probability of a blood clot. In that case, we would proceed with the ultrasound to visualize the veins in your leg and confirm whether a clot is present. If a clot is found, you would likely need to be started on blood thinners immediately. Depending on the size and location of the clot, you might also require compression stockings or, in some cases, a more intensive treatment plan. I want to reassure you that we're taking this seriously and we're going to do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. We'll discuss the results of the tests as soon as they're available and develop a treatment plan that's tailored to your specific needs. Does that sound reassuring?
PATIENT: Yes, that does sound… much more reassuring, thank you, Doctor. Knowing what to expect is half the battle, I suppose. And you've explained everything so patiently. So, blood tests, then an ultrasound if needed. And the results will determine what happens next. I think I can manage that. When will I be able to get the blood tests done? And is there anything I should do in the meantime? Should I stay off my leg? Elevate it? I always read things online, and everything says something different. It just gets confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand your confusion—the internet can be overwhelming. For now, I recommend elevating your left leg as much as possible when you’re resting, and avoiding prolonged standing or sitting. Gentle ankle pumps can also help promote circulation. I don’t want you to put complete weight on it, but a little bit of walking is okay, as long as it doesn’t worsen your symptoms. The lab is just down the hall, and I’ll write you a requisition now. They should be able to draw the blood samples right away, and the results should be back within a few hours. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or increased swelling or pain in your leg, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Chest pain, shortness of breath, worsening swelling… I'll remember that. Thank you for writing the requisition. I’ll go to the lab now and get that done. You've been very kind and thorough, Doctor. I feel much better about things, even though I still worry, of course. It's just… it's frightening when your body isn't working properly. I suppose I’ll see you again when the results are back. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if you have any concerns at all, don't hesitate to call the office. And please, don’t worry too much—we’ll figure this out together. I'll be in touch soon. Take care, and have a good day. .
