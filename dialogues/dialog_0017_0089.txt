DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, really. Lower part. It’s been hurting quite badly, on and off. I… I believe that’s why I’m here. It’s difficult to recall precisely when it started, to be honest. I do have… some other health concerns, too, if that’s relevant? Something about my immune system, I think. It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: "Hazy," you say. Right. We'll attempt to clarify. "On and off" is not a diagnosis, Ms. Glymph. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I apologize. It’s… a cramping, mostly. A deep ache. And sometimes, it feels like… twisting? It’s hard to explain. It comes in waves, I suppose. Not constant, thankfully. But when it is there, it’s quite noticeable. And… it seems to be getting more frequent, perhaps? I don't recall it being this bothersome before. Though, as I said, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Frequency is marginally more useful than “on and off.” Do you experience any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation alongside this “cramping”?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… No vomiting, thankfully. No diarrhea, either. Constipation… yes, actually. That’s been a bit of a problem lately. Not severe, but… noticeable. As for nausea… sometimes, a little queasy, perhaps. But I wouldn’t say full-blown nausea, no. More of a general feeling of… unwellness, alongside the pain. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Unwellness” is exceptionally vague, Ms. Glymph. And constipation… for how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You’re right to press me. I do apologize for being so… imprecise. The constipation… perhaps the last week or so? Maybe a little longer. It’s not every day, but… several times over the past week, certainly. And it’s… not easy, if you understand. I have been drinking plenty of water, though. I always try to stay hydrated. It’s just… things aren’t moving as they should, I suppose. It feels different than usual.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is there anything that seems to trigger this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Not that I’ve noticed, specifically. It doesn’t seem to be related to anything I eat, or any particular activity. It just… comes and goes. I suppose… stress might be a factor? I’ve been a little preoccupied lately with… well, with things. Nothing major, just… life. And perhaps when I’ve been sitting for too long? But I honestly can’t pinpoint anything concrete, Doctor. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, with all due respect, a vague recollection of “things” and “stress” is not conducive to a diagnosis. Let's move on. Do you have any past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me see… I believe I have something called… Systemic Lupus Erythematosus? SLE, I think the doctors call it. It was diagnosed… oh, goodness, quite some time ago now. Years and years. I’m under the care of a rheumatologist for that. And… I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia a few years back, but that’s fully recovered, I believe. Other than that… honestly, my memory is so poor, I’m afraid I can’t recall anything specific. I do take medication, of course, for the lupus, but I don’t know the names of everything offhand. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: “Not helpful” is a charitable assessment, Ms. Glymph. SLE is… significant. And you say you’re currently under the care of a rheumatologist?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely. Dr. Anya Sharma. She's… very good, very thorough. I see her every six months or so. I was supposed to have an appointment last month, but I… I seem to have misplaced the appointment card. And then things got busy, and I haven’t rescheduled yet. It’s terribly irresponsible of me, I know. But I’m generally quite stable, you see. That’s why I haven’t been overly concerned about getting it rescheduled immediately. I just… take my medication and try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's examine you. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with abdominal palpation. Try to relax. And please, Ms. Glymph, try to be more precise when I ask you questions. It saves both our time.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. I will certainly try my best. It’s just… sometimes the details escape me. Please, do let me know if you need me to do anything. I'm ready whenever you are. And I will endeavour to be more… specific. As you say, it saves time.
DOCTOR: I'm noting some tenderness in the lower left quadrant. No guarding, no rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are present, but somewhat diminished. No palpable masses. Do you feel any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. A little discomfort there, yes. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. It’s… similar to the pain I’ve been experiencing. Not worse, exactly, but… definitely present. And… yes, there’s a little… pressure, a little fullness. It’s not excruciating, Doctor, but it's not comfortable either. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: “Concerning” is premature. I’m also noting a slight distension. Now, Ms. Glymph, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. Let me think… I don't believe so. No, I don't have any known allergies to medications. I've taken quite a few over the years, with the lupus, and I haven’t had any adverse reactions that I recall. Perhaps a slight drowsiness with some of the stronger pain relievers, but nothing serious. Is that useful, Doctor? I always make sure to tell my rheumatologist about any new medications I’m taking, too, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history of SLE, the abdominal tenderness, distension, constipation, and the fact that you haven’t seen your rheumatologist recently… We need to consider a flare. However, we must rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. We'll also need to perform a stool test to rule out infection. This is standard procedure, Ms. Glymph. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely, Doctor. That all sounds… sensible, yes. A flare… that’s what you suspect? It’s been so long since I’ve had a significant one, I’m afraid my recollection is… foggy. Blood tests and a stool test… I understand. Standard procedure, you say? Very good. That’s reassuring. I trust your judgment, Doctor. And I will endeavour to schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma as soon as possible. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime?
DOCTOR: "Endeavouring" will not suffice, Ms. Glymph. Schedule the appointment. In the meantime, continue to drink plenty of fluids and maintain a bland diet. Avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience fever, worsening pain, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. The emergency room… yes, I understand. Fever, worsening pain, nausea, vomiting, blood in the stool. I will be vigilant. And… about the bland diet? What exactly does that entail? I generally try to eat a healthy diet, but I'm not sure what constitutes “bland.” And… is there anything I should be avoiding specifically? I do enjoy a little spice now and again… and I'm rather fond of citrus fruits. Would those be problematic?
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, a “bland” diet consists of foods that are easy to digest and unlikely to irritate your digestive system. Think toast, rice, bananas, applesauce. Avoid anything spicy, fatty, fried, or highly acidic – including citrus fruits. And limit dairy. This is not a complex medical request. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh! Toast, rice, bananas, applesauce… yes, yes, of course. That makes perfect sense. And no spice, no fried foods, no citrus fruits, limited dairy. I understand now, Doctor. My apologies for being so… obtuse. I seem to be having a bit of difficulty focusing today. I will follow those guidelines to the letter. Thank you for clarifying. Is there anything else you think I should know? Perhaps a list of symptoms to watch out for, besides those you’ve already mentioned? I like to be prepared, you see.
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, I've provided you with a reasonable list of instructions. Further elaboration is unlikely to be productive. The laboratory results will guide our next steps. I’ll have the nurse contact you when they are available. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Please, schedule that appointment with your rheumatologist. And try to adhere to the dietary recommendations. .
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. I understand. Laboratory results, appointment with Dr. Sharma, dietary recommendations. I will do my best. Thank you for your time and your… patience. And… have a good day, Doctor Blim.
