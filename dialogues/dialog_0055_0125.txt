DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Belan. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Eaddy. Thanks. I, uh... I wanted to get tested for, well, the HIV thing. Just want to be sure, you know? It's better to be safe than sorry, even if I know I'm careful. My wife thought it was a good idea, actually.
DOCTOR: Very well. A sensible precaution, I suppose, although I find patients of your demographic are often… unnecessarily anxious. Still, we shall proceed. You mentioned your wife suggested this testing. Before we delve into specifics, could you briefly describe what “careful” entails for you and your wife?
PATIENT: Look, I don't appreciate being talked down to. "Careful" means… we only sleep with each other. Been married for eight years. And before you ask, yes, we were both… you know… tested before we got married. I just want a check-up. Is that alright? I don't need a lecture on responsible behaviour.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Belan. I assure you, I wasn't intending a lecture. Simply gathering information is standard procedure. Eight years of marital exclusivity is… reassuring. However, even with a history of monogamy, periodic screening is not unreasonable. To clarify, have there been any instances—and I use that term loosely—where the exclusivity has been… compromised?
PATIENT: Compromised? Are you serious? No! Absolutely not. Look, I told you, we've been together eight years. I'm a compliant officer, for goodness sake, I understand rules and following them. It’s a basic principle. I’m getting this done to put my wife’s mind at ease, not because I’ve been gallivanting around. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. I understand your frustration. Let us move on, then. Have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: No, never. Not once. I'm perfectly healthy, thank you very much. Always have been. I eat well, I exercise… I don't even get colds that often. My wife says I’m too stubborn to be sick. Why are you asking about blood transfusions, anyway? Is that a common way to get… it?
DOCTOR: It was a method of transmission prior to the implementation of rigorous screening protocols. It is simply part of a comprehensive medical history, Mr. Belan. Now, have you ever shared needles for any reason?
PATIENT: Needles? Are you implying… Look, I work in compliance, I wouldn’t dream of… No! Absolutely not. What kind of question is that? I don't do… any of that. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit insulted. I came here for a simple test, not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem… direct, Mr. Belan. It is my professional duty to explore all potential avenues of risk, however improbable they may seem. It is simply a matter of thoroughness. Now, let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections, besides what you've already disclosed?
PATIENT: Look, I already told you, we both got tested before we got married. Everything was clear. And we haven't… Look, this is getting beyond a joke. I'm a married man, I have a good job, and I'm perfectly healthy! I don't appreciate being treated like… I don't know… like I'm some sort of reckless individual. I just want the test, can we please just get it done? I've wasted enough time here answering ridiculous questions.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. If you insist. We shall proceed with the HIV testing. However, I must reiterate, a comprehensive medical history is vital. Your… defensiveness is noted. Now, to begin, may I take your vital signs?
PATIENT: Yes, finally. Please do. Just get it over with. Honestly, this whole process has been… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Nurse Anya, if you would assist Mr. Belan with his vitals. While Nurse Anya takes your blood pressure and temperature, I will examine you briefly. Please lie back on the examination table. And do try to relax, Mr. Belan. It will make the process considerably smoother.
PATIENT: Relax? Easy for you to say.
