DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me. I just want to figure out what's causing it, if you can help. I don't like feeling… off.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Uzarski. Tingling in the hands and feet can be caused by a number of things, and we’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on with you. To start, can you tell me a little more about this tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it's not constant, you know? It comes and goes. Sometimes it feels like pins and needles, other times just… numb. It's worse in the evenings, I think. And it seems to be both feet and both hands, but maybe a little worse on my right side. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Uzarski. It's helpful that you're noticing it comes and goes, and that it's worse in the evenings and potentially more pronounced on your right side. Now, when did you first start noticing this tingling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Around February, I guess. It was very mild at first, I barely noticed it. I thought it was just from working too hard at the post office, you know? Standing all day. But it hasn’t gone away, and it's gotten a bit more frequent, so I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, starting around February. And you initially attributed it to standing at work. That's good information. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it or make it worse besides standing and the time of day?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I did have a fall last spring. Nothing major, thankfully. Just tripped over a garden hose while I was bringing in the mail. I bruised my hip pretty bad, but I didn't think much of it at the time. Could that have something to do with it? It was on my right side, the same side that's bothering me now.
DOCTOR: That’s very important information, Ms. Uzarski. A fall, even a minor one, can sometimes cause nerve irritation. The fact that it was on your right side, the same side experiencing more tingling, is definitely something we need to consider. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions about your health. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms alongside this tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No weakness, no pain exactly, just the tingling. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just from getting older. I haven’t noticed anything else… Oh! Wait. My balance hasn’t been the best lately. I almost stumbled a couple of times, but I didn't think too much of it. Could that be related?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no weakness or pain, but some fatigue and recently some balance issues. Those could certainly be related, Ms. Uzarski. It’s good you’re mentioning these things. To get a better understanding of the situation, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. Other than that, nothing major. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. My husband… well, he had diabetes, but I don’t. I get checked regularly at the doctor for everything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of controlled hypertension, but no diabetes, and you generally stay on top of your regular check-ups. That’s good to know. Are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And… oh, sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but that’s it. Not every day, just when I really need it. Nothing else. I don't like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, most medicines, anyway. I haven't had any problems in that department. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Uzarski. Alright, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother had arthritis, bad in her hands. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. My husband's side… his mother had diabetes, like I said, and his father had something with his nerves, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details. It wasn’t good, that much I know. It made him very weak towards the end. Is that helpful? I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Uzarski. A history of arthritis, heart problems, diabetes, and a nerve condition in the family are all good things to know. Now, to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone now, since my husband passed. I still work at the post office, three days a week. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and soup. I don't drink or smoke. I used to garden a lot, but it's been harder since the fall. I like to read, and visit my grandkids when I can. I try to stay busy, you know? I don't sit around much. I don’t get a lot of exercise, but I’m on my feet all day at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you live alone, work part-time at the post office, generally eat a healthy diet, don't drink or smoke, and stay active with work and visiting your grandkids. Alright, Ms. Uzarski, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical exam to assess your condition further. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. I’m ready when you are. I hope it doesn’t take too long, though. I have to get home and make dinner for my grandkids tomorrow. They're coming over.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Uzarski. We’ll take it one step at a time. It shouldn’t take too long. First, I'm going to check your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. We’ll also check your balance. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that's not uncommon. Pulse and temperature are normal. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, that's good to hear about the reflexes. Is that enough? I try to squeeze pretty hard. I used to be very strong, but I haven’t been doing much lifting lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. Slightly diminished, but still adequate. Now, can you push your hands against mine as I resist?
PATIENT: Like this? I'm trying my best. It feels a little weak, maybe. Does that make sense? I feel like I could push harder, but it's not as strong as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. I'm noting some mild weakness bilaterally. Now, let's check the sensation in your hands and feet. I'm going to lightly touch your hands and feet with this cotton ball. Please tell me when you feel it. Can you tell me when you feel the touch?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that… and that… and… oh, that one feels a little… fainter. And that one too. It’s hard to explain. I feel it, but it’s not as strong as it should be, maybe? Especially on my toes. Is that what you’re looking for? It’s like… a dull feeling.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Diminished sensation in your toes bilaterally. Now, finally, let's check your balance. Could you please stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh dear… whoa! I’m a little unsteady. Sorry! I guess my balance really isn’t as good as it used to be. It feels like I’m going to fall. Maybe I should sit down?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Uzarski. It’s good we checked. That confirms some balance impairment. Okay, Ms. Uzarski. Based on the exam findings – mild weakness in your hands, diminished sensation in your toes, and impaired balance – along with your symptoms and history, I suspect you may have peripheral neuropathy. This means there's some damage to the nerves outside of your brain and spinal cord. Several things can cause it, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, certain medications, and sometimes it can be due to a fall or injury. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some blood tests. We’ll check your blood sugar, vitamin B12 levels, thyroid function, and a complete blood count. I’d also like to consider an electromyography study, which measures the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves. Would you be open to those tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear… neuropathy? That sounds… serious. So it's not just me imagining things? Blood tests, okay, I can do blood tests. And… electro-what-now? That sounds a little scary. What does that involve? I don't like needles, you know. But if it'll help figure out what's going on, I guess I can try. But please, no surprises. Explain it to me like I'm five, okay? I just want to know what’s happening to me, and what I can do about it. I need to get back to my grandkids, and I can't do that if I'm falling all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Uzarski. It's certainly unsettling to hear a diagnosis like neuropathy, but it’s good we are looking into it. It's not necessarily serious, but it's important to understand the cause so we can manage it properly. Now, the electromyography, or EMG, study is a way to see how well your nerves are working. It involves inserting a very small needle into your muscles – just like the blood test, but a little different. It doesn’t hurt much, just a brief pinch, and it doesn't take long. A machine then measures the electrical signals your muscles make when they contract and relax. It helps us pinpoint exactly which nerves might be damaged. We'll start with the blood tests, and if those are inconclusive, we can discuss the EMG study in more detail. Would you like me to write down the names of the tests so you can look them up?
PATIENT: Okay… a pinch, you say? Not a lot of pinches? Yes, please write down the tests. I like to know things. And I need to know where to go to get them done. I don’t want to end up going to the wrong place. Is there anything I should do before the tests? Fasting? Special clothes? I just want to be prepared. And... is this something covered by insurance? Oh, I didn't mention, I don't have insurance right now. It’s a long story. It’s just… things have been tight since my husband passed.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Uzarski. I understand. Here’s a list of the tests: Complete Blood Count – Checks your overall health and looks for any signs of infection. Blood Glucose – Checks your blood sugar levels. You will need to fast for 8-12 hours before this test – meaning no food or drinks except water. Vitamin B12 Level – Checks your vitamin B12 levels, as a deficiency can cause neuropathy. Thyroid Function Tests – Checks your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause neuropathy. The lab is located at [Clinic address, phone number]. You don't need to do anything special for the CBC, Vitamin B12, or Thyroid Function tests. Just try to drink plenty of water the day before. As for the EMG study, we can discuss that further after we get the results of these initial tests. Regarding insurance, I understand you're currently uninsured. Let me check our financial assistance options for you. I will also have my staff look into the cost of these tests and see if there are any programs available to help. We don't want financial concerns to prevent you from getting the care you need. It appears we do have a sliding scale fee option for uninsured patients. The cost of these tests would be approximately [Dollar amount] with that discount. We can also explore options for payment plans. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… good to hear about the sliding scale. [Dollar amount]… I think I can manage that, if I cut back a little. Payment plans would be helpful, too. Okay, so just the blood tests for now. And I need to fast? No breakfast? Not even a little coffee? And… when will I get the results? I don’t want to wait too long. I need to get this sorted out. And if the results do show something… what happens then? More tests? Medicine?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Ms. Uzarski. It’s good you’re being proactive. Yes, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood tests – that means no food or drinks except water. No coffee, unfortunately. It's best to keep it simple to get accurate results. The lab typically gets the results back to us within 3-5 business days. We'll call you as soon as they're available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If the results do show signs of neuropathy, we’ll need to determine the underlying cause. Depending on the cause, treatment may involve medication to manage symptoms like pain or numbness, physical therapy to improve strength and balance, lifestyle modifications like avoiding alcohol, or addressing any vitamin deficiencies. In some cases, further testing like a nerve conduction study may be needed. We'll take it one step at a time, Ms. Uzarski. We'll start with these blood tests, and then we'll develop a plan based on the results. Here’s a lab requisition form with the tests listed. My staff will schedule a follow-up appointment for you before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
