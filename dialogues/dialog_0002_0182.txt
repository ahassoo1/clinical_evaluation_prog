DOCTOR: Hi Werner, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you, Doctor. Though I doubt you'll be doing much for me, frankly. It's this surgery. They want a check-up before they let me go under the knife, you see. Waste of time, if you ask me, but a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A pre-operative check-up. Even if you feel healthy, it’s good to make sure everything’s in good working order before any procedure. It's standard practice, and helps us minimize any risks. So, tell me a bit about the surgery you’re scheduled for. What kind of surgery is it, and where is it being done?
PATIENT: It's… cosmetic. And honestly, it’s none of your business where it's being done. A perfectly good doctor, thank you very much. It's… well, it’s for my face. Getting a little… droopy, you understand. A man likes to keep up appearances. Is this going to take long? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: I understand. No need to share specifics if you're not comfortable, Werner. Just knowing it's a facial surgery is helpful. I appreciate you mentioning your lunch appointment. I'll try to be as efficient as possible. To get a good overview, I'll need to ask a few questions about your medical history and current health. It will take some time to ensure you're a good candidate for surgery, and to avoid complications. First, have you had any significant medical problems in the past – things like heart trouble, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else that your other doctors have treated you for?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Heart trouble? No. Diabetes? Goodness, no. I’ve lived a clean life, mostly. A little arthritis in the knees, that’s all. Used to work with terrazzo, you know. Hard on the joints. High blood pressure… maybe a bit, when my wife was… well, never mind. But nothing serious. I told you, this is a waste of time. A perfectly good, healthy man. Now, can we get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the knees, and some past blood pressure concerns – that's helpful to know. And I appreciate you sharing that with me. We’ll definitely want to get a current reading just to be safe. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve always been too… practical to go under the knife for anything frivolous. This is it, the one time. And frankly, I’m not thrilled about it. It’s… a vanity thing, I suppose. My daughter insisted. Now, are you writing all this down? It feels rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am documenting everything as we talk, Werner. It’s important for your medical record and helps me provide the best possible care. It's standard procedure, and everything is confidential, of course. Since you've never had surgery before, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I eat everything. Used to be, my wife would make the best lutefisk… never mind. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I have a tee time after lunch, you know. This is a very important day. Just tell me if I'm cleared or not, and let me be on my way. I haven’t got all day for medical chit-chat.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Werner. I'm trying to gather the necessary information to ensure your safety during and after the surgery. Okay, no known allergies, that's good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for the knees. Glucosamine, I think it is. And sometimes, when it really acts up, ibuprofen. That's it. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a very simple man with very simple needs. This whole process is… unnecessary. I feel like I’m being treated like a child.
DOCTOR: Okay, glucosamine and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. That's good to know. Now, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, for goodness sake. What does that have to do with anything? My father lived to be eighty-five, mostly healthy. My mother… well, she died young. Pneumonia, I think. And my wife… never mind. Look, I’m not a complicated case, alright? Healthy stock. No heart disease, no cancer, no… anything. Can we please just skip this part? I really don't feel like reliving old memories. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand, Werner. It's perfectly alright if you don't want to go into detail. Just knowing that your father lived to 85, and that you aren't aware of any major health issues in your family is helpful. Okay. Let’s move on to some lifestyle questions then. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. Always preferred a good beer with my lutefisk. My wife… well, never mind. Look, are you done yet? I’m starting to feel quite impatient. This is taking far too long. A man has a life, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’re almost finished, Werner. Just a few more questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, yes. A beer with dinner, sometimes two. Nothing excessive. Mostly on the weekends. Keeps a man… relaxed. My wife used to… never mind. Honestly, Doctor, this is getting absurd. I feel like I’m being interrogated. Just tell me if I can have this surgery or not. I’m a perfectly healthy man who wants to look a little less… droopy. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it's not too much to ask at all, Werner. I understand your frustration, and I apologize if the questions feel intrusive. I assure you, I'm only trying to gather the information needed to ensure your safety and well-being. Okay, so a beer or two on the weekends. And finally, do you have any activity limitations, aside from the arthritis in your knees?
PATIENT: Activity limitations? Well, the knees act up sometimes. Can’t go for long walks anymore, that’s for sure. Used to love hiking, but those days are over. Other than that… no. I still do a bit of gardening. Mostly weeding, nothing strenuous. And I drive. Have to get to the golf course, you know. Look, are we finally done? I feel like I’ve aged ten years just answering these questions. Can we get this over with? I have a tee time to keep.
DOCTOR: Yes, Werner, we are almost finished. Thank you for being patient with me. Just one final thing before the physical exam: Can you tell me about your diet?
PATIENT: Diet? What do you mean? I eat. Mostly… normal things. Steak, potatoes, vegetables, occasionally fish. My wife used to make the best lutefisk… never mind. Look, I don't spend my days counting calories or obsessing over what I eat. A man eats when he’s hungry. Are you going to ask me about my bowel movements next? This is utterly ridiculous! Now, can we please move on? I have a life to get back to. A very important tee time.
DOCTOR: Alright Werner, I understand your frustration and appreciate you answering all my questions. It sounds like you have a fairly normal diet, and that’s great. Now, if you don’t mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your knees. It will just take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. The sooner I'm out of here, the better. But be gentle with the knees. They're not what they used to be. And please, no more questions. I've answered enough for a lifetime. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Werner. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Another one… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but nothing too concerning. We can monitor that. And your knees… some creaking and tenderness, as you mentioned. No significant swelling or redness. Range of motion is a bit limited, but not severely. Alright, that's everything. Everything seems generally good. We'll want to review your records, just to be sure. Do you have any concerns or questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. None whatsoever. Just tell me if I can have the surgery or not. I’m wasting valuable golfing time here. And frankly, I trust your judgement. Just… get on with it. I have a tee time to keep, you know. A very important tee time. Is that too much to ask? Just a simple yes or no. That’s all I want. Now, don't keep me in suspense.
DOCTOR: Alright, Werner. Based on what we've discussed, and my brief examination, there's no immediate medical reason why you shouldn't proceed with the facial surgery. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, so I would recommend a follow-up with your primary care physician to get that under control. I also want to advise that you follow any post-operative instructions given by your surgeon very carefully. And please, don't hesitate to contact them if you experience any concerning symptoms after the procedure. Do you have the name and contact information for your surgeon?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Dr. Albright. He’s perfectly good, don’t worry. I have his card somewhere… Here. Don’t bother calling him. He’ll contact me if he needs anything. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, but I've lived a long life. I’m not made of glass. Now, can I finally go? My tee time is slipping away. I need to get going. A man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do. Is there anything else? Anything at all? Because I really need to leave.
DOCTOR: Alright, Werner. Here's Dr. Albright’s card. I've made a note of our conversation in your chart. I don't think there's anything else at this time. I’m going to have my nurse print out a summary of our visit for you to take with you, and a note for your primary care physician regarding your blood pressure. Thank you for your patience today, and I wish you all the best with your surgery and recovery. Enjoy your tee time! And don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns in the future.
PATIENT: Right. Thank you. Though I doubt I’ll be back. A waste of time, frankly.
