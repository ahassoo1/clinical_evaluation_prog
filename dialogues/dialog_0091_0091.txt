DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here that you’re 63 years of age. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, to be honest, I been feeling… strange lately. I drink a lot more water than usual, and I still feel thirsty. And I always hungry, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just don’t seem right.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling thirsty despite drinking a lot of water, and persistent hunger even after eating – those are certainly symptoms worth investigating. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It start… maybe about two, three months now? It wasn’t sudden like, one day it just happen. It build up slow, slow. First the hunger, I thought I was just getting old and needing to eat more. Then the thirst come after, and that was really worrying me. I always had a glass of water with me, but now… I feel like I need a whole bucket!
DOCTOR: I see. A gradual onset over two to three months, starting with increased hunger and then progressing to excessive thirst. That’s helpful information. And you mentioned you’re feeling thirsty despite drinking a lot of water. Are you noticing any other changes – perhaps more frequent urination, any unexplained weight loss, or blurry vision, for example?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been going to the bathroom more often. Especially at night! It wake me up sometimes, which is not good. I didn’t really think much of it, just thought it was the water I was drinking. As for weight… I don’t know. I haven’t been weighing myself. I feel… a little thinner, maybe? But I could just be imagining it. And no, I not seeing blurry, everything look normal.
DOCTOR: Okay. Increased nighttime urination, along with the increased thirst and hunger, is certainly concerning. And the potential for unintentional weight loss is also something we need to consider. Let’s move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any fatigue, or unusual tiredness lately?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have been feeling very tired. More tired than usual, you know? I used to be able to work in the garden all day, but now I have to stop and rest after a little while. My husband have to help me more and more. I just feel… drained, all the time. Like something taking all my energy.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds quite debilitating. Fatigue, along with the other symptoms you've described, paints a clearer picture. Now, regarding your medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I never been sick with nothing like that. I try to eat healthy, you know? Mostly local fruits and vegetables. My mother always said good food is good medicine. I go to the doctor for check-ups when I have to, but they always say I healthy as a horse. This… this is something new.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No prior history of diabetes or chronic medical conditions. And you mentioned you generally eat a healthy diet. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a one. I’ve been lucky that way. A few bumps and bruises over the years, but nothing serious enough for a hospital or surgery. My husband always said I too stubborn to stay in a hospital!
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother, she had something with her sugar, I think. Not sure what they called it back then, but she had to watch what she eat. And my grandfather on my father’s side, he lost his leg because of… something with his blood, I think. They said it was bad blood. It was a long time ago, so I don’t remember much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of diabetes in your mother and a potential blood-related issue in your grandfather. That’s helpful information. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take nothing. Not a pill, not a vitamin, nothing at all. I always believe in letting my body do its work. My husband, he try to get me to take something for my joints, but I refuse. I just rub on some bush medicine when they bother me too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I never been allergic to nothing. Not a thing. I can eat anything, touch anything, breathe anything. I always been a strong woman.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Zicarelli. That’s very helpful information. Based on what you’ve told me – the increased thirst, frequent urination, persistent hunger, fatigue, and family history – I would like to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar levels and kidney function. These tests will help us determine what's going on and what the best course of action is. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sound good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s wrong with me and get it fixed. Blood tests… yes, that’s fine.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m ordering a comprehensive metabolic panel, which includes your blood sugar, electrolytes, and kidney function, as well as a hemoglobin A1c, which gives us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. The lab will also do a complete blood count to check your overall health. I will have the lab technician draw your blood now. It’s a standard procedure, and shouldn't take long. After the results come back, we can discuss them and determine the next steps. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You explain everything very well. Just… how long will it take to get the results? I hope it’s not too long. I don’t like feeling like this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. The results typically take about 24 to 48 hours to come back. I will personally review them as soon as they are available, and my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink fluids as needed to stay hydrated, but try to avoid sugary drinks. And while we wait for the results, if you notice any worsening symptoms – such as confusion, severe weakness, or difficulty breathing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions before I have the lab technician come in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s all. Thank you very much for listening to me and taking the time to help. I feel a little better just knowing we are finding out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Zicarelli. I’m glad I could help. I will have the lab technician come in now. “Could someone please come in to draw blood from Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor.
