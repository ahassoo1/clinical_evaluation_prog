DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… well, my bruising. It’s just been getting worse lately, and I’m on blood thinners, so it’s a bit worrying, you know? I don’t want anything serious happening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Courtnye. Bruising easily when you're on blood thinners is something we need to investigate. It's good you're bringing it to our attention. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the bruising?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… everywhere, really. I bumped my arm on the doorframe a couple of days ago, and it turned black and blue immediately. Normally, it wouldn't be that bad, but this is… different. And I’ve noticed some bruising on my legs too, even though I don’t remember hitting them on anything. It's just… appearing. It’s kinda scary, honestly.
DOCTOR: I can certainly understand why that would be scary, Courtnye. Bruising that appears spontaneously, or with very minor trauma, does warrant a closer look. When you say "immediately," how large was the bruise right after the bump on your arm?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It was maybe… the size of my palm? And it was really dark purple, almost black. It spread pretty quickly too, within a few hours it was bigger than my hand. Usually, it takes a day or so to even start to show. I keep checking it, and it's not going down much. It’s just… staying purple. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Courtnye. A bruise developing that quickly and to that size, especially with minimal trauma, is concerning. And the fact that it isn’t resolving as you’d expect is also important. Now, you mentioned bruising on your legs as well. About how often would you say you’re noticing new bruises there?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's hard to say exactly… maybe… two or three times a week? It’s not like a big, painful bruise every time, sometimes it's just little spots. But they're definitely showing up more often than they used to. I keep thinking I must have bumped something, but I honestly can't remember doing it. And they're in weird places, like on the tops of my feet and my shins. Not where I'd normally get them.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information, Courtnye. Two or three times a week with those characteristics is definitely something we need to investigate further. Let’s go through a bit more of your medical history to get a clearer picture. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I have high blood pressure, and that’s why I’m on the blood thinners to begin with. And I had a hysterectomy about ten years ago. Other than that… not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. I try to eat right and walk when I can, but it's hard sometimes. Is that enough? Should I be telling you about… like, childhood illnesses?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Courtnye. Knowing about the high blood pressure and the hysterectomy is important. And yes, if you don't mind, a little more detail about your past medical history would be helpful, including any childhood illnesses you remember having. It doesn't have to be exhaustive, just anything significant that you recall. Also, were you told why you needed to start on blood thinners with your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I had a blood clot in my leg a few years ago, that's why they put me on the blood thinners. It was scary, really. They said it was from… uh… sitting too long on a plane. I fly a lot for work, unfortunately. I think they called it deep vein thrombosis or something? As for childhood illnesses… I had chickenpox, measles, mumps… the usual stuff, I guess? Nothing serious, really. I didn’t get sick much as a kid, honestly. Does the type of blood thinner matter? I don't really remember the name, just that I take a pill every day.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Courtnye. Knowing about the deep vein thrombosis is very important. And knowing you fly frequently is helpful as well. Yes, the type of blood thinner is important. Do you happen to know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is where I struggle. I think it starts with a 'W'? Warfarin? Is that it? I have the bottle at home, but I didn't bring it with me. Sorry, I'm terrible with names and stuff. I just ask the pharmacist to refill it every month. I do know it’s a pill, and I take one every day, usually at dinner. Is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Courtnye. Warfarin is a common blood thinner, and knowing that's likely what you're on is good. Okay. Now, do you take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the blood thinner, and… oh! I take a multivitamin every day. Just a basic one. And sometimes, when my joints are acting up, I’ll take ibuprofen. Not regularly, just when I need it. I used to take something for my blood pressure too, before they put me on the blood thinner, but I stopped taking that when I started the new medication. Is that everything? I’m really trying to remember, but I get so confused with all the pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information, Courtnye. Multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Knowing you stopped the other blood pressure medication is also important. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I don’t think so. I used to be allergic to penicillin, but I haven't had a reaction to it in years. I think I outgrew it or something. Other than that… nothing comes to mind. I’m pretty lucky, honestly. No hay fever, no food allergies… nothing. Is that unusual?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Courtnye. And it's not unusual at all to not have many allergies. Now, let’s briefly talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… that's a tough one. My mom had high blood pressure, and my dad had… um… heart problems, I think? He died pretty young, actually. And my sister has diabetes. Other than that… not really. A lot of my family is just… healthy. Or they died of old age, you know? It’s kinda hard to keep track, honestly. We don't really talk about it much. Does that help at all? I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Courtnye. Knowing about the high blood pressure, heart problems, and diabetes in your family is good. Finally, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. I hate the smell of it. And I don't drink much alcohol either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a week? Nothing heavy. I try to stay healthy, even though it's hard sometimes with work and everything. I really try. Does that make sense? I feel like I'm rambling now. Can we get to the actual bruising part? I'm a bit worried about it, you know?
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Courtnye. It's helpful for me to get a complete picture. I appreciate you sharing all of this information. Now, let’s get back to the bruising. You mentioned it's been worsening lately. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on. The bruising is really starting to scare me, and I want to make sure it’s not something serious. Please, do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Courtnye. Let's start with your arm, where you bumped it. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Here it is. It looks worse in the light, doesn’t it? It feels a bit tender, but not really painful. Just… uncomfortable. And it hasn’t gotten much smaller, even after a couple of days. I keep looking at it, hoping it will disappear, but it just stays the same. It’s kinda freaky.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see it. It is quite extensive, as you said. And it does feel somewhat firm. Now, I'm going to check the bruising on your legs. Could you please lower your pants slightly so I can examine your shins and the tops of your feet?
PATIENT: It's… it's not as bad as my arm, but it’s still there. I didn’t even remember hitting my legs on anything. They just… appeared. It’s kinda embarrassing, honestly. I feel like an old lady, always covered in bruises. I'm really worried it's something serious, Doctor. Do you think it could be a sign of something really bad? I don’t want to get sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There are multiple smaller bruises in various stages of healing. It doesn’t appear to be concentrated in one area, which is good. I’m not going to jump to any conclusions, Courtnye. But the fact that you have unexplained bruising, especially while on a blood thinner, warrants further investigation. Your bruising pattern and the fact that the bruising doesn't correlate to significant injury does concern me. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I’d like to order some blood work. This will help us assess your blood clotting factors and rule out any underlying conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and make sure it’s not something serious. Blood work sounds… scary, but if it helps, then I’m willing to do it. Will it take long? And… will it hurt? I’m kinda nervous about needles. I’m really not good with needles. Can you tell me what the blood work is for, exactly? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Of course, Courtnye. I understand your nervousness. The blood work is relatively quick and shouldn't take more than a few minutes. The needle pinch is brief, and most people tolerate it well. We'll have a phlebotomist draw the blood, and they're very skilled at minimizing discomfort. As for what the blood work is for, we'll be checking a few things. First, we'll check your complete blood count to assess your overall blood health. We’ll also check your prothrombin time and international normalized ratio to see how well your blood is clotting, especially since you're on warfarin. These tests will help us ensure your medication dosage is correct. We'll also check your platelet count to make sure you have enough platelets, which are important for blood clotting. And finally, we’ll check some other markers to rule out any other potential causes of unexplained bruising. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. So it’s just to make sure the medication is working right and to rule out anything else. Okay, that doesn’t sound too bad. I’m still nervous about the needle, but if it helps figure things out, then I’ll do it. Can I eat before the blood work? Or should I fast? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have work on Friday, and I’m worried about missing it if it takes too long. I really hope it’s nothing serious, Doctor. I'm getting really worried.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be thorough with your questions, Courtnye. No, you don’t need to fast for this blood work. You can eat and drink normally. As for the results, it usually takes about 24 to 48 hours for the lab to process the samples and send the report back to us. We’ll have the results by Thursday at the latest, and I'll give you a call as soon as I've reviewed them. If there’s anything urgent, we’ll let you know immediately, of course. I understand your anxiety, and I want to reassure you that we’re taking this seriously. It's important to rule out any underlying causes, but many things can cause unexplained bruising, and it's often something relatively minor. Let's get the blood work done, and then we'll discuss the results and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. Okay, let’s get it over with. Where do I go for the blood work? Is it in the same building? And… will you call me even if the results are normal? I just want to be sure everything is okay. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. I was getting really scared, and you’ve made me feel a lot better. Can I ask one last question? Does taking ibuprofen affect the blood work? I took some yesterday for my joints. I know I shouldn’t, but sometimes it’s the only thing that helps.
DOCTOR: Of course, Courtnye. You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could ease your anxiety a bit. Yes, the lab is right down the hall, in room 203. The phlebotomist is expecting you, and they’ll take good care of you. And yes, I will absolutely call you even if the results are normal. I want to follow up and make sure you're feeling better and address any remaining concerns. And yes, taking ibuprofen can slightly affect the blood work, specifically the platelet function test. It’s good you mentioned that. We’ll take that into account when interpreting the results. It’s best to avoid taking ibuprofen for a few days before any further testing, if possible. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been really helpful and patient with me. I feel a lot better knowing we’re getting things checked out. I'm going to go get the blood work done now. I really appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Courtnye. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns after the blood work. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
