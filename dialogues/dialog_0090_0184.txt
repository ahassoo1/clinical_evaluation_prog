DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning to you too. Look here, Doctor, I don't have all day. It's... well, it's this. <gestures vaguely at his stomach> It's gettin' too big. Always been a lean man, you see. Pile drivin' keeps you fit, it does. But now... now it's just... there. Wife used to say… never mind what she said. Just want it gone, if that's possible. Not lookin' for sympathy, just a fix.
DOCTOR: Alright. “It’s getting too big,” you say. And it's a recent change, considering your history of physical labor?
PATIENT: Recent-ish. Not overnight, mind you. But maybe... six months now? Started noticing my clothes feelin' a bit tight. And I ain’t been eatin' any more, I tell ya! Used to be able to eat a whole chicken, no problem. Now… it’s just bothersome. <fidgets with his hands> It’s not about health, Doctor. It's about lookin’ presentable. A man’s got pride, you know? I don't want to look like a… a barrel.
DOCTOR: Hmm. I see here you've had regular check-ups, and everything was within normal limits last year. No significant weight gain reported then. Six months is a reasonable timeframe for changes. And to be clear, you’re not experiencing any pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Nause-… what was that word? No, none of that. Bowel… look, Doctor, I'm a simple man. I go to the bathroom when I need to. It ain't changed. Just… it's the size of me. It’s embarrassing. You ever try to bend over with somethin’ hangin’ over your belt? It’s no fun, I tell ya. <shakes his head> Look, can we just get to the part where you tell me if you can do somethin’ about it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. We need to figure out what "something" is before we can talk about fixing it. It could be a number of things. Given your description, we’ll need to start with a physical exam. I’ll need to palpate your abdomen to feel for any masses or abnormalities. Then we may need some imaging, like an ultrasound or CT scan, to get a clearer picture. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had none of them fancy allergies. I eat what’s put in front of me. <scoffs> Back in my day, we didn’t have time for allergies. Too busy workin’. <pauses, looking at her skeptically> Palpate? You’re gonna feel my stomach? Is that necessary? Sounds a bit… invasive, don’t you think? Can’t you just… I don’t know… measure it? With a tape or somethin’?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, simply measuring the circumference of your abdomen won’t tell me what’s causing the enlargement. Palpation allows me to assess the texture, location, and any tenderness, which is vital information. It’s a standard part of a medical examination. Unless you have a specific reason why you’re unwilling, I need to proceed with the exam to properly evaluate your condition. It's not about what you want, it’s about getting a diagnosis. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Do what you gotta do. But I’m tellin’ ya, it’s just… fat. Maybe a bit of… somethin’ from all the jerk chicken I had last weekend. But don’t go lookin’ for anythin’ serious. Just get it over with. <crosses his arms tightly, looking away> And be gentle, mind you. I ain’t as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, then I will gently palpate it. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort during the examination. <begins listening to his abdomen with a stethoscope> Take deep breaths for me, Mr. Trendler. …Okay. Now I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. <begins gently palpating his abdomen> …Hmm. <pauses>…I’m feeling some fullness in the lower abdomen. Is this where you've noticed the most change?
PATIENT: <winces slightly as she presses> Aye, that’s… right there. Lower down. It feels… kinda hard, actually. Not like a gut. More… solid. Not painful, just… noticeable. And it’s bigger than it used to be. Always been a bit soft around the middle, but never… hard like that. <looks at her with a worried expression> What’s that mean, Doctor? Don’t tell me it’s somethin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. A hard mass in the lower abdomen warrants further investigation, Mr. Trendler. It’s unlikely to be simply “fat,” given your description. I’m going to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. In the meantime, I’d like to draw some blood for routine labs – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: <fidgets with his hands> A scan? Blood tests? What are you lookin’ for, Doctor? This sounds… serious. You makin' me nervous now. I just wanted a little somethin' done about my belly, not… <trails off> Is it… is it cancer? My cousin… he had somethin' in his belly. Didn't end well. Just tell me straight, Doctor. Is it somethin' bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your concern, especially given your cousin's experience. However, it’s far too early to jump to any conclusions. A mass can be caused by a variety of things—benign growths, hernias, or, yes, potentially something more serious. That’s why we need the imaging and blood work. We need information before we can determine the cause. I am not going to speculate on a diagnosis without seeing the results of the tests. Jumping to conclusions will only cause you unnecessary anxiety. We are taking a cautious and thorough approach. Do you understand?
PATIENT: <sighs heavily> Fine. Tests, then. But don't keep me waitin' too long. I hate bein' in the dark. <looks down at his hands> And… when will I get the results? A day? A week? I got things to do, Doctor. Can't be runnin' back and forth to the clinic all the time. Just… give me a timeframe.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back within 24-48 hours. The CT scan, however, will take a bit longer to be reviewed by a radiologist – typically 3-5 business days. My office will call you as soon as we have the results. We will then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. I understand your impatience, Mr. Trendler, but these tests are essential for an accurate diagnosis. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: <nods slowly> No. I suppose not. Just… get it done quickly, Doctor. And call me. Don't want to be sittin’ here worryin’ for a week. <stands up slowly, looking uncomfortable> Thank you, I guess. <hesitates> That'll be all.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Trendler. The nurse will escort you to schedule your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
