DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. I am Dr. Yackey. So, let's get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… my speech, I think. It’s been a bit off, you see. Hard to explain properly, truthfully. It feels… slurred, sometimes. Not always, though. It’s just… been happening.
DOCTOR: "Off," you say. A rather vague description, I must admit. Can you elaborate?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes, sorry. It’s difficult to put into words. Like… the words don’t come out as clearly as they should, sometimes. Like I’m… mumbling, perhaps? Or… I don’t know. It's not a constant thing, and it’s hard to know when it’s happening, really. My husband pointed it out, mostly.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. Not very long, I don’t think. A few weeks, maybe? It’s difficult to recall precisely. Everything feels a bit… blurred, if you don't mind me saying. It definitely hasn't been months, though. Perhaps since the start of July? I really couldn’t say for certain.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, then. And has this been gradual, or did it begin suddenly?
PATIENT: Suddenly, I think. Or, at least, I noticed it suddenly. It wasn’t like a slow fade, more… one day I was speaking normally, and the next… my husband said I wasn’t as clear. It wasn’t dramatic, just… noticeable, he said. I didn’t really feel any different myself, to be honest. It's all a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this speech issue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Not that I’m aware of, no. I haven’t felt unwell, or had any headaches, or dizziness… nothing like that. I feel perfectly normal, aside from this… speech thing. Perhaps a little more tired than usual, but I put that down to work. It's quite demanding, you know? Construction is…physical.
DOCTOR: Construction, yes. And have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… no, not at all. I’m on my feet all day, lifting and carrying things. I haven’t noticed any difficulty with my strength or balance. Everything feels… as it should, physically. It's just this… talking. It's frustrating, more than anything. I don't understand why it's happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Not that I recall, no. Nothing serious, anyway. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, of course, and a bad sprain in my ankle a few years ago, but nothing… long-term. I've always been quite healthy, truthfully. I have Medicare, you see, and they haven’t mentioned anything…serious. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Fair enough. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. Not a single one. I try to avoid hospitals if I can, truthfully. It’s not my favourite place, and thankfully, I’ve never needed to be in one for anything major. Just the usual check-ups, and the occasional sprain treated at the clinic. Nothing requiring… cutting. I hope that explains things.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… hmm. That's a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he passed away a few years ago, from…well, old age, mostly. He was a strong man, but his heart wasn't. I don't recall any other major illnesses on either side, truthfully. It’s a bit of a blur, if I’m honest. I wasn't very close to a lot of my family. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any medications at all. Never have, truthfully. I try to stay away from them if I can. I prefer to manage things naturally, if possible. Just plenty of rest and good food, that's what I believe in. I've always been lucky enough to stay healthy without needing… pills.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything, and I've never had a rash or anything like that. My husband sometimes jokes that I have a cast iron stomach, but truthfully, I think I’m just… lucky. I haven’t ever had any problems with allergies, as far as I can recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. I'm going to perform a brief neurological exam, if you don't mind. Just to assess your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It shouldn't take long. Please follow my instructions as best you can.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. I'll do my best to follow your instructions. Just let me know what you’d like me to do, and I’ll try my very best. I hope I don’t mess anything up! It’s just… sometimes my mind wanders a little. But I'll focus, I promise.
DOCTOR: Please sit here. First, I’d like you to close your eyes, and I’m going to test your reflexes in your arms and legs. Relax your limbs. Good. Now, can you squeeze my fingers?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Here we go. Is that alright, Doctor? Is that too hard, or not hard enough? I always worry about doing things properly.
DOCTOR: Adequate strength. Now, I’d like you to follow my finger with your eyes, but do not move your head. Keep following it… and now, look to your left… and now, to your right…
PATIENT: I’m following it, Doctor. Is that alright? It’s a bit…wobbly, perhaps? I'm trying to keep my head still, but it's a little difficult. I’m looking left… and now right. Is that what you wanted? I hope I'm doing it properly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you say the phrase "baby hippopotamus" for me?
PATIENT: Baby… hippopotamus. Ba-by hip-po-po-ta-mus. Does that sound alright, Doctor? It feels… strange to say so slowly. I usually speak a lot faster. Is it too quiet? Or too loud? I always worry about getting it right.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, I’d like you to stick your tongue out as far as you can.
PATIENT: Is that alright, Doctor? It feels… a little silly, truthfully. I'm not very good at sticking my tongue out. It's a bit wobbly, isn't it? I hope that's what you wanted. It doesn’t go very far, does it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. Based on this brief examination, and your history, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of your speech issues. However, the mild slurring and slight tremor are concerning. I recommend further investigation, specifically an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An MRI… That sounds… serious, Doctor. What exactly are you looking for? Is it something bad? I hadn’t really expected it to be anything…so involved. I just thought it was maybe stress, or… I don’t know. I'm not really sure I understand. But if you think it’s necessary, then… yes, I suppose so. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then I’m willing, but it sounds rather frightening.
DOCTOR: An MRI is simply a diagnostic tool, Ms. Swaby. It allows us to visualize the brain and identify any potential issues. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious, but it’s important to rule out possibilities. I’m concerned about the possibility of a small stroke, or a neurological condition. I’ll arrange a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Eleanor Vance, and she will schedule the MRI for you. I will also prescribe a mild anti-inflammatory medication, naproxen, to help manage any potential underlying inflammation. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, a neurologist… and inflammation? A stroke… that sounds… very bad. Is it likely, Doctor? I’m not very good with medical terms, you see. And naproxen… is that safe? I try to avoid taking pills if I can, truthfully. I’m a little worried about side effects. And… Dr. Vance… is she a good doctor? I just… everything feels a bit overwhelming, suddenly. I just came in because my speech was a bit off, and now it sounds like… a lot. Perhaps I should have just ignored it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Swaby, I understand your concerns. It’s natural to feel overwhelmed when faced with uncertainty. I’ve mentioned the possibility of a stroke to cover all bases, but it is not a definitive diagnosis. The MRI will provide us with the clarity we need. Naproxen is a common anti-inflammatory medication with minimal side effects for most patients. If you experience any gastrointestinal upset, please discontinue use and contact my office. Dr. Vance is an excellent neurologist, highly regarded in the field. I would not refer you to anyone I didn’t have complete confidence in. I’ll also provide you with a list of stroke symptoms to be aware of. If you experience any sudden weakness, numbness, vision changes, or severe headache, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, that… helps a little, Doctor. Knowing it’s not a definitive diagnosis is reassuring. And Dr. Vance sounds… good. A list of symptoms… yes, that’s sensible. I'll remember that. And… the MRI… will it be painful? And how long does it take? I always worry about being closed in… I don’t do well in tight spaces. I suppose I should have mentioned that earlier. Perhaps it's silly, but… it’s something I worry about. Is it a long procedure?
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Swaby. Claustrophobia is quite common. The MRI machine is a tight space, but you will be provided with headphones and a call button to communicate with the technician at all times. You can request a mild sedative from Dr. Vance if you are particularly anxious. The procedure itself typically takes between 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the areas being scanned. The technician will explain the process thoroughly before you begin, and they will be monitoring you throughout. I’ll include a note on your referral requesting Dr. Vance to address your claustrophobia concerns. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, and for being so patient. I was very worried, and you’ve… calmed me down a little. Knowing about the sedative is… reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time. I suppose I'll wait for the referral, and then contact Dr. Vance. Thank you again. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Swaby. That will be all. I will have my assistant provide you with a summary of our discussion, as well as the referral information. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Dr. Vance. I wish you all the best, and I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
