DOCTOR: Hi Esthela, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Hernandez, it’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I suppose you could say I’m… vetting a potential life partner. It’s just, one has to be thorough, don’t you think? I want to ensure everything is… as it should be, before I commit to anything serious.
DOCTOR: That’s… a very conscientious approach, Esthela. I understand you'd like a general health assessment then, to ensure everything is as it should be. That’s perfectly reasonable. To start, can you tell me a little about why you decided to come in today specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not just a general assessment, Doctor. It’s more… targeted. He’s… quite a bit younger than I am, and while I find that… refreshing, one naturally wants to be certain of one’s health status. It would be… awkward to discover any… pre-existing conditions later. And frankly, I want to be certain he doesn’t have anything… untoward going on, either. Though I suppose that’s his responsibility, truly. I simply prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Being informed is always best. So, to clarify, you’re looking for a comprehensive assessment for both of you – a kind of check-up to address any potential concerns before things become more serious. Is that right?
PATIENT: Precisely, Doctor. You understand perfectly. It’s about due diligence, really. One doesn’t simply… leap into these things blindly. And while he seems very… health-conscious—yoga, organic smoothies, the whole nine yards—one can never truly be certain, can one? It's reassuring to have a professional opinion. And, if you’ll permit me to say so, a discerning one.
DOCTOR: Of course. That's what I'm here for. Alright, let's start with you, Esthela. Can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I've always been quite… robust, thankfully. No major illnesses, no surgeries to speak of. I had the usual childhood vaccinations, of course. My mother was very diligent about that. I've always maintained a… reasonable weight, though I've put on a few pounds in recent years – marriage will do that to you, you know!—but nothing of any real concern. I do have slightly elevated blood pressure, which my primary care physician monitors. Otherwise, quite healthy. Do you need specifics? I have a list, if you’d like. It’s all very organized, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Esthela. Actually, let me quickly pull up your records – I see you've been seen at the clinic before. Ah, yes. I see the notes regarding the slightly elevated blood pressure, and it's good to see regular monitoring. Knowing that gives us a good baseline. And no, a list isn't necessary at the moment—we can go through it systematically. Just to be thorough, have you had any new medical problems arise in the last six months?
PATIENT: No, nothing new, Doctor. Thankfully. Just the usual… aches and pains of getting older, you know? Nothing that requires a visit to the doctor, at least. Though, I did have a rather persistent cough last winter. It was quite bothersome, but it eventually cleared up on its own. It’s… rather tiresome, explaining these things. I've always been very healthy, you see. It’s simply routine, I suppose. Are we getting anywhere? I do have commitments later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting somewhere, Esthela. And I apologize if this feels repetitive—I want to be as comprehensive as possible, especially given your concerns. The cough is good to note. Did you have a fever, any chest pain, or shortness of breath with that cough?
PATIENT: Oh, no fever, Doctor. Definitely no chest pain. Just a… nagging cough. A bit of congestion, perhaps. Nothing serious, I assure you. It was likely just a cold. I rarely bother the doctor with minor ailments. It’s… inefficient, really. And frankly, he always makes me feel as if I'm wasting his time. Though, you seem very attentive, which is… refreshing. Still, I highly doubt that cough is relevant. It was months ago! Are you intending to ask about every minor illness I’ve ever had?
DOCTOR: No, not every minor illness, Esthela. I’m simply trying to get a complete picture of your recent health history. It's helpful to know what you've experienced, even if it seems insignificant now. Alright, let’s move on then. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Absolutely none. I’ve always been able to eat anything and everything. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. It’s rather enviable, really. I suppose it’s a blessing. Though, I do try to avoid… overly processed foods, for health reasons, naturally. But not due to any allergic reaction. I just find them… unpleasant. Are we nearing the end? I really must be mindful of my schedule. I have a hair appointment scheduled for this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’re making good progress, Esthela. Just a few more questions, then we can move on to a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, Doctor, as recommended by my primary care physician for my blood pressure. And a multivitamin, naturally. One must maintain one's health, you see. I’ve always been very proactive about that. Though, I must admit, I sometimes forget to take it. My husband reminds me. I suppose that's why he’s so valuable. Do you need the specific dosage? I can look it up. It’s all meticulously documented, you understand.
DOCTOR: No, the aspirin and multivitamin are helpful to know. No need to look anything up. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… that’s… complicated, Doctor. My mother’s side was… rather prone to everything, frankly. Heart disease, high blood pressure, some instances of breast cancer, a touch of diabetes… it was a rather unfortunate gene pool, to be honest. My father’s side was somewhat better, but he wasn’t particularly forthcoming with medical information. It was… a sensitive topic. I believe his mother had arthritis, but beyond that, I’m afraid I can’t offer much detail. It’s all rather vague, you see. Is that helpful? I do apologize for the lack of specifics. It’s simply the truth. Perhaps it's best not to dwell on the negative.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Esthela. It’s helpful to know what you do know. Alright, one final section, then we can proceed with the physical exam if you’re willing. Let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, Doctor! Absolutely not. I would never dream of such things. I find them… distasteful, frankly. I do enjoy a glass of sherry with dinner occasionally—a very small glass, mind you—but that’s the extent of it. And I believe a healthy lifestyle is paramount. Regular walks, a balanced diet, a peaceful home life… those are the keys to longevity, you see. I take very good care of myself. It’s simply a matter of common sense. Are we finished now? I do have a rather important engagement later. A luncheon with my book club. They’re quite strict about punctuality.
DOCTOR: Yes, Esthela, we are finished with the questions. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam—just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your throat. It’ll only take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Proceed. Though, I must warn you, my blood pressure may be slightly elevated due to the… stress of this entire process. I’m not particularly fond of medical examinations, you see. But I understand it’s necessary. Just… be gentle, if you would. And try not to take too much of my time. My book club would be most displeased.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax and take some deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, rate is… 78 and steady. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 142 over 88, as expected. Throat looks clear, no signs of infection. Everything seems within normal limits, given your slightly elevated blood pressure.
PATIENT: Hmm. As expected, you say? I suppose that’s… reassuring, in a way. Though, I do wish it were lower. My primary care physician is always urging me to reduce my sodium intake. It’s so difficult, you see. Everything tastes so much better with a little salt! Still, I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. Now, what does this all mean? Is there anything I should be concerned about? And more importantly, is it likely to… affect my prospects in the romantic arena? I apologize for the bluntness, but it’s a perfectly legitimate concern.
DOCTOR: Well, Esthela, overall, you appear to be in good health for your age. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but it’s not alarming, and we can certainly discuss strategies to manage that—dietary changes, stress reduction, regular exercise. It’s good that you’re already aware of it and working with your primary care physician. As for your… prospects, I don't believe a slightly elevated blood pressure should be a significant obstacle. It’s a common condition, easily manageable, and demonstrates your proactive approach to your health, which is a very positive quality. And frankly, a healthy lifestyle and a peaceful home life – as you mentioned – are far more important factors. Do you have any specific concerns you’d like me to address?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… somewhat comforting, Doctor. Though, I do worry about appearing… frail. He’s quite active, you see. Hiking, rock climbing, all sorts of strenuous activities. I wouldn’t want to be a burden. Perhaps I should take up yoga? Or… learn to rock climb? It seems terribly dangerous, but one must be adaptable, don’t you think? And… is there anything I should disclose to him? About my blood pressure, I mean. It feels rather… indelicate. It's not as if it's a rash, or a broken bone. It’s simply a number, isn’t it? Still, I suppose honesty is the best policy. What would you advise?
DOCTOR: That’s a very thoughtful question, Esthela. I think it’s admirable that you’re considering his activity level and wanting to be prepared. As for disclosure, I believe transparency is always a good approach, especially in a new relationship. You don’t need to present it as a medical crisis, but simply mentioning that you’re monitoring your blood pressure and working with your doctor shows you’re responsible and aware of your health. You could say something like, “I’m generally very active, but I do monitor my blood pressure with my doctor, just to stay on top of things.” That’s honest, proactive, and doesn’t dwell on any potential limitations. And as for taking up yoga or rock climbing – that’s entirely up to you! Do what you enjoy and what makes you feel healthy and strong. You don’t need to change yourself to fit his lifestyle, but incorporating some activity you enjoy can certainly be beneficial. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been… remarkably helpful, and surprisingly understanding. I was rather apprehensive about this entire process, but you’ve put me at ease. Though, I still maintain that my book club will be most displeased with my tardiness. Perhaps I should schedule a follow-up appointment, just to ensure everything remains… satisfactory. And perhaps you could recommend a good yoga instructor? Though, I must warn you, I have very high standards. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been a true professional. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Esthela. I’m glad I could help. A follow-up appointment is always a good idea—we can check your blood pressure and discuss any concerns that may arise. I do have a list of highly-recommended yoga instructors in the area, I can email it to you. And don’t worry about your book club – I’m sure they’ll understand! Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And best of luck with everything. .
