DOCTOR: Hello Mr. Obarr, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. It’s… it’s my stomach, mostly. I just get full so quick these days. Like, barely eat anything and I feel stuffed. It’s been going on for a bit now, and my wife, bless her heart, she says I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good of your wife to encourage you to come in. Feeling full quickly, even after a small amount of food, is certainly something we should look into. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it wasn't sudden, not like a switch flipped. Probably started… oh, maybe six months ago? It’s hard to say exactly. At first, I just figured I wasn’t as hungry as I used to be, getting older and all. But now… it’s just getting a bit bothersome. I used to really enjoy my meals, you know? Now I pick at them.
DOCTOR: Right, six months is a good timeframe to work with. And it sounds like it’s gradually worsened, which is helpful to know. Besides feeling full quickly, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside that?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really, not that I’ve noticed. No pain, no… nothing coming back up. Just… full. Sometimes a little bloated afterwards, maybe? But not always. And, now that I think of it, I've been a little tired lately. But honestly, at my age, who isn’t tired?
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea or vomiting, occasional bloating, and some fatigue. That’s good information. And you’re right, fatigue is common, but we still want to consider it. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – anything different with how often you’re going, or the consistency of things?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking! … Well, they’re… regular enough. Maybe a little… softer than they used to be? Nothing drastic, though. My wife keeps an eye on those things too, always has. She'll tell me if things get really out of sorts. I don't really pay attention unless she says something.
DOCTOR: Alright, regular but slightly softer stools. Thank you for sharing that, and it's good you have your wife keeping an eye on things. Let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Nothing major. I had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, arthritis, the doctor said. But that’s about it. I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise. I try to stay active, go for walks when the weather’s good. Nothing too strenuous, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your knees is good to know. Any surgeries or hospitalizations you can recall?
PATIENT: Just the one, a long time ago. I had my appendix out when I was a young man. Must have been… oh, goodness, 50 years ago or more! Other than that, nope. Never been much for doctors, to be honest. Always tried to tough things out.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removed many years ago. And I appreciate you being so open with me. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My mother, she had some trouble with her heart when she got older. And my father… he was a strong man, but he did have diabetes towards the end. My sister, she's still alive, thankfully, but she’s been battling high blood pressure for years now. I don’t think anything else jumps to mind, to be honest. It’s a big family, so it’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Heart trouble in your mother, diabetes in your father, and high blood pressure in your sister. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I try to stay active. Walks mostly. I used to do a bit of fishing, but it’s gotten harder to get out there. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much anymore, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I live with my wife, we’ve been married a long time. We eat pretty healthy, I think. Lots of fish, vegetables. She does most of the cooking, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, that all sounds very good. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always asks when she gets me new medication, just in case. She's very thorough. I've always been pretty lucky, as I said. I’ve never had to worry about allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And it sounds like your wife is a wonderful advocate for your health. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just one. My doctor gave me something for my knees, a little pain reliever. I don’t take it every day, just when they’re really bothering me. And sometimes I take a multivitamin, just to be safe. But that’s it, really. Nothing else. Oh! And sometimes a little fish oil. My wife says it’s good for the heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pain reliever for your knees as needed, a multivitamin sometimes, and fish oil. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your reflexes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, so I suppose I need a good looking over. Just let me know if anything feels… odd.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr, everything seems generally okay. Your heart and lungs sound good, your reflexes are normal. I did notice some mild tenderness when I pressed on your upper abdomen, but nothing too concerning at this point. I'd like to order some blood work, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, your liver and kidney function, and your thyroid levels. We'll also check your blood sugar to rule out diabetes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work sounds good. I don’t mind getting poked a little if it helps figure things out. Just let me know what I need to do. Fasting, or anything like that? I’m not good at remembering things these days, so you might have to remind me.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask! Yes, I'd like you to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw – that means no food or sugary drinks, but you can still drink water. I’ll give you a requisition form to take to the lab, and the lab technician will explain everything to you. I’ll also have my nurse give you a printed list of instructions before you leave. While we wait for the results, I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals. Avoid anything overly fatty or greasy, as that can sometimes worsen the feeling of fullness. We will discuss the results next week. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very reasonable. Smaller meals, no fatty foods… I can manage that. And I’ll remember to fast. Hopefully, my wife will remind me too, just in case. Next week is fine for discussing the results. Thank you, Doctor, for taking the time to listen and figure things out. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It was my pleasure. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your follow-up appointment. Here’s the requisition form for the blood work and a print out of the instructions for fasting. My nurse will be right in to review everything with you. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and kindness. It’s a relief to finally get this checked out. I’ll just wait for the nurse then. Thank you again.
