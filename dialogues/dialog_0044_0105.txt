DOCTOR: Good morning, Bradlee. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here about getting surgery, I think. For… losing weight? My wife helped me set this up, honestly. I don't really remember all the details. It’s… bariatric surgery, right? She said something about an evaluation.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bradlee, that’s perfectly alright. It’s common to feel a little overwhelmed with all the information. Bariatric surgery is a big step, and an evaluation is definitely the right place to start. Your wife sounds very supportive. So, just to clarify, you're interested in exploring weight loss surgery as an option. Before we go further, can you tell me a bit about why you're considering surgery now?
PATIENT: Yeah, she is. Really helpful. Um… why now… Honestly, it’s just… things have gotten harder. Everything is harder. Getting around, keeping up with my kids… even just bending over to tie my shoes. It’s been getting worse for a while, and I just… want to feel better, I guess. I want to be able to do things again. I don't know if that makes sense. I just feel… stuck.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Bradlee. Feeling stuck is a very common feeling, and wanting to regain your quality of life is a perfectly valid reason to explore options like bariatric surgery. It’s good you’re recognizing this and taking steps to address it. Let's gather some more information. Could you tell me roughly how long you've been experiencing these difficulties—getting around, bending over, and feeling limited in your activities?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s been… gradual, you know? It's not like one day it just started. But if I had to guess… probably the last five years or so? It’s definitely gotten worse in the last two or three, though. Like, noticeably harder each year. It's just… slow, but steady. Does that make sense? I'm not good with timelines.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Bradlee. Gradual changes are often harder to pinpoint. Five years with a noticeable increase in the last two or three – that’s helpful information. Now, let’s talk a little about your weight history. Have you tried to lose weight before?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Lots of times. Diets, exercise… I’ve tried a bunch of stuff. My wife is always finding new things. Some worked for a little while, but I always ended up gaining the weight back. It’s… frustrating. I’d lose ten pounds, feel good for a week, and then boom, it’s all back plus more. It just feels… hopeless sometimes. I think that’s why we’re here, honestly. I just don't seem to be able to do it on my own.
DOCTOR: I understand that frustration completely, Bradlee. Many people struggle with long-term weight management, and it’s discouraging to put in effort and not see lasting results. It takes courage to acknowledge that, and it’s smart to explore other options. To get a better picture, could you tell me roughly what your highest weight has been, and what your current weight is?
PATIENT: Um… my highest weight… I think it was around 280 pounds? Maybe a little more? It was a while ago. And right now… I think I’m around 250? Something like that. I haven't weighed myself in a few weeks, to be honest. My wife keeps track of it more than I do. I’m not great with numbers, as you can tell.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Bradlee. Numbers aren’t everything, and it’s good you have your wife supporting you. So, around 280 pounds as a highest weight, currently around 250. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I don’t think so… I mean, the doctor checks my blood pressure every year, and it's usually a little high, but he says it's okay with medication. And… I think my cholesterol is a little high too, but again, it’s managed with pills. Other than that… I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. I get headaches sometimes, but everyone gets headaches, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of slightly elevated blood pressure and cholesterol, both managed with medication. And occasional headaches. That’s good information to have. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… besides the blood pressure and cholesterol pills… um… I take a multivitamin sometimes, when I remember. And… my wife gives me something for my joints, I think? It’s a little orange pill. She says it helps with the pain. I don't really know what it is, exactly. I let her handle most of the medication stuff. I’m terrible with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Bradlee. It’s helpful to know you’re taking a multivitamin occasionally and something for joint pain. We can sort through all of this later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Not that I know of, anyway. I've never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks when she fills out forms, and I always tell her no. So… I’m pretty sure I don't have any allergies. I'd probably know if I was allergic to something, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, you would, Bradlee. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have conditions like diabetes, heart disease, obesity, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My dad had heart problems, I think. He had a bypass surgery when he was older. And… my mom had diabetes, I think. Type 2, maybe? She was always getting her blood sugar checked. And… my older brother is pretty overweight, but he doesn't really talk about it. Other than that… I don't really know much about my family history. My parents aren't around anymore, and I haven’t seen my brother in a while. It’s not something we really talked about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart disease in your father, diabetes in your mother, and obesity in your brother. That's helpful information. Finally, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My wife wouldn't allow it. She’s very health-conscious. And I try to stay active when I can, but it’s getting harder these days. I used to go for walks with the kids, but… well, it’s just difficult now.
DOCTOR: That's great, Bradlee. No tobacco use is excellent. And it’s understandable that staying active is more challenging as things get harder. Alright, thank you for answering all those questions. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just the basics – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, feel your abdomen, and check your height and weight to confirm what you’ve told me. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust you, Doctor. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat here, we’ll get started. Okay, your height is 155 centimeters, and your weight is 139 kilograms. That confirms what we discussed. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Abdomen is soft, mild tenderness in the upper quadrants, no masses or organomegaly appreciated. Blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg. Okay, Bradlee. Everything sounds pretty stable, but the blood pressure is a little elevated, as expected. The mild tenderness in the upper quadrants could be related to dietary habits, or potentially some mild inflammation. We will need to run some blood tests to get a better picture.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Blood tests… My wife is going to be happy I’m finally getting things checked out. She's been wanting me to do this for a while. What kind of things will the tests show? Will they tell me if I'm… healthy enough for the surgery?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what the tests will help us determine, Bradlee. Your wife sounds very proactive, which is great. We’ll be looking at a comprehensive metabolic panel – that checks your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. We’ll also check your lipid panel – that’s your cholesterol levels – and a complete blood count, which checks your red and white blood cells. We’ll also run a thyroid stimulating hormone test. And we'll check your vitamin D levels. These tests will help us assess your overall health, identify any underlying conditions, and determine if you’re a good candidate for bariatric surgery. It’s important to make sure you don’t have any contraindications, and to optimize your health before proceeding with any major procedure. Do you have any questions about any of these tests?
PATIENT: Wow, that’s… a lot. Kidneys, liver, blood sugar, cholesterol… It’s all a bit overwhelming. Not really, I guess. I mean, I trust you to know what you're doing. I just… I just want to feel better. What happens after the tests? How long will it take to get the results? Will I need to see any other doctors?
DOCTOR: I understand it's a lot to take in, Bradlee. Don't worry, we'll go through everything step-by-step. It's my job to make sure you understand everything. The blood tests should take about 24-48 hours to come back. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. We’ll go over each result, explain what it means, and decide on the best course of action. Depending on the results, you might need to see a few other specialists before we can proceed. For example, if we find any underlying heart conditions, we’ll refer you to a cardiologist. Or if you have any digestive issues, we might refer you to a gastroenterologist. We'll also need a psychological evaluation to assess your readiness for surgery, and a consultation with a registered dietitian to help you prepare for the dietary changes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. A lot of appointments, but I guess that’s what it takes. Psychological evaluation… that’s good, actually. I might need someone to talk to about all this. My wife is great, but she’s already doing all the planning. So, 24-48 hours for the blood tests… and then we’ll schedule another appointment? I’ll just wait for you to call? Is there anything I need to do before the next appointment? Like, fast or anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly right, Bradlee. A thorough evaluation is crucial to ensure your safety and success. And you’re right to be prepared, so good on you for asking. For the follow-up appointment, you don't need to fast. You can eat and drink normally. The lab will give you specific instructions about any preparations needed for individual tests if applicable, but generally, there’s nothing you need to do beyond showing up for the tests themselves. We’ll call you as soon as the results are back and schedule the appointment. We’ll also send you information about the other specialists you might need to see. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve explained everything really well, Doctor. I appreciate it. I just… I’m glad I finally came in. I’m hoping this will actually help me feel better. And thank you for being so patient with me. I know I’m not very good with details. I think… I think I’ll just wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bradlee. It was my pleasure. And don’t worry about the details – that’s what I’m here for. I’m optimistic that we can find a solution that will help you feel better. I understand it’s a big step, and I’m here to support you throughout the process. Alright, well, I'll let you get going. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day, Bradlee.
