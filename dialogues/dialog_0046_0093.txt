DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, honestly, it's… a bit of a blur, trying to remember exactly why I booked this. Something about not sleeping well and feeling… less than peak, I suppose. My wife usually handled all this sort of thing. It's been… a while. But I think I read something about optimizing things? Fitness and sleep, yeah. That sounds right. I just want to feel… normal again, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s very common to feel overwhelmed, and it’s completely fine that you’re not entirely sure what prompted the appointment. We can certainly explore both your sleep and overall well-being. So, you mentioned not sleeping well and feeling “less than peak.” Let's start with the sleep. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Right, the sleep. It's... patchy. I wake up a lot. Not necessarily fully awake, just… aware. And then it takes ages to get back under. Used to be, I could fall asleep standing up, practically. Now? Forget it. I toss and turn, think about… stuff. And then I'm just… tired all the time. Not like physically exhausted, just… drained. I don't even know when it started, to be honest. Probably after… well, you know. It all sort of blurs together. I don't really do routines anymore, either. Not like I used to.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some significant disruption to your sleep, and it’s understandably impacting your energy levels. It's also common for life events to affect sleep patterns, and it sounds like you've been through a difficult time. When you say you wake up a lot, roughly how many times would you estimate per night?
PATIENT: Ugh, estimating… that’s… difficult. It’s not like I’m counting sheep or anything. Probably… three or four times, at least. Sometimes more. And it's not always at the same time, either. It could be an hour after I fall asleep, could be right before I wake up. Honestly, it’s just… frustrating. I used to be a very… disciplined person. Everything had its place, its time. Now… It’s just all a bit messy, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can appreciate how disruptive and frustrating that must be, especially if you're accustomed to a more structured routine. Waking up frequently throughout the night can certainly leave you feeling drained. To help me get a better understanding of what might be going on, let's go through a quick review of your overall health. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the sleep disturbance?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, I've been a bit… forgetful, I suppose. More so than usual. I mean, I always had a terrible memory, but now it’s… worse. I leave things lying around, forget appointments… small things, mostly. And I haven't really had much of an appetite lately. Not that I need to eat much, really. I’ve lost a bit of weight, probably. Not trying to, just… not hungry. Oh, and my back aches sometimes. Just a dull ache, nothing major. I’m an old man, what do you expect? But yeah, those are probably the main things. Nothing… dramatic.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Forgetfulness, decreased appetite with weight loss, and back pain – those are all helpful pieces of information. And it’s good you’re acknowledging them. While back pain is common, we’ll want to explore the other symptoms in more detail. Before we move on, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… right. Honestly, I’m a bit hazy on the details. My wife, she handled all that. I think… high blood pressure, maybe? Years ago. They put me on some pills for a while, but I think I stopped taking them eventually. And… I had some trouble with my heart, once. A bit of an irregular heartbeat. They did some tests, said it wasn't anything too serious. Other than that… not really. I've always been a fairly healthy person, all things considered. Or, was a fairly healthy person. It's all a bit… muddled. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Redfern. It’s very common for patients not to remember all the details of their medical history, especially if it was managed by someone else. We can access your electronic health record here to fill in some of those gaps. Okay, it looks like you were diagnosed with hypertension approximately five years ago, and you were prescribed lisinopril. It does appear you were discontinued from the medication about two years ago. And there is a note about occasional episodes of atrial fibrillation, which were managed with monitoring. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Surgery… hmm. Let me think. I broke my arm when I was a kid, does that count? Nothing major. No, I don’t think I’ve ever had a proper surgery. Hospitalized… yes, once. A few years back, for the heart thing. They kept me in for a couple of days, ran some tests, gave me some pills. Nothing too serious, like I said. It was all… a bit of a blur, to be honest. I mostly remember my wife being very worried. It's funny, I can remember the smallest details about building instruments, but medical stuff… just vanishes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant surgeries other than a childhood arm fracture, and one hospitalization for atrial fibrillation. That's helpful. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… right. My father… he had heart trouble. Serious heart trouble. Had a bypass when he was in his sixties. And… my mother, she had diabetes. Type 2, I think. She wasn't very good at looking after herself. And… my uncle, on my mother’s side, he had cancer. Lung cancer, I believe. Smoked like a chimney, that one. Other than that… not that I recall. My family wasn't really one for talking about their health, to be honest. It was always a bit… taboo, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart disease, diabetes, and lung cancer. That’s good information to have. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… I used to have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. But not anymore. Not since… well, not for a while. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested in any of that. I spend most of my time in my workshop, building and repairing instruments. It keeps me busy. It’s the only thing I really enjoy anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no drug use. That’s helpful to know. Finally, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had any serious reactions to anything. I can’t say I’ve ever been particularly careful about checking ingredients or anything. Maybe a bit of a runny nose sometimes, during pollen season. But nothing major. Honestly, I’m not really one for paying attention to that sort of thing. I just figured I wasn't allergic to anything. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly fine, Mr. Redfern. It’s not uncommon for patients to not be aware of specific allergies. Okay, so no known allergies. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. I mean, I’m not doing much good just sitting here. Hopefully, you can figure out what’s going on. Just… try to be gentle, alright? I haven’t been examined in a while.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will. I’ll do my best to make you comfortable. We'll start with your vital signs: blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 145 over 90. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Your heart rate is 78 and regular. And your temperature is normal at 98.6. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm and a faint murmur. This is something we'll need to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, but I do notice some slight distension. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes and neurological function. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength and sensation are intact. Overall, the exam reveals elevated blood pressure, a slightly irregular heart rhythm, a faint murmur, and mild abdominal distension. These findings warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Distension… that doesn’t sound good. What does it mean? Is it serious? I told you I hadn’t been feeling right. My wife would have known what to do. What kind of tests do I need? And… will they be painful? I’m not good with… procedures.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Redfern. It’s natural to feel anxious when you’re unsure about what’s going on. The distension simply means your abdomen is a little bit swollen, which can have several causes, most of which are not immediately serious. However, it’s important to investigate to determine the underlying reason. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. Second, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte levels. Third, an EKG to further evaluate the irregular heart rhythm I detected during the exam. And finally, a chest X-ray to rule out any lung abnormalities. The blood tests involve a simple blood draw, which may cause a brief, mild discomfort. The EKG is a painless procedure where we attach small electrodes to your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. And the chest X-ray is also painless, it just involves standing in front of a machine for a few seconds. None of these tests should be overly uncomfortable. Would you be comfortable with proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… right. It’s always tests. I suppose I don’t really have a choice, do I? Better to know, I guess. Yeah, go ahead. Do them. The sooner we figure out what’s wrong, the better. Just… let me know if anything’s going to hurt, alright? I really don't like surprises. And… can I get the results quickly? I don't want to be left hanging for weeks.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Redfern. I understand your anxiety, and I’ll do everything I can to ensure you’re comfortable throughout the process. I’ll order the tests right away, and the lab technician will explain the procedure to you in detail. We typically receive the results within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll personally review them as soon as they become available and contact you to discuss them, regardless of the findings. I’ll also explain the results in detail and discuss any further steps that may be necessary. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, for now. Just… thank you. For listening, I mean. It’s been a while since someone actually… listened. I’ll try not to worry too much, but… it’s hard. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Redfern. It’s perfectly understandable to want to feel normal again. And it's absolutely not too much to ask. We’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and help you feel better. I'll have the lab technician come in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, please feel free to relax. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask. Thank you for coming in today, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon.
PATIENT: .
