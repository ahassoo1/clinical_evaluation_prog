DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Right, well… it’s my head, mostly. I’ve been gettin’ these headaches. Pretty bad ones, they are. And… I get really sweaty when they happen, and my heart kinda races, you know? It’s been goin’ on for a bit now. Honestly, I can’t really say how long. It feels like… a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches… and associated with sweating and a racing heart. And you said “a while” – can you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics… that’s tough. It feels like… maybe a few months? Or is it longer? It comes and goes, see? Not every day. Definitely not every day. Sometimes weeks between them, sometimes… not as long. It’s all a bit blurry, to be honest. Sorry, I'm not much help with dates.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few months, intermittent. That’s helpful. And can you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe them… They’re… throbbing, mostly. Like a really bad pressure, all over my head. Sometimes it feels like it's behind my eyes. And bright lights… they don’t help, that’s for sure. Makes it worse. It kinda feels like… everything’s just too much, you know? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Throbbing, pressure, behind the eyes, worsened by light. Okay. Have you noticed anything that triggers these headaches?
PATIENT: Triggers… Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I mean, sometimes they just… happen. I haven’t been doin’ anything different, not that I can recall. Work’s the same, I haven’t been stressed any more than usual, I don’t think. I used to drink a fair bit of coffee, but I cut back on that a while ago, tryin' to be healthier and all. Didn't seem to make much difference either way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other symptoms along with the headaches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, like I said, the sweating and the racing heart. Sometimes I feel a bit… sick to my stomach when one’s comin’ on. Not always, but sometimes. And I get really tired afterwards. Just… wiped out. It's like it takes all the energy outta me. That can last a good part of the day.
DOCTOR: Nausea, fatigue post-headache… Okay. Have you tried anything to treat them yourself?
PATIENT: Yeah, I’ve taken some over-the-counter painkillers, you know, like ibuprofen. Sometimes they help a bit, but not always. And I try to lie down in a dark room. That usually helps a little with the light sensitivity. But honestly, it’s kinda just… wait it out, most of the time. I haven't found anything that really stops ‘em.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to go through some basics… any fever, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking with these headaches?
PATIENT: No… no fever, I don't think. Vision… hmm. Not that I've noticed. Everything looks normal. Weakness… no, not really. And I can talk alright, can’t I? No numbness either. Just the headache, the sweaty feeling, and the heart racing, mostly. It's been… well, it’s been a bit worryin’, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And regarding your medical history… any past illnesses, surgeries, or injuries I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… past illnesses… not much, really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playin’ around. Had it in a cast for a while. And I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox and all that. No surgeries. And… honestly, I can’t really remember anything else significant. I've not been to the doctor much over the years. Mostly just for check-ups. Oh, and… I was divorced a couple of years ago. If that matters?
DOCTOR: No, the divorce doesn’t matter directly. Just checking for medical conditions. Any family history of headaches, migraines, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tough one. My… my mum used to get headaches, I think. But she never really talked about ‘em much. And my dad… he was pretty healthy, as far as I know. No one ever mentioned any… neurological problems or anything like that. I wouldn’t say there’s much of a history, no. But I don’t know everyone on my dad’s side, to be fair. He wasn’t around much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don’t smoke. And I used to drink, like I said, but I cut back. Just a few beers on the weekend, now and then. Nothing major. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. Never been my thing. I do have a coffee every morning, though. Like most people, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can take most painkillers alright, like I said. And… no food allergies either. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and never had a problem. I think that’s everything? Is there anything else I need to tell you, Doctor? I feel like I'm forgetting something, but I can’t put my finger on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a quick neurological assessment. It shouldn’t take long. If you could just lie down for me, please?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Happy to do whatever helps. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Pulse is 88, regular. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Reflexes are normal. Now, I’m going to check your cranial nerves. Strength is good in all extremities, sensation intact. No obvious focal neurological deficits. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Some mild tenderness in the neck muscles, but nothing significant. Okay. Everything appears normal on the physical exam, but given your history of headaches, nausea, and racing heart, I want to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your head, just to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Is… is it something serious, Doctor? I mean, you said everything appears normal… Blood tests are fine, I guess. But a scan sounds… a bit worrying. What are you lookin' for exactly? And would it show somethin' if it was serious? I'm probably just overreacting, but… this is all a bit much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Lawther. It’s good that you’re asking questions. The CT scan is mostly a precautionary measure. We're looking to rule out any structural problems – like a tumor or aneurysm – that could be causing your headaches. It's unlikely, but it’s best to be thorough. The blood tests will check for inflammation and other possible underlying causes. It doesn't mean I think it’s something serious, but we need to get a clear picture. We also need to rule out things like sinusitis, which can cause similar symptoms. It's just… a process of elimination. Would you like me to explain the procedure itself?
PATIENT: Okay… a process of elimination. That sounds… reasonable, I guess. Sinusitis… I do get stuffy noses sometimes. Yeah, please explain the scan. I'm a bit nervous about… well, everything. What does it involve? And will it hurt? I’m not good with… confined spaces. Is it like a really big machine? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to get this sorted out, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course. The CT scan itself is very quick, usually just a few minutes. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It doesn't touch you, and you won't feel anything during the scan. It’s not painful at all. There is a small amount of radiation involved, but it’s a very low dose. The technician will be able to see and speak to you throughout the procedure. As for confined spaces, we can discuss options for making you more comfortable if you feel claustrophobic – like an open CT scanner, or medication to help you relax. Results typically take 24-48 hours, but I’ll try to get them back to you as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to order the blood tests and write you a prescription for a stronger pain reliever, something that may provide better relief than over-the-counter medications. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… better. Not touching me is good. And knowing someone can talk to me helps. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours… I can manage that. A stronger pain reliever would be great, thank you. So, what happens after the blood tests? Do I need to come back in, or will you call me? And what if the scan does show something? What are the next steps then? I'm sorry to ask so many questions, but it's just… everything feels a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize for asking questions, Mr. Lawther. That's what I'm here for. After the blood tests, the results will be sent to me, and I’ll review them. I’ll then call you with the results, regardless of what they show. If the scan does show something, the next steps will depend on what we find. We’ll discuss the options together, and I’ll refer you to a specialist – like a neurologist or neurosurgeon – if needed. We’ll create a plan together, and I’ll make sure you understand everything every step of the way. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll print out the orders for the blood tests and the prescription for the pain reliever, and I’ll also give you a referral form for the CT scan. The lab and the scan center are both located nearby. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… a lot better. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a lot calmer, knowing we have a plan. No, I think that’s everything for now. Just… thank you again. It’s good to finally get this looked at. I appreciate your patience with me. I'll get the tests done as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Lawther. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we'll take it one step at a time. Take care.
