DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a test. A drug test, I think? Someone said I needed to come in for one. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I don’t really recall all the details. Something about work, maybe? I operate… big machines, you know. Paving stuff.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It sounds like your employer may have requested a drug screening as part of your work requirements, given the nature of operating heavy machinery. That’s very common for safety reasons. Let me see if I can find any documentation here regarding a scheduled drug test for you. Do you recall who at work mentioned this test to you, or perhaps have any paperwork from them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Paperwork… I doubt I do. I usually just toss things. It was… probably Earl. He’s the foreman. A nice enough fella, but always bustling around. He just said something about needing to get this done, and gave me the address. I’m really not good with remembering names or details, sorry. That’s why I'm here, I guess. To get it over with.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Hughston. It’s perfectly alright. Memory can be tricky. And it’s good you came in to get this sorted out. Okay, I do see a note here from Earl requesting a urine drug screen for you, dated July 28th. It’s listed as a pre-employment screening, though it does specify a return-to-work component as well. Before we proceed, just to confirm, have you had any changes to your medication list recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good, Earl remembered to write it down! Medication… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. I take a little something for my arthritis, but it’s the same as always. Just a little pill in the morning. Nothing new, I promise. Doctor prescribed it ages ago. I really don't take much these days. Trying to stay off things if I can.
DOCTOR: Good. And to confirm, that medication is… what is the name of it, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… It’s on the tip of my tongue. It’s… it starts with a ‘M’, I think. Something about mobility… No, that’s not it. It’s a small white pill. I get it filled at the pharmacy down on Elm Street. I really wish I could remember! I feel silly now.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry at all, Ms. Hughston. It’s perfectly common to have trouble remembering medication names. We can easily look it up. Okay, I see your medication history here at Elm Street Pharmacy. It looks like you’re currently prescribed Meloxicam 15mg daily for osteoarthritis. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh! Meloxicam! Yes, yes, that’s it! Meloxicam. See, I knew it was something with an ‘M’. Thank you, Doctor! That’s a big weight off my mind. I worry about forgetting things, you know. So, is that all you needed to know before… the test?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Hughston. Knowing your current medications is important to ensure the accuracy of the drug screen results. Now, before we proceed with the urine collection, I just want to quickly review a few things. Are you currently experiencing any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, not really. My arthritis acts up sometimes, but it’s pretty manageable most days. Just a little stiffness in the mornings, that’s all. Nothing that keeps me from working, thankfully. I need to keep moving, you know? Can’t sit still for too long. So, what does this test involve exactly? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that your arthritis is manageable. And yes, staying active is important. The urine drug screen is a simple, non-invasive procedure. You will be given a collection cup and asked to provide a sample in a private restroom. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully to ensure an accurate result. We’ll provide you with those instructions in the restroom. The test will be checking for a standard panel of substances, as requested by your employer. Do you have any questions about the process or what the test will be looking for?
PATIENT: A standard panel… No, I don't think so. I don't… do anything like that, if that’s what you mean. Just a little wine with dinner sometimes, if anything. Nothing that would cause any trouble, I hope. Is it a painful test? I don't like needles or anything like that. And where is the restroom?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not. This test does not involve any needles. It's simply a urine sample, as we discussed. You will provide the sample privately, and it will be analyzed in a lab. And no, a little wine with dinner will not cause any issues. We are looking for illicit substances, not alcohol. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. I will have a nurse provide you with the collection cup and detailed instructions. She will also explain the chain of custody process to ensure the accuracy of the results. Are you comfortable proceeding with the test?
PATIENT: Oh, good! No needles, that's a relief. And just a regular urine sample, okay. Yes, that sounds… manageable. A chain of custody… Sounds very official! Yes, let’s get it done. The sooner it’s over, the better. I appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. Where should I go to find the nurse?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse, Sarah, is just outside the door to your right. She’s already aware you’re coming. She will guide you through the process. If you have any questions or concerns at any point, please don’t hesitate to ask her or myself. We're here to help make this as comfortable as possible. After the test, Sarah will let me know when the sample is ready for analysis. The results typically take 24-48 hours to process. We will contact you as soon as they are available. Do you have any questions for me before you proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very patient with me and my… forgetfulness. Thank you, Doctor Solero. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes to mind. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon with the results.
