DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I’m Dr. Voytek. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lennie Tkac. I believe I have an appointment to be cleared for a senior living facility? My daughter set it all up, a very capable woman, she is. I just want to make sure everything is in order before I make any big changes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tkac. Good to meet you too. Yes, I see here your daughter, Sarah, scheduled a pre-admission physical for Willow Creek Senior Living. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, at my age, things aren’t quite as they used to be, naturally. I’ve always been a baker, you see. Worked with my hands my whole life. Keeps a man busy, it does. My knees ache a bit when the weather turns cold, and sometimes my back gets a little stiff, but nothing I haven’t lived with for years. I haven't been seriously sick in quite some time, if that makes sense. Mostly just the usual aches and pains of getting older. I try to stay active, though. Do a little walking when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, aches and pains primarily, especially with the weather. And you said walking when you can. About how much walking are we talking on a typical week?
PATIENT: Not as much as I used to, Doctor. Maybe three or four times a week for about twenty minutes each time. It depends on how I’m feeling, to be honest. If the rain is coming down or my knees are particularly bothered, I’ll take a day off. I used to walk much further, but...well, things change, don't they? I still enjoy getting outdoors when I can, though. Fresh air does a man good. Do you need me to be more specific? I can try to remember exactly how many steps, if that would be helpful.
DOCTOR: No, that gives me a good idea. Three or four times a week for twenty minutes is useful. Now, have you noticed any shortness of breath with that walking, or any chest pain at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no shortness of breath. And thankfully, no chest pain either. My heart feels…steady, I suppose. I haven't had any trouble keeping up with my walking, just a little slower these days. I do get a bit winded if I try to lift something heavy, but that’s just the weight of things, I reckon. Not a heart thing, I don't believe. I had a doctor many years ago who listened to my heart and said it was strong, but that was…a long time ago now. Is that something you would check today?
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll definitely listen to your heart and lungs today. And just to be thorough, can you tell me if you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Sometimes, Doctor. Just a little, at the end of the day. It's not too bad, usually goes down overnight if I put my feet up. My daughter worries about it, tells me to wear support stockings, but they're not very comfortable, if you understand. It seems to be worse if I'm on my feet all day, which, being a baker, happens more often than I'd like. It’s never caused me any real pain, though. Just a bit of puffiness. Is that something I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: It's good that it goes down overnight. Some swelling is common with age and being on your feet, but we want to rule out anything more serious. Alright, let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: Just one, Doctor. For my blood pressure. It’s a small white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. My previous doctor prescribed it a few years back. Keeps things…even, I suppose. I can’t recall the name of it right offhand, but I can have my daughter bring the bottle in next time if you need to know exactly what it is. She's very organized, that girl. No trouble remembering things like that. Do you want me to try and remember for you now, or would it be better to wait?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember right now, Mr. Tkac. Your daughter bringing the bottle in would be great. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. Never had a reaction to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. My wife used to try all sorts of new recipes, and I always happily volunteered as the taste tester. She was a wonderful cook, that woman. Never had any trouble with allergies, though. Not that I recall, anyway. Perhaps my daughter would know if I forgot something? She has a good memory for these things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see...I had pneumonia when I was a young man, back in the army. Spent a week in the hospital, but I recovered fully. And I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that was a simple surgery and I haven't had any trouble since. Other than that, I’ve been remarkably healthy, if I do say so myself. My father lived to be ninety, so I suppose good genes play a part. My mother had arthritis, but that runs in the family, so I figured that was inevitable. Does that answer your question, Doctor? Is there something specific I should be thinking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Tkac. Pneumonia and gallbladder removal noted. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Just a few small things, Doctor. I broke my wrist when I was a boy, fell out of a tree trying to rescue a cat. And I had my appendix taken out when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Nothing major, really. Mostly just bumps and bruises over the years. A baker's life isn't always easy on the body, you know. Lots of lifting and bending. I wouldn't say any of those surgeries were serious, nothing that caused me any lasting trouble. Should I be listing every little scrape and bruise, Doctor? I can try to remember them all, if you'd like.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. Pneumonia, gallbladder removal, broken wrist, and appendix removal is plenty for now. Alright. One last thing before the physical exam. Can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, like I mentioned, my father lived to be ninety. He was a strong man, worked on a farm his whole life. My mother had arthritis, and her mother did too, so it seems to run in the women. My brother had high blood pressure, but he didn't take care of himself like he should have. As far as anything serious, like heart disease or cancer...not that I recall. My parents weren't the type to go to the doctor much, so we didn't have a lot of official diagnoses. Mostly just a good, strong family who lived long lives. Is there something specific you’re looking for? My daughter probably knows more about the family history than I do, she’s always been interested in that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Okay. Alright, Mr. Tkac. Before we proceed with the exam, I want to quickly confirm you are up to date on your vaccinations, specifically your tetanus booster?
PATIENT: Tetanus booster? Hmm...that's a good question, Doctor. I try to stay on top of these things, but it's been a while since I had a doctor keep track of everything. I believe I had one a few years back, maybe five or six years ago? It was at a clinic when I went for a flu shot. But I can't say for certain, truthfully. My memory isn’t what it used to be when it comes to dates and things. Would it be possible to check the records? My previous doctor might have it on file. Or, perhaps, my daughter would know? She’s very organized, you know. Keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. We can certainly check your records, if you'd like. However, it's best to be safe, so I'm going to recommend giving you a tetanus booster today. It's a quick shot, and it's important to be protected. Now, if you’re okay with that, let's get started with the physical exam. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then we'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. If you think it’s best to give me a booster, then I trust your judgment. I’m not one to argue with a good doctor. And yes, please, let’s get started with the exam. I’m ready when you are. I’ve always believed in taking care of oneself, and if a booster is what’s needed, then so be it. Just tell me what to do, and I'll cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. If you could just have a seat here, and we’ll get started. I'm going to take your blood pressure first. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here you are. Be gentle now, my veins aren’t what they used to be. A baker's life, you know. Lots of lifting and kneading. Still, I’m a sturdy man. Do your best.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not drastically so. And your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. In and out…in and out…Is everything alright? Do you hear anything unusual? I’ve always had a strong heart, but one can never be too careful, you know. My father always said, "Take care of your body, and it will take care of you." He was a wise man.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. It could be due to a number of things, like old age or mild congestion. We might want to consider a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture, just to be safe. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you please bend your knees and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray, you say? Very well, Doctor. If that's what you think is best, then I trust your judgment. I’ve always believed in getting a thorough check-up, especially at my age. It’s better to be safe than sorry, as they say. I’m not particularly fond of X-rays, but I’ll cooperate if it means getting a clearer picture of what’s going on. And yes, please, proceed with the reflexes. Do your best. I used to be quite nimble, but I'm slowing down these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age, but they are present and symmetrical. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back down and relax. And can you tell me, have you had any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Bowel habits, you say? Hmm...let me see. No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. Everything’s been…regular, as they say. Perhaps a little slower these days, but nothing I haven’t experienced before. A baker’s life isn’t always kind to the digestive system, you know. Lots of rich foods and not enough roughage. But no major changes, nothing that’s caused me any concern. Should I be listing every little detail, Doctor? I can try to remember if there’s anything unusual, if you’d like.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, Mr. Tkac. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don't feel any masses or abnormalities. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Based on my findings, and your history, I think it’s prudent to order a chest X-ray to investigate those crackles I heard in your lungs. And, since your blood pressure is slightly elevated, we’ll keep an eye on that as well. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A chest X-ray and keeping an eye on my blood pressure…I trust your judgment completely. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. It’s good to know everything is being checked properly. So, what’s the next step? Do I need to schedule another appointment? And will the results be sent to my daughter as well? She’s very involved in my healthcare, you see. A very capable woman, that girl.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll schedule a chest X-ray for you. The radiology department is just down the hall, and they can usually fit you in within the next couple of days. And I'll have the results sent directly to your daughter, Sarah, as well as to my office. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today, so we can discuss the results of the X-ray and check your blood pressure again. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and staying well-hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and patient with an old man like myself. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns and provide such a comprehensive examination. Two weeks for a follow-up, and the results sent to my daughter…that sounds perfect. I’m feeling much better knowing everything is being taken care of. Thank you again, Doctor. You’re a credit to your profession. And one last thing...if it's not too much trouble, could you perhaps write down the names of a few good pharmacies in the area? My daughter handles most of my prescriptions, but it’s good to have a list on hand, just in case.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. I’m glad I could help. Here's a list of pharmacies in the area. Most of them offer delivery services, which might be convenient for you. And don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Alright, then. Have a good day, Mr. Tkac. And please, take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
