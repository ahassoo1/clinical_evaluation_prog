DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Petrimoulx. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, as the paperwork probably says… I’m here for a check-up before a… a surgery I’m considering. It’s cosmetic, and I believe a clearance is needed beforehand. Honestly, I don't recall all the specifics, but my… well, my late husband arranged everything. I’m just following through with it now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-operative clearance for a cosmetic surgery. That's perfectly alright. And you're right to be thorough, even if the details are a bit hazy right now. It’s understandable with everything you’ve been through. To get a better picture, could you tell me what type of surgery you’re considering?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. It’s not coming to me easily. I think… it had something to do with my stomach? Perhaps a tightening? Or… removal of excess skin? It was after a significant weight loss, I believe. My husband… he was very supportive of me getting back to feeling like myself. I’m so sorry, I wish I could be more precise. It feels… distant.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly common to have details blur, especially when dealing with difficult circumstances. “Tightening” or “excess skin removal” after weight loss sounds like a panniculectomy or abdominoplasty – sometimes called a tummy tuck. Is either of those ring a bell?
PATIENT: Abdominoplasty… yes. That sounds right. I think… that was the word he used, actually. Yes! An abdominoplasty. Thank you for prompting me, Doctor. It’s… relieving to finally have a name for it. I was worried I’d be completely unable to explain.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. It's good we clarified that. Now, to make sure you’re a good candidate for the procedure and to obtain that clearance, I'll need to gather some more information. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: That’s… a little difficult. I was generally quite healthy before… before everything. My husband always handled the details of appointments and such. I think… I had slightly elevated blood pressure once, a few years ago, but it was never anything serious, and I don’t recall taking any medication for it. I’m truly sorry for being so vague. Is there a way to perhaps check my records?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mackenzi. No need to apologize at all. It’s perfectly alright. We have access to your electronic health records, and we can certainly take a look to see what information is available. Just one moment… Okay, here we are. It looks like you did have a reading of 138/88 about three years ago at an urgent care visit, which is considered slightly elevated, but there’s no history of a formal diagnosis of hypertension, and it wasn't followed up on. Otherwise, your records are largely unremarkable. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: That’s good to know. No, I haven’t had any other surgeries before. This abdominoplasty would be my first. I… I’ve always been quite lucky, in terms of needing medical intervention. Just the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any other hereditary illnesses?
PATIENT: My mother… she had some heart trouble later in life. It wasn’t anything dramatic, I don’t think, but she did require a pacemaker, eventually. And… my paternal grandfather had diabetes, I believe. Beyond that… I’m afraid I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. My father wasn't one for discussing such things, and I didn't think to ask when I was younger. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing about your mother's heart condition and your grandfather’s diabetes is helpful. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Well… as you can probably gather, I was married for quite some time. My husband passed away about a year ago. Before that, we lived a very quiet life. We didn’t travel much, mostly stayed close to home. I don't have any children. I don’t really have much of a social life these days, to be honest. I prefer to keep to myself.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Mackenzi. That must have been incredibly difficult. And there's no pressure to share anything you're not comfortable with. Now, just a couple more questions to complete the picture. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I always believed in taking good care of my health. My husband encouraged it, as well.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don’t believe so. I've never had any adverse reactions to any medications that I'm aware of. I'm not allergic to any foods, either. I might be slightly sensitive to certain fragrances, but it’s just a mild irritation, nothing serious. I think that’s everything, isn’t it? I apologize again for being so… vague at times. I truly appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. You've been very forthcoming, and we’ve gathered enough information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam just to get a baseline assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I want to be sure everything is as it should be before moving forward with the surgery.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. Your reflexes are normal, and your neurological function appears intact. Finally, I’ll take your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130/82, and your pulse is 78. It's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given your recent loss and potential stress. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Based on what you've told me and the results of the exam, I don't see any immediate contraindications to proceeding with the abdominoplasty. However, I would like to order some routine blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions and ensure you're a good surgical candidate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. Blood work is a good idea, to be certain. Absolutely, please order whatever you deem necessary. I just want to make sure I’m doing everything correctly, and that it’s safe for me to proceed. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. That’s my job. I’ll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a coagulation panel. You’ll receive instructions on where to get the blood work done. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and finalize the pre-operative clearance. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything I’ve been wondering. I’m very grateful for your patience and understanding. It means a lot to me, especially given… everything. I believe I’m ready to proceed with the blood work, then. Just let me know when and where to go. Thank you again, Doctor Petrimoulx.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. My staff will contact you with the details regarding the blood work and your follow-up appointment. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Thank you for choosing our clinic, and I look forward to seeing you at your next appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and professionalism. Have a wonderful day.
DOCTOR: You as well, Mackenzi.
