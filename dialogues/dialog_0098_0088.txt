DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um, well, I've been getting this ringing in my ears. It's been happening for a little while now, and it’s starting to get on my nerves, to be honest. I just want to figure out what it is, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Ringing in the ears… alright. And how long has this been going on for, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... it started maybe... three or four months ago? It wasn't constant at first, just every now and then. But the last few weeks it’s been pretty much all the time. It’s a bit distracting, especially when I’m at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months… and it's become more consistent recently. Can you describe the ringing?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not like a bell or anything. More like a high-pitched whine, I guess? Sometimes it feels like buzzing too. It changes, honestly. Not always the same sound. And it’s mostly in my right ear, though I think I can hear it a little in my left sometimes.
DOCTOR: A high-pitched whine, sometimes buzzing… and primarily in the right ear, occasionally in the left. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question... I work as a waiter, so it's pretty loud at the restaurant most nights. Maybe that? I don't know. I wear earplugs sometimes when it’s really bad, but… I didn’t really think much of it at first. Just figured it was the noise. I don't know if that's connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, working as a waiter in a noisy environment… That's definitely something we need to consider. And you've noticed it's worse with the noise, and you sometimes use earplugs. Have you noticed any hearing loss, any difficulty understanding conversations, particularly in noisy settings?
PATIENT: Hmm... now that you mention it, yeah. It’s a bit harder to hear people when it’s busy at the restaurant. I usually just ask them to repeat themselves, but I’ve had to do that more often lately. I just thought I was tired, to be honest. It's a busy job. I haven't really thought about it being linked to the ringing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the ringing and the difficulty hearing in noisy environments, have you experienced any dizziness, headaches, or any pain in your ears?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No dizziness or headaches. And no pain in my ears at all. Just the ringing and… having to ask people to repeat themselves. It’s mostly just annoying, but like I said, it’s getting worse. I just want to know what’s causing it, if something’s seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, well, let’s take a look at your ears. I want to rule out any obvious issues like an infection or wax buildup. It’s a quick exam, shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Just let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Yeah, I’m happy to get it checked out. Just get it over with, if you don’t mind. I’ve got a shift later.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s see… Your ear canals look clear, no signs of infection or excessive wax buildup. The tympanic membranes look normal as well. No obvious signs of any structural issues. So that’s a good start, rules out some of the more common causes. We’ll need to do a basic hearing test to get a better idea of what’s going on. It’s a quick, non-invasive test. Just wear these headphones, and I’ll ask you to respond when you hear a sound. Do you mind?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds alright. A hearing test is good. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? Headphones are fine. Let’s just get it done. I hope it’s not anything too serious.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll get this done as quickly as possible. It's most likely something we can manage. I’m going to play a series of tones at different frequencies and volumes in each ear. Just press the button whenever you hear a sound, no matter how faint. We'll start with your right ear… Alright, are you ready?
PATIENT: Yeah, I'm ready. Just tell me when to press the button. Let’s get it over with. Hopefully, it won’t take too long. I really need to get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, here we go… Press the button when you hear the tone… Okay, and now for the left ear… Press the button when you hear the tone… Alright, we’re all done. Thank you for your patience. The results show some mild to moderate high-frequency hearing loss in both ears, more pronounced in the right ear. This is consistent with noise-induced hearing loss. Considering your work environment, it's likely the primary cause. It’s not surprising, unfortunately, with prolonged exposure to loud noises. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh. Noise-induced? That makes sense, I guess. I figured it had something to do with the restaurant. So... is it permanent? Is there anything I can do about it? Honestly, I kinda rely on my hearing for work. It's a bit worrying. I don't wanna lose my job over this.
DOCTOR: It’s good that we’ve identified the cause, and it’s certainly manageable. Whether it’s completely permanent… depends on how much further exposure you have, and how quickly we address it. The hearing loss is likely to worsen with continued exposure to loud noises without protection. The good news is, it’s not typically sudden. We can’t restore the hearing you've already lost, but we can prevent further loss. The most important thing is hearing protection. I strongly recommend wearing high-quality earplugs whenever you’re at work. There are also custom-molded earplugs available that fit more comfortably and provide better protection. We can also discuss strategies to reduce your noise exposure at work, if possible. Have you ever had a baseline hearing test before?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Never had one. Just kinda ignored it, to be honest. I just figured my ears were ringing because I was tired. I did try the earplugs at work, sometimes, but… they’re not the most comfortable. Maybe the custom ones would be better. How much do those cost, roughly? And is there anything else I should be doing? Like, any medications or anything? I don't wanna mess around with this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no previous baseline. That’s alright. We’ll use this test as your starting point. As for medications, there’s no medication to cure noise-induced hearing loss. There are some supplements marketed towards ear health, but the evidence is limited, and I wouldn’t recommend relying on those. The most effective treatment is prevention. Custom-molded earplugs typically range from $150 to $300, depending on the material and features. They’re an investment, but they’ll be much more comfortable and effective than generic foam earplugs. I can give you a referral to an audiologist who can take impressions and fit you with a pair. I also recommend avoiding loud noises outside of work as much as possible. If you listen to music with headphones, keep the volume low. And finally, if you notice any sudden changes in your hearing, such as a sudden loss of hearing or ringing in your ears, please see me immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. $150 to $300… alright, I can probably manage that. A referral to an audiologist would be great. And I’ll definitely be more careful about the noise. I do listen to music on my commute, so I’ll keep the volume down. Just… is this gonna get worse even with the earplugs? Like, am I gonna go completely deaf eventually? That's kinda what I'm worried about. I just want to be realistic. I understand you can’t guarantee anything, but… what are the chances? I really rely on my hearing. It's my livelihood.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Jaylyne, and it’s good you’re asking. The chances of complete deafness are relatively low if you take appropriate precautions. The goal with the earplugs is to reduce the amount of noise reaching your ears, preventing further damage. It's difficult to say exactly how it will progress, as it depends on several factors: how much noise you’re exposed to, the quality of the earplugs, and your individual susceptibility. However, with consistent use of hearing protection, we can significantly slow down the progression of the hearing loss and minimize the risk of it becoming severe. We'll monitor your hearing regularly with follow-up tests to track any changes. And we can discuss strategies to reduce your noise exposure at work, if possible. It’s also worth noting there are hearing aids available if your hearing loss does progress, which can help restore your ability to hear. I'm going to write you a referral to a local audiologist, and a summary of our discussion today. I’ll also print out some information on noise-induced hearing loss and hearing protection. Do you have any other questions before we finish up?
