DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is mine. I am here because… well, my ear. It is… leaking. A little bit of fluid comes out. It has been happening for maybe three days now. Not much, but enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: I see. Leaking fluid from the ear for three days. Thank you for letting me know. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the fluid a bit more?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… clear. Not bloody, not… thick. Just… watery. Like water, but… from my ear. It does not smell, if that makes sense. And it happens mostly when I… move my head. Or if I press on it. Gently. Not hard. Just… a little push.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Clear, odorless fluid related to head movement and gentle pressure. Do you have any pain associated with this leakage, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain. Not really. Maybe a… fullness. Like something is inside. But not painful. It is more… uncomfortable. Like when you go up high in an airplane. That feeling. But not so bad. And only sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, fullness, similar to airplane ear, intermittent and not severe. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing, such as muffled sounds, ringing in your ear, or difficulty hearing conversations?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… a good question. I have… not heard as well. Things are… quieter. Not completely gone, but… softer. Like someone turned down the volume. And… sometimes, yes, a little ringing. A high… eee sound. Very quiet, but I notice it when it is… quiet in the house. Like now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Reduced hearing and intermittent high-pitched ringing – that’s important information. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, such as a cold, the flu, or a sinus infection?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I had a bad cold. About one week ago. Very stuffy nose. And a cough. It lasted… maybe five days. I thought it was gone, but… maybe that is connected? I took some medicine from the… pharmacy. For the cough and… the congestion. Over-the-counter medicine.
DOCTOR: That’s quite possible. A recent cold is certainly relevant. Do you recall the name of the medication you took from the pharmacy?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… a blue box. I think it had… "DM" in the name. Something with "DM". And it had a picture of… a nose and throat on it. I am not very good with names. My daughter bought it for me. She usually takes care of those things. It helped the cough, yes. But I do not remember the exact name. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Radillo. It's understandable. A medication with “DM” in the name suggests it contained dextromethorphan, a common cough suppressant. Now, have you experienced any dizziness, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No dizziness. Not sick to my stomach, no. And I have not… thrown up. Everything is… normal in that way. Just the ear. And the quiet hearing. And the little ringing. It is… annoying, more than anything. It makes it hard to hear my favorite radio program.
DOCTOR: I see. No dizziness or nausea. Alright. I'd like to take a look at your ear now, if you don't mind. I'll use an otoscope to examine the ear canal and eardrum. Could you please sit forward slightly?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I will sit forward. Please be gentle. My ears are… sensitive. I hope it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. I see some fluid behind the ear drum, and the ear drum appears to be slightly retracted. There's some mild redness in the ear canal as well. The fluid is clear, as you described. It appears you have a possible middle ear effusion, likely related to your recent cold. This means there is fluid build-up in the middle ear space. This can cause the symptoms you’re experiencing – hearing loss, ringing, and the ear leakage.
PATIENT: Middle ear… effusion? Is that… bad? Will it go away? I do not want to lose my hearing. I enjoy listening to the radio. And talking with my daughter. Will I need… medicine? Or… surgery?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Radillo. A middle ear effusion is common, especially after a cold, and often resolves on its own. It’s not typically serious, but it can be uncomfortable and affect your hearing, as you’ve noticed. Most cases improve within a few weeks with supportive care. We'll start with a "watchful waiting" approach, meaning we'll monitor your symptoms closely. I’m going to prescribe some nasal decongestant spray to help reduce congestion and encourage drainage. I will also recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if you experience any discomfort. Surgery is rarely needed, and we wouldn't consider that unless your symptoms persist for an extended period – typically 3 months or longer. To be on the safe side, I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check your hearing and ensure the effusion is resolving. If your symptoms worsen—if you experience severe pain, high fever, or a significant loss of hearing—please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that is good. And if the pain gets worse, I should call? The… nasal spray. Is it difficult to use? I am not very good with… devices. And what kind of pain are we talking about? Like a… sharp pain? Or just… uncomfortable? I do not want to worry my daughter. She already worries too much.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. The nasal spray is quite simple to use – it's a pump spray, and I’ll have the nurse demonstrate it to you before you leave. It's important to use it as directed, usually two to three times a day for about a week. As for the pain, we’re talking about anything more than mild discomfort. A sharp, throbbing pain, or a pain that doesn't respond to over-the-counter pain relievers, would be concerning. Also, if you develop a fever, notice any drainage from your ear that is bloody or pus-like, or experience any dizziness or balance problems, please contact the clinic immediately. We're mostly looking for signs of a secondary infection. The goal is to prevent that from happening. And, I understand your concern about your daughter. Keeping her informed is good, but we don't want to cause unnecessary worry. We’ll address it as it comes. Does that help clarify things?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… much better. No sharp pain. No fever. And… no pus. I will remember that. And the nurse will show me how to use the spray. Two weeks. I think I can manage that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience. My daughter will be happy to hear it is probably not… serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. We’ll monitor your progress closely. I’ll have the nurse come in to demonstrate the nasal spray and review the instructions with you. She'll also give you a printed handout with the important follow-up information. I'm going to document my findings and recommendations in your chart, and then we'll be all set. Do you have any other questions for me before I finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. Thank you again for your time and your kindness. I will see you in two weeks, then. And I will try not to worry too much.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s all I ask. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Radillo. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions and the medication. Have a good day, and please rest well.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well.
