DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m here. My husband insisted. Something about… settling in? We just moved, you see. And he worries terribly. It’s all rather tedious, if you must know. Do get on with it, please. I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Engelhaupt. A “settling in” visit is perfectly reasonable after a move – just a check-up to make sure everything is alright and to establish care with a local physician. And I understand your time is valuable. Let’s try to be efficient. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with you lately?
PATIENT: “With me”? Goodness. That’s a rather broad question, isn’t it? I’ve been… existing, I suppose. Perfectly normally, as far as I can recall. No complaints, really. Though my knees do ache a bit in damp weather. But that’s hardly a matter for a doctor, is it? It’s just…old age. And frankly, I don’t see what this has to do with anything. Are we quite finished?
DOCTOR: Knee aches in damp weather are certainly worth mentioning, Ms. Engelhaupt. They can be more than just “old age,” and we want to rule out anything that might be contributing to the pain. It's good you brought that up. To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Heavens. I suppose… I had a touch of the flu, oh, must be ten years ago now? And a rather nasty bout of indigestion last spring. But those were… temporary inconveniences. My husband keeps all the papers, you know. He’s terribly organized. I really couldn’t say. I’m quite healthy, as a rule. Honestly, I find all this questioning rather intrusive. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Engelhaupt. It is a lot of questions, and I apologize if it feels intrusive. It's standard practice when establishing care with a new patient – especially one who is new to the area – to gather a complete health history. It helps me understand what’s normal for you so I can better assess any potential problems in the future. Since you mentioned your husband keeps the records, perhaps we can review them together?
PATIENT: Honestly, the very idea! Rummaging through private papers… it’s preposterous. He keeps everything, you see. Bills, receipts, old grocery lists… it’s a dreadful mess. And I certainly don’t have time to sort through it all now. I’m telling you, Doctor, I’m perfectly fine. A little creaky, perhaps, but perfectly… serviceable. Really, this is a waste of both our time. I think I’d like to leave.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Engelhaupt. We don’t need to sort through everything today. However, knowing about any past surgeries, serious illnesses, or medications you’ve taken can be quite important. Perhaps we can try a different approach. Do you recall ever being hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Oh… well, there was that time… a very long time ago. When I was quite young. I broke my arm, I believe. Climbing a tree, it was. Dreadfully foolish of me. But that was… goodness, sixty years ago? More? It hardly seems relevant, does it? I’ve led a perfectly normal life since then. And I assure you, I haven’t been near a hospital since. This is all quite… distressing, you know. I think I need a glass of water.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. I’ll have someone bring you a glass of water right away. And it’s good to know about the broken arm – even if it was a long time ago. It's helpful information. Let’s talk about your family, then. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, my dear, that’s a complicated subject. My mother… passed away, oh, decades ago. A lovely woman, but terribly frail. My father… well, he disappeared during the war. We never knew what happened to him. A very sad affair. Really, I don’t much like dwelling on the past. It’s all rather… upsetting. I’m quite alone now, you see. Except for my husband, of course. But he’s… occupied. With his garden. Are we quite finished yet? I have a luncheon, you know. A very important luncheon.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Engelhaupt. It sounds like you’ve experienced a great deal of loss. Thank you for sharing that with me. Just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Are there any health problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, family health problems? Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the faintest idea. We weren’t a particularly… communicative family. Everyone kept to themselves, you see. My mother… she had a touch of the nerves, I believe. And my father… well, we didn’t see much of him. As I said, it was a rather… solitary existence. Really, I’m quite unable to provide you with any useful information on that topic. It’s all terribly vague. And frankly, I’m beginning to feel quite faint. I really must insist… I need to leave. Now. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Engelhaupt. I understand you’re not feeling comfortable. Given your reluctance to provide a detailed history, and your reported feeling of faintness, I recommend we keep things brief today. I’d like to perform a quick physical exam – just to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be acceptable?
