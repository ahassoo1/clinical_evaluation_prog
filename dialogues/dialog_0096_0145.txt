DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lonell Bahta. I am here… well, to see if my mother is able to receive care at home. A friend suggested I get a certification. She says it will help with… everything. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A certification… to provide care at home?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is correct. She is… older, and needs assistance with many things now. My friend, Madame Dubois, she explained that a form, a certification from a doctor, would allow someone to come and help us at the house. She said it has something to do with… payments, and making sure the care is correct. I am a little confused about the details, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Right. So you want me to certify you to care for your mother at home… so you can get paid to do that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is not quite right. I am not the one who will be providing the care. I work, you see. I am a pediatric surgeon. I simply want to find someone to provide the care for my mother, and Madame Dubois said this certification would help with that. Perhaps I am not explaining it clearly? It is about getting help in the home, with a professional. Not… me receiving payment. I apologize for the confusion.
DOCTOR: A pediatric surgeon… and you’re relying on Madame Dubois for medical advice?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect… my expertise is with children, not with the complexities of elder care and… these arrangements. Madame Dubois has gone through this with her own father. She seemed very knowledgeable. I trust her judgment. I am… not familiar with the process, and frankly, it is a bit overwhelming. I simply want what is best for my mother.
DOCTOR: Very well. It sounds like you're referring to home healthcare services, potentially with some assistance from insurance. This isn’t a “certification” I provide, Mr. Bahta. You need to contact a home healthcare agency. They will assess your mother’s needs and help you navigate the paperwork and insurance requirements. I can certainly document her overall health status for them, but I won't be certifying you to do anything. Do you have any idea what agencies are available in this area?
PATIENT: Ah! Yes, that makes much more sense. Home healthcare agency… that is what Madame Dubois mentioned. No, I do not know of any agencies here. That is why I came to you, Doctor, hoping you could point me in the right direction. Perhaps you have a list of recommended agencies in the rural area? I am truly lost on where to begin. Would you be able to help with that?
DOCTOR: Let me see… in this area, there’s “Comfort Keepers” and “Visiting Angels.” Both are fairly reputable, though I haven’t had extensive personal experience with either one. Frankly, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the individual caregiver assigned. I can print out their contact information for you. Now, to document your mother's health status for the agency, I'll need some information. What are her primary medical concerns?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor, that is very helpful. Both those names are new to me. I appreciate you taking the time to assist me. As for my mother’s health… she is 87 years old. Her biggest concern is her heart; she has congestive heart failure. She also has arthritis, which makes it difficult for her to move around and care for herself. She has some difficulty with her memory lately, as well. She is generally quite frail, and tires easily. Is that the sort of information you need?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a good start. Congestive heart failure, arthritis, and cognitive decline… Alright. Has she been formally diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer’s, or is it just general memory loss?
PATIENT: Doctor, she has not been formally diagnosed with either. We consulted with a neurologist about a year ago, and he said it was likely age-related memory loss, but he did not give a specific diagnosis. He recommended some exercises to keep her mind active, and we have been doing those. She recognizes us, of course, and knows who she is. But she does repeat herself frequently, and sometimes she forgets recent events. It has become more noticeable in the last few months.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, likely cognitive impairment, but no formal diagnosis. Does she have any difficulty with her vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Yes, she does. Her vision is quite poor, even with glasses. She has macular degeneration, the doctor said. And her hearing is also declining. She has a hearing aid in one ear, but she doesn’t always wear it. It seems to bother her sometimes. She often asks us to repeat ourselves, even when we speak loudly. It is… challenging at times.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bahta, it’s good you’re doing these things for your mother. It sounds like she requires a significant level of assistance. Before I document her health for the agency, I need to ask about her medications. Do you have a list of everything she's currently taking?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. My wife, Simone, she is very organized. She keeps a detailed list. Here it is. It includes everything, with the dosages and times. I hope it is legible; Simone’s handwriting can be… small at times. She also notes any allergies my mother has, should that be relevant. Is there anything else you require at this time?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s see… digoxin, furosemide, lisinopril… typical medications for congestive heart failure. She's also on ibuprofen, which is… concerning. We should really avoid NSAIDs in patients with heart failure if possible. I’ll make a note of that. And she has a documented allergy to penicillin. Excellent. This is helpful. One final thing, Mr. Bahta. Has she had any falls recently?
PATIENT: Ah… yes, she had a fall about three months ago. She tripped over the rug in the living room. Thankfully, it wasn’t a serious fall; she only bruised her hip. But it frightened us both greatly. She has been more unsteady on her feet since then. That is why we removed the rugs, and we are trying to assist her as much as possible. Should I be concerned about anything else regarding the fall, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, the fall is significant. A history of falls increases the risk of future falls and potential injury. We’ll need to document that as well. Okay, I think I have enough information now to provide a summary of her health status for the home healthcare agencies. I’ll also include my recommendation that she discontinue the ibuprofen and be evaluated for possible causes of her falls. Is there anything else you would like me to document, Mr. Bahta, before I finalize this report?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, if you wouldn't mind… she is quite anxious, generally. Especially at night. She worries a lot, and it can disrupt her sleep. Perhaps noting that might be helpful for the agency, so they can provide someone who is patient and reassuring. Simone and I worry that someone abrupt or impatient might upset her. That is all, Doctor. Thank you again for your assistance. You have been most helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve added a note about her anxiety and the importance of a patient and reassuring caregiver. I’m also going to recommend a fall risk assessment, if the agency offers that. Okay, I think that’s everything. I’ll print this report for you, and you can forward it to the agencies you contact. Do you have any questions about anything I’ve documented?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is very thorough. No, I don’t believe I have any questions at this time. It all seems accurate. Simone and I are grateful for your time and expertise. I truly appreciate you taking the time to listen to our concerns. We will forward this to the agencies and hope to find someone suitable for my mother. Thank you again, Doctor Burlingham. Have a pleasant day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I hope you find the care you need for your mother. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further concerns. Take care.
