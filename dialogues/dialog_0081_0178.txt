DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's this cough. Been hacking up stuff for… honestly, I’ve lost track. And I’m just tired all the time. Seems like I get a sinus infection every other month, too. It's getting old.
DOCTOR: A cough, fatigue, and frequent sinus infections… Alright. Let’s start with this cough. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. It wasn’t sudden, you know? More like it just… got worse over time. Maybe six months ago? Hard to say exactly. It started out just a little tickle in my throat, especially in the mornings. Now… well, now it's a real problem. I’m coughing up phlegm, and it just won’t quit.
DOCTOR: Six months… and the phlegm is… what color would you describe it as?
PATIENT: Uh… mostly it's clear-ish, but sometimes it gets a little… yellow. Not bright yellow, more… faded, I guess? And it's thicker when I’m actually sick with the sinus stuff. Look, I don't pay much attention to the color, to be honest. It's just… yucky.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. And with these sinus infections – how often would you say you’re getting them?
PATIENT: Like I said, feels like every other month. Maybe not exactly every other, but close enough. Stuffy nose, headaches, the whole thing. I usually just ride it out, take some over-the-counter stuff, but they keep coming back. It's exhausting.
DOCTOR: “Ride it out,” you say. And what over-the-counter medications are you using precisely?
PATIENT: Well, usually just something for congestion… like a Sudafed or… something with a 'D' in it, I guess. I don’t really look at the names, to be honest. Whatever’s on the shelf at the store. And sometimes I’ll take some Tylenol for the headache. I don’t usually bother with the doctor unless it’s really bad.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s… not ideal. Frequent sinus infections, self-treating with varying medications… It makes it difficult to get a clear picture of what's going on. Do you smoke, Mr. Pithan?
PATIENT: No, never have. My grandfather smoked, though. Terrible habit. No, I don't smoke. I spend most of my time at home, honestly. Quiet life.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright. And how about any known allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I get a little itchy sometimes in the spring, but I always figured it was just the pollen. Nothing I ever really bothered getting tested for. I mean, who doesn’t get itchy in the spring, right?
DOCTOR: A fair point. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like asthma, COPD, heart problems, diabetes…?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. Had a bout of pneumonia when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Otherwise, just the usual colds and flu. Nothing serious. I've always been a strong Lakota man, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not that I can recall. Maybe I had my tonsils out when I was little, but it was so long ago I barely remember. Nothing major, for sure. My body’s pretty much all original parts, I think.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my brother had some problems with his knees. But that's about it. Nothing really… serious. We don't talk much anymore, to be honest. Not much of a close family.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed to a physical exam, could you tell me about your current medications?
PATIENT: Like I said, just the over-the-counter stuff when I need it. Tylenol for the headache, the decongestants… nothing a doctor prescribed. I really don't take many pills, Doctor. I like to keep things natural if I can.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick exam. Please step up onto the scale for me. I want to get some basic vitals, listen to your lungs, and take a look at your sinuses.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Get it over with. I have things I need to do today.
DOCTOR: Your weight is 132 pounds. That's... lower than anticipated. Now, if you’ll just stand here, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Breathing sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, with some faint wheezing in the lower lobes. Now, let’s check your sinuses. Tenderness upon palpation of the frontal and maxillary sinuses. Mild erythema noted around the nasal bridge.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. What does that all mean? Don't tell me I got something bad. I just want this cough to go away.
DOCTOR: Well, the diminished breath sounds and wheezing suggest some airway obstruction, possibly due to inflammation. The sinus tenderness is consistent with sinusitis. Your low weight is also concerning, as it could be contributing to your weakened state. However, it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. We need to run some tests. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia or other underlying issues. I’ll also recommend a referral to a pulmonologist for a more thorough evaluation of your breathing.
PATIENT: A pulmonologist? More doctors? This is getting complicated. What kind of tests are these? And how long is this going to take? I got better things to do than spend all day in a clinic.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will give us information about your overall health and whether there’s an infection present. The chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and identify any abnormalities. These are standard procedures to determine the cause of your symptoms. It should take a few days to get the results. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics for the sinusitis, and an inhaled corticosteroid to help reduce inflammation in your airways. It's essential to follow the instructions carefully, even if you start feeling better. Do you have any allergies to medications, particularly antibiotics?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. I've taken antibiotics before, when I was younger. Nothing bad happened. Honestly, I just want this cough gone. And I don't want to feel tired all the time. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the prescription for the antibiotics and inhaled corticosteroid. Take the antibiotics as directed for the full course, even if you begin to feel better, as stopping early can lead to antibiotic resistance. The inhaled corticosteroid you should use twice daily. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review the test results and assess your progress. If your symptoms worsen, or you develop a fever, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I understand. One week. Okay. Look, Doctor, is there anything I can do… like, right now… to help with the coughing? Something besides all these pills?
DOCTOR: While the medication addresses the underlying cause, you can manage your symptoms at home. Drink plenty of fluids – water is best. Avoid irritants such as smoke, dust, and strong fumes. A humidifier can help to loosen the phlegm. And rest. Your body needs rest to recover. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… I really hope these pills work. I just want to feel normal again. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Get some rest, Mr. Pithan.
