DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pipolo. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: My eyes. They just… feel dry. All the time. It’s botherin’ me. Been happenin’ a while now, I guess. Don't know what to do about it.
DOCTOR: “A while now,” you say. That’s… not particularly helpful, sir. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Okay. Maybe… six months? Seven? Time kinda… blends together, you know? Especially when your eyes are scratchin'. It's worse when it’s windy, outside workin’. I work with cement. Makes it dusty.
DOCTOR: Right. Cement work. Dusty. That is relevant. And it's been consistently dry for six or seven months?
PATIENT: Pretty much. Not gettin' better, that's for sure. Sometimes it feels like there’s somethin’ in ‘em, even when I close ‘em. Don't know if that makes sense. I just wanna get rid of the scratchin’.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you tried anything at all to help it?
PATIENT: Tried… uh… I put some water in ‘em sometimes. Just tap water. Don't really do much. My daughter, she told me to get some drops once, a long time ago, but I don't remember what kind. Didn’t seem to help much either.
DOCTOR: Right. Tap water… not recommended, sir. It's got all sorts of things in it that can irritate your eyes further. Any pain, redness, or blurred vision?
PATIENT: Nah, no blurriness. Just… dry. And kinda itchy. Redness… sometimes, maybe? Hard to tell with the dust. Never any sharp pain, thankfully. More like… irritation, you know? Like somethin' is grindin' around in there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you wear any sort of eye protection when you’re working with the cement?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not always. Gotta be honest. It slows me down. And it fogs up. Hard to see what I’m doin’. Old man's problems, I guess.
DOCTOR: Well, sir, it sounds like you've got a classic case of environmental irritation. Working with cement without proper eye protection is almost guaranteed to cause problems. We need to rule out anything more serious, though. Let’s take a quick look at your eyes. I’ll need you to sit up and look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Look at ‘em, you say. Fine. Just get it over with, Doc. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, looking straight ahead… good. Let me examine your conjunctiva… and your corneas. Hmm. Some mild injection—that’s redness—and a little dryness, as you said. No obvious abrasions, which is good. Your pupils are reactive to light, which is also good. But your tear film is definitely… insufficient. It's likely just chronic irritation from the cement dust, but we should be cautious. I'm going to recommend a trial of artificial tears, four times a day. And, and this is important, you need to start wearing proper eye protection when you're working. Goggles, at least. Do you have any allergies, sir?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never been bothered by pollen or nothin’. Always been pretty tough, I guess. But these eyes… they're killin' me. So, the drops… four times a day? Alright. And goggles… I’ll try. Just wanna get back to work. Will these drops be enough, Doc?
DOCTOR: The drops should help with the symptoms, yes. However, without addressing the cause – the dust exposure – they’ll only be a temporary fix. This is for a basic artificial tear. Use it as needed, but aim for four times a day. And seriously, the goggles. Consider it a small investment in your vision. I’m also going to recommend you follow up with me in two weeks if there’s no improvement. If you experience any pain, discharge, or changes in your vision, come see me immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. Goggles… yeah, yeah. Pain… okay, I'll remember. Just… does this mean I gotta stop workin’? I can’t afford to stop workin’.
DOCTOR: No, sir, it doesn't necessarily mean you have to stop working. But you do need to protect your eyes. If you continue working without proper protection, the condition will only worsen, and you will eventually have to stop. Think of the goggles as a preventative measure. They'll allow you to continue working safely. I'm not telling you to stop, I'm telling you to be smart about this. Now, do you understand?
PATIENT: Alright. Goggles. Preventative. Yeah, I understand. Just… a hassle. But... alright. I’ll get some goggles. Two weeks, then. I’ll come back in two weeks. Is that all, Doc? I really gotta get goin’.
DOCTOR: Yes, sir. That will be all for today. Here’s a pamphlet on protecting your eyes in the workplace. Take it. And please, do take this seriously. If you experience any changes in your vision, don’t wait two weeks. Come see me immediately. Have a good day, Mr. Pipolo. .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doc. I’ll… I’ll get the goggles. .
