DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s… nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s about this… certification, you see. Required for my… line of work. Something to do with keeping things up to date, I believe. Honestly, the paperwork these days is quite dreadful. I vaguely recall a notice… a very official-looking notice.
DOCTOR: A certification… right. And is this a medical certification, or something else entirely?
PATIENT: Medical, I presume. It has to be medical. I work… with people, providing… assessments. Yes, assessments. Though, truthfully, I can't quite recall the specifics of why a hearing or eye exam is required. It’s all rather bureaucratic, wouldn’t you agree? I simply received the form and was told to schedule an appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, you received a form requesting a hearing and eye exam. And this is for… work purposes?
PATIENT: Precisely. For work. Though, what work exactly... is becoming increasingly hazy. It involves… competence, I should think. Ensuring I can still perform the assessments. It's a bit embarrassing, to be frank. One expects a certain level of… recall, after all these years. Is it necessary to detail the nature of these assessments, Doctor? It feels rather… mundane, when put into words.
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily. We can proceed without knowing the specifics. Let’s start with a basic hearing screening, then move on to an eye exam. Just to fulfill the requirements of the form, you understand. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. As long as it satisfies whatever governing body requires it. Though, I must say, these procedures… are they quite painless? I have a… sensitivity, you see. Not a fear, precisely, but a… preference for comfort. And how long will this ordeal take? I have a luncheon appointment, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, both are quite painless, Mr. Oriley. The hearing test just involves wearing headphones and responding to sounds. And the eye exam is standard – looking through the machine, reading letters on a chart. I estimate it will take about thirty to forty-five minutes, total. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with the hearing test, shall we?
PATIENT: Thirty to forty-five minutes… hmmm. Very well, Doctor. But do ensure the headphones are… comfortable. And the room is adequately ventilated, naturally. I dislike feeling… constricted. Lead on, then. Though I still maintain this whole process is rather… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. Please, have a seat in here. I’ll explain everything as we go. The headphones are adjustable, and I can adjust the ventilation as needed. Just let me know if anything is uncomfortable. We’ll just do a quick screening to meet the requirements of the form, alright?
PATIENT: A booth… rather… isolating, isn’t it? But very well. Do proceed. I trust this isn’t one of those… trick tests? I’ve heard rumors of such things. And please, speak clearly, Doctor. My hearing, while generally adequate, isn’t what it once was. Although, frankly, what is these days? Proceed. But do hurry, if you would be so kind.
DOCTOR: No trick tests, Mr. Oriley, I assure you. Just a simple screening. I'll be speaking clearly. I’m going to put the headphones on, and you’ll hear a series of beeps. Just press the button when you hear a beep. It’s alright if you miss some – just do your best. Ready when you are.
PATIENT: Very well. Beeps, you say? Hmm. A rather… primitive method, wouldn't you agree? But proceed. Though if this becomes… unduly stressful, I reserve the right to… discontinue. Begin, then. But do make it swift. I have a rather important luncheon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Oriley, I'm starting the test now. Just listen for the beeps and press the button whenever you hear one. Don't worry about missing any, just focus on responding when you do hear them. …Good. …Okay. …Alright, just a few more. Okay, Mr. Oriley, that concludes the hearing screening. Let's move on to the eye exam now. Could you please come out of the booth when you're ready?
PATIENT: Finished, then? Rather… exhausting, all those beeps. Though I suppose I responded adequately. Now, this eye exam… is it also going to involve… irritating noises? My nerves, Doctor, my nerves. Proceed, but do be gentle. And please, a comfortable chair. This whole ordeal is quite… taxing. .
DOCTOR: No irritating noises this time, Mr. Oriley. Just looking through the machine. And yes, please have a seat. We’ll just check your vision and assess your eye health. Alright, if you could look straight ahead… I'm going to put this device close to your eyes. Just relax and focus on the letters I show you.
