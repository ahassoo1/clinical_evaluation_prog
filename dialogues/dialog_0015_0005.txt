DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I’m Dr. Trestrail. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lennie Tkac. I am here today because I am looking into moving to a senior living facility, and they requested I get a check-up first. Just to make sure I am fit enough, you understand. A formality, really.
DOCTOR: A pre-placement physical, alright. Perfectly understandable. Though, even a “formality” is important. We want to get a complete picture of your health. Let's start with the basics. Can you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, at my age, things aren't quite what they used to be, naturally. But I’ve been quite fortunate. I still bake every day, you see. Keeps my hands busy and the mind sharp. I don’t get sick often, a cold now and then, but nothing serious. My bones ache a little in the cold weather, but I suppose that’s just part of getting older. I walk most days, not long distances, mind you, but enough to keep moving. I eat pretty well, mostly. I try to avoid too much sugar, though my sweet tooth does get the better of me sometimes. Is that the sort of thing you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: It’s a start, Mr. Tkac. It’s good to hear you remain active. However, "mostly" and "sometimes" aren’t very helpful for a medical assessment. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, you are right to ask for specifics. I suppose I ramble on a bit. Let me see… The doctor back home – Dr. Henderson, good man – he told me years ago my blood pressure was a little high, but it wasn’t anything that needed medicine, he said. Just to watch my salt intake, which I do. And my knees… arthritis, he called it. That’s why I don’t walk too far. Everything else… I don’t recall anything major. I’ve never been one for taking a lot of pills, if I could avoid it. I've had the usual things, a bad flu here and there, but nothing that lingered. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure, managed with diet, and arthritis in the knees. We’ll need to check your current blood pressure and assess the extent of the arthritis. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never any surgeries. I’ve been very lucky in that regard, thankfully. Not a fan of knives, you see. My mother always said a good life meant avoiding the doctor as much as possible, and I’ve tried to live by that. Though I understand times have changed, and sometimes they are necessary. But thankfully, I’ve not needed them. I broke my wrist as a boy, climbing a tree – a foolish thing, really – but it healed on its own. No surgery required.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, a healed wrist fracture. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My mother… she lived to be quite old, nearly ninety, but she suffered from… well, she called it the “shaking sickness.” I believe it was Parkinson's, though we didn’t have doctors out on the reservation when I was a boy who could say for sure. My father… he died young, from a fever. Pneumonia, I think. And my older brother… he had a bad heart, died in his fifties. That’s about all I recall. There weren’t many of us, and we weren’t much for talking about illnesses, to be honest. It was considered bad luck, you see. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of Parkinson’s in your mother, early heart disease in your brother. And you mentioned your father died of pneumonia. That gives us something to work with. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a single pill. As I said, I try to avoid them if I can. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, as the sun isn't as strong then, but that's all. I believe in letting nature take its course, mostly. I've always found a good night's sleep and a healthy diet to be the best medicine. Though I do enjoy a slice of pie now and then, as I mentioned. Perhaps that's why I don't need any pills!
DOCTOR: No medications, just vitamin D occasionally. And pie. Very well. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I am aware of. I've eaten all sorts of things over my eighty-one years, and never had a reaction. My mother raised us on wild berries and game, and you learn pretty quickly what doesn't agree with you. I’ve never been stung by a bee, nor have I ever had trouble with any sort of plant. I am quite fortunate in that regard, I believe. Does that conclude the questions, Doctor? I am happy to answer anything else you may need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. That's a good starting point. Now, I need to perform a physical examination. It’s standard procedure for a pre-placement assessment. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, assess your reflexes, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. I understand. That is perfectly alright. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I have nothing to hide. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable in any way. I am an old man, you know. Bones aren't as forgiving as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. This will be quick. Relax your arm. Deep breath in… and out… again… Good. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear, but breath sounds are a little faint. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. A little achy, perhaps, from age, but no sharp pain or tenderness. I've had a full life, you see. Lots of hard work. Perhaps that's why it aches a bit. It's a good ache, if that makes any sense. Please, don't hesitate to let me know if you feel anything unusual. I’m quite used to being poked and prodded, but I am an old man, as I said.
DOCTOR: Now, let's check your reflexes… Left leg… Good. Right leg… A little diminished, but still present. Alright, now let's take a look at these knees… There’s some crepitus, and the range of motion is limited. Tenderness here… and here… Yes, there’s definite tenderness along the joint line. Alright. A little swelling present. I’m going to need to order some X-rays of both knees.
PATIENT: X-rays, you say? That sounds… sensible. I suppose that's what you doctors do. I didn’t expect them, but if that’s what you need to see what’s going on inside, then I trust your judgment. I haven’t fallen or injured them recently, if that’s what you’re wondering. Just the usual aches and pains of old age, I presume. When can we expect the results, Doctor? And will it be painful?
DOCTOR: The X-rays themselves are not painful, Mr. Tkac. It’s a quick procedure. As for the results, the radiologist will need to interpret them, which usually takes 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I’d like to order some blood work as well. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. Just to get a baseline. We need to rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Blood work, too? You are thorough, Doctor, I must say. Very thorough. No, I don’t think so. I trust your judgment, as I’ve said. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid panel… you name it. Whatever you need to do. Will I need to fast for the blood work? And where will I be going for that? Perhaps I can schedule it for tomorrow? I am a fairly early riser, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours prior to the blood draw. No food or drinks other than water. And yes, you can schedule it for tomorrow. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They’ll need a requisition form from me, which I’ll send over. Once we have the results from the lab and the X-rays, we can discuss a plan. It’s likely we’ll need to address the arthritis in your knees with physical therapy, and possibly some pain management strategies. Here’s the form for the lab. They will call to schedule an appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… that sounds sensible as well. I've always been a firm believer in keeping active. No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything. You are very thorough, and I appreciate that. I trust your judgment, and I’ll go to the lab tomorrow as you instructed. Thank you for your time and your attention to my concerns. I feel much better knowing I am being taken care of. I suppose I’ll see you again once the results are in?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tkac. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day. And try to take it easy. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I will. And thank you again for everything. .
