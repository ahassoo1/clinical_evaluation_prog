DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… it’s about my coloring, really. I seem to be… yellowing. It’s quite unsettling, and my daughter insisted I come in. She says it’s something to do with my liver, but I… I don’t quite recall everything. It's been a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yellowing, you say. I see. That is… concerning, certainly. And you attribute this to a possible liver issue, based on your daughter’s observation?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. She mentioned something about… hepatitis? Or something similar. I’ve had… issues with my liver in the past, I believe. Though the details… they escape me. It was quite a long time ago. I just want to know what’s happening now, if you can tell me. And hopefully, it’s not… too serious.
DOCTOR: Hepatitis is a possibility, yes. And a history of liver issues… that is relevant. However, simply stating a past history isn't sufficient for proper assessment. I’ll need to gather some more information. Let's begin with the present illness. When did you first notice this yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes, of course. Details… It was… perhaps a month ago? No, maybe a little longer. It started subtly, I think. I dismissed it at first, thinking it was just the lighting, or perhaps something I ate. But it’s become more noticeable, and my daughter, bless her heart, really insisted I see someone. I wish I could be more precise, but my memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. Memory can be… unreliable. A month ago, you say. And has this yellowing been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, I believe. Yes, it hasn’t faded at all. It seems to be… worsening, if that makes sense. Though, again, it’s difficult to say for certain. I haven’t been carefully observing it. Mostly, I just try not to look in the mirror too much. It’s rather upsetting, you see. And I've been feeling… rather tired lately. But I attribute that to my age, mostly.
DOCTOR: Tiredness is a common symptom at your age, certainly. However, we must rule out other possibilities. Has this tiredness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. My appetite hasn’t been very good, I suppose. I don’t have much of a thirst, either. And… oh, my stomach feels a bit… uncomfortable sometimes. Not exactly pain, more of a… fullness. It’s hard to explain. Everything feels rather… off, to be honest. I haven't noticed anything particularly alarming, but I'm glad my daughter pushed me to come in. She's very sensible, that girl.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite, no thirst, and abdominal discomfort. Very well. Now, Ms. Durig, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your stool color?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting, thankfully. And… stool color? I… I don’t believe so. Everything seems normal in that regard. I haven't paid much attention, to be honest. I'm not one to… examine those sorts of things. It's rather unpleasant to think about, really. I’m sorry if that sounds… indelicate. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Durig. Changes in stool color can indicate liver or gallbladder issues. Pale or clay-colored stools, in particular, are cause for concern. But since you haven’t observed any changes, we will proceed with other questions. Have you had any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now that might be something. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes… they feel a bit looser than they used to. Not a dramatic amount, mind you, but noticeable. It’s not like I’ve been trying to lose weight, that’s for sure. Just… less appetite, I suppose. Everything seems to be connected, doesn’t it? This whole situation is rather unsettling. I just want to know what’s happening and what can be done about it.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss. We are gathering enough information to warrant a more thorough examination, Ms. Durig. Before we proceed with the physical exam, let’s briefly discuss your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a particularly strong reaction to anything. Perhaps a slight sniffle with certain pollens, but nothing serious. I don’t take any medications regularly, either. Just a little something for my arthritis when it flares up, but that's it. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. I’ve always been rather healthy, all things considered. Until recently, of course. This whole business is quite a shock.
DOCTOR: Very well. No known allergies or regular medications. Now, have you had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me think… Years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. A very long time ago, when I was much younger. And… oh, I was hospitalized once for a bout of pneumonia, but that was decades ago as well. Nothing else significant, I believe. It was all so long ago, it’s difficult to recall the specifics. I hope that’s helpful. Is there anything else you need to know? I’m starting to feel a bit… tired, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Durig. Thank you. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. I will listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen to assess for any tenderness or enlargement of the liver or spleen. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. An examination. Very well. I hope you don’t mind my age. It makes things… a bit difficult sometimes. Please, proceed. I trust you know what you’re doing, Doctor. I just want this to be over with, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. I’m noting some mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Your liver feels slightly enlarged, though not dramatically so. Your lungs sound clear, and your heart rate and rhythm are normal. Based on your symptoms and this preliminary examination, it appears we need to investigate the possibility of a liver issue further. I'm going to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a liver function panel, and a bilirubin level. We will also need to get a CT scan of your abdomen to visualize your liver and surrounding organs. This will give us a more definitive understanding of what is happening and allow us to formulate a proper treatment plan. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood tests and a scan? That sounds… rather involved. Will these tests be painful? And… how long will it take to get the results? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good with medical procedures. They always make me anxious. And… is it serious? You’re not telling me something, are you? I just want to know what's wrong, and what can be done. Please don't use complicated words, if you don't mind. I get lost so easily.
DOCTOR: The blood tests are relatively straightforward, Ms. Durig. A small sample of blood will be drawn from your arm. There may be a brief, mild discomfort, but it is generally well-tolerated. As for the CT scan, it is a non-invasive imaging procedure. You will lie on a table, and a machine will take pictures of your abdomen. It does not involve any needles or injections. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Regarding your question about the seriousness of the situation… it is too early to make a definitive diagnosis. The symptoms you are experiencing – the yellowing, the fatigue, the abdominal discomfort – can be indicative of a liver problem, but they can also be caused by other conditions. We need to run these tests to determine the underlying cause. I understand your anxiety, Ms. Durig. I will explain everything to you in detail once we have the results. We will proceed cautiously and methodically. Do you have any immediate concerns about undergoing these tests?
PATIENT: No injections… that's good. And you say it could be other things… that's… somewhat reassuring. But a liver problem… what does that even mean? Is it… curable? Or is it something… serious? My daughter always worries so much. She's the sensible one, you see. She'd want me to ask all the right questions. And… what if it is a liver problem? What are the… options? I don't want to be a burden, Doctor. I just want to feel better. Can you at least tell me what we're looking for with these tests? What are the different kinds of liver problems? Please, don't use complicated words. Just… simple explanations. I'm an old woman, Doctor. I don't understand all this medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Durig. Let me explain in simple terms. The liver is an organ that performs many essential functions, including filtering toxins from the blood, producing bile to aid digestion, and storing energy. A “liver problem” can encompass a wide range of conditions. Some common liver problems include hepatitis, which is inflammation of the liver, often caused by a viral infection. There’s also cirrhosis, which is scarring of the liver, typically caused by long-term alcohol abuse or chronic hepatitis. And then there’s fatty liver disease, which is an accumulation of fat in the liver, often associated with obesity and diabetes. The blood tests will help us determine if your liver enzymes are elevated, which is a sign of liver damage. They will also help us identify any viral infections. The CT scan will allow us to visualize the liver and look for any abnormalities, such as enlargement, scarring, or tumors. Whether a liver problem is curable depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the condition. Some forms of hepatitis are treatable with antiviral medications. Cirrhosis is often irreversible, but its progression can be slowed with lifestyle changes and medical management. We will discuss all of your options once we have the test results. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Hepatitis… cirrhosis… tumors… It all sounds so… frightening. I haven't touched a drop of alcohol in my life, Doctor. And I've always been careful about what I eat. I just don’t understand… And what about the tests themselves? Will they be expensive? I’m not insured, you see. I'm on a fixed income, and I wouldn't want to be a burden on my daughter. She's always helping me out, but she has her own family to worry about. Can you at least give me an estimate of the cost? And… will they require a lot of follow-up appointments? I don't drive anymore, and it's difficult for me to get around. I just want to know what I’m getting into, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Ms. Durig. It's a legitimate question. Let me see… the blood tests will cost approximately $250, and the CT scan will be around $800. That brings the total to $1050. Unfortunately, I cannot waive these fees. However, our clinic does have a financial assistance program for uninsured patients. I can have our billing department contact you to discuss your eligibility. They may be able to offer a discount or a payment plan. As for follow-up appointments… that will depend on the test results. If the results are normal, you may not need any further follow-up. However, if the results are abnormal, you may need to see a specialist – a gastroenterologist or a hepatologist – for further evaluation and treatment. You would likely need several follow-up appointments with the specialist, as well as potentially some additional tests, such as a liver biopsy. I understand that this is a lot of information to process. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests scheduled. Once we have the results, we can discuss your options in more detail. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: A thousand dollars… That’s… a substantial amount of money. I don't know how I'll manage. My daughter will be worried sick. A specialist… a biopsy… it all sounds so… overwhelming. I just want to feel better, Doctor. Is there anything… anything we can do to avoid all these expensive tests? Perhaps a simpler test? Or a different approach? I know you're the expert, but I'm just an old woman. I don’t want to be a burden on anyone. And… how long will it take to get the results? I'm just so anxious, Doctor. I can't sleep when I'm worried. I just want to know what's wrong, so I can prepare myself. Please.
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, I understand your anxiety and financial concerns. However, I must emphasize that these tests are necessary to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. A simpler test would not provide us with sufficient information to make an accurate diagnosis. Skipping these tests would be irresponsible, and could potentially delay treatment for a serious condition. I am obligated to provide you with the best possible care, and that requires a thorough evaluation. The results of the blood tests typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. The CT scan results may take a few days longer, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. I will contact you as soon as I have the results. I recommend that you contact our billing department to discuss the financial assistance program. They may be able to offer a discount or a payment plan. I can also provide you with a referral to a social worker who can assist you with finding resources to help cover the cost of your care. For now, let's focus on getting these tests scheduled. Do you have any questions about the scheduling process?
PATIENT: Scheduling… yes. I suppose so. But… I don’t drive anymore, Doctor. And my daughter is very busy with her family. She can't always take time off work. Is there… is there anything you can do to help me with transportation? Or… could a nurse come to my home to draw the blood? I just… I don't want to be a burden. I really don't. It's just… everything is so overwhelming. And I'm just an old woman, Doctor. I'm afraid. Please. Is there anything… anything you can do to make this easier for me? I'm starting to feel quite faint, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Here, drink this. Ms. Durig, I understand your anxiety and your concerns. Unfortunately, we do not offer home blood draws. However, I can arrange for a medical transport service to take you to the lab and bring you back home. There may be a small fee for this service, but it should be covered by our financial assistance program. As for the CT scan, you will need to go to a radiology center. I can provide you with a list of centers that offer transportation assistance. I can also contact our social worker to see if she can assist you with arranging transportation. I have already contacted our billing department and social worker on your behalf. They will contact you shortly to discuss your options. For now, let's focus on getting these tests scheduled. Do you have any questions about the scheduling process?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… that’s very kind of you. To contact them for me… it takes a great weight off my mind. Scheduling… yes. I suppose so. But… could you please… just tell me one thing? Based on what you've seen, and what I’ve told you… do you think it’s serious? Just a simple yes or no, if you don’t mind. I need to prepare myself, you see. And I’m afraid to ask my daughter, in case it’s bad news. Please, Doctor. Just a simple yes or no. It would mean a great deal to me. I’m starting to feel quite unwell again, to be honest. Perhaps… perhaps I should just go home and think about it. I can always reschedule, can’t I?
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, I understand your anxiety and your desire for a simple answer. However, it would be irresponsible of me to provide you with a definitive diagnosis without a thorough workup. A “yes” or “no” answer would be speculative and could potentially cause unnecessary alarm. Based on your symptoms, further investigation is necessary. Until we have the test results, I cannot determine the severity of your condition. I strongly advise you to proceed with the scheduled tests. I understand that this is a stressful situation, but it is important to gather all the necessary information before making any assumptions. I am here to support you throughout this process. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Now, shall we proceed with scheduling the tests?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Schedule the tests. I suppose I have no choice. But please… please be gentle with me. And… please contact my daughter. She’s the sensible one. She’ll know what to do. Just… please. Let me know as soon as you have the results. I’m starting to feel very faint again. And… thank you, Doctor. For everything. I’m not sure I could have gotten through this without you.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Durig. I am scheduling the blood tests for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. And the CT scan will be scheduled for the following day at 10:00 AM. I have already contacted your daughter to inform her of the appointment times. She will be responsible for arranging transportation to and from the lab and radiology center. I will contact you as soon as I have the test results. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
