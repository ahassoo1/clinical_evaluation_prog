DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… it’s my legs, dear. They bother me something awful at night. Cramping, mostly. Just… ache and pull up, you know? It’s been going on for… well, a good while now, I reckon. I don’t rightly remember when it started, but a good while.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Bilstein. Leg cramping at night, has been going on for a “good while.” I understand. Can you tell me a little more about the cramping?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Where to begin? It’s… in both legs, usually. Sometimes just one, but more often both. It’s not a sharp pain, not like a broken bone or anything. More like a… a tightening. A pulling. It wakes me up, you see. I have to… I have to stretch them out. And sometimes, just rub them. It helps a little, but it always comes back. I don’t know what sets it off. I just… feel it start. It’s a nuisance, more than anything. A very stubborn nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright, a tightening and pulling sensation in both legs, mostly at night, waking you up. Stretching and rubbing provides some relief, but it returns. And it seems to come on without any specific trigger you’ve noticed. Now, just to get a better picture, can you describe where in your legs you feel the cramping?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It… it’s hard to say, exactly. It's not always in the same spot. Sometimes it’s in my calves, you know, the back of my lower leg. And sometimes it’s higher up, in my thighs. And… and occasionally, even in my feet. It's never in my knees, though. Never in my knees. It just… moves around. Makes it hard to pinpoint, really. Is that… helpful? I’m afraid my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Bilstein. It's good to know it moves around – calves, thighs, sometimes feet, but not your knees. And don't worry about your memory; we'll take our time. Now, have you noticed anything that makes the cramping worse?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think… Worse? Hmm. Well, I don’t know if this makes sense… when I’ve been sitting for a long time, it seems… more likely to happen. Like if I’m visiting with someone, or… watching television. And… and if I’m cold, that doesn’t help. Cold feet, cold legs… it just feels… tighter. I don’t know if that’s just me being old, though. I do seem to feel the cold more these days. I can't rightly say what causes it to be worse, just that those things seem to be connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, so prolonged sitting and being cold seem to be associated with the cramping. That’s good information. Now, thinking about your overall health, do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Well, I’ve got a bit of… arthritis, I suppose. In my hands, mostly. Makes it hard to do some things, like… knitting, which I used to love. And… and my blood pressure, the doctor told me, was a little high a few years back. But I don’t take any medicine for it, he said it wasn’t bad enough to worry about. Other than that… I’m pretty sturdy for my age, I always thought. I try to stay active, you know? Walking when I can. But, truthfully, I haven't been to a doctor in a long time. A very long time. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It is important to know, Ms. Bilstein. Thank you for telling me. So, arthritis in your hands and a history of slightly elevated blood pressure. No current medications. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A very long time ago. And… and I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist. Fell off a horse, you see. A very silly thing to do. But other than that… no. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Kept out of trouble, mostly. Though that horse incident was a bit of a fright. It happened before your time, I’m sure. A very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child and a broken wrist from a fall. No other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, are there any medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That's a hard question, Doctor. My family… well, we weren't ones for talking about such things. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her heart, I remember. But I don't know what kind of trouble. And my father… he just… got old, you see. A slow fading. Nothing sudden. My brother… he had diabetes, I think. But I don't know much about it. We weren’t close, my brother and I. It’s all a bit hazy, truthfully. I'm afraid I can't be much help with family history. Is that… alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Bilstein. It's common for family medical history to be unclear. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take anything… well, I don’t take much of anything these days, but I never have had an allergy. I used to help my mother with her garden, you see, and I handled all sorts of plants. Never a problem. I’m a sturdy sort, I always thought. Though, I suppose anything is possible. But no, not that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Not a one. I don't believe in taking pills if I can avoid it. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, but that’s about it. And I stopped that last year, I think. I just… prefer to let nature take its course. I used to make my own remedies, you see, from herbs and plants. But I don't do much of that anymore. My hands aren't what they used to be. No, I don't take any medicine at all. Just a little bit of sunshine when I can get it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein. No current medications. Thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your circulation and reflexes in your legs. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just tell me what to do. I’m a bit of a nervous patient, you see, but I’ll try my best to cooperate. Just be gentle with my old bones, if you would. I don’t want to break anything!
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bilstein. I’ll be very gentle. First, let’s just check your pulses in both legs. Please lie back comfortably. Okay, your pulses are present and equal in both legs. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, but symmetrical. Range of motion is a bit limited, but I don’t notice any significant pain with movement. I also note some mild swelling in both ankles. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I just hope I don’t make a fuss. I've never been very good at lying still. My heart… it used to be stronger, I reckon. But I haven't had it checked in a long time. Do you think it's alright? I do get a little breathless sometimes, just walking up the stairs. Is that… something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and I hear a very mild murmur, which is common with age and often doesn’t cause any problems. Your lungs sound clear. The breathlessness you mentioned is something we should keep an eye on, but it’s not immediately alarming. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing nighttime leg cramps, possibly related to reduced circulation and some mild swelling in your ankles. The diminished reflexes could also be playing a role. It’s important to rule out other potential causes, however, given your history of breathlessness and slightly elevated blood pressure. I'd like to order a couple of blood tests, including a basic metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. We should also check your Vitamin D level, since you haven't been taking supplements. And I think an EKG would be a good idea, just to assess your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That sounds… thorough, Doctor. A lot of tests! But… if that's what you think is best, then yes, alright. I trust your judgment. I just… I hope it's nothing serious. I'm not a fan of needles, you see. But if it will help me figure out what's going on, then I'll do it. Just… be gentle, if you would. And tell me what all those tests mean, afterwards? I don't understand much of that medical jargon, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bilstein. I understand your concerns. We’ll take it one step at a time. The blood tests are just to get a better overall picture of your health and rule out any underlying causes for the cramps and breathlessness. And I will absolutely explain everything to you in plain language – no jargon, I promise. The EKG is a quick and painless test – just some stickers on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t involve any needles. In the meantime, there are a few things you can try at home to help manage the cramps. Make sure you’re staying well-hydrated throughout the day. Before bed, try gentle stretching of your calf muscles. And if you feel a cramp coming on, try massaging the affected muscle and walking around if possible. We can also discuss potential medication options if these measures aren’t enough. I'll get the lab orders entered now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… helpful, Doctor. Stretching and massage. I can manage that. And I'll try to drink more water. I do get a bit forgetful, you see, and sometimes forget to drink enough. Um… yes, I do have a question. About the… the medication. What kind of medication are we talking about? And… and are there any side effects? I don’t want anything that will make me feel… drowsy, or confused. I like to keep my wits about me, you see. And… and are these tests covered by… by insurance? I don't have much money, you see.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Bilstein. We would likely start with a low dose of quinine or magnesium, depending on the results of your blood tests. Both are sometimes used to help prevent nighttime leg cramps. Quinine can have some side effects, including nausea and dizziness, so we would start with a very low dose and monitor you closely. Magnesium is generally well-tolerated, but can sometimes cause diarrhea. We would discuss the risks and benefits of each option before starting anything. As for the tests, unfortunately, because you don't have insurance, you will be responsible for the cost. I'll have the billing department contact you with a breakdown of the charges. We can also explore options for financial assistance programs if needed. I understand this is a burden, and we’ll work with you to make it as manageable as possible. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more tailored treatment plan. Do you have any other questions before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That… that’s a lot to think about. Financial assistance… I’ll have to see what I can do. I don’t have much savings, you see. And… and I’m a bit worried about the side effects. Nausea and dizziness… I don’t think I could handle that. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now, Doctor. Just… please be gentle with me. And… and explain everything clearly. I don’t want to feel confused or overwhelmed. I suppose… I suppose I’m ready for the nurse now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bilstein. I will absolutely be gentle and explain everything clearly. I'll be right here if you need anything during the blood draw. Don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you're feeling uncomfortable. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. And please, take your time. There’s no rush.
