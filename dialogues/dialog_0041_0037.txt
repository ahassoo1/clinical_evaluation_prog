DOCTOR: Hi Margret, welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It is… the breathing. I have been… how you say… wheezing. It makes it hard sometimes, especially when I walk.
DOCTOR: Okay, wheezing, trouble breathing, especially with walking. I see. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It began… maybe two months ago? At first, it was just a little bit. I thought it was just from the garden, maybe some dust. But now… it is more. It happens even when I am resting sometimes. Not always, but… more often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started about two months ago, initially mild and possibly related to gardening, and has gradually worsened, even occurring at rest sometimes. And when you say wheezing, can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, it is… a whistling sound. When I breathe out. Like a little tea kettle, almost. And my chest feels… tight. Not painful, but… squeezed. It is difficult to explain. I am sorry. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, actually. A whistling sound on exhale, a tight feeling in your chest… that gives me a good starting point. Do you notice anything that makes it worse besides walking?
PATIENT: Yes. When it is cold. Very cold air… it makes it much worse. And sometimes… when I am lying down flat. I have to use more pillows. It is better when I sit up. Does that make sense? I do not know if that is important.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Margret. Cold air and lying flat… those are important clues. Now, have you had a fever, cough, or any swelling in your ankles or feet recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever. A little cough sometimes, but not much. Mostly just the wheezing. And… no swelling. My feet are fine. I check them every day, you know, for problems. Old habits from being an athletic trainer. We always looked for swelling.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the feet, and no fever is reassuring. Let's talk a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like asthma, bronchitis, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I had a bad flu when I was younger, but that is all. And my blood pressure… it goes up sometimes, the doctor says. But I take pills for it. Nothing else, I think. I had a very strong heart when I was training athletes, you know. But that was a long time ago. I divorced many years ago, and haven't been to the doctor much since.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of the flu, and you manage your blood pressure with medication. That's helpful. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, if you remember?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… it is a small white pill. I take it every morning. I believe the doctor said… Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril, I think that is it. And a small dose. I do not remember the number. I am sorry, I am not very good with names and numbers these days. I just take it like the doctor tells me.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Margret. Lisinopril is good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any trouble with that. I eat everything. I like spicy food, even! My ex-husband… he was very careful about his food. I am much more relaxed. I never had a reaction to any medicine, as far as I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, if that's alright. And I'll check your oxygen levels with a little clip on your finger. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. My chest feels a little tight, but I can manage. Please, do what you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Great. Just breathe normally. Okay, I do hear some wheezing on both sides, especially when you exhale. It's definitely present. Your heart sounds regular, and your oxygen level is 92%, which is a little low, but not critically so. I'll document that. Now, let's just check your ankles for any swelling, if you don't mind.
PATIENT: Yes, please do. No problem at all. I always check them myself, like I said. But a second opinion is always good. It is reassuring. My feet are fine, I think. A little bit of veins, but no swelling. I used to be very strict with my athletes, you know. Always looking for the smallest changes.
DOCTOR: You're right, no swelling, and your pulses feel good. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve heard and seen so far, it sounds like you might be experiencing a flare-up of asthma, or potentially some chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD. The wheezing, the tightness, worsening with cold air and when lying down… all point in that direction. But we'll need to do a little more to be sure. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a spirometry test – that’s a breathing test where you blow into a tube to see how well your lungs are working. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A chest X-ray… and a breathing test? Is it… serious, Doctor? I have never had those before. I do not like the sound of it. But if you think it is best… yes, I suppose so. I trust your judgement. Just… please explain everything clearly, okay? I do not understand all of the medical words.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Margret. I'll explain everything clearly. It’s not necessarily serious, but we need to figure out what’s causing your breathing problems so we can treat it properly. The chest X-ray is just a picture of your lungs, like a photograph, to see if there's anything obvious going on. No pain involved, just standing still for a few seconds. The spirometry test is like blowing into a straw. You take a deep breath and blow as hard as you can into a tube. It measures how much air you can get out of your lungs and how quickly. It helps us see how well your airways are working. It's a little tiring, but not painful. It sounds more intimidating than it is, I promise. We can do both tests right here in the clinic. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… that sounds a little better when you explain it like that. Not so scary. Yes, I think I can manage that. If you say it is important. And if it is just like blowing into a straw… well, I used to yell at my athletes all the time, so I am good at blowing! Yes, let's do the tests. I trust you, Doctor. Just… please tell me everything you find, okay? And explain it slowly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Margret. I will explain everything thoroughly, and we'll take it one step at a time. Let me just get the orders entered for the X-ray and spirometry. The technician will come in shortly to get you started. Then, once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: No, I think I am alright. Just a little nervous, maybe. But I am glad I came. Thank you, Doctor. Perhaps a glass of water later? But for now… no, thank you. Just let me know when the technician is ready. I will try to take deep breaths. Like you said.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll let you know as soon as the technician is ready. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if you're feeling anxious or short of breath at any time. I'll be just outside if you need anything.
