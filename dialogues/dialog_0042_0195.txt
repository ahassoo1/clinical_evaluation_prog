DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… alright to meet you, I suppose. Honestly, it’s a bit silly, really. My daughter, she thinks I need a little… pick-me-up. She says I’m being a bit down, and she wants you to write me one of those cards. A “Get Well” card, even though I'm not sick sick. Just… low spirits, she says. Honestly, young people these days… always fussing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very thoughtful of your daughter to be concerned, and it’s certainly not silly to want to feel better. It takes courage to come in and talk about feeling low, so thank you for coming in. So, let's talk about these "low spirits," as you call them. Can you tell me a little more about how you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it’s just… everything feels a bit gray, you know? Not bad, exactly. Just… nothing really sparkles anymore. I used to enjoy my garden so much, but even that feels like work now. And I bicker with my husband more. Little things, really. He leaves his slippers everywhere. It’s always been slippers, but now it annoys me, proper annoys me. It’s not like I want to be grumpy, but I can’t seem to help it. Honestly, I think I’m just getting old. Everything loses its shine, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you're experiencing a loss of enjoyment in things you used to love, and a bit of increased irritability. Those are important things to talk about, and it’s good you’re recognizing them. It’s true that things change as we get older, but it doesn’t necessarily mean we just accept feeling this way. To get a better understanding, could you tell me how long you’ve been feeling like this – this “grayness” and the increased annoyance?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. It didn’t just happen overnight. Probably… six months, maybe? It started around the winter, I think. Everything was cold and damp, and I didn't get out much. I just… stayed inside more. And then it just sort of… stayed that way, even when the weather got better. My daughter, she keeps saying it's the “season,” but it’s August now! It’s supposed to be cheerful! Honestly, she reads too many of those internet articles. Everything's a “condition” these days.
DOCTOR: Six months is a significant period of time. And you're right to point out it’s August – it’s reasonable to expect things to feel a bit brighter. It's helpful to know it seems to have started around the winter months. Now, thinking back over those six months, have you noticed any other changes besides the loss of enjoyment and the increased irritability?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don’t really crave anything anymore. I used to love making daal, you know, proper spicy daal, but even that seems like… effort. And I’m sleeping… too much, maybe? Not that I can't fall asleep, but I wake up feeling tired. And, oh! I forget things more easily. Not important things, thankfully. Just… where I put my glasses, or what I was going to say mid-sentence. My husband teases me about it, says I’ve always been a bit scatterbrained, but it’s a bit more than usual, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Reduced appetite, increased sleepiness, and some difficulty with memory – those are all things we need to consider. It sounds like this is impacting more than just your mood, which is important. Now, to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… Honestly, I've been pretty lucky. Nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was a girl, that’s about it. And a bit of arthritis in my knees, but I manage it with turmeric and ginger, mostly. I don’t go to the doctor much, never have. I don't like all the poking and prodding. I used to be very strong, you know. Worked in the factory for years, assembling… well, it doesn't matter what. It was hard work. And I’ve never smoked, and I only drink a little bit of rakshi on special occasions. My husband, he has high blood pressure, but he takes his medicine. That’s about it, really. Nothing exciting. I'm a simple woman, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know. No major medical history, a bit of arthritis managed with natural remedies, and no smoking or heavy drinking. That’s excellent. And you mentioned your husband has high blood pressure. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just the turmeric and ginger, Doctor. And sometimes a little bit of ibuprofen for my knees when they're acting up. But not regularly, maybe once a month, if that. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I prefer natural remedies, you know? My grandmother always said turmeric is good for everything. She lived to be ninety, so she must have known something. And my daughter keeps trying to get me to take vitamin D, says I’m not getting enough sunshine, but I tell her I get plenty when I’m in the garden. Though, admittedly, I haven’t been in the garden much lately…
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional ibuprofen for knee pain, but otherwise primarily relying on turmeric and ginger. Thank you for sharing that. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or mental health conditions like depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That’s a tricky one. My parents… they both died quite old, of just… old age, really. My mother had a bit of trouble with her memory towards the end, but we didn't talk about these things much back then. My father was a strong man, never sick a day in his life. And my siblings… my brother died in a factory accident when he was young, and my sister… she always was a bit… nervous, I suppose. She worried a lot. She didn’t like leaving the house much. And she did see a doctor for her nerves, back in Kathmandu. But that was a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, everyone just got on with things. We didn’t dwell on illnesses. It wasn't the way we were raised.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Janeth. It sounds like there may be a history of some anxiety and possible memory concerns in your family. It’s helpful to know, even if the details are limited. Now, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Poking and prodding, you mean? Well… I suppose so. If you must. But be gentle, Doctor. I’m a delicate flower, you know. And don’t take too long. I have things to do. Mostly… thinking. Although, admittedly, I’m not thinking much worth thinking about these days. Just… gray thoughts. But still. Don’t keep me long.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janeth. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I’ll keep it brief. Just a few basic checks. Alright, let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation, though breathing appears a little shallow. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not critically high. Reflexes are a bit diminished bilaterally. Balance appears slightly impaired. Overall, a bit of sluggishness in reflexes and a slightly unsteady gait, but no major neurological deficits.
PATIENT: Well? What did you find? Am I falling apart? I knew I should have stayed home and had a cup of chiya. At least chiya is comforting. All this poking and prodding is just making me more anxious, you know. Honestly, you doctors… always looking for something wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Janeth, let’s talk about what I found. First of all, you are not falling apart. The exam wasn’t about finding something “wrong,” it was about getting a better understanding of your overall health. Your heart and lungs sound fine. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that’s not uncommon, and we can discuss lifestyle changes to help manage that. What I did notice was some slight sluggishness in your reflexes and a bit of unsteadiness in your gait. It’s subtle, but it’s something we need to take into account. Also, you mentioned difficulty with memory and a reduced appetite, along with feeling tired and sleeping more. Taken together, these symptoms – the low mood, loss of enjoyment, sleep changes, memory difficulties, and physical findings – suggest a few possibilities. One possibility is simply a natural adjustment to getting older, but given the length of time you’ve been feeling this way, we need to rule out other causes. Have you ever been evaluated for depression?
PATIENT: Depression? Me? Depression? Honestly, Doctor, I'm a practical woman. I have things to do. I look after my home, I help my husband. I don’t just sit around feeling sorry for myself. My grandmother used to say a strong cup of chiya can cure anything. And hard work. That's what cures things. Not… wallowing. Honestly, all these modern labels… everyone’s got a “condition” these days. But… I suppose I have been feeling a bit… down. And forgetful. But that’s just old age, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly valid to feel skeptical about labels, Janeth, and I understand your perspective. It's also very true that hard work and a strong sense of purpose are incredibly important. And you are right, some changes in mood and memory are normal with age. However, the symptoms you're describing – the prolonged low mood, loss of enjoyment, sleep changes, and memory difficulties – are more significant than what we’d typically expect with normal aging. They could also be a sign of something else, like a vitamin deficiency, a thyroid problem, or, yes, depression. It doesn’t mean you’re “wallowing” or that you’re not strong. It simply means your brain chemistry might be a little off balance, and there are things we can do to help restore that balance. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some basic blood tests. We can check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and other common markers. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… More poking and prodding? Honestly, it never ends with you doctors. But… I suppose… if it will get rid of this grayness. If it will make me feel like myself again. And if it will stop me from snapping at my husband over his slippers. He’s been giving me funny looks lately. So, yes. Blood tests. But promise me it won’t take all day. And promise me you won't find anything too awful. I don't want to be a bother to anyone.
DOCTOR: I promise, Janeth. The blood tests shouldn’t take long at all – just a few vials of blood. And I understand your concerns. We’re just gathering information to see what might be going on, and we'll discuss the results thoroughly. We’ll do a complete blood count, check your vitamin D level, thyroid function, and a basic metabolic panel. I’ll also include a B12 level, as deficiency can cause similar symptoms. I'll give you a lab requisition now. You can go to the lab at [Clinic Lab Address] anytime that’s convenient for you. They’ll send the results to me, and I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’d like to suggest a few things you can try. Have you considered any gentle exercise, like walking?
PATIENT: Walking… I used to walk, in the garden. But the garden doesn’t feel… appealing lately. Everything feels like effort, you know? And my knees aren’t what they used to be. But… I suppose I could try. Just a little bit. Maybe around the block. But it won’t be a long walk. And I won’t be pushing myself. Just… a little bit. And what else? You mentioned exercise. Is that all? Honestly, I thought you doctors would have more… miraculous cures. Some kind of magic potion, perhaps? Or a special tea? Anything to get rid of this grayness.
DOCTOR: I wish I had a magic potion, Janeth! Unfortunately, there's no quick fix. Gentle exercise is a good starting point. It releases endorphins, which can improve your mood and energy levels. Another thing that can be helpful is social interaction. Are you spending time with friends or family?
PATIENT: Friends… Not much, lately. My friends, they all live far away, in Kathmandu. And my daughter… she’s busy with work and her family. We talk on the phone, but it’s not the same. And my husband… well, he’s content to sit and watch television. We don’t really do much together anymore. We’ve been married a long time, you know. Sometimes, I think we’ve just… settled. It’s comfortable, but… Not very exciting. I used to love going to the temple with my friends. We would sing and pray and share stories. But it’s been a long time since I’ve been to the temple. Everything feels… distant.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re missing a sense of connection and community. That’s very understandable, and it can certainly contribute to feeling low. One of the things I often suggest to patients is finding activities that bring them joy and connecting with others who share their interests. It doesn’t have to be anything grand – a simple book club, a walking group, or even volunteering can make a difference. Since you mentioned missing the temple, perhaps you could consider revisiting it, even if it's just for a short visit?
PATIENT: The temple… That… that might be nice. It’s been years. But it’s a bit of a journey, you know. And my knees… But… I suppose I could ask my daughter to take me. She likes going to the temple. And it would be nice to see the old friends. Yes. Maybe I will ask her. It’s worth a try, isn’t it? Well, I suppose that’s enough talking for today. What about these blood tests? Where do I go? And how long will it take? I have things to do, you know. Even if I don’t feel like doing them.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Janeth. It is worth a try. The lab is located at [Clinic Lab Address]. They’re open from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday. You don't need an appointment. Just bring your insurance information – although you mentioned you're not insured, so just let them know that. The blood draw itself will only take about 15-20 minutes. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. I'll give you a call as soon as they're available. Here’s a lab requisition. In the meantime, try to be kind to yourself. And remember, I'm here if you need anything. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very… patient with me, Doctor. Even if I am just an old woman with silly worries. And you didn’t laugh when I said I wanted a magic potion. That’s a good quality in a doctor, I think. Well, I suppose I should be going. I have to make dinner. My husband likes his daal spicy. Even if I don’t feel like making it. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll see you… when the results come back. And… perhaps I will ask my daughter about the temple. It couldn’t hurt, could it? .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janeth. It was a pleasure meeting you. And you’re not silly at all. Take care. .
