DOCTOR: Hi Blain, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. It’s… well, my family. There’s a history, you know? A lot of…problems. My mom, her side…lots of heart stuff. And cancer. It's just… unsettling. I want to make sure I’m not headed that way. I'm probably fine, honestly, but it’d be nice to know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's very responsible of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history like that. It's good you're thinking about this now. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about what kind of heart problems your mother and other family members experienced?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… my mom had…high blood pressure, I think. And then… something with a valve? She had a surgery for it. A few years before… well, before. My aunt, on her side, she had a stroke. And my grandfather… I think it was colon cancer. He didn't… he didn’t do well. It’s all a bit… fuzzy, to be honest. They don’t really talk about it, you know? It’s just…bad vibes. I just know it's a lot. And I’m…slim. I don’t eat much junk, but…still. It worries me.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable – it sounds like a stressful situation, and it’s common for families to avoid discussing difficult health issues. It’s good you’re taking the initiative to get some answers for yourself. Okay, so hypertension, valve surgery, stroke, and colon cancer. That gives us a starting point. And you said you’re slim and don’t eat a lot of junk food – that’s great! Just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your current diet?
PATIENT: Well, I don't really have a diet. I just… eat when I'm hungry. Mostly rice and… chicken, usually. Sometimes fish. I’m not a big fan of vegetables. And I don’t drink soda. I have tea. A lot of tea. Black tea. No sugar. It’s…basic. I’m not a foodie or anything. Honestly, I’m busy. I teach. I don’t have time to fuss with food. It’s fuel, you know? That’s all. And I walk. A lot. To class, around campus. It's not exercise, just…getting places.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily rice and chicken, some fish, tea, and you walk a lot to get around campus. That’s helpful to know. It sounds like you're reasonably active and avoid a lot of processed foods, which is good. Now, let's talk a little about you specifically. Have you been experiencing any symptoms at all that are concerning you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I get tired, sometimes. But that’s just…teaching. You’re on your feet all day, explaining things to… well, let’s just say not always the most engaged students. And I get headaches, occasionally. Stress, probably. I don’t feel… sick, if that makes sense. Just…normal tired, normal stressed. I'm not short of breath or anything dramatic. I'm not… dropping dead, obviously. I just want to stay that way. Not dropping dead, I mean. It's preventative, okay? I don’t have a problem, I just don't want one.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. You're feeling well currently, but you're proactive about checking things out, which is excellent. No shortness of breath, no dramatic symptoms, just fatigue and occasional headaches related to stress. That's good information. Now, have you had any significant medical issues in the past – any surgeries, hospitalizations, or chronic conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing cricket. But that’s it. A cast, a sling, that was it. No allergies, either. And I’m up to date on… whatever shots you need. I went to college, I had to get them. That's about it. Perfectly boring, medically speaking. Honestly, I’m surprised I’m even here talking about this. It’s… unusual. I just… my aunt was saying… she got some tests, and it made me think. I don’t want to end up like… them. It’s just… better safe than sorry, right? I just wish this didn't take all day.
DOCTOR: You’re right, better safe than sorry is a good approach. And it’s good your aunt prompted you to get checked out. You've had a broken arm as a child, no allergies, and you're up to date on vaccinations – that's all very helpful to know. No chronic conditions, no surgeries – perfectly boring medically speaking, as you say! Okay, one last quick thing about your background. Are there any medications you currently take, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don't take anything. I tried… something for headaches, once. Aspirin, I think. It didn't work, and it made my stomach feel weird, so I stopped. I'm not a pill person. I'd rather… deal with it, honestly. Tea is enough. I really don’t believe in… loading up on chemicals. It’s… unnatural. That’s it. No pills, no potions, no supplements. Just… tea. And maybe a headache now and then. Are we done yet? I have office hours soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s excellent. No medications or supplements. Just tea and occasional headaches. It sounds like you’re very healthy otherwise, and very mindful of what you put into your body. Alright, Blain. Given your family history, and the fact that you're currently feeling well, I think a basic check-up and some targeted blood work is a good place to start. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then get some blood tests to assess your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. That will give us a baseline and help us identify any potential risks early on. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Yeah, that sounds…reasonable, I guess. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And I don’t have to come back a million times. Is it covered by… Medicare? I just…don’t want any surprises. And can we get the results quickly? I don't want to spend the next month worrying about it. It defeats the purpose of “peace of mind,” you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll keep it as efficient as possible. And yes, Medicare should cover these basic tests – we’ll double-check everything with the billing department just to be sure, and we’ll let you know upfront about any potential costs. As for the results, we typically get them back within 5-7 business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail then, or we can review them over the phone if you prefer. Let’s start with a quick physical exam, and then we’ll get the lab order sent over. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Just… quickly, please. I have a lot to grade. And can I sit? My blood pressure might be high just being here. It’s…a stressful environment. And I don't want a false reading. Honestly, I really don’t enjoy this. It's a waste of time. But okay, let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course. Sitting will definitely help. We can take your blood pressure after you’ve had a chance to relax for a few minutes. No need to rush. Let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are normal, motor function is intact. Everything appears normal so far. Now, I’m going to order some blood work. It’ll be a standard lipid panel, a complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the samples. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, whatever. Fine. Just…don’t poke me too much. And can I have some water afterwards? I always get… lightheaded. Honestly, I really don't enjoy medical procedures. It's just... unpleasant. Just get it over with. Are we almost done? I have a deadline. And I don't want to have to explain this to my department chair. It's just a waste of valuable research time.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And yes, absolutely you can have water afterwards. The nurse will be right in with the water and a small snack for you. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It will take just a few minutes. Once that's done, you're free to go. We'll call you with the results in 5-7 business days. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No. That’s it. Just…get it over with. And please, tell the nurse to be gentle. I bruise easily. Honestly, I really dislike needles. It's... irrational, I know. But yeah. Just… leave me alone now. I'm wasting valuable research time.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll let the nurse know to be extra careful. You just relax, and we'll get this done quickly. .
