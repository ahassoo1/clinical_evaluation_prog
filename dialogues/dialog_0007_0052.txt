DOCTOR: Hi Aurthur, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good to meet ye too, Doctor. Well, it's this mornin' sickness, really. Though I haven't been sick sick, just feelin' awful queasy first thing. It's been happenin' for a few weeks now, and my heart... well, it's not the strongest, ye ken? They told me it was heart failure a while back. Just worried it's somethin' more, or somethin' worse with the heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, “mornin’ sickness” for a few weeks, and you’re concerned it might be related to your heart failure diagnosis. That’s good you're bringing it up. Just to be clear, when you say “mornin’ sickness”, is that how it feels – like nausea, particularly in the mornings?
PATIENT: Aye, exactly that. Nausea, mostly. And it's usually in the mornin', though sometimes it lingers a bit longer than it used to. Not vomitin', thankfully, just... that awful churnin' in yer stomach. Makes it hard to get goin' with the day, ye ken? And it’s worryin’ me because, like I said, the heart… it’s not been brilliant. I always wonder if it's that, or somethin' else entirely.
DOCTOR: Right, nausea, primarily in the mornings, lasting a bit longer recently, and your concern about it being related to your heart failure. I understand. Let's get a bit more detail. When you say it's been happening for “a few weeks,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Aye, I can try. Let me think… it started properly, I’d say, around the 18th of July. Maybe the 20th. It was just a wee bit o’ queasiness at first, easy enough to ignore. But it’s gotten steadily worse since then. Now, it's almost a constant worry, waitin' for it to start each mornin’. I keep a wee calendar, ye see, just to keep track o' things. I’m good with details, always have been.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. July 18th or 20th, starting mild and progressing. And you said it's almost a constant worry, waiting for it to start. Does anything specifically trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… nothin' I've noticed, really. I eat the same breakfast every mornin', porridge mostly. Doesn't seem to make a difference. I've tried havin' a biscuit before gettin' up, just in case it was an empty stomach, but that didn’t help either. It just… comes on. Sometimes it's worse if I've had a restless night, maybe. But even then, it’s not a guarantee. It's just… unpredictable, which is what's worryin’ me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s unpredictable, doesn’t seem tied to food, and maybe slightly worse with a restless night. And you've tried a biscuit with no change. Now, let's talk about your heart failure for a moment. Do you know when you were diagnosed?
PATIENT: Aye, I do. It was… let me think… October of 2021. Nearly four years ago now. The doctor at the hospital told me it was mild at the time, but it’s been… well, it’s been steady downhill, hasn’t it? I’m on some tablets for it, water pills mostly, and somethin' else to keep the heart beatin’ regular. I can tell ye the names if ye need, I remember things like that. But they haven’t seemed to be workin’ as well lately, I don't think. That’s part of why I’m worried about this mornin’ sickness. Could be somethin’ to do with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, diagnosed in October 2021, and you feel the medications aren’t working as well recently. Knowing the medication names would be very helpful, if you don’t mind. And you're right to consider if the nausea could be related. Before we get to that, let's quickly go through some other things. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea?
PATIENT: Aye, no problem at all. The tablets are… Furosemide, that’s one, for the water. And Bisoprolol, that’s the one for the heart beatin’. I take them every mornin', same time. As for other symptoms… well, I get a wee bit breathless sometimes, goin’ up the stairs. That’s been happenin’ for a while, part of the heart failure, I think. And my ankles swell up a bit at the end of the day, though not as bad as they used to. Other than that… no, not really. Just tired, to be honest. But I’m 63, so that could be anythin', couldn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, Furosemide and Bisoprolol, taken every morning. Breathlessness with exertion and some ankle swelling, which you’ve attributed to the heart failure. And fatigue. That gives me a good picture. Now, just to be thorough, have you experienced any chest pain, dizziness, or changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: No chest pain at all, thankfully. I get a wee bit dizzy sometimes when I stand up too quickly, but that’s been happenin' for years, and the doctor said it was just low blood pressure. As for bowel habits… no, not really. Everything’s been regular enough, if ye ken what I mean. Maybe a bit slower than usual, but nothin’ to worry about, I wouldn’t think. I’m sorry, I’m not used to talkin' about these things. It feels a bit… personal.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Aurthur. It is personal, and it takes courage to talk about these things. No need to apologize at all. Okay, no chest pain, dizziness is long-standing and attributed to low blood pressure, and bowel habits are regular. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine. Go ahead. I’m used to bein’ poked and prodded, unfortunately. I just hope it's not somethin’ serious. I’ve got a granddaughter’s birthday next month, and I wouldn't miss that for the world. She's turnin' seven. It's a wee bit of a drive, but I promised her I'd be there.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, we'll do everything we can to get you feeling your best for that birthday. Alright, let’s see… Your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, which is consistent with what you mentioned. I’m hearing some… congestion in your lungs, a bit of crackling, especially on the lower lobes. And your ankles do have some mild swelling, and pitting edema when I press on them. Your heart rate is regular, but a bit on the slower side. We'll need to factor these findings in, along with your history.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… not good, does it? The congestion in the lungs… that's the heart failure, is it? I was worryin' it was gettin' worse. And the slow heart rate… that’s the Bisoprolol, I suppose. I just don’t want to end up in the hospital. I had a wee spell there last year, and it wasn’t pleasant, to say the least. It's a long drive for my daughter to visit, and I don't want to cause her any worry.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, and I understand your worry about being hospitalized. The congestion in your lungs is concerning and suggests your heart failure may be worsening, and the slow heart rate is likely due to the Bisoprolol. However, we need to rule out other possibilities and determine the best course of action. Given your symptoms and examination findings, I'd like to order a few tests. Specifically, a complete blood count to check for infection, a basic metabolic panel to assess kidney function and electrolytes, and a BNP test, which measures a hormone released by the heart when it’s under strain. I’d also recommend an EKG to check the electrical activity of your heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible enough. Tests are always a bit of a bother, but if it'll help figure things out, then go ahead. CBC, BMP, BNP, and an EKG… I’ll remember that. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back again, or will ye be phoning me? I’ve got a bit of a busy schedule, ye see, with the granddaughter’s birthday comin' up. I'm tryin' to build her a wee dollhouse, and I promised her it’d be ready by then. It’s a bit fiddly, but she's been helpin' me with the paintin’.
DOCTOR: That's lovely about the dollhouse! We’ll get this sorted so you can finish it in time for your granddaughter. The lab results usually take about 24-48 hours. I'll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. We can discuss them over the phone, and if necessary, schedule a follow-up appointment. I don't anticipate needing to see you again unless the results are concerning or we need to adjust your medications. I'm also going to write you a prescription to temporarily increase your Furosemide dosage. This may help reduce some of the fluid buildup and ease your congestion, but it’s important to follow my nurse’s instructions carefully. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… a bit better, to be honest. Increased Furosemide… I hope it doesn’t make me need the loo all the time, but if it helps with the breathlessness, then it’s worth a try. And ye’ll phone me with the results? That’s good. I’d rather not have to make another trip here if I can avoid it. Just… make sure yer nurse knows about the birthday, will ye? I don't want to be stuck in the hospital then. I promised her a special day. She's been lookin' forward to it for months.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll make a note of the birthday and ensure my nurse is aware. We’ll do everything we can to get you feeling your best for it. Alright, I’ll get the prescription sent to your pharmacy and have my nurse call you within 48 hours with the results. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – particularly if you experience severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It was good meeting you, Aurthur. And please, enjoy building the dollhouse with your granddaughter.
