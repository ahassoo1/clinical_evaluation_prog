DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astores, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s been getting harder to do things. Not all at once, you understand. Little by little, things feel… weaker. I don’t know how to explain it good. It’s like my body doesn’t always listen to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Little by little” is helpful. Can you tell me more about what specifically is getting harder?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s mostly my legs, I think. Walking… it takes more effort now. And sometimes… sometimes they feel numb. Not all the time, just… comes and goes. And my hands… I used to be able to fix things, work with wood, but holding tools… it’s harder to keep a good grip. It worries my wife, you see. She does so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, legs and hands… increasing effort with walking, numbness in the legs sometimes, and difficulty with grip. When did you first start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It wasn't sudden, you see. Maybe… oh, a couple years ago? It started with just feeling a little tired after walking the dog. Then it got to where I needed to sit more often. I don't remember exactly when, but it’s been a slow thing. Not like I woke up one day and couldn't walk.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of years, gradual onset. And has this been impacting your daily activities significantly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It has. I used to help my wife with the garden, you see. Digging, planting… things like that. Now… now I mostly watch. And I like to go to church with the family, but sometimes the walk is too much. I don’t want to slow them down. It makes me feel… useless, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds frustrating. Now, aside from your legs and hands, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… sometimes my vision gets blurry. Not all the time, and it goes away, but it happens. And… now that you mention it, I get tired easier. Much easier than before. Even just sitting and talking, I feel it sometimes.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision sometimes, and increased fatigue. Okay. And have you had any recent falls, or any problems with your balance?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no falls. I'm careful. My wife would have my hide if I fell! But… my balance isn’t what it used to be, I guess. I feel a little unsteady sometimes, like I need to hold onto something. Especially if I turn my head quick. It’s not bad enough to fall, but… I notice it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little unsteady, especially with quick head movements. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure years ago, but they got it under control with pills. I take those every day. And… oh, and I had a surgery on my knee a long time ago, after a football injury. That was many years back, though. Doesn’t bother me much now, except when the weather is cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a previous knee surgery. The EHR confirms that. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, just the one. Nothing else. And I try to eat good, mostly fish and vegetables. My wife is very good about making sure I eat right. She worries about me, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the one medication. And no known allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with that. I can eat anything. My wife likes to try new recipes, and I always try them.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astores. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll do a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. And finally, I’ll take a look at your feet and legs. It won't take long. Just relax, Mr. Astores. Blood pressure 140 over 80. Not bad, a little elevated, but not concerning. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing. Okay, let's check your reflexes now… Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m trying my best. It’s not as strong as it used to be, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: I see. Grip strength is diminished bilaterally, as you mentioned. Now, I’m going to check your strength in your legs. Can you lift your legs against my resistance?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do it, but it’s harder than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, leg strength is also diminished, but adequate. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Be careful… I might stumble.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. A slightly wide-based gait, and a little unsteady, as you said, but no immediate risk of falling. Alright, Mr. Astores. That's all for the physical exam. Based on what you've told me, and what I found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, possibly combined with some age-related muscle weakness. The unsteady gait and reduced reflexes also point to this. It's hard to say for sure without further testing.
PATIENT: Neuropathy? That sounds… serious, Doctor. What does that mean, exactly? And what kind of testing would I need? Is it something I got from… I don't know… something I did?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious in the sense of being immediately life-threatening, but it’s definitely something we need to investigate. Peripheral neuropathy means there's some damage to the nerves outside of your brain and spinal cord. It can cause weakness, numbness, pain, and difficulty with balance. As for what causes it, there are many possibilities. It could be related to diabetes, which sometimes causes nerve damage, though you didn’t mention a history of that. It can also be caused by vitamin deficiencies, certain medications, or sometimes it just develops with age. It's not necessarily something you did to cause it. To get a better idea of what's going on, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your vitamin levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. I would also recommend an electromyography, or EMG, test. This is a non-invasive test that measures the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves. It will help us pinpoint the location and severity of any nerve damage. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That makes a little sense. Blood tests and… electromyography. It sounds… complicated. But I understand you want to find out what’s causing this. Will the tests hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know what I’m dealing with.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. The blood tests are just a standard blood draw, so there will be a brief pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. The EMG test does involve some small needles inserted into your muscles, but most people don't find it very painful. It can feel a little uncomfortable, like a mild muscle twitch. The whole test usually takes about 30-60 minutes. As for the results, it usually takes about a week to get the blood test results back. The EMG results can take a little longer, maybe 1-2 weeks. Once we have those results, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding any activities that make your symptoms worse. If you're experiencing any pain, over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I understand. No more activities that make things worse, and pain relievers if needed. One or two weeks for the results… That sounds… alright. Will my wife need to come with me to the tests? I don’t think I’d remember all the instructions.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. It’s perfectly fine if your wife comes with you to the tests, and I encourage it if it makes you feel more comfortable. She can help you remember the instructions and provide support. It's often helpful to have someone with you for these things. We can also provide you with written instructions after the appointment. I’ll have my nurse schedule the tests for you before you leave. And I’ll give you a referral to a neurologist, just in case we need further evaluation after we get the results. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. A neurologist… just in case. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for not rushing me. I worry about forgetting things, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. It’s my job to make sure you understand everything, and there's no need to worry about forgetting things. We’ll make sure you have all the information you need. I’ll have the nurse come in and schedule those tests for you now. In the meantime, please take care and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I’ll let my wife know. Goodbye.
