DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. Please tell me, concisely, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to put it simply, I’ve been getting… weaker. And my eyelids, they feel heavy, like they’re drooping. It’s been happening gradually, over the last few months, but it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: “Gradually” is not a helpful medical term, Mr. Schaust. Can you quantify that?
PATIENT: Quantify…? Oh. Right. Um… let me think. Six months ago, I could easily carry groceries up the stairs, no problem. Now, I find myself having to stop halfway, needing a bit of a rest. And… maybe a month ago is when I first really noticed the eyelids. It’s subtle, but noticeable in pictures, you know? I haven't been taking many pictures lately, but my sister pointed it out.
DOCTOR: A sister's observation. Fascinating. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this… weakness and drooping?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not that I’ve really consciously noticed, no. I suppose I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn't these days? And… maybe my speech feels a little slurred sometimes, but it could just be that I’m not concentrating. It's difficult to say. I haven’t really told anyone about it, except my sister, of course.
DOCTOR: “A bit” and “sometimes” are equally unhelpful, Mr. Schaust. Do you have any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing…? No, not really. I haven’t noticed any problems with that, no. I enjoy a good meal, and I haven’t had any trouble keeping anything down. I did choke on a piece of bread last week, but that happens, doesn’t it? It wasn’t… related, I don't think. It was just a bit dry.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Please have a seat and I will assess your neurological function. I must warn you, Mr. Schaust, I have limited time, so cooperation is essential.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Yes, I can certainly cooperate. I understand you’re busy. Just tell me what you’d like me to do.
DOCTOR: Now, look straight ahead. I want you to follow my finger. Don't move your head. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Finally, grip my hands firmly. Your reflexes appear… diminished, and your grip strength is below average for your age and build.
PATIENT: Diminished? Below average? Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? Is… is that serious? What could be causing that? I haven't been doing anything particularly strenuous lately, just my usual work, mostly paperwork and checking the facilities. Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schaust, “worried” is a subjective emotion. Objectively, these findings are… concerning. There are a multitude of possibilities, most of which require further investigation. Given your symptoms and the examination results, I suspect we are dealing with a possible neuromuscular weakness. I am going to order a comprehensive blood panel, including a complete metabolic profile and creatine kinase levels. We will also need to schedule an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. I will have my assistant schedule those for you now.
PATIENT: An MRI…? That sounds… expensive. And a blood panel, I suppose that’s alright. But… is there anything less invasive we could try first? I haven't got insurance at the moment, Doctor, and this is already sounding quite… daunting. And what does “neuromuscular weakness” actually mean? I’m not a doctor, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schaust, I appreciate your financial concerns, however, diagnosing a potentially serious condition requires appropriate investigation. We cannot simply… guess. "Neuromuscular weakness" indicates a problem with either the nerves that control your muscles, the muscles themselves, or the junction between the two. This can be caused by a variety of factors – from vitamin deficiencies to autoimmune disorders, and, in rarer cases, more serious neurological conditions. The blood work is a starting point. The MRI is non-invasive, despite your apprehension, and will provide crucial imaging data. I will also refer you to a neurologist for a formal consultation. A specialist’s opinion is highly recommended. I expect you to follow these recommendations promptly. Time is often of the essence with these matters.
PATIENT: Right. Of course. Time is of the essence. So… blood work, MRI, and a neurologist. That’s quite a lot. I… I will try to arrange it, Doctor. Although, to be honest, I haven’t a clue where to begin. Could your assistant perhaps… offer some guidance? And is there anything I should be avoiding in the meantime? Any particular foods or activities?
DOCTOR: My assistant will provide you with the necessary paperwork and information regarding local facilities. As for avoiding activities… common sense, Mr. Schaust. Do not engage in strenuous physical exertion. Avoid excessive alcohol consumption. And, given your reported fatigue, ensure you get adequate rest. I cannot provide a comprehensive list of dietary restrictions without the results of the blood work. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… a lot to take in. Thank you for your time. And for… explaining things, as best you could. I'll… I’ll see what I can do about arranging everything.
