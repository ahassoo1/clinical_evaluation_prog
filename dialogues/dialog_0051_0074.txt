DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Glazewski. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. My blood pressure's been actin’ up, that's why I'm here. My regular doctor said I oughta come see someone… a specialist, she called it. I don’t rightly know what that means, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, a specialist... that means she thought it would be beneficial for someone with a bit more focused experience to take a look. High blood pressure, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. It’s been high for a spell now. Makes me kinda dizzy sometimes, and my head feels all full. Not all the time, mind you, but enough to worry me. I try not to fuss over it, but… well, at my age, you start payin’ attention to these things.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to pay attention. It’s good you're being proactive. And at 90 years young, that's even more important. Can you tell me roughly when you first noticed this dizziness and fullness in your head?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It didn't start all at once, you know? It was gradual. But I reckon… maybe three, four months ago is when I started really noticin' it. Before that, it was just a little somethin’ here and there. Easy to brush off. But lately… no, it’s more persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months... That gives us a good starting point. And you mentioned it's more persistent now. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes – like exertion, stress, or maybe certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Well now… exertion, not really. I don’t do a whole lot of heavy liftin’ these days, bless my soul. Stress… could be. My granddaughter's been havin’ some trouble, and worryin' about her does get to me. And… I don’t know if time of day matters. Seems to come and go when it pleases. It don't follow a pattern, if that makes any sense. I just feel kinda… off.
DOCTOR: That does make sense. It’s not uncommon for these things to not have a clear trigger. Worrying about your granddaughter certainly could be a factor. We'll need to explore that further. Now, have you been checking your blood pressure at home at all?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don't have one of those machines. My daughter offered to get me one, but I told her not to bother. Too many gadgets these days. I just let the doctors check it when I come in for a visit. I figure that’s what they’re for. I'm not very good with all the newfangled technology.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Steines. We'll rely on the readings we get here, then. Now, before we take your blood pressure, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let’s see… I had the flu somethin’ fierce back in ‘68, but other than that… not much. My eyesight’s gettin’ worse, which is why I need these glasses. And my arthritis acts up somethin’ awful when it rains. But no serious illnesses, if that's what you're askin'. I always ate pretty healthy, mostly Cherokee recipes. Baked a lot, too. Still do, when I can.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Cherokee recipes – excellent! A healthy diet is very important. And you mentioned arthritis. Where do you experience the arthritis pain primarily?
PATIENT: Mostly in my hands and knees, Doctor. Makes it hard to knead dough sometimes, which is a shame. Used to bake bread for the whole town, you know. Now I just make smaller batches. And it hurts to hold my needles when I’m doin’ beadwork. I used to make beautiful necklaces and earrings, but I can’t do it as much anymore. It’s just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've lived a very full and creative life, Ms. Steines, and it’s understandable that arthritis is making some of those things more difficult. Alright, let's move on to past surgeries. Have you ever had any operations or procedures done?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife. Always been lucky, I reckon. I had all my babies natural-like, and everything else has just… stayed put. I always figured if somethin’ ain’t broke, don’t fix it. My mama always said that, and I’ve lived by it. Is this gonna take long, Doctor? I have a biscuit recipe I need to get started on before it gets too late.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Steines, we're almost through with the initial questions. I completely understand your desire to get back to your baking – a good biscuit recipe is important! Just a few more things, and then we’ll do a quick physical exam. Now, regarding your family history… do you know if anyone in your family has had high blood pressure, heart problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mama, she died young from a fever, so I don’t know much about her family. And my daddy… he wasn’t around much. I know my aunt Bessie had some trouble with her heart, but that was a long time ago. And my brother, he was healthy as an ox ‘til the day he passed. Honestly, I don’t remember anyone havin’ trouble with their blood pressure specifically. We didn’t talk about such things back then. It's just… a lot of things get forgotten, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Steines. Family histories can be difficult to recall, especially over time. Alright, just a couple more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy in my life. I eat just about anything. My mama always said a strong stomach comes from workin' the land. I can eat spicy peppers, raw onions… you name it. I haven't had any trouble with any medicines either, not that I take many. Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis when it really flares up, but that's about it. Can we get to the checkin' now, Doctor? I really need to get home and start on those biscuits. The dough needs time to rise, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Steines. We’re just about finished. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, and if so, what are they?
PATIENT: Just that arthritis stuff I mentioned. It's called… hmm… let me think… Naproxen, I believe. My daughter gets it for me. I take one when my hands and knees are really achin’. Other than that, nothin’. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. Always believed in lettin' nature take its course. Alright, is that it, Doctor? I’m ready when you are. I'm hopin' it's nothin' too serious. I really don't want to have to change my biscuit recipe.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Steines, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your hands and knees. It shouldn't take long at all. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just try not to take too long, will ya? Those biscuits ain’t gonna bake themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is reading 162 over 94. That is elevated. Your heart rate is a bit fast, around 88 beats per minute, and I hear a slight murmur, which isn't necessarily concerning at your age, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear, and I can see some swelling and tenderness in your hands and knees, consistent with arthritis. Do you experience any pain with these movements?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It aches somethin' fierce when I try to knead dough, or even just open a jar sometimes. And my knees… oh, they just creak and groan somethin' awful when I try to get up from a chair. It's worse when it's cold or damp outside. It feels like… like the bones are rubbin' together. It’s just part of gettin’ old, I suppose. But it’s makin’ it harder to do the things I love.
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds quite uncomfortable, Ms. Steines. And it is important to maintain your ability to do the things you love. Based on what you've told me and my brief examination, your elevated blood pressure and arthritis are the primary concerns we need to address. I want to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health and kidney function, as high blood pressure can affect those. And I'd also like to get an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and a… what did you call it? E-K-G? Oh dear. Sounds complicated. I don't like needles, you know. And I’m not much for machines. But… if you think it’s important, I suppose I can do it. Just try to be quick, will ya? And don't poke too hard. I’m a fragile old woman, you know. Can we do the blood work here? I don’t want to have to go to a different place.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Steines. We can absolutely do the blood work here in the clinic, and I'll make sure the phlebotomist is very gentle. As for the EKG, it’s a simple, painless test where we place a few stickers on your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn't involve any needles at all. It’ll take just a few minutes. While we’re waiting for the results, I'd like to start you on a low dose of a medication called Lisinopril to help lower your blood pressure. It has some potential side effects, like a mild cough or dizziness, but we can monitor you closely and adjust the dosage if needed. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A pill? Another pill. I really don’t like takin’ pills, Doctor. I told you, I prefer nature’s way. But… if you think it’s the best thing… alright. But just a low dose, you said? And you'll watch me carefully? I don’t want to feel awful. And what about my biscuits? Will this medicine interfere with my bakin'? I need to get this recipe just right for the town festival, you know. It’s a family tradition.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Steines, a very low dose, and we will watch you closely. We’ll start with 5 milligrams daily. As for your biscuits, Lisinopril shouldn’t interfere with your baking at all. It’s a medication that works on your blood pressure, it won’t affect your ability to cook or enjoy your favorite recipes. I'm also going to give you a handout with information about high blood pressure, the medication, and some lifestyle changes you can make – like reducing your salt intake and getting regular, gentle exercise – to help manage your condition. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check your blood pressure and see how you're tolerating the medication. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. I suppose that’s fair. Lifestyle changes… gentle exercise… I ain't much for walkin', Doctor. My knees just won't allow it. And salt… well, I do like a little salt in my biscuits. But I can try. For the biscuits. And for you, I reckon. I’ll read this over later. Just don't expect me to become a health nut overnight. I'm a simple woman, Doctor. I like my biscuits, and I like my peace and quiet. Can we get this medicine now, so I can get home and start on my recipe? The dough needs time to rise, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Steines. I understand. We’ll take things one step at a time. Let's get you set up with the Lisinopril. The nurse will be in shortly to give you the prescription and go over any remaining questions you may have. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any side effects or have any concerns. We’re here to help. I sincerely hope you enjoy your baking, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. And perhaps, one day, even tasting one of those famous biscuits. Now, let’s get you on your way.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you takin’ the time. And… maybe I’ll bring you a biscuit next time. If I remember. Bye now.
