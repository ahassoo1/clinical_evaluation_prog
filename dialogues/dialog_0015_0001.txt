DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kn och. I am Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s Kn och, actually – K-N-O-C-H. And, well, I’ve been smoking for… a very long time. Sixty years, I believe. And I’d like to… stop. It’s becoming rather a nuisance, truth be told.
DOCTOR: Sixty years. That is a considerable amount of time, Mr. Kn och. And you’re seeking assistance with cessation, then?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Assistance, yes. I’ve tried a few times on my own, you see. Patches, gum… even those little things you inhale. But nothing seems to… stick, as the young people say. It’s not so much the want for a cigarette anymore, it’s the… habit, I suppose. The routine. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Habit is a powerful thing. And nicotine addiction has both physical and psychological components, so simply wanting to stop isn't always enough. Let's get a full history. First, how many cigarettes a day, roughly, are you currently smoking?
PATIENT: Approximately… fifteen. Sometimes sixteen, if it’s been a particularly… difficult day. I used to smoke more, perhaps twenty or twenty-five when I was working in the factory. But now… fifteen is the average. I smoke them throughout the day, usually one after a meal, and… well, whenever I feel a bit restless, I suppose. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly.
DOCTOR: Fifteen a day for sixty years... That's a significant pack-year history, Mr. Kn och. Have you ever had any coughing or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. The coughing, certainly. A bit of a morning cough, always. I put it down to the… the climate, mostly. This city air isn’t what it used to be, you know. And sometimes, if I walk up the stairs too quickly, I get a little… winded. But nothing that I considered… serious. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I thought.
DOCTOR: And have you had any chest pain or wheezing?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. A little discomfort sometimes, but I always attributed that to indigestion. I enjoy a good sausage, you see, and that can sometimes cause a bit of… pressure. Wheezing… hmm. Perhaps a little, especially in the winter months. But nothing persistent. It comes and goes. I wouldn't say it's a regular occurrence, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, Doctor, I have been a bit more tired lately. More so than usual, I suppose. And a bit of a… loss of appetite. Though, truthfully, I haven’t been cooking for myself much lately. It’s easier to just… have a sandwich, or something simple. But yes, the tiredness is… noticeable. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Fatigue and loss of appetite, along with your smoking history and cough… these things warrant further investigation. I’m going to need to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen saturation. Then, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying issues. We need to establish a baseline before we start discussing cessation methods. Please sit back and take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray, you say? Hmm. Very well, Doctor. If that's what you think is best. I suppose I'm in your hands. Is it… unpleasant? The X-ray, I mean. I’ve never had one before.
DOCTOR: It’s quite straightforward, Mr. Kn och. You’ll simply stand in front of the machine while a technician takes a few images. It doesn't involve any needles or discomfort, just a brief exposure to radiation. It’s a standard procedure. Now, if you’ll please remove any metal objects from your clothing.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A chain my mother gave me, you see. She was a very… practical woman. Always said a bit of silver wards off bad luck. But I suppose I can part with it for a few minutes. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Besides the… radiation, of course.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kn och, that will be all. Just stand still and follow the technician’s instructions. I'll be back in a few moments to discuss the results and formulate a plan.
PATIENT: Right. Stand still, you said. Sixty years... I wonder what they'll find after sixty years. .
