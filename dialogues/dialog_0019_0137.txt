DOCTOR: Good morning, Lindra. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My… family want me to go to a… a place for old people. A senior… living? They say I need… checkup first. To make sure I’m okay for go there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your family wants you to have a checkup before considering a senior living facility, that’s very thoughtful of them. And completely reasonable. So, let’s get a good picture of how you’re doing. First, can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on with you lately?
PATIENT: Lately? Hmm… Not much different, I think. I make my coffee, I watch my stories on the TV… I help my husband with the cooking sometimes. He does most of it, though. My knees… they bother me when the weather is cold. And I forget things… small things. Like where I put my glasses. But everyone forgets things, right?
DOCTOR: Everyone does forget things, you’re absolutely right. It's very common. We'll definitely talk about that a bit more. So, the knees bothering you in cold weather… is that a new thing, or has that been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time now. Maybe… ten years? More? I don’t remember exactly. It’s just… achy. Not so bad I can’t walk, but it’s… there. It gets worse when it rains, or when it’s very cold. My husband, he rubs them for me. That helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the knee pain has been a long-term issue, worse with the weather, and your husband helps with that, which is wonderful. And you mentioned forgetting things… can you give me an example of what kinds of things you’re forgetting?
PATIENT: Like… yesterday, I made a sandwich for my husband, and I put it in the fridge… but I forgot what was on it! He told me. And sometimes I go to the store, and I forget what I went there to buy. Small things, you know? Not… important things. I remember my children, I remember my husband… I don’t forget them.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's more like misplacing things or having trouble recalling details of recent events, not major memory loss. That’s helpful to know. Let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… Doctor told me, a long time ago, my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me a pill for it. I take it every morning. I think that’s all… nothing else that I know about. I go to the doctor for checkup every year, and he never say anything else was wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication. Let me just pull up your records here to see what the doctor has noted over the years… Ah, yes. Hypertension, well-controlled. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! When I was young, I had my tonsils out. A long time ago. And when I had my babies, I was in the hospital, of course. That was… many years ago now. No other surgery, no. I been lucky, I think. Mostly just… old aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, and hospitalizations for the births of your children. Good to know. Now, Lindra, are you currently taking any medications other than the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Just the one. The little white pill for my blood pressure. My husband, he gets it for me. He knows what I need. I take it with my coffee every morning. I think… that’s all. No other pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the one medication for your blood pressure. That's good to keep track of. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never had a problem with allergies. I eat everything… well, almost everything. I don’t like spicy food, but that’s not an allergy, right? I can eat anything, never been sick from food or a pill.
DOCTOR: No, not liking spicy food isn't an allergy! That's perfectly fine. So, no known allergies. Now, Lindra, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother, she lived to be very old. Ninety-something, I think. She had a little trouble with her heart at the end, but she lived a long time. My father, he… he died when I was young. I don't remember much about his health. My brother, he's still alive, he's a little older than me, he has… something with his sugar, I think. Diabetes? My husband's family… they were all healthy, I think. It's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother lived to a good age, some heart trouble later in life. Your father passed away when you were young, brother has diabetes, and husband’s family healthy. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I never smoke. My husband, he used to, a long time ago, but he stopped many years ago. He say it was bad for him. I always tell him it's good he stop! Never smoke, never liked it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Never smoked. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A little glass of wine with dinner. Just sometimes. On the weekend, maybe. Or if we have company. Not every day, no. Not much. My husband, he like a beer sometimes too. Just… a little. Not too much. We’re not big drinkers.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol consumption. That’s good to know. Now, Lindra, before we do a quick physical exam, I'd like to ask a couple of questions about your daily activities. Are you able to take care of yourself at home – things like bathing, dressing, and preparing meals?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. I do everything myself. I make my own breakfast, I wash my clothes, I cook dinner sometimes. My husband, he helps me with the heavy things, like moving furniture. But I can do most things myself. I’m still strong. Just… slow sometimes. But I can do it. I don’t need help.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Lindra. It’s good that you’re still able to manage things on your own. Now, I'd just like to do a quick exam – just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, please? My old bones… they’re not what they used to be. But I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lindra. I will be very gentle. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax and take a few deep breaths… Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. That’s a little elevated, but not too concerning given your history. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs… Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit of a murmur, which is common at your age. Your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is also normal for your age. I notice a little bit of swelling in your ankles. Do you notice that yourself?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. My ankles… they get puffy. Especially at the end of the day. Or if it’s very hot. I just… put my feet up. That usually helps. Is that bad? Should I tell my husband? I forget these things, you know?
DOCTOR: It's good you've noticed that yourself, Lindra. The swelling, or edema, can happen with age and being on your feet a bit. Putting your feet up is a good idea. We'll definitely want to keep an eye on it. It’s not necessarily an emergency, but we should rule out anything more serious. Now, just one more thing. Could you stand up and walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay… be careful, Doctor. Like this… Just a little bit… I’m a little unsteady, sometimes. The floor… it feels funny. But I can walk. I walk every day, to the kitchen and back. But not very far. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Lindra. You have a slightly wider gait than usual, and a bit of unsteadiness, but nothing too alarming. Okay, that completes the quick exam. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re generally in good health for your age. The main things I want to address are the slightly elevated blood pressure, the ankle swelling, and the memory concerns. I’m going to order some blood work to check your kidney function, thyroid levels, and rule out any vitamin deficiencies that could be contributing to the memory issues. I also want to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… like a lot. My husband, he does all the things with the doctor. He’ll know what to do. Blood work… EKG… Is that… expensive? I don’t want to cause trouble. Should I tell him? Maybe he already knows about these things. I forget, you know?
DOCTOR: It does sound like a lot, I understand. And don’t worry, we’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll give you a list of everything that needs to be done, and your husband is right to handle it – he sounds very capable. As for the cost, I can’t give you an exact amount, as it depends on your insurance coverage. But we can check with the billing department to get an estimate before you proceed. We certainly don’t want to cause any financial hardship. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests scheduled. Would you like me to have the nurse give you a list of instructions and the paperwork needed?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. My husband, he can read all the small print. And… maybe the nurse can remind me what we’re supposed to do. I’m… a little confused now, with all the things. Just… the blood work and the EKG, right? And my ankles… I should put my feet up. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ve got it. Blood work and an EKG. And yes, continue putting your feet up when you notice swelling in your ankles. The nurse will also review your medications and allergies. I’m also going to write a note to your primary care physician, letting them know about our consultation and the tests I’m ordering. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You were very… nice. And patient. I forget things, you know. But you didn’t get angry. Just… the blood work and the EKG. And I should tell my husband? Is that right? He’ll know what to do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindra. And no, I wasn’t angry at all. It’s perfectly normal to forget things, and it's good you have a supportive husband who can help. Yes, definitely let him know about the blood work and EKG. The nurse will be in shortly to go over everything with you. It was a pleasure meeting you, Lindra. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
