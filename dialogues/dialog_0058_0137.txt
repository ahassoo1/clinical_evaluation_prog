DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My… how you say… the place for old people? My husband and I, we want to see if I am… okay for it. For live there. It is very nice place, but they need to check me first.
DOCTOR: Right. So you’re inquiring about admission to the Meadowbrook Assisted Living facility, and they’ve requested a medical evaluation. Just to confirm, you want me to assess your overall health to determine if you’re a suitable candidate?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That is right. Suit-able. They want to know if I… can live there without… trouble. My husband, he worries too much. But I feel good! Mostly.
DOCTOR: “Mostly” is… helpful. Could you tell me a little more about what “mostly” means?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my knees, they hurt sometimes. When it is cold, or if I walk too much. And… I forget things. Not big things, you know? Like… what I eat for breakfast. Or the name of the lady next door. But not… important things! My husband says I repeat myself too. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, knee pain and some memory difficulties, and your husband has noticed some repetition. Let's try to get a better picture of all of this. How long have your knees been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Maybe… ten years? More? I don't remember exactly. It comes and goes. Sometimes I use a little cream. The one my daughter buys me. It helps a little. It is a white jar.
DOCTOR: Alright. And the memory issues… when did you start noticing those?
PATIENT: That is… harder to say. Maybe a few years ago? Like I said, not big things. Just… little things. I ask my husband where I put my glasses, even when they are on my head! He laughs. But sometimes… sometimes it worries me a little bit. It is not like I don't know who I am, you understand? Just… words. Names. Dates. Things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, to get a clearer idea of things, I'd like to do a very quick memory test. It’s just a few simple questions. Nothing to worry about, just helps me understand what’s going on. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A test? Hmm… I don't like tests. I never was good at tests in school. But… if it helps, okay. But go slow, please. And if I don't remember, don't get mad at me!
DOCTOR: Of course not. We’ll go at your pace. No pressure at all. Okay, first question. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Hmm… Today… August… Let me see… Is it the 1st? No… my grandson, he came to visit last week… so it must be… the 2nd? Yes! August 2nd. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Very good. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh dear. The year… That is a hard one. Is it… 2024? No… My husband, he always tells me… 2025! Yes, 2025. I think. Is that right? I get so confused with the numbers.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is 2025. Okay. Let's move on. I'm going to ask you to remember three words. Listen carefully: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Okay. Apple, table, penny. I think I remember. Apple… table… hmm… and… what was the last one? Something shiny… small… oh! Penny! Yes. Apple, table, penny. Did I do good?
DOCTOR: Yes, you repeated them correctly. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more questions, then we’ll do a brief physical exam. Let’s see… have you noticed any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat what my husband makes. He is a good cook. Sometimes I don't feel like eating, but I eat anyway. He worries if I don't finish my plate. He says I need to keep my strength up. Is that okay? Is it bad to not want to eat sometimes?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, but it's good to know. Alright, let’s talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescriptions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Yes! For my blood pressure. A little white pill. And… something for my knees, sometimes. A cream, like I said. And… oh! A vitamin! My daughter gives me a vitamin every morning. That’s all I think. My husband, he helps me with the pills. He keeps track. I forget which ones to take when.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you know the names of these medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no. No, I don't. Too many names. I just take what my husband gives me. He says they are important. He reads the labels, I think. I’m not good with remembering those things. It makes my head hurt. Is it bad that I don't know the names?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad, but it’s helpful to know. We can get that information from your pharmacy. Okay, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay. As long as it doesn't take too long. And please be gentle with my knees. They are very sensitive. And… don't poke too hard. I don't like being poked.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not critically high. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Could you sit on the edge of the table, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Be careful, Doctor. They ache when I bend them. And they crack sometimes. It’s very strange. Like little bubbles popping. Do you hear them? I hope it’s not too bad. My daughter says I need to lose weight, but it’s hard when I can’t walk very well.
DOCTOR: There’s some crepitus in both knees, consistent with osteoarthritis. There’s also some mild swelling and tenderness. Range of motion is limited. Okay. That's all for the physical exam. It appears you have moderate osteoarthritis in both knees.
PATIENT: Os-teo-what? Is that bad, Doctor? Does that mean I can’t go to the nice place? I really want to go to the nice place. My husband is getting too old to take care of me all the time. He worries so much. Is it very bad? Will I need… surgery?
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis is a common condition, Ms. Abdollahi. It simply means the cartilage in your knees has worn down. It explains your pain and stiffness. It doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t go to Meadowbrook, but it will require some management. Surgery is an option, but not usually the first step. We can start with physical therapy, pain medication, and weight management. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any other contributing factors. We'll also need to get a list of your current medications from your pharmacy. Then we’ll discuss a plan to manage your osteoarthritis and see if you're a suitable candidate for Meadowbrook. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… That sounds… okay. Physical therapy… I don’t know. I’m not very strong. But if it helps, I will try. And the medicine… I hope it doesn't make me sleepy. I like to watch my stories on the TV. And the list of medicine… my husband can get that. He is very good at those things. So… you think I still have a chance to go to the nice place? If I try hard?
DOCTOR: We’ll see. It depends on how well you respond to treatment and your overall functional status. We need to gather more information first. I'll have the nurse draw some blood and get that medication list. I’ll review the results and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss a plan. For now, try to rest your knees and avoid activities that aggravate your pain. The nurse will be in shortly. Do you have any other questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I hope… I really hope I can go to the nice place. My husband… he worries so much. Tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle, please. I don’t like needles very much.
