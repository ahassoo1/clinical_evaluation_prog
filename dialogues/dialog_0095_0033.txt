DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the slightest idea why I'm here. My assistant scheduled this appointment, and frankly, she’s… not always the most organized. Something about my eyes and ears, I believe. It's all rather disruptive to my schedule, you understand. I have patients waiting.
DOCTOR: Right, I see. Yes, your assistant indicated a follow-up for some changes with your vision and hearing. Just to clarify, are you experiencing any difficulties with either of those senses currently?
PATIENT: Difficulties? Well, now that you mention it… things are a bit muffled. And the print in this magazine is rather small, isn't it? Though, that could simply be poor design. I really don't have time to decipher things that aren’t clear. Did they not explain why I’m here? This is terribly inefficient.
DOCTOR: It appears the appointment was scheduled after a routine screening showed some minor changes. Nothing alarming, but we like to follow up on those. To get a better picture, could you tell me specifically when you first noticed the muffled hearing, and how long have you been having trouble with your vision?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates? Doctor, I’m a surgeon, not a historian. It was… some time ago. Perhaps a few weeks? Months? Honestly, it all blurs together. I simply noticed things weren't as… crisp as they should be. A general decline, you understand. It’s what happens with age. Are we going to do something about it, or simply discuss the timeline of my deterioration? I have a two o'clock.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. No need to get bogged down in exact dates. Let's just focus on what's happening now. So, the muffled hearing… is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, I believe. Or at least, I haven't noticed a time when it isn't muffled. It's rather irritating, frankly. People mumble these days. And this examination is taking far too long. Are you quite sure this is necessary? I've managed perfectly well for… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant muffled hearing. And with your vision, is it blurry at all distances, or more noticeable when reading or seeing things far away?
PATIENT: Both, I suppose. Everything seems… less defined. The world is losing its sharpness. Though I doubt a new pair of glasses will solve anything. My eyesight has always been quite good, you know. It’s probably just the lighting in here. It's terribly… sterile. Are you finished with your questions yet? I really must get back to my patients.
DOCTOR: Just a few more quick questions, Ms. Julie. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or any dizziness or balance problems?
PATIENT: Ringing? No, not that I recall. Though there’s always a bit of noise in the city, isn't there? And dizziness… well, I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be, but that's just age again, I expect. Truly, Doctor, I'm not sure what you’re hoping to achieve with all these questions. I lead a very busy life. Are you going to examine my ears and eyes, or continue this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Let's do a quick examination. It will just take a few minutes. I want to take a look at your ears with an otoscope and check your vision with a few simple charts. Then we can discuss the results and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, that sounds… acceptable. Get on with it, please. I have a two o’clock, and my patients don’t appreciate being kept waiting. And try to be quick. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your ears. Please lean forward a little… Good. I’m just going to take a quick look. Hmm. Some cerumen buildup, but nothing concerning. Similar on this side. Now, let's check your vision. Could you please read the letters on this chart, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Ugh. These letters are terribly small. And the color is… uninspired. …E… H… P… Z… I believe that's all I can discern. Honestly, Doctor, the design of this chart is quite poor. Are you certain this is the most accurate way to assess one’s vision? It’s hardly scientific.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try this one. It has larger letters. And we can adjust the distance if needed. Okay, start with the top line again, please.
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. …F… P… T… L… This is utterly ridiculous. Are you certain you’ve focused the chart correctly? It seems rather… blurry. I really must insist on a more thorough examination. Perhaps a specialist? This is clearly not yielding any useful information. And this lighting… it's giving me a headache.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration. It seems we’re having some difficulty with the standard charts. Given your concerns and the subjective nature of these findings, I think a referral to an audiologist and an ophthalmologist would be the most prudent course of action. They have specialized equipment and can perform a more detailed assessment of your hearing and vision. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Finally, a sensible suggestion. Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I’ve always preferred specialists, frankly. They actually know what they’re doing. Please expedite the referrals. I have a very busy schedule, you understand. And please ensure they’re competent professionals. I won't waste my time with amateurs. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I've wasted enough time here. Is there anything else, or can I finally leave?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. I’m printing out the referral forms for both an audiologist and an ophthalmologist now. They are both highly recommended professionals in the area. I will also include your recent primary care notes to help them with your assessment. Here you are. You can schedule appointments with them at your convenience. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all. Just…try to be more efficient with your patients in the future, Doctor. Time is precious. Thank you for… eventually… agreeing to the referrals. Now, if you'll excuse me.
