DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Guilds is fine. What… what did you say? Something about why I’m here? Old age, I guess. Everything hurts these days. Mostly… hard to breathe. And my mouth feels like the Sahara. And my eyes… like sandpaper. It’s been… a while now. Don't remember exactly when it started. A long while.
DOCTOR: Right. “Everything hurts.” Vague. And a long while… that’s helpful. Let's try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? Look, I'm 83! What do you want from me, a timeline? It's just… getting worse. The breathing, I mean. Used to be able to walk to the store, now… now I gotta stop every few feet. And the dryness… like someone left the heat on full blast in my face. You know? Is that enough “specific” for ya?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get… agitated. We'll get there. It's just that "getting worse" doesn’t tell me much. When did you first notice the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. Before the heat, definitely. Maybe… last winter? Or maybe the winter before. See, I used to spend a lot of time outside, workin' traffic signals. Hot sun, cold wind... all sorts of things. Coulda been then. I don't keep track of these things, Doctor. I just feel bad. Is that a problem? You doctors always want dates and numbers... like I'm a calendar.
DOCTOR: It’s not about being difficult, Mr. Guilds. It’s about understanding the progression of your symptoms. Was it gradual, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual… I think. It wasn't like I woke up one day gasping for air. Just… little by little, harder to catch my breath. Like climbin’ a hill, slow and steady. And the mouth and eyes… they just got drier. Not all at once, either. Took their time. Look, I’m tellin’ you, everything’s just… slow. That's how old age works, isn't it? Everything slows down.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any chest pain, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Not really. Not like a sharp pain, no. Sometimes… a tightness. A little squeeze. But that could be anything. Could be indigestion, could be… well, could be anything. I eat a lot of… Cuban food, you know? Not the healthiest. But no pain, pain. Not the kind that makes you grab your chest and fall down. Just a little… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any cough?
PATIENT: Cough? Yeah, sometimes. Not a big one, though. Just a little tickle in my throat. Mostly happens when I lie down. Or when the air is… dusty. Living in this town, it gets dusty. Always has. Not a bad cough, Doctor. Just… a cough. Is that all you're gonna ask about? Everything feels wrong, you know? I'm old! What do you expect?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Let's just do a quick exam, then we'll see. Please lie down on the table. I need to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen saturation. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oxygen… what-now? Look, I don't like doctors pokin' and proddin'. But… fine. If you gotta listen to my lungs, listen. But be quick about it. And no cold instruments, okay? Everything feels colder when you get old. Hurry it up, Doctor. I got things to do. Well, not really things, but… you know. I got a life. A slow one, but a life.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Guilds. And another one. Good. Your oxygen saturation is 91%. A little low, but not critically so. I'm hearing some… diminished breath sounds in both lower lobes. And some mild wheezing. Do you have any swelling in your feet or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Now that you mention it… maybe a little. Not much. I always thought my feet were kinda big. Never paid much attention. They feel… puffy sometimes. But that could be from sittin’ around all day, right? It's hard to walk, remember? Everything swells when you don't move. Is that bad? Everything's bad these days, it seems. Are you gonna give me a shot or something? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: There is some mild pitting edema. It’s consistent with… fluid retention. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a basic metabolic panel to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Guilds. The X-ray will help us rule out pneumonia or other lung issues, and the blood work will check your kidney function and electrolyte levels.
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood work? Oh, boy. More pokin' and proddin’. Look, Doctor, is this gonna be expensive? I'm on Medicare, you know? And I don't want any surprises. I just want to be able to breathe again, that’s all. And maybe not feel like the Sahara Desert in my mouth. Is there anything… anything simple you can give me? Like a pill or something? I don't like all this… fancy stuff.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your concerns, but I need to gather more information before I can determine the best course of treatment. Medicare should cover these tests, but the billing department will handle that. As for a “simple pill,” I won't prescribe anything without a proper diagnosis. I suspect you may be dealing with a combination of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, and some degree of dehydration, but I need the test results to confirm. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we'll get you scheduled for the X-ray. The results will be back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend you increase your fluid intake and avoid strenuous activity. Is that clear?
PATIENT: COPD…? That sounds… serious. Never heard of it. And dehydration… I drink plenty of coffee! That’s a fluid, right? Look, Doctor, I don’t want any complicated treatments. I just want something to make me feel better. And no lectures about coffee. It’s all I got. Fine. Blood work, X-ray… whatever. Just… please don’t make me come back too many times. I’m an old man, remember? It takes me a while to get anywhere.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly. I'll review the results when they are available and we can discuss them at your follow-up appointment. We'll schedule that before you leave. And yes, I understand you're an old man. .
