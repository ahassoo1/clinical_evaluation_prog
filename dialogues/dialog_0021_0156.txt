DOCTOR: Right. So, Jase, you're here today… for?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yeah. It’s my stomach. It’s been… well, it’s been going on for a bit now. Diarrhea, mostly. It’s not… new, exactly. It comes and goes. Honestly, I forget when it started, to be real. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: “Happens.” Right. Well, that’s… not very helpful, is it?
PATIENT: No, you’re right, it isn’t. Sorry. It’s just… hard to keep track of everything. I’ve had stomach problems on and off for years, I think. My doctor back home – I just moved here, actually – always said something about… something I can’t eat? Or something my body doesn’t like? I don’t remember the name of it, and it was a while ago. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Something you can’t eat.” Vague, very vague. And you say this has been going on for years?
PATIENT: Yeah, years. Maybe… five? Six? It’s hard to say. It doesn’t bother me all the time. Just… lately it’s been more frequent, and… messier, if you know what I mean. It’s just been a bit disruptive, honestly. I work, you know? And it’s… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Disruptive. Right. Well, we can't diagnose anything based on "disruptive," now can we?
PATIENT: No, you’re right. I know. I just… I don’t really know what to tell you. It just is. I feel okay, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but that could be anything. My husband keeps telling me to come get it checked out, so… here I am. I really don’t know what’s going on, or what they even do to figure it out. Is it going to be… bad?
DOCTOR: Look, I'm sure it's not a catastrophe. But “feeling okay” and having chronic diarrhea are two very different things. We need to get a better history, at the very least. Let's start with this: have you noticed anything specific that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I eat pretty much everything. Maybe dairy? I don’t know. Sometimes after I eat really spicy food, but I love spicy food, so I don’t avoid it. I drink a lot of tea, too. Black tea, mostly. I don’t think that’s it, though. I’ve been drinking tea forever. I really can’t think of anything… It just seems random. Is there a certain food I should avoid completely to see if it helps?
DOCTOR: “Random” is rarely a helpful diagnosis, you know. We'll need to rule some things out. Do you have any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… that’s a bit… personal. I… I think so? Sometimes. Not a lot, usually just… a little bit. It’s hard to tell, honestly. It’s never bright red, if that makes a difference. It’s more… dark? Like mixed in with everything else. I try not to look too closely, if you know what I mean. It worries me, but I figured it was just… something I ate. Or maybe just a hemorrhoid or something?
DOCTOR: "Something you ate." Right. Well, dark stool with blood is not usually "something you ate," dear. Let’s get a stool sample. And I'm going to order some blood work, just to be thorough. Have you had any recent fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no fever or anything like that. No vomiting, either. Just… the stomach stuff. And feeling a little tired, like I said. I haven't been sick, not really. I just… feel off sometimes. Okay, a stool sample… How do I… do that? Is it… complicated? I'm sorry, I just… I've never really done this before. And what will the blood work tell you? Will it be painful?
DOCTOR: Here. Read this. It explains the stool sample collection process. It’s not rocket science. As for the blood work, it will help us rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. It's just a standard blood draw; a little prick, really. Not exactly a painful ordeal. We'll check your electrolytes, too – diarrhea can throw those off balance. And don't worry, I'll order everything electronically. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That’s… good. Not rocket science, that’s reassuring. I’ll read that pamphlet. Um, allergies… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I’ve taken ibuprofen before, and penicillin when I was little, but I don’t remember having a reaction. My husband says I get hives sometimes, but he also says I’m dramatic, so… I don’t know if that counts. He says it’s from stress, mostly. Does that mean I’m allergic to stress? I’m really not sure. Is it okay if I just say I don’t know?
DOCTOR: “Allergic to stress.” Wonderful. Fine. We’ll put "no known allergies" then. Let’s move on. What about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, um… not much, really. I was a healthy baby, I think. I had chickenpox when I was little, like everyone else. I’ve never been hospitalized, never had any surgeries. I don't have any… major illnesses, not that I know of. My family… they have high blood pressure, mostly. And diabetes, on my mother’s side. But I haven't been tested for either of those. I feel… pretty good, usually, except for the stomach stuff, of course. Is it okay if I just say that? I don't want to leave anything out, but I really don't know much about my medical history.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll need to get some baseline tests done, regardless. Your husband – is he available to provide any more information about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, he could probably tell you more. He remembers everything. I’m terrible with dates and details. He's at work right now, though. He’s an engineer. He's really good with… logistics. And remembering things. Would it be okay if he called the clinic tomorrow? He has all my old medical records, I think. And he knows my family history really well. He can probably tell you everything. Is that okay? I’m sorry I’m not more helpful. I just… get easily confused, and I forget things so easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have him call tomorrow. In the meantime, try to rest and stay hydrated. I’ve ordered the stool sample and blood work. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or bloody stool, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I… I don’t think so. That’s… a lot of information. Thank you, Dr. Havird. I appreciate you… taking the time to listen to me, even though I’m not very helpful. I guess I’ll just wait for the lab to call. And I’ll tell my husband to call tomorrow. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay. You too. .
