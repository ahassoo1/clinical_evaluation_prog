DOCTOR: Alright, Annelle Durig, 77 years old. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Osterholm, is it? Yes. Well, it’s my… a friend of mine, actually. He’s been looking quite yellow, you see. And he has… trouble with his liver, I believe. It’s been going on for a bit now. I just… want to get it sorted, if you don’t mind. I don’t recall all the specifics, terribly.
DOCTOR: Right. A friend… experiencing some yellowing, and you suspect liver issues. Hmm. It’s good you’re bringing this to someone's attention. When you say “a bit now,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Specific… that’s difficult. Perhaps… a few months? It’s hard to say exactly. He doesn’t like to complain, you see. And I… well, my memory isn’t what it once was. It started subtly, I think. A slight change in his skin tone. Now it’s… rather noticeable. He's also been very tired, I believe. He just… sleeps a lot more. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of increasing yellowing, accompanied by fatigue. That is helpful, thank you. Now, this friend… is this someone you live with?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, he does live with me. We share a… a house. He’s a quiet man, mostly keeps to himself. Doesn’t have much family left, you see. That’s why I’m here, really. To make sure he gets the proper attention. I worry about him, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has he noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. He's been… less hungry, I suppose. And his stomach… it seems swollen sometimes. Not always, but… occasionally. He also complains of itching, terribly. He scratches quite a bit, especially at night. I don’t know if that’s related, of course. It’s just… what I’ve noticed. Is that… enough information? I’m afraid I’m not a very good reporter.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright. You're doing fine. Loss of appetite, abdominal swelling, and itching… those are all potentially relevant. We'll need to do a proper examination to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'd like to check his abdomen, listen to his heart and lungs, and feel for his liver and spleen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just… want to help him. He’s a good man, really. A quiet life, but a good one. Please, do whatever you think is best. I'm not sure I understand all the medical… procedures, but I trust your judgment. Shall we begin then?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could have him lie down on the table, that would be great. I’m going to start by listening to his heart and lungs. We’ll take it one step at a time. It’s important to rule things out systematically. Now, does he have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Oh dear. That’s another thing I can’t quite recall. He doesn’t take many medications, if any. Perhaps he had a reaction to something years ago, but I truly don’t remember. He's always been a very… stoic man. Didn't much bother with doctors or pills, to be honest. It’s a good thing you’re here now, though. I think it’s best to be safe. I'll try to think harder... but I doubt I'll recall anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll proceed with caution then. I’m listening to his breathing now. Deep breaths, please. Sounds a bit diminished on the left side. And I’ll check his pulse. A little weak, but regular. Now, let’s move to the abdomen. I’m going to gently press on his stomach. Tell me if anything feels painful. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yes… he flinches a little on the right side, just under the ribs. Not a large flinch, mind you, but… a definite reaction. He makes a small noise, a sort of… grunt. He doesn't like being touched, you see. Always has been a bit sensitive. It doesn’t seem terribly painful, just… uncomfortable. I hope you don't mind his… reluctance. He's a private man.
DOCTOR: Alright, tenderness on the right upper quadrant. That’s… concerning. And I notice some slight swelling there as well. I’m going to listen to his abdomen now with the stethoscope. Sounds a little… muffled. It’s difficult to say definitively, but it could indicate some fluid buildup. I’m also going to examine his skin. Yes, there's definite jaundice here, as you suspected. And some scratching marks, consistent with itching. Now, has he had any recent changes in his bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh dear… bowel movements. That's… a rather personal question, isn't it? He's… rather regular, if that’s any comfort. Not much change there, as far as I know. Perhaps a little paler than usual, but I attributed that to his general unwellness. He does… strain a bit sometimes, now that I think of it. But nothing dramatic. He doesn’t talk much about such things. I apologize for my… lack of specifics. This is all rather… unpleasant. I just want him to be comfortable again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pale stools, slight straining… that’s something to keep in mind. Based on what you’ve told me, and my initial examination, it’s concerning. The jaundice, the tenderness in the right upper quadrant, the fatigue, the itching, and the changes in bowel movements… these all point towards a possible issue with his liver or gallbladder. It could be a number of things, from gallstones to a more serious liver condition. I’m going to order some blood tests and an ultrasound of his abdomen. The blood tests will help us assess his liver function, and the ultrasound will give us a better look at his liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts.
PATIENT: Tests… Yes, that sounds… thorough. Whatever you deem necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. He won't be pleased, mind you. He dislikes hospitals and… poking and prodding. But if it helps him, I’ll convince him. When will we have the results? And… will they be painful? I’m sorry to ask so many questions. I just… worry. I just want to know what we're dealing with. .
DOCTOR: It’s alright to worry, that’s perfectly natural. The blood tests are relatively quick and only involve a small needle prick. The ultrasound is non-invasive; a technician will simply move a probe over his abdomen. It shouldn't be painful at all, just a little cool gel. We should have the results back within a few days, usually 2-3 business days. While we wait, I’m going to prescribe some medication to help with the itching. It won’t address the underlying problem, but it should at least provide some relief. I'll also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in digestive disorders. They will be able to provide a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
