DOCTOR: Hi Mikeisha, welcome. I’m Dr. Polczynski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you too. Um… my sinus, it is… bothering me. For some time now. I… I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s… not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinus trouble. I see. Not good… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It… feels full. Like water is… stuck. And sometimes… a pain. Not a bad pain, always. More… pressure. And… I have trouble smelling. Not everything, but… the nice smells, they are… faint. I… do I make sense? I forget things easily, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re making perfect sense, Mikeisha. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this for a bit. So, fullness in your sinuses, some pressure, and a decreased sense of smell… and you said this has been going on for some time. Do you remember anything that might have started it?
PATIENT: Hmm… started it… That is… difficult. I work with the… the drills. For the oil. Very dusty work, sometimes. But… I always wear the mask. I think. Maybe the dust? Or… the weather? It has been very hot. I don’t… I truly don’t recall. Everything feels… fuzzy. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mikeisha. It’s perfectly alright. It’s common to not remember exact details, especially when something has been going on for a while. Dusty work and hot weather… both could be contributing factors. Let’s try to narrow things down a bit. When you say "fullness," where exactly do you feel it?
PATIENT: Here… and here. And… sometimes behind my eyes. It’s… hard to explain. Like… a heavy feeling. Not pain, exactly. Just… full. Like when you have a cold, maybe? But not with the cold. Just… the stuffiness. Does that… make more sense? I am sorry if I am not being clear.
DOCTOR: That makes a lot of sense, Mikeisha. You're describing it very well. So, fullness in your forehead, cheeks, and sometimes behind your eyes, without any other cold symptoms like fever or cough. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. I… sometimes I feel very tired. More tired than usual. But… I work long hours. So maybe that? And… sometimes a little headache. But it comes and goes. Very mild. I… I don’t know if that is… related. It could be the sun, maybe? I work outside a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional mild headaches. It’s good you’re mentioning everything, even if you’re not sure it’s related. Let’s do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll just listen to your lungs, check your ears, and take a look at your sinuses. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I… I trust your judgement. Please, go ahead. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Your lungs sound clear. Now I’m going to take a look at your ears. Your ears look normal as well. Now, let’s check your sinuses. I'm going to gently press on your forehead and cheeks to see if there's any tenderness. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. A little bit there. And… a little here, on my cheek. Not sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like… pressure. It is… better when you are not pressing. When you press, it… hurts a little. I apologize. I am not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Mikeisha. You're describing it perfectly. It sounds like there’s definitely some inflammation in your sinuses. Given your symptoms – the fullness, decreased sense of smell, fatigue, and tenderness when I press on your sinuses – it’s likely you have sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinus passages. Now, given your work in the oil fields with potential dust exposure, we should consider if it could be chronic sinusitis. Do you happen to know if you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t think so. I… my mother, she had allergies. To flowers, I think. But I… I don’t have any problems with flowers. Or… anything else, that I know of. We didn’t have much money growing up, so we didn’t go to the doctor often. I… I’ve never been tested for allergies. I’m sorry. I wish I had more information.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mikeisha. It’s helpful to know either way. Okay, so no known allergies. Given your symptoms and the lack of allergy history, we'll proceed assuming it's likely non-allergic sinusitis, potentially chronic given the duration. We can start with some conservative treatment. I recommend a nasal saline rinse twice a day to help clear the passages and reduce inflammation. And I can prescribe a nasal steroid spray to help reduce the inflammation in your sinuses. It will take a few days to start working, so be patient. Would you be comfortable trying that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. A nasal rinse… and the spray. I can try that. I will… I will be patient. I trust your judgement. I… do I need to worry about my work? Is it safe to continue working with the drills?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mikeisha. Working with the drills, with the dust… it’s best to minimize your exposure as much as possible. I recommend wearing a high-quality N95 mask at all times while you're working, even if you usually do. And if your symptoms worsen, you should absolutely take some time off work to rest and recover. We want to prevent this from becoming a more serious issue. Do you have any concerns about being able to wear a mask consistently at work?
PATIENT: The mask… it can be hot. And… difficult to breathe in sometimes. But… I can try. I need to work. We have bills to pay. I will… I will do my best to wear it all the time. I just… I hope it helps. I am worried about getting sicker.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mikeisha. It’s a difficult situation. We'll do everything we can to help. The nasal rinse and steroid spray should provide some relief. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week or two, or if they worsen, please come back and see me. We may need to consider further testing, such as a CT scan of your sinuses, or a referral to an ENT specialist. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a short course of an antibiotic, just in case there's a bacterial infection contributing to your symptoms. But please only take it if your symptoms are getting worse, or if you develop a fever. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I’ve never had many problems with medicine. Just… a little stomach ache sometimes. But nothing serious. I… I appreciate you helping me. I was very worried.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. I’m glad I could help. Here’s the prescription for the antibiotic, and I’ll also print out some instructions on how to use the nasal spray and do the nasal rinse. I also want to emphasize the importance of staying hydrated and getting plenty of rest. And please, don’t hesitate to come back if you have any concerns. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is everything. You explained everything very clearly. I will… I will try my best to follow your instructions. Thank you very much. You are very kind. I… I hope I can come back to see you again… but only if I need to.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. That’s what I’m here for. And I hope it doesn’t become necessary to come back, but please know you can. Get some rest, stay hydrated, and wear that mask at work. If anything changes, don't hesitate to call the office. Take care, and have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
