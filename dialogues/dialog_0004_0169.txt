DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Minerd. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Well, it's this… puffiness, I reckon. Face and legs, mostly. Been gettin' worse lately. Not sure why it's happenin', though. Don't go in for much of this doctor stuff, normally.
DOCTOR: Puffiness, you say. And it’s primarily in your face and legs, and worsening recently. Alright. Can you describe the puffiness to me?
PATIENT: Describe it…? Well, it just… swells up. Like a balloon, kinda. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. Makes it hard to see outta one eye sometimes, the face part. And the legs ache a bit, feelin' heavy, ya know? It's not like a sudden thing, it’s been creepin' up on me for… oh, I dunno, a few weeks now, maybe longer. Hard to keep track these days.
DOCTOR: So, it’s a gradual swelling, not sudden, in your face and legs. Not painful, but uncomfortable and causing some vision difficulties in one eye, and a heavy ache in your legs. For several weeks, at least. Do you notice it's worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I think it's worse in the evenin', maybe? After I’ve been on my feet all day. Workin’ with the metal, ya know? Standin' for hours. But honestly, it's kinda there all the time now. It doesn’t really go away completely. Could be my imagination, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: It's not your imagination if you're noticing a change, Mr. Minerd. And standing for long periods at work could certainly contribute. Now, let's get a bit more detail. Do you have any trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? No, not really. I get a little winded climbin' stairs, but that's just 'cause I'm not as young as I used to be. Never had any trouble breathin’ regularly. No wheezin' or nothin'. I can still yell at the TV during hockey games, if that counts.
DOCTOR: Good. No shortness of breath or wheezing. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Urine? Now you’re askin’ things I don't usually pay attention to. Let me think… It looks normal, I guess. Yellow. Goes in, comes out. Like it always has. Don’t go lookin’ for fancy colors or nothin’. Honestly, Doc, I’m not much for details. Just want this puffiness to go away.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Minerd. However, changes in urine can be very telling. But alright, we can move on. Have you experienced any chest pain, or palpitations - that is, a feeling of your heart racing or fluttering?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Never had any of that. My heart… feels alright, I suppose. It beats. Sometimes it feels a little fast after I’ve been workin’ hard, but that’s normal, right? Like when you run up the stairs. It ain't flutterin' or nothin'. Just… beatin'. Always has been. Look, I’ve always been a strong fella. Still am, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or have you experienced any unintentional weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, I eat. Always have a good appetite. Like a horse, my wife used to say. As for weight… I don’t weigh myself. Never have. I’m probably a little lighter than I used to be, now that I'm alone and don't have her cookin' for me all the time, but it’s not like I’m disappearin’ or nothin’. Just… less food.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never been one for fancy foods or nothin'. Take a little penicillin now and then when I get a bad cold, and that’s always been alright. Never had any reactions. Dust gets to me sometimes, makes me sneeze, but that’s just dust, ya know? Not a real allergy, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my knees now and then. Helps with the achin’. Can't remember the name of it, though. Some kinda pain reliever. Bought it at the general store. Little orange pill. That’s all. Never been one for a lot of pills. My wife always said they were more trouble than they were worth.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned somethin' about it a few years back, but I didn't pay much attention. He wanted me to watch my salt intake, I think. Didn't really change much, to be honest. As for the rest… no, never been diagnosed with nothin’. Always been a tough Swede, ya know? Didn't get sick much, even as a boy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… Had my appendix out when I was a young man, back in Sweden. That was a long time ago. And I broke my arm once fallin' off a roof, fixin' shingles. They set it in a cast, and that was that. Aside from that… no, I don't think so. Mostly just bumps and bruises from workin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my father lived to be a good age, but he always had a bad ticker, I think. Kept coughin' and wheezin'. And my mother… she had some kinda trouble with her legs, got real swollen towards the end. Couldn't walk much. Aside from that, not really. We weren’t ones for keepin’ track of fancy medical stuff. Just Swedes, ya know? Tough folk.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife hated 'em. As for drinkin'... I used to have a beer with supper now and then, but not anymore. Don't really care for it much. And recreational drugs? What are you thinkin'? I'm a Swede, Doc, not some wild young fella.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Minerd. Thank you for that information. Now, I’m going to do a physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your legs to assess the swelling. Please lie back on the examination table. Your heart sounds…regular, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is elevated: 160/95. Significant pitting edema in both legs, extending to the ankles. Skin is warm to the touch. Okay. Based on your history and this exam, the swelling could be due to a number of factors. Elevated blood pressure, family history of leg swelling, and the pitting edema suggest a possible fluid retention issue. It’s unlikely this is a simple, isolated problem. We need to rule out more serious causes.
