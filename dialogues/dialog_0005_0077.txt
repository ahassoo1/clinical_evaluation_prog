DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Donate. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh. They told me to come. Something about the… the place I work. Been workin’ there a long time. Ain't nothin' wrong with me, though. I feel fine. Just… they said I had to come for checkin’. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, sometimes these things are just routine, part of keeping things up to date. Still, it’s good to get a baseline, even if you feel fine. Your employer does have your best interest at heart. So, just to clarify, you're here because your workplace requires a check-up?
PATIENT: Baseline? What kinda baseline? Look, I been diggin’ in that mine for… oh, close to sixty years now. Sixty years of dust and rocks. If somethin’ was wrong, I’d know it, yeah? They just want to be safe, I guess. Lawyers and rules, that's all it is. Don't need no fancy checkin'.
DOCTOR: Sixty years is a long time, Mr. Bigger, I can appreciate that. Dust and rocks can certainly take a toll, even if you don’t feel anything immediately. It’s not always something obvious, see?
PATIENT: Hmph. You think I ain't felt nothin' in sixty years? I've broken bones, coughed up enough dirt to build a small hill, and I still come to work every day. I'm a strong man. Strong Nigerian man. What kinda toll are you talkin' about?
DOCTOR: I didn't mean to imply you weren't strong, sir. It’s admirable that you’ve been working for so long. But things can develop gradually, slowly, over time, even with someone as resilient as you. It's about being proactive, catching potential issues before they become serious. Now, let’s just run through a few questions, alright?
PATIENT: Questions? What kinda questions? You gonna ask me about my wife? She passed, you know. Five years now. Don't need to talk about that. Just tell me when I can go. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Oh, I am very sorry to hear about your wife, sir. No, I certainly won't ask about that. I apologize if this feels intrusive, but these are just standard medical questions to get a picture of your overall health. It’s not about digging into personal matters. Let’s start simple. Any coughing or shortness of breath lately?
PATIENT: Coughin’? A little, sometimes. Dust, you know? Always dust. Been coughin’ since I was a boy. Shortness of breath? When I climb too many stairs, maybe. I don't go climbin’ stairs much these days. It's the young men's job. Now, are we done? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little coughing, and some shortness of breath with stairs. That's helpful. Just to be clear, has this cough changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? How would I know if it changed? It's a cough. It's always there. Maybe a little worse in the winter. Look, I'm tellin’ you, I'm fine. This is ridiculous. You askin' me about my cough like I’m a… a baby! I been coughin’ since before you were born!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this cough for a very long time. And I apologize if I'm belaboring the point. I just need to rule things out, alright?
PATIENT: Rule what out? What are you lookin’ for? You think I got some kinda… miners’ disease? Is that it? I’ve seen men come and go from that mine, good strong men. If I was gonna get somethin’, I’d know it. And I haven’t. Now, can we please just get this over with? I got a garden to tend to. Tomatoes won't grow themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Miners’ disease… pneumoconiosis, as we call it, is definitely something we consider with your history, yes. But there are many other possibilities. That's why I ask these questions. And you're right to say you'd likely know if something was seriously wrong. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs and check a few things. It won't take long. Sound good?
PATIENT: Listen to my lungs? You gonna stick a cold thing in my ear? I don't like that. Look, I'm an old man. Leave my lungs alone. I've lived this long breathin’ dust, they’re doin’ just fine. I really don’t think this is necessary. Just write down “fine” and let me go. Tomatoes are waitin’. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your reluctance. However, as your doctor, I do have a responsibility to assess your health. A simple listen to your lungs takes only a moment and can provide valuable information. I will be as gentle as possible. I assure you, it's not about finding something wrong, it's about ensuring everything is as it should be. If you absolutely refuse, I must document that in your chart. However, I strongly recommend allowing a brief examination. It’s better to be safe, alright?
