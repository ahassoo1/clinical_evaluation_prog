DOCTOR: Right. Aron Bulaong, 38 years old. Well, Mr. Bulaong, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's my chest. It… hurts a little. Not all the time, but… yeah, it hurts. Mostly here. <points to chest>
DOCTOR: "A little," you say. Well, "a little" can mean a great many things. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: It's not like, a bad pain. More like…sore. Like when you use muscles too much? But…I don't think I used muscles. It's just…there. Mostly on this side. <points to left side of chest> It feels…full, sometimes. I don't know if that makes sense. My wife told me to come. She worries.
DOCTOR: Your wife brought you in for…chest fullness?
PATIENT: Yeah. She said it’s not normal. And I…I guess it feels a little weird. It started a few weeks ago, maybe? Not every day, like I said. Sometimes it's just a little ache. And…sometimes it feels like it's inside, not just on the skin. It's hard to explain. I work on roofs, you know. Lots of moving around. Could it be…from that?
DOCTOR: Roofs, you say. Well, physical labor can certainly cause all sorts of discomfort. But "inside," you claim?
PATIENT: Yeah, like…deep inside. Not like a muscle hurt, more…in my chest. It's hard to tell. It doesn't hurt to touch it, not really. Just…feels uncomfortable. And sometimes, like when I lay down, it feels…heavy. I don't know if that makes sense. Is something…wrong? My wife gets scared about everything. She thinks it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: "Serious." Right. Well, let’s not jump to conclusions. But heavy when lying down…and inside… Hmm. Do you have any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, not really. I can breathe okay. Maybe sometimes when I’m really high up on a roof, I get a little…winded. But that’s just from climbing, I think. Not like…can’t catch my breath. And no fever, no cough, nothing like that. Just this…chest thing. Is it…bad to not have insurance? We can’t really afford it right now.
DOCTOR: Insurance is…a factor. Let's focus on the chest, Mr. Bulaong. Have you noticed any palpitations, any fluttering in your chest?
PATIENT: Pal…pal-pa-what? Sorry, I don’t…I don’t know what that means. Like…my heart beating fast? Sometimes, yeah. But that’s just when I’m working hard, right? When I’m up on the roof, climbing around. It feels normal then. Not like…racing all the time. Just when I’m busy.
DOCTOR: So, fast heart rate with exertion. Understandable, given your profession. Any nausea, dizziness, or sweating accompanying this…chest fullness and fast heart rate?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I feel okay. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just from work. Really, I just wanted to check if this chest thing was anything to worry about. My wife gets really worried, and I wanted to make her feel better. It's just… uncomfortable. It doesn't stop me from working, but it's there. It hasn’t gotten worse, but it hasn't gone away either. Is it…maybe just a muscle? From the roof?
DOCTOR: A muscle, you say. Possible, though your description is…vague. Alright, let’s have a listen to your chest, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm ready. <shifts nervously in his chair> I hope it’s not anything bad. My wife…she’ll be really upset if it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath…and exhale. Again. Hmm. Lungs sound…clear. No wheezing, no crackles. Heart sounds regular. A bit fast, as you said, but normal for someone who works physically. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s…sensitive, a little, but not like a sharp pain. More like…a dull ache, if anything. And…it feels like it’s deeper inside than where you’re pressing. Like…back here. <points to the middle of his chest> It’s hard to explain. <shifts uncomfortably> Is something wrong? Is it something serious? I really don't want to need…expensive tests.
DOCTOR: "Serious" is a strong word, Mr. Bulaong. It sounds like musculoskeletal pain, possibly from strain with your work. But "deeper inside" is concerning. Given your lack of insurance, we need to be practical. We'll start with some basic blood work—CBC, basic metabolic panel. And an EKG, just to rule out anything cardiac. If these tests come back abnormal, we'll discuss further options. Understand?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work and…E-K-G? That sounds okay. I guess. As long as it doesn't cost too much. My wife…she'll worry if it's expensive. And…what if something is wrong? What kind of things are you looking for? I just want to know what’s going on, and…make it stop hurting. <looks down at his hands nervously>
DOCTOR: The blood work will give us a baseline, check for inflammation. The EKG looks at your heart's electrical activity. We're mostly ruling things out, Mr. Bulaong. It's unlikely to be anything drastic, but we need to be thorough. We’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and she'll get you set up for the EKG. Don't fret. It’s a simple test. We'll call you with the results in a few days. If anything urgent arises, you know where to find us.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. <stands up slowly> I hope it's nothing serious. And I'll tell my wife. She'll be glad we're getting it checked out. <hesitates> Just…please call if it is something bad, okay? She worries a lot. <pauses, then offers a weak smile> Thanks again.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. We'll be in touch. Next patient. .
