DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Havird. I need to get a card… for driving, you see. A commercial driver one. I drive folks around sometimes with my car, and I think I need this to be official. It's for ride-sharing, mostly. Is that what this visit is for? I want to make sure we don’t waste time.
DOCTOR: A commercial driver's license… Right. Honestly, most people come in for actual medical issues. But, okay. So, you’re needing a physical for a commercial driving license. It's... a bit unusual to come to family medicine for that, but we can do it. It’s just... I’m not sure what specifically they need these days. Are you experiencing any health problems at all?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no problems! Perfectly fine, thank you. Just… getting older, I suppose. But nothing that stops me from driving. My back aches a little if I sit too long, but that’s it. Honestly, I just want to get this done and be on my way. Do you need a long list of things, or…? I’m a bit worried about all the paperwork.
DOCTOR: Paperwork is always the worst, isn't it?
PATIENT: Tell me about it! My ex-husband… never mind. That’s a story for another time. So, back to this card. What do you need to know? I have Medicare, if that matters. And I’m… let me see… I think it’s a ride-share thing, mostly, not big trucks. Does that change anything?
DOCTOR: It does change things slightly. Ride-sharing is... less strenuous than long-haul trucking, thankfully. Medicare is fine; we'll just need your card. Now, let's start with the basics. Do you have any major medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Blood pressure was a little high a few years ago, but the doctor said it was just stress and to watch my salt. I haven’t had any problems since. And no diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing. I used to walk a lot, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. Honestly, Doctor, I’m pretty healthy for a seventy-year-old. Is this taking long? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. We're getting there. Just trying to cover all the bases. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes. I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be twenty years ago now? And… a hysterectomy, even longer ago than that. But those were both ages ago, and I recovered just fine from both. No problems at all since. They didn't cause any trouble, I promise. Anything else you need to know about old surgeries?
DOCTOR: No, that’s fine. Old surgeries are… old news. Now, medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis. A small dose of ibuprofen most days. And sometimes Tylenol if the ibuprofen doesn't quite cut it. Nothing serious, just over-the-counter stuff. I don’t take anything else regularly. Really. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. Do you need the exact dosage? I have the bottle in my purse, if that helps.
DOCTOR: No, no, that's alright. We can usually verify that later. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Never had any reactions to anything. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I seem to have skipped that particular inheritance. I eat everything, take everything… well, almost everything. Just trying to get this card, that's all. Are we almost done? My appointment is at three.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's just do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough, and then we can get this over with. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… standard stuff. Please sit up straight.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Straight as I can. My back is a bit stiff, so don't expect perfect posture. I do try to keep in shape, honestly. Walking, you know, when my knees allow. Just get it over with quickly, if you don't mind. I hate sitting still for too long. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is... 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… regular, but a little faint. It could just be… well, age. Anything hurt when I press here?
PATIENT: No, nothing there. That feels… fine. A little pressure, but nothing painful. My back is always a bit sore, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine. Do you need to check my reflexes or anything? I don’t want to waste your time. This card is the only thing I need. Are we almost done now? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… a little slow, but within acceptable limits for someone your age. Okay. I'll need you to do a quick vision test. And I will need you to stand up and walk for me, just to check your gait and balance. That is standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Vision test first, you say? Fine. Is there a chart in here somewhere? And then the walking... Honestly, I do worry about tripping. My knees aren't what they used to be. But, fine. Let's just get it over with quickly, alright? I really do have an appointment to get to. It's at three, and I’m already running late.
DOCTOR: Just read the bottom line if you can. And please, just try not to fall when you walk. It would complicate things.
PATIENT: Um… okay. Let me see… F… P… T… Oh, and V. Yes. F P T V. That’s all I can make out, I’m afraid. My eyesight isn't the best. Glasses are getting stronger every year, you know. Is that good enough? Honestly, I should have brought my glasses. This is all rather stressful. Can we move on to the walking now, please? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just walk normally. I just want to see your gait. And please, be careful. Okay. You’re… a little unsteady, but manageable. Now, based on this limited assessment, and your reported health history, I can… tentatively approve you for a commercial driver’s license, with a few restrictions. But, given your slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished vision, I recommend you have a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician within the next three months for a more thorough evaluation. And you should probably see an optometrist as well. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. A primary care physician? Yes, yes I do. Dr. Tanaka, over at the community hospital. I see him every year for my check-up. I can make an appointment right away. Honestly, this has been quite stressful. So, I have the card now? Is there anything else you need? I really need to get going. My appointment is at three, and I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Here. This is a temporary certificate. You'll need to submit this to the licensing department, along with the other required documents. And please, follow up with Dr. Tanaka as soon as possible. Alright. That will be $75 for the visit. Have a good day. .
