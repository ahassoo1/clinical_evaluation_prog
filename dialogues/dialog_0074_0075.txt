DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been feeling awfully sleepy during the day, even though I’m using a machine at night for my sleep apnea. I’ve had it for… oh, must be eight years now, maybe nine. And it usually helps, but lately, not so much. It’s just… tiring, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Feeling tired despite using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea is certainly concerning. It’s good you’ve been consistent with treatment for so long. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this sleepiness?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it’s not like I’m falling asleep standing up or anything, but I find myself dozing off in the afternoon, usually after lunch. Sometimes just sitting in my chair reading. And it’s… harder to stay focused, you know? Like my brain feels a little foggy. It doesn’t happen every day, but enough that it’s bothering me. I used to be able to power through, but… not so much anymore. I’m 83, Doctor, things change, I suppose. But it's still frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Paske. It’s good you’re recognizing this change, and it’s absolutely worth investigating, regardless of your age. Feeling foggy and having difficulty staying focused is concerning. To get a better picture, could you tell me a bit about how you've been using your CPAP machine lately?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely. I try to use it every night, I really do. I have it set to the settings the doctor gave me years ago… I don’t think I’ve changed them since. I do sometimes take it off during the night if I need to go to the bathroom, or if it feels… irritating. Not every night, but maybe a couple of times a week. And sometimes, if I’m really congested, it’s just too uncomfortable to wear. I’ve tried those saline sprays, but they don’t always help. I clean it regularly, though! My daughter makes sure of that. She’s very good about these things.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're cleaning it regularly – that’s very important. And it’s helpful to know your daughter is involved, that’s wonderful. It sounds like there may be some variability in your CPAP usage, and some nights it’s more difficult than others. Let’s talk a little more about those nights when it’s uncomfortable. What specifically makes it uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly my nose, Doctor. It gets very dry and stuffy. Sometimes it feels like it’s just… blocked, even after I blow my nose. And other times, it feels irritated, almost like a raw feeling inside. It's hard to explain. The mask itself isn’t usually the problem, though it can feel a little tight sometimes. But it's mainly the dryness and congestion in my nose. And like I said, when it gets really bad, it’s hard to breathe with the machine on. I’ve tried different masks over the years, but none of them seem to make a huge difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good idea of what’s going on. It sounds like you're experiencing some nasal irritation and congestion, which is impacting your CPAP tolerance. Those symptoms can certainly contribute to daytime sleepiness. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, let’s see… I had my prostate removed about fifteen years ago, that was a bit of a… ordeal, but I recovered well. I also have some arthritis in my knees and hands, which slows me down a bit, but it’s manageable with medication. Oh, and I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I made a full recovery from that too. I’m generally pretty healthy for my age, I think. I used to smoke, years ago, but I quit about forty years ago. And I have high blood pressure, which is controlled with medication. I don’t have any allergies that I know of. Does that cover everything? I might be forgetting something…
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. It sounds like you've had a few medical challenges, but are managing them well overall. Knowing about the prostate removal, arthritis, pneumonia, history of smoking, and high blood pressure is important. And it's good you haven't noticed any allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications for any of these conditions – or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think… For my blood pressure, I take lisinopril, 20 milligrams every morning. And for my arthritis, I take ibuprofen as needed, usually 600 milligrams. Sometimes I take acetaminophen, Tylenol, if the ibuprofen isn’t enough. And… oh, sometimes I take a stool softener, because the lisinopril can cause constipation. That’s about it, I think. Just those three. I try to keep it simple, you know? I don't like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lisinopril 20mg daily, ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed for arthritis, and a stool softener as needed. Thank you for letting me know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my father had heart disease, he passed away when he was in his early seventies. My mother lived to be 95, but she had some dementia in her later years. I have one brother, he’s a few years older than me, and he’s generally healthy, though he has some mild diabetes. And… oh, my aunt on my mother’s side had sleep apnea, though she wasn’t diagnosed until she was quite old. She didn’t use a machine or anything, I don’t think they knew much about it back then. That’s about all I know, really. We weren’t a very close family, so I don’t have a lot of information about their medical histories.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart disease, dementia, and sleep apnea. That’s helpful information. Alright, Mr. Paske. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, and I'd also like to take a look at your nose and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. I'm ready when you are. Just let me know if anything feels… odd. I might be a little sensitive in the nose, you know, with all the dryness. But don't worry about that too much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. I appreciate your cooperation. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now. Sounds regular, no murmurs. Now, your lungs… breathing is clear, but a little diminished on both sides. That could be age-related, or related to your sleep apnea. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's take a look at your nose and throat… Alright. I see some redness and dryness in your nasal passages, as you mentioned. The turbinates are slightly swollen. Your throat looks clear, no significant inflammation. There's some mild dryness of the mucous membranes. Okay, everything seems consistent with your report. The nasal passages are indeed irritated and dry. Now, given your symptoms and the exam findings, I suspect the primary issue is nasal irritation contributing to difficulty with CPAP adherence. However, to rule out other possible causes and ensure we're on the right track, I'd like to order a few tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it helps to get a clearer picture, then absolutely. I’m happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. What kind of tests are you thinking about? Just so I know what to expect. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding, but I'd like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Paske. I want to make sure you're comfortable and informed every step of the way. I’m thinking a complete blood count, just to rule out any underlying infection. A basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. And a nasal swab to test for any potential allergens or irritants. We can also consider a sleep study repeat, but let's start with these initial tests and see what they reveal. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A blood count, metabolic panel, and a nasal swab… I can handle all of that. No problem at all. And you're right, let’s start with those and see what they show before we worry about another sleep study. Those things aren’t exactly comfortable, are they? When can I get these tests done? Is there a lab nearby?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve just sent the orders to the lab here in the clinic building, actually. It's just down the hall, room 203. The lab technician is expecting you. You don’t need an appointment. They’ll draw your blood and take the nasal swab. It should take about 30-45 minutes. While you’re waiting for the results, I'd like you to continue using your CPAP machine as much as possible. If the nasal dryness is particularly bothersome, you can try using a saline nasal spray before bed. We can also discuss some nasal lubricants if that doesn't help. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Room 203, no appointment needed… I can manage that. And I'll keep using the machine and try the saline spray. Maybe a little lubricant too, if the spray doesn’t cut it. I appreciate you being so thorough, and explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease, you know? I'll head down to the lab now. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns while you're waiting for the results. You take care, and I’ll see you soon.
