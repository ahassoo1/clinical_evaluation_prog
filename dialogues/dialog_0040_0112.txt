DOCTOR: Right, yes. Hello. Dr. Osga. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been having to go to the bathroom much more often lately. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, I can’t quite put my finger on how long, exactly. A few weeks, I think? Perhaps longer. It’s just… frequent.
DOCTOR: Frequent, you say. A few weeks… or longer. Honestly, people don’t keep track of these things. Alright. Is it only frequent?
PATIENT: Well… no, not only frequent. It’s… I don't feel like I empty my bladder completely when I go. There’s always a little bit left, if that makes sense? And sometimes, I feel like I need to go even when I’ve just been. It's… unsettling. I apologize for being vague. It’s difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Difficult to explain?
PATIENT: Yes, I suppose it is. It's just… a personal thing, isn't it? I don't usually discuss this with anyone. And to be perfectly honest, Doctor, I’m not very good at remembering details. My mind just… doesn’t hold onto those sorts of things very well. I apologize if that makes your job harder. Is there… is there anything specific you'd like me to try and recall? Perhaps about when it started, or what makes it worse? I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: Look, I have other patients waiting. “Doing your best” isn’t terribly helpful. Is there pain with urination?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no pain, thankfully. Not exactly. It’s not…sharp, or burning. It’s more… a discomfort. Like a little pressure, sometimes, before I go. And occasionally afterwards, a sort of lingering…emptiness. I do hope that’s descriptive enough. I truly am sorry for rambling. I’m not usually this disorganized. I used to be much better at these things…before my divorce, perhaps. But things have been…scattered, since then.
DOCTOR: Pressure before, emptiness after. Right. Any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those. No fever, chills… not nauseous, and certainly no vomiting. I have been a little tired lately, but that’s… well, I think that’s just life, isn't it? I work long hours. And I haven’t been sleeping well. But I wouldn’t say it's anything unusual. I wouldn’t associate it with… this. Is that making sense? It’s all so muddled in my head. Perhaps I should write these things down…
DOCTOR: Look, let’s get a urine sample. And frankly, your sleeping habits and divorce aren’t relevant. We need to rule out a simple UTI. Go use the restroom down the hall. Cup is labeled with your name.
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, of course. A urine sample. That makes perfect sense. I can certainly do that. A UTI… yes. I suppose that would explain things, wouldn't it? Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll go do that right away. Is there anything else you need from me before I go?
DOCTOR: No. Just… the sample. And try to be quick.
PATIENT: Right. Quick. Yes. I’ll be as quick as I can. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Honestly, the state of people these days… Finally.
