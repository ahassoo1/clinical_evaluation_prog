DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day. I read your… profile. Bicycle repair. Really. Anyway, I want to have a baby. And I want it to be easy. I don't want any of those… problems people have. Is that so much to ask? I’m not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “easy” is… rarely how these things work, Ms. Shteynberg. But we can certainly try to make things as smooth as possible. Let’s start with some basics. Have you been trying to conceive already?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not precisely. I’m… preparing. I figured I should get a check-up before I start. Common sense, really. I’ve had… experiences. Let's just say things didn't work out as planned with my ex-husband, and I’m not taking any chances. I want to know if there’s anything wrong with me before I even bother. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear. A preventative approach is… sensible. Alright. Let's go through some questions then, to get a better understanding of your medical history. We'll start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, really – like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. My ex-husband always said I worried too much about my health. I had… a touch of the flu a few years back. Nothing serious. And my gallbladder, they took that out, ages ago. 1998, I believe. And… well, honestly, I have good genes. My grandmother lived to be ninety-seven. I can't recall anything else of significance. Are we done with the past? It's all rather tedious, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Right. Flu and gallbladder removal. That’s… helpful. While good genes are certainly a plus, a history of no significant medical issues is still important information. Okay, any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Honestly, you're asking me to remember things from decades ago! Let me see... there was… a wisdom tooth. And… Oh! A rather nasty splinter when I was a child. My father took it out himself, quite the man he was. Is that what you mean by 'surgery'? Because truly, I’m not sure I’ve had any real surgery beyond those two things. And honestly, I doubt a splinter is relevant to having a baby.
DOCTOR: No, the splinter isn’t relevant. I’m trying to establish if there’s been any major surgical intervention that could potentially impact fertility. Let's move on, then. How about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Ugh. My mother… she had a bit of trouble sleeping. And my aunt… she liked to gossip. Is that what you want to know? Look, my family is… perfectly normal. No genetic diseases, no early deaths, just… ordinary people. I'm wasting my time here. Is there a quick test you can give me to tell me if I’m fit to have a baby?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your frustration, but a thorough medical history is essential. Simply saying there’s “no genetic disease” isn’t sufficient. Do you know if any of your relatives—parents, siblings, grandparents—have had any issues with infertility, miscarriages, or complications during pregnancy?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake! You're grilling me like a criminal! Honestly, no. No one discussed such things in my family. It was… unseemly. My grandmother… well, she had several children, perfectly healthy. My mother had two. Everyone just… got on with it. There wasn’t all this fuss. Is that good enough? Can we please just move on? I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can move on. Social history then. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not! Disgusting habit. My ex-husband tried it once. Once. I made him sleep in the shed. Do you need to know about drinking? I have a small glass of wine with dinner. Occasionally. It’s good for the heart, you know. A very small glass. Are we nearing the end of this interrogation?
DOCTOR: No smoking, occasional small glass of wine. Good. Now, medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And sometimes, if my joints ache, I take ibuprofen. A small dose. I don't believe in all these fancy pills unless absolutely necessary. And honestly, I doubt a multivitamin is going to prevent me from having a baby. It's common sense, really. Is that all? Can we finally get to the tests? I’m losing patience.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to some physical examination then. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your abdomen. Just relax and breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Your weight is 86 kilograms and your height is 186 centimeters. That gives you a BMI of... 24.9. Within the normal range.
PATIENT: Finally! Something useful. See? Perfectly healthy. I told you. Is that it? Can we proceed with the tests? I have… a very busy schedule, you know. And I'd like to know if I’m capable of having a child before I waste any more of my time. This whole process is terribly inefficient.
DOCTOR: While your basic exam is unremarkable, a physical exam is just one piece of the puzzle. To assess your fertility, we need some blood work to check your hormone levels and ovarian reserve. That will give us a clearer picture of your ability to conceive. We’ll also need a Pap smear to screen for cervical cancer, as that is standard preventative care. I’m going to order those tests now. The lab is down the hall, and they’ll need a urine sample as well. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials we should be aware of before you go?
PATIENT: Latex? No. I’m not allergic to anything. Honestly, you’d think I was made of glass with all these precautions! Fine. Blood work, urine sample, Pap smear. Can I get this over with? The sooner I know if I'm able to have a baby, the better. And please, tell the lab technician I don't have all day. I have a life, you know. A busy one. Do I need to fill out any more forms? This is becoming ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Just these forms, and then the lab technician will take it from there. They'll need a first morning urine sample. The nurse will give you instructions on how to collect that. Once the results are back—usually takes a few days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I understand your desire for a quick answer, Ms. Shteynberg, but rushing through these steps won’t provide accurate results. It’s important to be thorough. Do you have any further questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Just get it over with. Honestly, this entire experience has been… frustrating. I expect the results to be perfectly normal. And I expect a swift follow-up appointment. Don’t keep me waiting. I'll be going now.
