DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get right to it. It's this…stuff. Coming up. Regurgitation, the nurse called it. It's disgusting, frankly. Happens mostly after I eat, and it's been going on for…well, a while now. Not a fan.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’d like to get right to it, and I appreciate you being direct. “Stuff coming up,” or regurgitation, as the nurse noted, is certainly unpleasant. And it's good you're bringing it to our attention. When you say “a while now,” could you give me a sense of how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s not like I sit around keeping track of these things. Probably…six months, maybe? At least. It's not constant, thank goodness, but it's frequent enough to be a bother. And it's getting worse, I think. Honestly, I just want it to stop. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Altine, that is absolutely not too much to ask. We’ll certainly try to figure out what’s causing this and get it stopped. Six months is helpful. And you mentioned it's been getting worse – can you describe how it’s getting worse?
PATIENT: Well, it happens more often, for one. Used to be just after a big meal, now it’s after… almost anything. Even a little snack. And the amount…let's just say it's not dainty little bits anymore. It’s… substantial. And the heartburn! Don't even get me started on the heartburn. It burns all the way up, keeps me up at night. I take those little tablets, but they barely do anything anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increasing frequency, increasing volume, and worsening heartburn despite using over-the-counter tablets. That's definitely concerning. You said “little tablets” – do you know the name of those?
PATIENT: Ugh, names. Honestly, I leave that to my wife. She's the organized one. They’re…antacids, I suppose? Pink ones. Little pink tablets. They come in a cardboard box. I think there’s a picture of a stomach on it. Does that help? I really don't pay attention to these things. I just take them when I feel the burn. She buys them at the drugstore, the regular kind.
DOCTOR: That's okay, Mr. Altine, don't worry about the exact name. "Regular kind" of antacids gives me a good starting point. And the fact that they aren’t working as well anymore is important information. Now, let's talk a little bit about what comes up. Is it just food?
PATIENT: Just food, mostly. Undigested food. Sometimes it's…sour. Really sour. Like lemon juice. Makes my teeth feel funny afterward. And it smells… unpleasant. Look, I don’t need to go into too much detail, alright? It’s not a pleasant topic. It's just… food and sour stuff. And it's ruining my appetite. Which, believe me, is a tragedy. I enjoy a good meal.
DOCTOR: I completely understand; you don't need to provide any more detail than you’re comfortable with. Sour-smelling, undigested food, especially with the heartburn, is suggestive of a few things. Before we get ahead of ourselves, let’s go through some general health questions. Have you had any changes in your weight recently – either weight loss or weight gain?
PATIENT: Weight? Hmm. Not really, I don’t think. I’m a big guy, always have been. Maybe a pound or two around the holidays, but nothing significant. I’m fairly…consistent, if you know what I mean. My wife keeps telling me I should watch what I eat, but… well, that’s another story. No, no major weight changes. I eat pretty much the same as always. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent weight is good. And you mentioned your wife suggests you watch what you eat – do you have any difficulty swallowing before the regurgitation happens?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No, not particularly. Food goes down fine. It's what happens after that’s the problem. It feels normal going down, then… boom. Up it comes. Doesn't get stuck or anything. Just… comes back up. I can eat a full meal, no problem. It's not like I'm choking or anything. Just… unpleasant. Frankly, this is taking too long. Can we just get some medicine or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine, and I want to assure you we’ll get to a solution. We’re just gathering information to make sure we address the problem effectively. Since you don't have trouble swallowing, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any chest pain, other than the heartburn?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Now that you mention it… sometimes, yeah. It’s not sharp, more like a pressure. In the middle of my chest. Happens sometimes after a big meal, and it makes me a little… anxious, honestly. I'm a big guy, but my heart isn't what it used to be. Could be just indigestion, I suppose. But it’s unsettling. It feels…heavy. And it worries my wife. She keeps telling me to go to the doctor, which is why I'm here, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure in the chest – that’s definitely something we need to investigate further. It’s good your wife is encouraging you to get checked out. Now, let’s move on to a bit of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. I’ve been on medication for that for…oh, goodness, fifteen years maybe? And I had a little trouble with cholesterol a few years back, but it’s under control now with pills, thankfully. Otherwise, no. I’m a fairly healthy guy, all things considered. I used to be a smoker, but I quit twenty years ago. Best thing I ever did. Now, can we please get to the part where you tell me what you’re going to do about this…problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure for fifteen years, and controlled cholesterol. That’s helpful. And congratulations on quitting smoking twenty years ago – that is a huge accomplishment. Before we discuss treatment options, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It'll just take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. The quicker we do this, the quicker I can get back to my life. I have things to do, you know. And frankly, I'm getting a little tired of talking about…this. Just do the exam, and tell me what you think. Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I'll be as efficient as possible. Your heart sounds are regular, although I do hear a faint murmur. It’s not immediately concerning, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen feels soft, but I do notice a little fullness in your upper abdomen. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, possibly with some esophagitis—inflammation of the esophagus. The regurgitation, heartburn, chest pressure, and fullness in your abdomen are all consistent with that. The murmur, while not necessarily related, needs to be considered. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: GERD? Esophagitis? All those fancy words… Look, I just want it fixed. Allergies… Hmm. No, not that I know of. My wife gives me the pills, and I just take them. She handles all that. I don’t remember ever having a reaction to anything. I’m a pretty straightforward guy, honestly. So, what do we do now? Are you going to give me something stronger? Something that actually works? I’m tired of feeling like I have a fire in my chest. And I have a golf game on Saturday, I need to be able to eat!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Altine. I understand your frustration and the need for relief, especially with your golf game approaching. To get a better understanding of what's going on and to rule out any other potential causes, I’d like to order a few tests. A simple upper endoscopy would allow us to visualize your esophagus and stomach, check for any inflammation or damage, and take a biopsy if needed. A pH monitoring test can measure the amount of acid in your esophagus. And a basic blood workup will give us a broader picture of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Honestly. Look, I really don’t like going to doctors. It’s always something with the tests. I hate being poked and prodded. Is there anything we can do before resorting to all that? A stronger pill, maybe? A shot? I really don't want to have a camera shoved down my throat. And I have a busy schedule! Can't you just give me something to take, and see if that works? I'll try it for a week, and if it doesn’t work, then we can talk about cameras and…whatever a pH monitoring test is. Frankly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Altine, and I want to assure you I’m trying to balance the need for a thorough diagnosis with your concerns. Given your busy schedule and discomfort with immediate invasive testing, we can try a more aggressive medication regimen first. I'm going to prescribe a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI – a stronger medication than the antacids you've been taking – for eight weeks. This will significantly reduce the amount of acid in your stomach. I’m also going to recommend some lifestyle modifications – avoiding trigger foods like caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods, eating smaller meals, and not lying down immediately after eating. However, it's important to understand that if your symptoms don’t improve with this medication and lifestyle changes, or if they worsen, we will need to proceed with the endoscopy and pH monitoring to get a definitive diagnosis and rule out more serious conditions. Are you comfortable trying this approach?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get me the pills. Lifestyle changes… I’ll try. But I like my coffee, and I enjoy a good steak now and then. Don't expect miracles. Eight weeks, you say? If I’m still feeling like there’s a fire in my chest after eight weeks, I’m not going through with any cameras. Understand? I have a golf game to play, and I need to be able to enjoy it. Now, can we just get this prescription sorted out so I can get going?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Altine. I understand your concerns. Here is the prescription for a PPI. I’ll also print out a sheet with dietary recommendations and tips for managing your symptoms. It’s important to take the medication as directed – usually once daily, 30 minutes before a meal. Give it at least two weeks to see a noticeable improvement. If your symptoms don’t improve after two weeks, or if they worsen at any point, please call the office immediately. And as we discussed, if you’re still experiencing significant discomfort after eight weeks, we will need to revisit the option of further testing. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just the pills. And please, don't call me. I'll call you if I need you. Thanks. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have a golf game to prepare for. .
