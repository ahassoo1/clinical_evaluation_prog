DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Boham. Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, good afternoon, Doctor. Yes... my sinuses. They are… bothering me. It's been a little while, I think. Not good, really. I feel… pressure. Mostly here, <points to forehead and cheeks> but sometimes it goes to my teeth.
DOCTOR: “A little while”?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes. Maybe… three weeks? Four? It’s hard to say exactly, Doctor. Work is busy, and I don’t always pay attention to the dates. It's not a sharp pain, just… full. Like when you go up high on a plane, you know? But it doesn't go away.
DOCTOR: Four weeks of subjective “fullness”. Very precise. And you’ve noticed this… “fullness” extending to your dentition?
PATIENT: Oh… dentition? Is that… my teeth, Doctor? Yes, sometimes. It’s not always my teeth, but when the pressure is bad, I feel it there too. I’m sorry, I don’t… I don’t know a lot of fancy words. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: “Dentition” simply refers to your teeth, Ms. Boham. It’s a basic term. Now, have you attempted any self-treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A little. I try to drink lots of water, and I put… warm cloths on my face. And I use those… the little sprays for your nose? The ones you get at the store? But they don’t seem to help much. Not for very long, anyway.
DOCTOR: Saline sprays. Commendable, but hardly a rigorous medical intervention. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? Um… I don’t think so. I haven’t taken my temperature. I feel warm sometimes, but that’s probably just from working outside in the sun, you know? We’re out in the fields a lot. It’s been hot.
DOCTOR: And what precisely do you do in these “fields”, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: Oh! I work… with the drills. The big drills for the oil. Rotary drill operator, that’s what they call it. It's… a lot of work, standing and… operating the machines. It's good work, but it can be dusty, and it’s loud.
DOCTOR: Dusty. Excellent. Have you noticed any change in your sense of smell?
PATIENT: Smell? Oh… hmm. That's a good question. I don’t… I don’t usually pay much attention to smells, Doctor. Everything smells like oil and dirt at work! Maybe it's a little… not as strong as it used to be? I'm not sure. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit up straight. We'll perform a quick examination. I need to auscultate your sinuses, palpate your facial structures, and examine your throat. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. I will try to sit straight. Allergies? Hmm… I don't think so. Not that I know of. My husband gives me some pills sometimes for my… for my aches, but I don’t know what they are. I never asked him. And… latex? Is that like… rubber? I don't think I have a problem with rubber.
DOCTOR: Nurse, please bring the otoscope and a basic throat illumination set. Ms. Boham, please open your mouth. And try to relax. This will be much quicker if you cooperate.
PATIENT: Oh… okay, Doctor. <opens mouth slightly, looking apprehensive> Is something wrong? I am trying to relax… It just feels strange, having someone look in my mouth.
DOCTOR: Mild pharyngeal erythema, no visible exudate. Now, let me examine your sinuses. <Places otoscope in ears, briefly checks each ear canal.> External canals clear. Now, please lean your head back. <Auscultates sinuses with the otoscope.> Decreased resonance bilaterally. Palpating frontal and maxillary sinuses… tenderness to palpation present. <Stops, looking at patient over glasses.> You are experiencing significant tenderness. Do you have any nasal discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, it hurts when you push there. <winces slightly> And… yes, I have some discharge. Mostly when I wake up in the morning. It’s… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little yellow, but not much. I just wipe it away with a tissue. It’s not… a lot, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Clear to yellowish nasal discharge, associated with frontal and maxillary sinus tenderness. This points towards… sinusitis. Now, let's review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, chronic… hmm. That means long-term, right? I don't think so. I get a little… aches in my back sometimes, from the work. And my knees bother me when it’s cold. But I haven’t been to a doctor for any of it. My husband, he gives me some things for the aches… but I don't know what they are called.
DOCTOR: “Patient reports intermittent back and knee pain, self-treated. No known chronic medical conditions. Denies history of surgery. Family history…?
PATIENT: Oh! My mother, she… she had problems with her stomach when she was older. And my father, he was very strong, but he had a bad heart. I don’t know… anything else, really. We didn't talk much about health. It was just… different back then.
DOCTOR: “Mother with history of gastric issues, father with cardiovascular disease. Social history…?
PATIENT: Oh! Um… I am married, Doctor. And I work, as we said. I don't… drink a lot. Maybe a little wine with dinner sometimes. And I don't smoke. We live on a small farm, with chickens and… a dog. That is my life, mostly.
DOCTOR: "Patient denies smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Reports stable marital status and employment. Given your symptoms and exam findings, it appears you are experiencing acute sinusitis, likely exacerbated by environmental factors at your workplace. I will prescribe a course of antibiotics and a decongestant. However, I must emphasize that this is a symptomatic treatment. You really should consider finding alternate employment."
PATIENT: Oh… antibiotics? Okay. Will that… help the pressure? And… alternate employment? But… I need the job, Doctor. What else would we do?
DOCTOR: The antibiotics should reduce the inflammation and alleviate the pressure. But the constant exposure to dust and irritants will only prolong your symptoms. I can write you a prescription for amoxicillin, 500mg three times daily for ten days, and pseudoephedrine for symptomatic relief. <Begins typing furiously on the computer, printing a prescription.> Take the medications as directed. If your symptoms do not improve within a week, you must seek further evaluation. And frankly, a less… strenuous occupation would be advisable. Here is your prescription. And… I suggest you speak with your husband about alternative income options. Next patient. <Looks pointedly at the door.>
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Ten days… I can try. Thank you, Doctor. <Takes the prescription, looking worried.> But… we don’t have much money. I will talk to my husband. Thank you. <Hesitates, then slowly walks towards the door.>
