DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s about… long-term care, I think? My daughter, bless her heart, she set this up. Said I needed to get things… sorted. My memory ain't what it used to be, so I can't rightly remember all the details. It’s somethin' about helpin' out if I… well, if things get hard later on.
DOCTOR: “Sorted,” is rather vague, Mr. Rover. And frankly, concerning. It’s good your daughter is proactive, but we need specifics. Let’s start with this: are you experiencing any new difficulties with daily tasks?
PATIENT: Daily tasks… hmm. Well, I still get up and make my coffee, but sometimes… sometimes I forget where I put the sugar. Or if I did put sugar in. My wife, God rest her soul, always took care of things like that. I do okay, mostly. I still go fishin' a few times a week, but… I get lost easier now, even on familiar roads. Not often, but it happens. It worries my daughter, I know it does. Is that what you mean? Difficulties?
DOCTOR: Okay. Forgetting where you put things occasionally, getting lost on familiar routes… those could be normal age-related changes, but we need to rule out anything more significant. It’s important to differentiate between typical forgetfulness and something indicative of cognitive decline. Let’s go through a more thorough review. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate?
PATIENT: Concentrate… That's a good question. It feels… harder to focus, maybe. Like my mind wanders off. I used to be able to read a whole book in one sittin’, but now… now I gotta reread pages. Or I just… stop readin' and stare at the words. Don't always remember what I just read, either. It’s frustratin', to be honest. I don’t think I’m gettin’ dumber, but… somethin's different.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anyone commented on changes in your mood or personality?
PATIENT: My daughter… she says I'm more quiet now. Less likely to tell stories, I guess. I used to love tellin' stories about fishin' trips and workin' on boats. Now… well, I just don’t feel like it, most days. Not sad, exactly, just… less enthusiastic. Used to laugh a lot more, too. My wife, she could always make me laugh. It’s been… a few years since she passed, so maybe it's just… gettin' older. It's hard to say. Does that make sense? I don’t want to complain.
DOCTOR: It makes sense, Mr. Rover, but it's important to document these changes. We're building a comprehensive picture here. Have you experienced any problems with language—difficulty finding the right words, for example, or trouble understanding conversations?
PATIENT: Trouble understandin’… not really. Folks talk pretty clear, usually. But… sometimes the words… they don’t come easy. Like they're stuck on the tip of my tongue. Or I know what I want to say, but can't quite find the right words to say it. It happens more when I’m tired, I think. Or stressed. It’s… annoying. It’s not all the time, though. Mostly just little things. Like forgettin' the name of a tool, or… somethin' like that. I wouldn't say it’s trouble understandin', exactly. Just… slow sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Sleep… well, it comes and goes. I wake up a lot during the night now. Used to sleep like a rock. Now I'm tossin' and turnin', gettin' up to use the bathroom… more than I used to. Sometimes I just lay there for a long time before I can get back to sleep. My daughter says I snore pretty loud, too. But she always complains about something. I don't think it's anything major, but it ain't the peaceful sleep I used to have, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover. Now, let's briefly go through some medical history. Do you have any significant past medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let's see… I had my share of bumps and bruises workin’ on boats, that’s for sure. Had my appendix taken out when I was a kid. And… oh, yeah. Doctor told me I had slightly high blood pressure a few years back. He put me on some pills for it. I take ‘em regular, but… I can't remember the name of ‘em. My daughter handles my refills, mostly. Been pretty healthy overall, though. Never had any serious illnesses, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’. My wife, she was allergic to cats, but I never had that problem. Been around all sorts of things workin' on the boats – fish, paint, oil, you name it. Never bothered me none. I think I'd know if I had an allergy, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about medications. You mentioned taking something for high blood pressure, but you don’t recall the name. Do you take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Let me see… besides the pill for my blood pressure… oh! I take a fish oil pill every day. Doctor said it was good for my heart. And sometimes, when my joints are achin', I take some ibuprofen. Not every day, just when I need it. That’s about it, I think. My daughter keeps a list somewhere, but I don’t bother with it much. It’s all pretty simple, really. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to perform a brief physical and cognitive exam. It’s a standard procedure to assess your overall health and cognitive function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical… and… cognitive? What does that involve? I ain't too keen on tests, if you know what I mean. But… if you think it's necessary… alright. Go ahead. Just… take it easy on an old man, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rover. It will be quite straightforward. First, I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll assess your reflexes and coordination. The cognitive portion will involve some simple questions and tasks to evaluate your memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. It shouldn’t be unpleasant, I assure you. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not critically high. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6°F. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Heart sounds reveal a mild murmur, which we'll note. Lungs are clear. Now, let's proceed with the cognitive assessment. I'm going to ask you a few questions. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… uh… let me think. It’s… August, isn’t it? Yeah, August… the 2nd, I think. August the 2nd… 20…25? Is that right? My daughter tells me the date sometimes, but I always forget it right after. It’s hard to keep track, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where are we? This is… a doctor’s office, right? Your office, Doctor. It's… a nice office. Suburban, you said? I remember you sayin’ somethin' about suburban. I don’t know the exact address or anything. Just… a doctor's office. I haven’t been to many doctor’s offices in my life, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words. Please listen carefully. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Is that right? I think so. It’s… hard to hold three things in my head at once, you know? My memory isn’t what it used to be. But I got ‘em. Apple, table, penny.
DOCTOR: Now, I’m going to ask you a simple question. What year did World War II end?
PATIENT: World War II… uh… that was a long time ago. Let me see… I was just a little boy then. I remember my dad talkin’ about it… It was… 1945, wasn’t it? Or was it 1946? I always get those dates mixed up. I think… 1945. Yes, 1945. But I could be wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Backwards from 100 by sevens… uh… 100, 93… 86… 79… Uh… oh dear. This is harder than it looks. 72… 65… I’m losin’ track. 58… Wait, what was I subtracting again? Seven, right? I… I can’t do it. It’s too much. My brain just isn’t workin’ right.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover. That's enough for now. Based on this brief assessment, and your history, there are some concerning changes in your cognitive function – difficulties with recall, orientation, and calculation. While it’s possible these are age-related changes, they warrant further investigation. I recommend a comprehensive neurological evaluation, and possibly some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms. I will write a referral for you to see a neurologist. I also want to order some basic lab work, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 level. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Lab work? What does all that mean, Doctor? Is somethin' seriously wrong? I just thought I was gettin’ old and forgetful… My daughter will be worried sick. What are you thinkin'? Is it… is it Alzheimer's or somethin'? I don’t want to go to a bunch of specialists. I just want to be able to fish and… and remember where I put my coffee.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, it’s understandable to be worried. I’m not saying it is Alzheimer’s. There are many possible causes for cognitive changes, and we need to rule out other potential issues before reaching any conclusions. The neurological evaluation and lab work will help us determine the cause and develop an appropriate plan of care. Possible causes could include vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, medication side effects, or even depression. It’s important to get a clear diagnosis so we can address the underlying problem. I understand you don't want to go to a lot of specialists, but a neurologist is the best person to evaluate your cognitive function and determine the next steps. I will arrange for the referral and the lab work. The neurologist will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, it's important to avoid driving if you're experiencing difficulties with orientation or recall. Do you have any questions about the referral process or the lab work?
PATIENT: Avoid driving… that’s… that’s a good idea, I guess. My daughter's been sayin' I shouldn't drive at night for a while now. She's a smart girl, my daughter. The referral… will it cost a lot of money? My insurance is okay, but… I don’t want to burden my daughter with a big bill. And the lab work… how long will that take? I just want to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Any exercises for my brain, or somethin'?
DOCTOR: Let’s address your concerns one at a time. Regarding the cost, I will submit the referral and lab orders to your insurance company. Their coverage will determine your out-of-pocket expenses. Our billing department will contact you with an estimated cost breakdown once the insurance pre-authorization is complete. As for the lab work, the results typically take 2-3 business days. Now, about exercises for your brain: engaging in mentally stimulating activities can be helpful. Things like puzzles, reading, and social interaction can help maintain cognitive function. There are also some brain training apps and websites that may be beneficial. However, these are not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation. I'm going to write you a prescription for a multivitamin with B12. While it won't solve the problem, it's a good general health measure. I will also give you a list of resources for cognitive health, including information about support groups and local programs. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: A list of resources… that sounds good. And the vitamin… okay. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I still worry, of course, but I feel a little better knowin' that you're takin' it seriously. I'll talk to my daughter about the drivin' and… about everything. She’ll know what to do. I think that’s all for now. I appreciate your patience. It's hard to explain these things… when your own head is a little foggy. Thank you again, Doctor Duplichan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rover. I understand it can be difficult to explain these things. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll be here to support you and your daughter every step of the way. I’ll have the nurse print out the referral information, lab orders, and resource list for you. And remember to take it easy. Have a good day, Mr. Rover. And please, let your daughter know to call if she has any questions.
