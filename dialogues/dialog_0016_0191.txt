DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub! It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I requested to be tested for HIV. It's... something I wanted to get checked, just to be sure, you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Shaub. It’s very responsible of you to want to get tested – knowing your status is important for your health and peace of mind. Okay, before we proceed with the test, I’d like to ask a few questions to get a better understanding of your situation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, ask away. I'll answer as best I can.
DOCTOR: Great. To start, have you had any recent activities that might put you at risk for HIV?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a... direct question. Well, my husband and I, we've been married for a long time. But… a few years ago, before he retired, he traveled quite a bit for work. And, well, I wouldn’t say anything happened, but there were times… times I worried. It was a stressful period. Does that make sense? I haven't been with anyone else, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Shaub. It’s good you're being so open with me. Worrying is a valid concern, and it's good to address those feelings. Just to clarify, when you say "times you worried," were there specific instances that led to those concerns?
PATIENT: It wasn’t anything specific, Doctor. More of a… a feeling. He was away for long stretches, and I suppose I was insecure. We didn't discuss it much, honestly. It's not something we openly talked about. And like I said, nothing did happen, as far as I know. It’s just… a lingering unease, you understand? I wanted to put my mind at rest, that’s all. It's been a few years now, though. Perhaps it’s foolish to worry after so long.
DOCTOR: It's not foolish at all to want peace of mind, Ms. Shaub. And even if it's been a few years, getting tested is still a very good idea. Now, aside from your husband’s travels, have you ever shared needles with anyone, or received any blood transfusions or tattoos?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I've never shared needles with anyone, and I haven't had a blood transfusion. And I’m afraid I’m not one for tattoos. I find them… rather alarming, actually. I’ve always been quite careful about things like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Shaub. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections, like syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Never. I’ve always been very careful, as I mentioned. I’ve been with my husband since I was a young woman, and before that… well, I didn’t have much experience, to be honest. I've never had any issues like that. I’ve always been healthy, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Shaub. And have you ever had a major illness, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had a rather bad bout of pneumonia when I was in my thirties, but that was many years ago now. And I had my appendix removed, also quite a long time ago. Other than that, nothing serious. Just the usual colds and flu, you understand. Nothing that required a long stay in the hospital, thankfully. I’ve always been quite robust, even if I do worry a bit too much sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub, that’s helpful. Now, a few questions about your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members – parents, siblings, or children – have ever been diagnosed with HIV, or any other chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My parents both passed away some time ago, and they didn't discuss illnesses much. They were… a private couple. My siblings, well, I haven’t been close to them for many years. I believe my brother had some heart trouble, but I don’t know the specifics. And I don’t have any children, Doctor. So, no, I don’t believe there’s any family history of HIV, or anything chronic, that I’m aware of. It's not something we talked about much, honestly. Family gatherings were… formal.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub, thank you for sharing that. Now, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure medication, Doctor. I was diagnosed with slightly high blood pressure a few years ago, so I take a small pill every morning. And occasionally, I’ll take something for headaches, but that’s it. Nothing else, I promise. Just the blood pressure medication, and the occasional headache pill. I try to stay healthy, you see. I eat well, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. No allergies at all, as far as I know. My husband, he’s allergic to shellfish, but I’m perfectly fine. I can eat anything, thankfully. It's one less thing to worry about, you see.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Shaub. Okay, so based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re wanting to get tested for HIV due to past anxieties, and you haven’t had any behaviors or conditions that would put you at high risk. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is a very fair summary. Exactly. It’s… it’s been on my mind for some time, these old worries. And I just wanted to be sure. To put my mind at rest, you understand? It's a relief to finally be talking about it, honestly. It’s been weighing on me for a while.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shaub. It takes courage to address these kinds of concerns. So, we can proceed with the HIV test. We can do a blood test today, and it will take a few days to get the results back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. A blood test is fine. A few days is no problem at all. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns, and for being so understanding. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’ll have the nurse draw your blood now. She'll explain the process to you. Afterwards, I'd like to discuss some preventative measures, regardless of the results, and answer any questions you might have. While we wait for the results, it’s important to remember that any sexual contact carries some risk, and using protection is always a good idea. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Preventative measures are always a good idea. And I appreciate you reminding me about protection. It's… good to hear. I'm ready when the nurse is. Thank you again for your time and your understanding. It's a weight off my shoulders, honestly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. I’m glad I could help. I'll be right back after the nurse has taken your blood.
PATIENT: .
