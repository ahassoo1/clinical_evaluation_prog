DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. I'm Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, is just... I been drinkin’ a lot more water than usual. And I feel hungry all the time, even after I eat a good plate of food. Is worryin’ me a bit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Increased thirst and hunger can certainly be concerning. How long have you been experiencing this increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Is start maybe... a couple months now? Not sudden-like, you know. Just slowly gettin’ worse. At first I thought it was the heat, but is still bad even when is cooler.
DOCTOR: A couple of months, gradually worsening… alright. And has anything changed in your diet around the same time?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat mostly the same things. Rice and beans, some chicken or fish, vegetables when I have it. My husband does the cookin’ mostly, and he hasn’t change up the menu or anything. I haven’t been eatin’ more sweets neither, is not that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Have you noticed any other changes along with the increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Let me see… I does feel a bit tired more often, yes. Not all day, but especially in the afternoon. And... sometimes I have to go to the bathroom more times than usual. Is not a pain or anything, just… more frequent. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Increased urination and fatigue are important things to note. Are you experiencing any blurry vision, or any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Blurry vision... no, not that I notice. And I haven’t been weighin’ myself, but my clothes feel a little looser, maybe? But I wasn’t really payin’ attention, to be honest. I just thought is the heat makin’ me sweat more. Is hard for me to say if I lose weight or not.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a complete picture, have you had any family history of diabetes, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diabetes... hmm. My mother's sister, she have it, yes. She needin’ to take medicine for it. But nobody else that I know of. Is a long time ago, though. As for other conditions... I does have a bit of pressure sometimes, but nothin’ serious the doctor ever say. I try to rest when it bother me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anythin’ regular. Just sometimes a little painkiller for the pressure, but not even every month. And no, I ain’t allergic to nothin’ I know of. I does take bush medicine sometimes, from a friend, but is just for cough and cold, not for anythin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I also want to check your feet and do a simple neurological exam. It’ll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if is goin’ to be uncomfortable or anythin’. Is not a problem for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Now, let's take a look at your feet. Your feet look good, no obvious sores or swelling. Finally, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and sensation. Everything seems normal there as well. Now, given your symptoms of increased thirst and hunger, frequent urination, and family history of diabetes, I’d like to order a blood sugar test. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. A blood sugar test is a good idea. Is not a problem for me at all. Is better to know for sure, right? Just tell me what I need to do. Do I need to fast before the test?
DOCTOR: That’s right, it’s always best to be sure. Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the test. That means no food or sugary drinks – just water. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning, first thing?
PATIENT: Tomorrow mornin’ is fine, Doctor. Eight hours, no food... I can do that. My husband will make sure I don’t sneak any snacks! Is not a problem. And will I get the results quickly? I does worry a bit, you know.
DOCTOR: Good. I’m glad we could schedule that. Usually, the results come back within 24-48 hours. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of water. If you experience any excessive thirst, blurred vision, or feel unusually weak, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You explained everything very clearly. I does appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me. I’ll make sure to fast and I’ll call if anythin’ change. Thank you very much.
