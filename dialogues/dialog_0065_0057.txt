DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… about the cancer. I was told to come speak with someone. It’s all been very confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Cancer,” you say. Alright. That is rather broad. Could you clarify?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. My husband… he passed away earlier this year. He had… a sickness. The doctors said it was cancer. And… I’ve been feeling unwell myself lately. Tired, mostly. And some pain. They did some tests and… well, they said it might be the same thing. I’m sorry, I don’t… I don’t remember all the details. It was a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand this is difficult, Chellsea. It’s perfectly alright to be overwhelmed. Let's try to break this down. You've been experiencing fatigue and pain since your husband's passing?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It started… not right away, but maybe a month or two after. The tiredness is the worst. It’s hard to even get out of bed some days. And the pain… it’s in my bones, mostly. It comes and goes. It's not… a sharp pain. More of a dull ache. I just thought it was… grief, at first. But it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: “Grief can certainly manifest physically, Chellsea. However, it’s good you’re seeking medical attention. Can you describe the location of this bone pain more precisely?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. It’s… hard to pinpoint exactly. It’s mostly in my legs, I think. Both of them. And my back. Lower back, mostly. Sometimes it feels like it’s deep inside the bone, other times it’s more of a muscle ache. I… I haven't really told anyone about it. I didn’t want to worry them. It probably sounds silly.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Chellsea. It's important to investigate any persistent pain. And given your husband’s medical history, it's prudent we take this seriously. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I’ve been… losing my appetite, I guess. Not eating as much as I used to. And I've been… thirsty a lot. I drink a lot of water, but I still feel like I’m dehydrated. Oh, and… I’ve had a few nosebleeds. Nothing major, just a little bit. That’s all I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: "Losing appetite, increased thirst, and nosebleeds… alright. Have you experienced any fevers, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Fevers… not really. I might have felt a little warm a few times, but I didn’t take my temperature. Night sweats… yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I have been waking up soaked in sweat a few times. And… yes, I think I have lost some weight. My clothes feel a little looser. I haven't weighed myself, but… I can tell. It’s been gradual.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chellsea. Given your symptoms and your husband's medical history, I’d like to conduct a thorough physical exam. This will include listening to your heart and lungs, palpating your abdomen, and checking your lymph nodes. We’ll also need to review your complete blood count and possibly order some additional imaging. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s happening. And… if it’s something bad. I’d like to know. Please. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s begin. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: “Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Another one… deeper if you can.” “Heart sounds are… within normal limits, though slightly rapid. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.” “Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little… sensitive, maybe. But not painful. It’s just… uncomfortable. I haven't had much of an appetite lately, so I guess it's a little tender. Perhaps… a little lower down, on the right side. There.
DOCTOR: “Let’s check your lymph nodes now. This may be a little uncomfortable.” “Any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not in my neck. It feels… normal. I haven’t noticed anything different there. Perhaps… a little bit swollen on the left side, now that you mention it. But it's very slight. I don’t know if it’s always been like that.
DOCTOR: "Alright. Now, let’s check your armpits and groin." “The examination reveals some slight swelling in the left cervical lymph node, and mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant of your abdomen. These findings, combined with your reported symptoms, are concerning.” “We need to order some further tests to determine the cause of these findings.”
PATIENT: I understand. What kind of tests? Will they be… painful? And… what are you thinking it might be, Doctor? I know you probably don't want to say, but… I need to know. Even if it’s bad. Please.
DOCTOR: “The tests I’m ordering include a complete blood count with differential, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The blood work is routine and will not be painful, though there may be slight discomfort from the needle stick. The CT scan involves lying still for a short period and receiving a small dose of radiation. It is generally painless, but some patients experience mild anxiety in the scanner.” “Based on your symptoms and the preliminary findings, I am concerned about the possibility of a hematological malignancy, such as leukemia or lymphoma. However, it is important to emphasize that this is a preliminary assessment, and further testing is required to confirm or rule out this possibility. There are other potential causes for your symptoms, and we must explore all of them before arriving at a definitive diagnosis.” "Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. Leukemia… or lymphoma. That’s… cancer, isn’t it? A CT scan… and blood work. Okay. I can do that. But… what happens if it is cancer, Doctor? What are my options? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: “Yes, leukemia and lymphoma are both types of cancer, specifically cancers of the blood and lymphatic system. However, it's crucial to remember that there are many different subtypes of leukemia and lymphoma, each with varying degrees of severity and treatment options.” “If you are diagnosed with cancer, your treatment options will depend on the specific subtype, your overall health, and your preferences. These options may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and stem cell transplantation.” “As for the results, the blood work should be available within 24-48 hours. The CT scan results will take slightly longer, approximately 48-72 hours. Once we have the results, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a personalized treatment plan, if necessary.” “In the meantime, I’m going to write you a referral for a hematologist, a specialist in blood disorders. It's important to get their expert opinion as soon as possible.” "Do you have any questions at this moment?
PATIENT: A hematologist… okay. That sounds… good. To have a specialist. Yes, I have a question. My husband… he went through chemotherapy. It made him very sick. Is that… is that what it will be like for me? I don’t know if I could go through that.
DOCTOR: “I understand your concern, Chellsea. Chemotherapy can indeed have significant side effects, and it’s natural to be apprehensive about undergoing that experience.” “However, chemotherapy treatments have evolved significantly over the years. There are now many different chemotherapy drugs available, and doctors can tailor treatments to minimize side effects and improve quality of life. Additionally, there are many supportive care medications available to help manage side effects, such as anti-nausea drugs and medications to boost the immune system.” “It is also important to remember that not everyone experiences the same side effects from chemotherapy. Your experience will depend on the specific drugs you receive, your overall health, and your individual response to treatment. We will closely monitor your condition throughout treatment and adjust your medications as needed to minimize side effects and ensure your comfort.” “The hematologist will discuss all of your treatment options with you in detail, including the potential benefits and risks of chemotherapy. They will also answer any questions you may have and help you make an informed decision about your care.” "Here is the referral. I also want you to know, there are support groups for patients with cancer, and I can provide you with information about those as well."
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that helps. A little. I appreciate you explaining everything. And the referral. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. I just need to… process everything. .
DOCTOR: “Very well, Chellsea. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions or concerns. I wish you the best. Take care.” .
