DOCTOR: Alright, Kiante, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, thank you, Doctor Havird. It’s…well, it’s a bit unusual, I think. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. My travel insurance company requires it, after…everything. It’s for a trip next month, and I really don’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: A letter for flying… right. And what exactly is this “everything” you’re referring to?
PATIENT: Oh. It’s…my husband passed away six months ago. Sudden heart attack. He was…healthy as a horse, really. The insurance company just wants everything in writing, I suppose. They’re being…thorough. It was a shock, and now they need a doctor’s note saying I'm fit to travel, mentally and physically. It’s just a formality, I assume.
DOCTOR: Right. A… shock. Well, naturally, a sudden loss is… upsetting. Though I still need to assess you to write such a letter. It's not just about confirming you feel okay; I need to ensure there aren't any underlying issues preventing safe travel. Have you been seeing anyone for grief counseling?
PATIENT: No, not formally. I haven’t really…gotten around to it. I’ve been trying to keep busy, you know? Planning the trip, mostly. It was…his dream to go to Mongolia. I’m going in his place. I feel alright, honestly. A bit tired, obviously, but…I’m functioning. I really just need the letter. Is there a form I need to fill out? I’m happy to answer any questions you have, as long as it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: “Functioning” isn't a medical diagnosis, Kiante. And frankly, travelling after a significant loss… it’s often more complicated than people realize. Okay, let's start with the basics. Any changes in your sleep or appetite since your husband’s passing?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I understand it’s not ideal, but I am managing. My sleep…it’s been a bit patchy. I wake up a lot. And my appetite comes and goes. Some days I eat fine, others…not so much. I mostly just feel…empty. It’s not like I’m constantly bedridden or anything. It’s just…grief. I really thought a simple letter would be enough. Is that really so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Look, I’m not here to judge how you’re choosing to grieve, Kiante. But I have a professional obligation to assess your fitness to travel. Patchy sleep and fluctuating appetite could indicate something more serious. Have you experienced any… dizziness, headaches, or trouble concentrating?
PATIENT: No! No dizziness, no headaches. And I concentrate just fine, thank you very much. I work in advertising sales, Doctor. It requires a lot of concentration. Honestly, I think this is getting a bit ridiculous. I just need a letter stating I am physically and mentally capable of taking a long-haul flight. I understand you need to do your job, but I assure you I’m perfectly alright. Are there specific questions you need me to answer? Because I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Right. Advertising sales. Demanding work. Still, I'm going to ask a few more questions, and I expect straightforward answers. Have you noticed any changes in your mood besides feeling “empty”?
PATIENT: Look, yes. I get…sad. Very sad. Sometimes I feel angry. Mostly just…numb. It comes and goes. I don't snap at people, I don’t…do anything irrational. I just…withdraw. I spend more time alone. Is that what you’re asking? It’s called grieving, Doctor. I'm trying to cooperate, but this is starting to feel…invasive. Is there a checklist or something I can fill out to speed this up?
DOCTOR: Withdrawal and mood swings… alright. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself, Kiante?
PATIENT: Excuse me? That is…completely inappropriate. Absolutely inappropriate. I am requesting a simple letter, not a psychiatric evaluation. I lost my husband, I am sad, and you are now suggesting I might harm myself? I find that incredibly offensive. I think I would like to see another doctor. This is completely unacceptable. I’m going to need to speak to the clinic manager. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Kiante. If that's how you feel. I'm documenting your refusal of assessment. Perhaps a different doctor will be more… accommodating to your demands. .
