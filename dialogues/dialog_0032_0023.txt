DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I am Dr. Pipkorn. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Um, well, my chest hurts. Not all the time, but… sometimes. It’s my chest, you know? Like… where a woman would have… you know, breasts. It hurts there.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand you're experiencing chest pain. Could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Okay. It's… hard to explain. It’s not like a bad pain, like if I fell down. It's more… achy? And kinda… heavy? Mostly on this side. <points to left side of chest> Not always there, like I said. Sometimes I don't even feel it for days. Then it comes back. It doesn’t hurt to touch it, though. Just… hurts there.
DOCTOR: Hm. And when you say it comes and goes… are there any specific activities or situations that seem to trigger this ache?
PATIENT: Trigger? You mean… what makes it worse? Hmm… I don't think so. Not really. I work on roofs all day, so I’m moving a lot, lifting stuff. Maybe when I’m really tired? But even when I just sit around with my wife, it can happen. I don't know. It just… does. I haven’t changed anything I do.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Let me think… maybe… three months? Maybe four? It started small, just a little feeling. I didn’t think much of it at first. Just figured I was sore from work. But it hasn’t gone away completely. It comes and goes, like I said, but it’s been… consistent for a few months now.
DOCTOR: Okay. And apart from this chest discomfort, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Um… no, not really. No fever. No cough. No… lumps. Nothing like that. I feel normal, other than the chest hurting sometimes. I sleep okay, eat okay. Everything else is… normal. <pauses, looking a little worried> Should there be other things? I haven't noticed anything else.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good that you haven’t experienced any other symptoms. However, chest pain, regardless of its description, warrants investigation. Let’s move on to some general health questions. Do you have any history of medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Nothing like that. My wife always tells me to watch my salt, but… I’m pretty healthy. Never been to the hospital for anything serious. Just bumps and bruises from work, usually. My family… my parents were okay. They lived a long time. No… heart problems, not that I know of. <pauses> I don't really ask about stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but they just put a cast on it. No cutting, nothing like that. I don't like doctors much. <chuckles nervously> I only come when something really bothers me. And this… it’s starting to bother me more, that’s why I came. It just feels… weird.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of. My wife gave me some medicine for a cold once, but I didn’t have a bad reaction. Nothing I remember, anyway. I don’t take much medicine. Just when I really need it. I try to tough things out, you know? <shrugs> I don’t like feeling sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to perform a physical examination now. Please lie back on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. I need you to remove your shirt, please. It will allow me to properly assess the area of discomfort as well.
PATIENT: Okay. Take off my shirt? Um… alright. <looks down nervously> I guess so. <starts to unbutton his work shirt, looking a little embarrassed> Is it… cold in here? I didn’t think about bringing another shirt. Just came straight from work. It's kinda dusty. <removes the shirt, revealing a thin frame> I work hard, Doctor. It's honest work.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Again. And again. Your breathing sounds clear. Heart rate is regular. I'm going to palpate your chest now… just to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. <begins pressing gently on his chest, moving systematically across the area he indicated earlier, then expanding outwards.> Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. That doesn’t hurt. Just feels… you know, like being touched. It doesn't feel like the pain I get. It’s not sharp, or anything. It’s more… inside. Like a heavy ache. It's hard to explain. <grimaces slightly> It's kinda embarrassing, too. I'm not used to people touching my chest. <shifts uncomfortably on the table> Are you finding anything? I hope it's nothing serious. My wife will be worried.
DOCTOR: There is no apparent tenderness to palpation and your lungs are clear. Your heart rhythm is regular. However, given your description of the pain and the persistence of the symptoms, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to rule out any underlying cardiac or pulmonary issues. It is standard procedure, Mr. Bulaong. I understand you are not insured, and we can discuss options for cost-effective imaging at the local hospital. <pauses, looking at him directly> Do you have any history of smoking?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Never smoked a day in my life. My father smoked, but I always hated it. It smelled terrible. I work outside, plenty of fresh air. X-ray and EKG… that sounds… serious. Is it bad? I just want to know… is it something I should be really worried about? And… how much will it cost? My wife and I… we don’t have a lot of money. We’re just trying to get by. The work is hard, but it pays the bills. <looks down at his hands, a worried expression on his face.>
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, I understand your concerns. The imaging is not necessarily indicative of a serious condition, but it is necessary to rule out potential causes of your chest pain. We need to be thorough. As for the cost, I will have the billing department contact you with an estimate and explore any available financial assistance programs. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, should further imaging become necessary?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? I don’t know anything about dye. Never had any imaging done before. Never needed it. I'm pretty healthy, like I said. Just this chest thing. Allergies… no, I don’t think so. My wife says I’m allergic to dust, but that’s just because I work on roofs. <pauses, looking confused> So, you’re saying I might need more tests? What kind of tests? And… what are you looking for exactly? Is it my heart? I don’t want to have anything wrong with my heart. That runs in my family. <looks increasingly anxious>
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, I assure you, we are proceeding systematically. The initial tests – the chest X-ray and EKG – will help us assess your lungs and heart function. If those results are concerning, then we may consider further imaging, potentially with contrast dye. We are looking for a range of possibilities, including musculoskeletal issues, pulmonary problems, and cardiac abnormalities. <pauses, glancing at the computer screen> I understand your anxiety, but it's crucial to remain calm and allow us to perform the necessary evaluations. The X-ray and EKG are relatively simple procedures. I will write you a referral to the radiology department at St. Jude’s Hospital. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions before I do so?
PATIENT: St. Jude’s… okay. That’s… not too far from here. So, just an X-ray and… EKG? No dye right now? That's… good. <pauses, looking relieved> Musculoskeletal issues? What does that mean? Is it my muscles? I lift a lot of stuff at work. Maybe it’s just a pulled muscle? <looks hopeful> That would be good, right? Just a pulled muscle. My wife will be so happy. <pauses again> And the billing department… they'll really try to find something that's… affordable? Because we… we really can’t afford a lot. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… explaining everything. <looks a little less anxious, but still worried>
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, musculoskeletal issues refer to problems with your muscles, bones, and joints. It is possible your pain is related to strain from work, but we must rule out other, more serious possibilities. The billing department will contact you regarding cost-effective options. I will also note your financial concerns in your chart. Please schedule the X-ray and EKG as soon as possible and follow up with me once you have the results. <pauses, looking at him directly> Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. I understand. Schedule the X-ray and EKG… and bring the results back to you. And the billing department will call. I will… try to do that as soon as possible. Thank you, Doctor. <takes the slip of paper and carefully puts it in his pocket> I hope it's just a pulled muscle. <pauses, looking a little lost> Is there anything else I should be doing? Any medicine I should take in the meantime? Before the tests? <looks at her hopefully>
DOCTOR: For now, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, if you are experiencing significant discomfort. However, I advise against prolonged use. It is best to avoid strenuous activity until we have a clearer understanding of the cause of your pain. <pauses, looking at him directly> I do not want you overexerting yourself before we have results. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… okay. I think my wife has some. No, I don’t think so. That’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. <starts to get up, looking a little relieved but still anxious> I will schedule the tests as soon as I can. And I’ll call if I have any… problems. <pauses, looking a little embarrassed> I hope it’s nothing serious. <starts to walk towards the door, looking a little lost> Thank you. <exits the room>
