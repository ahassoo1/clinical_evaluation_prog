DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Coby, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Sammie Coby. Though most folks just call me Sammie. What’s this about, exactly? I don’t have time to sit around all day, you know. I got work to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we all have commitments. You’re here for a general check-up, according to the notes. But let’s get to why you’re actually here. What’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: Heat, mostly. Can’t stand it anymore. Always been able to handle a bit of sun, worked outside my whole life, but this year… it’s different. Feels like I’m gonna melt just walking to the truck. And it ain't even that hot, not like it used to be. People these days are too soft, always complainin’ about the temperature. But I'm telling you, something’s off.
DOCTOR: “Heat intolerance.” Alright. And when did you first notice this change?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, I’d say around springtime, maybe April. But it’s been gettin’ worse every week since then. Not a sudden thing, just… creepin’ up on me. I thought I was just gettin’ old, to be honest. But it’s more than that. Makes a man feel useless, not bein’ able to work a full day.
DOCTOR: "Useless," you say. And besides feeling overheated, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? I sweat, of course. Everyone sweats when it’s hot. And I get a bit… cranky, I suppose. My daughter keeps tellin’ me to drink more water. Honestly, she treats me like I'm a child sometimes. But other than that… no, not really. Just the heat. It's just… exhausting. Like my body's workin' overtime for no reason.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, increased sweating, irritability… exhaustion. Have you noticed any changes in your thirst?
PATIENT: Thirst? Well, I drink when I'm thirsty, don't I? Seems pretty obvious. I haven’t been keepin’ track, if that’s what you’re askin’. I’ve always been a practical man, not one for fussin' over every little thing. My daughter’s always goin’ on about hydration, like I’ve never had a drink of water in my life. But no, nothin' different about my thirst, not that I’ve noticed.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any dizziness, headaches, or nausea with this exhaustion?
PATIENT: Now you’re just askin’ silly questions. Dizziness? No. Headaches? Sometimes. But I get headaches. Everyone gets headaches. Old age, probably. Nausea? No, I don’t get sick to my stomach. Look, I'm a painter and builder, I work hard. I don’t have time for feelin’ poorly. I just can’t handle the heat like I used to, is that so hard to understand?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not hard to understand. Let's move on. Any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite's fine. Always been a good eater. Steak, mostly. And weight… probably a bit heavier, if I’m honest. Been less active, with this heat keepin’ me indoors. Not a big deal. I'm a solid man, built for hard work. Not one of those skinny fellas. But I ain’t gained a ton of weight, if that's what you're thinkin’. Just… softer around the edges, maybe. It's the weather, I tell ya. It’s messin’ with my constitution.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, Mr. Coby, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. Took some pain pills after I messed up my back a few years ago. Didn’t like how they made me feel, so I just toughed it out. I prefer to avoid pills if I can. They just mask the problem, don’t fix it. I don’t have any known allergies, no. I'm a pretty simple man. Plain food, hard work, that's all I need.
DOCTOR: According to your chart, you’re currently taking Lisinopril. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Lisinopril? Now hold on a minute… I don't recall takin’ anythin’ like that. My daughter… she sometimes handles my appointments, fills my prescriptions. Maybe she put that down? I’m sure I would remember takin’ a pill every day. No, I don’t take Lisinopril. She’s a good girl, but… sometimes she gets things mixed up. I haven’t taken a single pill in months, maybe longer. Are you sure that's right?
DOCTOR: The record indicates it was prescribed six months ago for high blood pressure. We can verify with the pharmacy, if you'd like. And, just to be thorough, do you have any family history of heart problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Diabetes? Never. My family is as hardy as the mountains. My father lived to be ninety, workin’ on his farm until the very end. And his father before him. We don't get those sorts of ailments. It’s this heat, I'm tellin' ya. It's somethin’ in the air, or the water… not my blood pressure. And no, I don’t need to call the pharmacy. My daughter probably just misunderstood somethin’ when she was talkin' to the doctor. I know my own body. And it ain’t breakin’ down because of blood pressure. It’s this blasted heat. I’m startin’ to get a headache just talkin’ about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It won't take long. Can you step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Fine. But don't expect miracles. I haven't weighed myself in ages. Probably a bit heavier than I used to be, with all this inactivity. Don't go makin' a fuss about it. I’m a solid man. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: 92 kilograms. And your height is listed as 1.72 meters. That puts your BMI at 31. That is considered obese. Now, let’s take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a seat.
PATIENT: Obese? Now you're just bein' ridiculous. I'm a strong man, not obese. Strong and solid. These numbers don’t mean nothin’. My father was a big man too, and he lived a long life. And don't go tellin’ me what my numbers are, I know my own body. I’m a practical man, I trust what I feel, not what some machine tells me. Get it over with, then. But I still think you're wrong.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 158/92. Heart sounds are regular, but a little distant. Lungs are clear, but there's some slight wheezing. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Hey! Watch it! I'm a sensitive man, you know. And what does “distant” mean, anyway? My heart’s perfectly fine. Always been strong as an ox. I’ve built houses, for goodness sake! And wheezing? Just a little dust, probably. I work outside. What's the point of all this, anyway? You’re makin’ a big deal out of nothin’. I just can't handle the heat, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on these findings, and your reported symptoms, I believe further investigation is warranted. Your blood pressure is elevated, which could be contributing to the wheezing and your fatigue. It's important to rule out any underlying cardiovascular issues. I'm going to order some blood work and an EKG to get a clearer picture of your health. And I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist as well.
PATIENT: A cardiologist?! You’re tellin’ me I need to see a heart doctor? Because I can’t handle the heat? This is absurd. I’ve never had a problem with my heart in my life. This is a waste of time and money. I'm not payin' for all these fancy tests just because a machine says my blood pressure is a little high. And don’t even get me started on blood work. I hate needles! Look, I appreciate you listenin’, but I think I’m gonna get a second opinion. This whole thing is ridiculous. I came here because I’m hot, not because I’m dyin' of a heart attack. I think I’m done here. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Coby. I respect your decision. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. Ignoring these potential issues could have serious consequences. I will provide you with a referral to a cardiologist and the lab order for the blood work, should you change your mind. Please take this information with you. Have a good day. .
