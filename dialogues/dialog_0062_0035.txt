DOCTOR: Hi Mirriam, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… oh, goodness, a couple of days now. Not constantly, but they just pop up out of nowhere! It’s a bit annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of days of hiccups. That is annoying! Let's try to figure out what might be going on. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they don’t really have a pattern, if that makes sense. Sometimes they come after I eat, sometimes when I'm just sitting and relaxing. I was gardening yesterday, beautiful hibiscus blooms, and one just jumped out then! Not painful, just… startling. And a bit tiring after a while, all that hic! I haven’t changed anything in my diet, or done anything different lately, not that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no real pattern, happening with eating or just at rest, and not associated with any changes in your routine. That’s helpful. Have you tried anything to get rid of them already?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! My granddaughter, Lani, told me to hold my breath, you know? And I tried drinking water really fast, upside down too! She saw it on… TikTok, I think it was. Didn't do much, sadly. Old remedies, too – a spoonful of sugar. That just made me feel a bit sticky! It’s stubborn, this one.
DOCTOR: TikTok remedies, huh?
PATIENT: Oh, you know these young people and their phones! Always something new. But no, nothing seems to work, Doctor. That’s why I thought I'd better come see someone who knows what they're doing! It’s not serious, I don’t think, just… persistent. And a bit embarrassing when I'm out with friends!
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in. Even if it's not serious, persistent hiccups can be really disruptive. Now, let's get a little more information. Do you have any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no cough, nothing like that. My stomach feels alright, maybe a little gassy sometimes, but I’ve always been a bit like that. No heartburn or anything, and I haven't noticed any trouble swallowing. Just the hiccups, really. Oh! And I might be a little more tired than usual, but I’m 86, you know. Things slow down eventually!
DOCTOR: Right, no fever, cough, heartburn, or trouble swallowing, and just a little extra tiredness. That's good to know. Let's talk a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not a great deal, thankfully. I had my gallbladder out years ago, back in the… oh, goodness, the 70s, I think it was. And I had a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it's not too bad these days, just a little stiffness in the mornings. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think! I used to be a psychiatric aide, so I was always on my feet, lots of activity. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and things, but nothing major. Oh, and I'm divorced, been that way for a long time now. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t count, but thank you for sharing. So, gallbladder out in the 70s and some arthritis in your hands. That’s good to know. Any major surgeries besides the gallbladder?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. I had a little procedure on my knee once, years ago, just to clean things up inside, but it wasn't a full surgery. And I’ve had the usual vaccinations, tetanus and things, but nothing major. I was always pretty lucky with my health, actually. I always ate a good diet, lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, and stayed active. Still do, as much as I can!
DOCTOR: Okay, just the knee procedure and regular vaccinations. That's helpful. Now, thinking about your family… are there any health problems that run in your family that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my brother had some trouble with his heart later in life. And my father… he just got old, you know? Everything just sort of wore out! Nothing major that I can think of, really. We weren't a family that talked about our illnesses much. Lots of strong, silent types.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother and heart trouble in your brother. Good to know. Now, just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis. It’s called naproxen, I think. Just a small dose, once a day. And sometimes, if my arthritis is really bothering me, I’ll take paracetamol. But that’s about it. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, you know? I prefer to keep things natural if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen for arthritis, and paracetamol as needed. And no allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve been taking those for years, and never had any trouble. I used to work with a lot of patients who did have allergies, so I always paid attention to that sort of thing! I remember one patient was allergic to penicillin… quite a reaction! But no, I'm pretty clear in that department, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's excellent. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your throat.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm used to being poked and prodded! I used to do the same thing to my patients, remember? Always good to check things out properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths in and out for me...and again... Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Palpating your neck… no enlarged lymph nodes. Your abdomen is soft, not tender. Everything seems normal on initial exam. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72. Hmm. It’s a bit unusual to have persistent hiccups with a completely normal exam.
PATIENT: Well, that’s good to know everything seems normal, I suppose. But it’s still annoying! So, what does that mean, Doctor? Are my hiccups just… a mystery then? Is there anything you can do? Perhaps it’s just something I have to wait out? I’m not looking for a miracle cure, you understand, just some idea of what’s going on, and whether I should be worried.
DOCTOR: It's not a mystery, necessarily, but it is a bit puzzling. Persistent hiccups can sometimes be caused by something simple, like a bit of irritation to the diaphragm, but often the cause is unknown. Given your normal exam and history, it’s unlikely to be anything serious. However, because they’ve been going on for a couple of days, and they're bothering you, I think we should do a couple of tests just to be on the safe side. I’d like to order a blood test to check your electrolytes and rule out any imbalances, and a chest x-ray just to make sure there's nothing going on in your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will rule things out, then yes, please do. I'd rather be safe than sorry, you know. Blood test and chest x-ray… alright. When can I get those done? And will they take long? I have a hibiscus garden to tend to! I don’t want my blooms to suffer while I'm off getting poked and prodded again.
DOCTOR: I understand completely about your hibiscus garden! Okay, I'm sending an order to the lab now, and a request for a chest x-ray. You can get the blood test done here at the clinic, it will only take a few minutes, and they can draw the blood right away. The x-ray will need to be done at the imaging center down the street, it should be a quick appointment – maybe 30 minutes or so. I'll have the receptionist schedule that for you now. While we wait for the results, if the hiccups become significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms like shortness of breath or chest pain, please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. We're just being cautious. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Blood test here and x-ray down the street… I can manage that. And I understand about being cautious. Better safe than sorry, as you say. Hibiscus can wait a little longer, I suppose. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for doing the tests. I feel much better knowing we're checking things out properly. Hopefully, it's just a silly little hiccup after all! Do I need to do anything to prepare for the tests? Fasting, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. And no, no special preparation is needed for either test. You can eat and drink normally before both the blood test and the x-ray. The receptionist will give you all the details about where to go for the x-ray and any paperwork you might need. Once you've had the tests done, just let us know, and we’ll review the results as soon as they come in. In the meantime, try to relax and enjoy your hibiscus garden! If they are still bothering you, and you feel comfortable, you can try a teaspoon of sugar mixed in a glass of water. It doesn’t always work, but it's a harmless trick. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate it. Sugar in water… alright, I’ll keep that in mind. It can’t hurt to try! Thank you again for everything. I’ll let your receptionist know I’m ready to schedule the x-ray. I'm looking forward to getting to the bottom of this, so I can get back to my garden! Have a lovely day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. It was a pleasure meeting you. And I hope you get back to your hibiscus garden soon! If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to call. Have a lovely day as well, and enjoy your blooms!
