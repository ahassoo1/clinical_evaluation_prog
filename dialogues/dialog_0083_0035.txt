DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. They just won’t go away! It’s been… goodness, I think about three days now. A bit bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Three days, that is a bit persistent. I understand they can be quite irritating. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, they’re… regular, I suppose. Not like, a whole fit of them, just one at a time. And they feel… normal, if that makes sense? Not painful, just… a jolt. Sometimes they come after I eat, sometimes just… randomly. I was having a lovely cup of tea yesterday and hic – there it is again! – right in the middle of a story. It’s a bit embarrassing, truth be told.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does sound frustrating. And it’s good to know they aren’t painful. Random occurrence and association with eating are helpful details. Now, Ms. Sucich, have you noticed anything specifically that seems to trigger them, besides eating?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… Well, my grandson, little Kaito, was visiting last week, and he was tickling me a lot. I did get a bout of hiccups then, but he tickles me all the time and I don't always get them. And… oh! I was a bit startled by a loud car horn the other day too, and started hiccuping after that. But again, plenty of loud noises don’t bother me. It's just… unpredictable, really. I wish I knew what was causing them!
DOCTOR: Unpredictable is a good way to describe it. Okay, let's try to get a broader picture. Besides the hiccups themselves, have you experienced any other symptoms along with them?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, no, not really. I've been feeling quite alright, actually. No heartburn, no bloating, no trouble breathing… just the hiccups! My appetite's been normal, I've been sleeping okay… everything else is as it should be, thankfully. It's just these pesky little… hic… interruptions! They don’t hurt, mind you, just annoying.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear that you're otherwise feeling well. No associated symptoms is certainly reassuring. Now, Ms. Sucich, do you have any significant medical history that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Well, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, back in… oh goodness, must be thirty years now. And I had a bit of a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was a long time ago, and I recovered fully. Other than that… not much, really. I’ve always been a pretty healthy woman, all things considered. Oh! And I used to get migraines, but they haven’t bothered me for years. I haven't taken any medication for anything regularly in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, pneumonia in the past, and a history of migraines that have since resolved. That’s helpful information. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter remedies or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, not a single thing. I try to avoid pills as much as possible, if I can help it. I believe in letting nature take its course, you see. I take a little bit of turmeric in my tea sometimes, for the joints, but that’s about it. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. Just the turmeric now and then. And I don’t smoke, and I only have a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally. A good, Fijian habit, that is!
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No regular medications and a healthy lifestyle are certainly positive. Now, Ms. Sucich, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, and never had a problem. And I’ve been around plenty of flowers and animals, and never had a sniffle or a rash. I think I’m quite lucky, really. I don’t recall ever having an allergic reaction to anything at all!
DOCTOR: That is excellent. No known allergies is very good to know. Now, Ms. Sucich, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 92, a very strong woman. She had a bit of high blood pressure towards the end, but otherwise, she was quite healthy. My father passed away earlier, in his seventies, from a heart condition. And my brother… he had some trouble with his digestion, but nothing major. As for anyone else… well, I don’t know much about my ancestors, to be honest. We didn’t really keep records, back in Fiji. A good, strong family though, for the most part! No history of anything particularly worrying that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with hypertension, father with a heart condition, and no significant family history of concerning illnesses. Now, Ms. Sucich, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s perfectly alright. Go right ahead, Dr. Alanes. I trust your judgment completely. It’s good to be thorough, you know. Anything to get rid of these pesky hiccups! I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sucich, take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular and lungs are clear. Your throat looks healthy, no signs of irritation. I don't detect any obvious cause for the hiccups at this time. Blood pressure is 130/80. Now, the good news is everything sounds normal. Hiccups are often benign and self-limiting. Given your history, it’s unlikely to be anything serious. However, since they've persisted for three days, we can consider a few things.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear everything sounds normal! Self-limiting… is that a good thing? Meaning they’ll just… stop on their own? That would be wonderful. What sort of things could we consider, then? I'm happy to try anything to get rid of them, as long as it’s nothing too drastic, mind you. I’m a bit old for surprises these days!
DOCTOR: Yes, self-limiting means they should resolve on their own eventually. And you are right, we don't want anything drastic. Sometimes hiccups are triggered by things like a full stomach, carbonated beverages, or even stress. Other times, they can be caused by minor irritation to the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm. Since we’ve ruled out any obvious medical cause, let's start with some simple measures. Have you tried holding your breath for a short period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, holding my breath… yes, I think I did try that once, but only for a few seconds. Didn’t seem to do much good, to be honest. And I don’t drink carbonated drinks, I prefer tea, as you know. And I’m not feeling particularly stressed, not at all. Just a bit annoyed by the hiccups themselves, I suppose! Is there anything else we could try? Perhaps some sort of… a remedy? My grandmother used to have all sorts of herbal teas for everything!
DOCTOR: Yes, there are a few things we can try. Sipping a glass of water slowly can sometimes help. Some people find relief from swallowing a teaspoon of sugar. Although it sounds odd, it can stimulate the vagus nerve and reset the diaphragm. We could also consider a medication, but I'd prefer to avoid that unless absolutely necessary. Since these have persisted for three days, and you’re otherwise healthy, I suggest we try the simple remedies for a couple more days. If they don’t improve, we can revisit this and potentially consider a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Dr. Alanes. I'm happy to try the water and sugar. My grandmother always said a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down! I’ll give those a try for a couple of days, and if they don’t work, I’ll come back and see you. A gastroenterologist… well, I hope it doesn’t come to that, but I trust your judgment completely. Thank you for listening to me, and for not making me feel like I’m being silly about a few hiccups!
DOCTOR: You're not being silly at all, Ms. Sucich. It’s always best to investigate persistent symptoms. And you are very welcome. So, to summarize, we’ll try sipping water slowly and a teaspoon of sugar as needed for the next two days. If the hiccups continue beyond that, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can discuss a referral. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Dr. Alanes. Thank you again for your time and your kindness. I feel much better knowing I'm not alone in this hiccup predicament! I’ll try the sugar and water, and hopefully, they’ll be gone before you know it. Have a lovely day!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sucich. I’m glad I could help. And I wish you a lovely day as well. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Take care.
