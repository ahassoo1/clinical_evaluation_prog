DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Pipkorn. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it is… the gas. I have a lot of it. More than is comfortable, if you understand. It has been happening for… oh, perhaps a month now, maybe a little longer. It’s quite embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Embarrassing, yes, I can appreciate that. A month or so, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately. It’s not constant, you understand. It comes and goes. But when it comes, it is… significant. I try to be polite, but… it is difficult. It happens after I eat, usually. Not every time, but mostly. Do you need to know what I eat? I can tell you, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do. Knowing what you’ve been eating could be quite helpful in determining the cause of this… discomfort. Be as specific as possible, if you would. And have you noticed any particular foods that seem to trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I work at the burger place, you see. So, I eat a lot of burgers, naturally. And fries. Sometimes chicken nuggets. I drink soda with my lunch, usually cola. I also have a small pastry, a kind of sweet roll, with my coffee in the morning. Not every day, but… often. Hmm… I think the burgers make it worse. And the soda, perhaps. But it is hard to say for sure. I do not pay very close attention to which burger, specifically. It is… a burger.
DOCTOR: I see. And when you say "burger," are these burgers you prepare at work, or do you consume them elsewhere as well?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, these are the burgers I make at work. I do not eat burgers outside of work. I do not go to fancy restaurants. It is… a simple life. I make the burgers, I eat the burgers. It is all the same burger, really. A patty, a bun, lettuce, tomato, some sauce. Sometimes cheese.
DOCTOR: Right. And regarding the sauce, could you describe what it consists of?
PATIENT: Of course. It is… the special sauce. It comes in a large container. It is… creamy. Reddish. It has pickles in it, very small pieces. And onion, I think. And a bit of… sweetness. It is not spicy, though. Everyone at the place likes it, very popular. I do not know the ingredients, exactly. It comes pre-made. I just put it on the burger.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, aside from the gas, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. No stomach pain, exactly. Just… the gas. Sometimes a little bit of… bubbling in my stomach before the gas comes. But it is not painful. And my… well, my bowel movements are normal. Regular, you see. No changes there. No weight loss. I feel… alright, otherwise. Just… embarrassed by the gas.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Never have. And no allergies, not that I know of. I have eaten many things in my life and never had a reaction. I am quite… resilient, I think. Though this gas… this is new.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. It will involve listening to your abdomen and palpating it to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly acceptable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I am not a medical man, you see. I just want this gas to stop.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just lie down on the table, we’ll begin. Please keep your arms at your sides. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with this stethoscope. It may be a little cool. Just breathe normally. Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants, which is good. They are… somewhat hyperactive, but not alarmingly so. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or discomfort. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Just… a little bit of pressure, naturally. You are pressing on my stomach. But no pain. It feels… normal. A little bit of bubbling, perhaps, but I already mentioned that.
DOCTOR: No significant tenderness to palpation. No masses detected. Alright, Mr. Goodstein. Based on your history and the physical examination, it sounds as though you may be experiencing symptoms of lactose intolerance or a sensitivity to certain components in the sauce you consume at work. The hyperactive bowel sounds suggest increased intestinal activity, which could be consistent with these conditions. However, to confirm this, I'd like to recommend a few tests. A hydrogen breath test can help determine if you have lactose intolerance, and we can also discuss a trial elimination diet to identify any specific triggers in your diet. Would you be amenable to these options?
PATIENT: That… sounds reasonable, Doctor. Tests are good. I want to know what is causing this. A breath test… and a diet… Yes, I am amenable to that. What does the diet involve, exactly? Will I have to stop eating burgers? That would be… difficult.
DOCTOR: The elimination diet involves temporarily removing potentially problematic foods from your diet—specifically, those commonly associated with gastrointestinal distress. In your case, we would start by eliminating dairy products and foods containing high amounts of fructose or simple sugars. And yes… unfortunately, it would involve temporarily discontinuing the burgers and the sauce from work. It’s only for a limited time, Mr. Goodstein, to see if your symptoms improve. We can then reintroduce foods one by one to pinpoint the exact culprit. I will write you a referral for the hydrogen breath test. The lab will schedule you for an appointment. We can discuss the specifics of the elimination diet at your follow-up appointment in two weeks. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. A bit long to wait, but… necessary, I suppose. So, no burgers for two weeks. This is… a sacrifice. The breath test… is it uncomfortable? Will it require a special preparation? And the diet… what can I eat? Just to have an idea. I do not want to be completely without sustenance.
DOCTOR: The breath test is generally not uncomfortable, Mr. Goodstein. It involves breathing into a collection bag at specific intervals. You’ll need to follow a specific diet for 24 hours beforehand—primarily avoiding foods containing lactose. The lab will provide you with detailed instructions. As for the diet… you can continue to eat lean proteins like chicken and fish, vegetables, fruits—excluding those high in fructose—and complex carbohydrates like rice and potatoes. Plain yogurt is permissible, but avoid all other dairy products. We will provide you with a more comprehensive list of allowed and prohibited foods at your follow-up appointment. It's about being mindful of what you consume for a short period to identify the cause of your discomfort. It will require some discipline, but it is a necessary step. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. No burgers, no fancy dairy, limited fruit… chicken and potatoes are acceptable. Discipline… yes. I am a disciplined man, when necessary. Though… giving up the burgers… it will be a challenge. So, the lab will call me to schedule the breath test. And then I see you again in two weeks. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. The lab will contact you to schedule the hydrogen breath test. And you have a follow-up appointment scheduled with me in two weeks. Here is your referral slip, along with a handout outlining general dietary guidelines for gastrointestinal issues. I recommend you review it before your appointment. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we conclude today’s consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have been very helpful. I appreciate your patience with my… burger-related woes. Hopefully, we can discover the cause of this gas and return me to my normal… existence. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I trust that with some discipline and these tests, we can resolve this issue. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of symptoms or have any urgent concerns. Have a good day. .
