DOCTOR: Hi Burdette, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's rather obvious, isn’t it? I seem to be losing my sight and… and my hearing. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I have a very busy schedule, you know. I haven’t got all day to sit here recounting every little detail.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, and I apologize for any inconvenience. It is concerning that you're experiencing changes in your vision and hearing. While I appreciate you being direct, a little more detail actually helps me understand what's going on and figure out the best way to help. But we'll get through this as quickly as possible. Let’s start with your vision. When did you first notice changes, and what kind of changes are you experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… when did I first notice? Honestly, Doctor, I can’t possibly recall the precise date. Sometime recently, I suppose. Things are… blurry. Just generally blurry. And dim. Is that sufficient? I really don’t have time for a lengthy interrogation about the specifics. I am a surgeon, you know. A pediatric surgeon. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Okay, “recently, blurry and dim” is a start. Thank you. And I do understand you're a busy professional. We'll focus on what's most important. Has the blurriness been getting worse, and is it in both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Yes, it’s been getting…worse. Naturally, if it hadn’t been getting worse, I wouldn’t be here, would I? And… both eyes, I believe. Yes, both. Though, frankly, I haven’t bothered to examine it closely. One doesn’t have time for such things. Is there a test you can simply do to fix it? I have patients waiting, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. I understand. I’m going to do a quick exam of your eyes, then we’ll talk about next steps. It won’t take long. Okay, can you read the smallest line you can see on this chart?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. I can barely make out the large letters, let alone… whatever those tiny scribbles are supposed to be. It’s all just a blur. I told you, my vision is quite poor. Are you sure you're using the correct chart? This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It sounds like we’re dealing with a significant vision loss. I’m going to switch to a larger chart now. Can you read this top letter for me?
PATIENT: Is that… an ‘E’? Perhaps. It's very difficult to be certain. Honestly, Doctor, I've never been very good at these sorts of things. I’m a surgeon, not an optometrist. My hands are far more precise than my eyes, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. So, it sounds like your vision is significantly reduced in both eyes. Given the sudden onset and the degree of vision loss, I’m a little concerned. Now, let's talk about your hearing. When did you first notice changes in your hearing, and what kind of changes are you experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, the hearing… It’s much the same as the sight, really. Recent. A muffled sort of sound. People don't seem to speak clearly anymore. Or perhaps they don’t speak clearly. It’s hard to say. It’s just…difficult to hear things. And I haven’t the patience to repeat myself constantly. Honestly, it’s rather embarrassing. Do you have any idea what’s causing all of this? Is it something serious? Because, as I mentioned, I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, so recent onset of muffled hearing in both ears. It’s understandable that it's frustrating and embarrassing. Given that you're experiencing changes in both your vision and hearing, and that they started around the same time, I'm definitely concerned. It could be a number of things, and it's important to investigate properly. Before we go further, can you tell me about any other symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not one to dwell on minor ailments. I've been feeling… a bit tired, I suppose. But that's hardly unusual. A surgeon's life is demanding, you know. And… perhaps a little dizzy sometimes. But I chalked that up to long hours and insufficient coffee. Is that relevant? Frankly, I find this line of questioning rather tedious. Are you going to actually do something, or are we simply going to catalogue my every minor discomfort?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and occasional dizziness. Those could be relevant, yes. It's good you mentioned them. I want to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'd like to do a quick neurological exam - just to check your reflexes and balance. That will help me narrow down the possibilities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please be quick about it. I have a waiting room full of children who need my attention. I suppose a few basic checks are acceptable, but I refuse to be subjected to any lengthy or invasive procedures. And do try not to poke me too much. My skin is rather sensitive. Honestly, I have more important things to do than spend the afternoon in a doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart and lungs sound clear. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, and your balance is slightly off. Given all of your symptoms – the sudden vision and hearing loss, the tiredness, the dizziness, and the findings on the exam – I’m concerned about a possible central nervous system issue. It could be a number of things, and we need to investigate further. I'm going to order an MRI of your brain, and I’d like you to see a neurologist as soon as possible. Would you be able to schedule an appointment with one?
PATIENT: An MRI? A neurologist? Good heavens. This sounds… serious. I was hoping for something simple, like new glasses. Honestly, Doctor, is this absolutely necessary? I have a very demanding schedule, as I've mentioned repeatedly. And an MRI… isn't that rather…invasive? I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary… but I expect a very prompt appointment. And a clear explanation of what you suspect. I don’t appreciate being kept in the dark. Do you have any recommendations for a good neurologist? Someone efficient, preferably. This is all rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I apologize for the unsettling news. It’s better to be thorough, especially given the combination of symptoms you're experiencing. While it might not be anything serious, we need to rule out any potential underlying causes. The MRI will help us visualize your brain and identify any abnormalities. It's not invasive, but it does require you to lie still for a period of time. I recommend Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s an excellent neurologist and known for being efficient. Her number is 555-123-4567. I’ll also have my nurse fax over the MRI order and my notes to her office. In the meantime, I’d advise against driving, and please avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any worsening of symptoms – such as severe headache, weakness, or difficulty speaking – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Very well. Dr. Sharma, you say? I shall call her immediately. And I’ll avoid strenuous activity, though that hardly leaves me much to do. Honestly, this is all terribly inconvenient. And…what exactly are we looking for, Doctor? Is it a tumor? Please be direct. I prefer not to beat around the bush. And… will this affect my ability to practice? That is my primary concern. I have patients who depend on me. Honestly, if I can't practice... I don't know what I'll do. .
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s understandable you're worried about your ability to practice, and I will be as direct as possible. We are looking for any structural abnormalities in the brain that could be causing your symptoms – such as a tumor, inflammation, or signs of a stroke. However, it could also be something less serious. The MRI will help us determine the cause. It's too early to say whether it will affect your ability to practice. We need to get the MRI results first and then discuss the treatment options, if any are needed. I know this is a lot to take in. I’m here to answer any questions you have throughout this process. I'll also have my nurse give you a handout with information about the symptoms we discussed and what to expect during the MRI. Here’s Dr. Sharma’s number again: 555-123-4567. Please call her office to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
