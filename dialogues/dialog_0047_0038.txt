DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… rather difficult to explain precisely. I understand I requested something regarding future care? My memory isn’t what it once was, and honestly, the details are… hazy. I believe it has to do with making sure my wishes are known, should I become unable to communicate them myself. Perhaps a form?
DOCTOR: Right. A future care plan. Essentially, advance directives, then. It’s sensible to get these things sorted. It is frustrating when patients haven’t considered these matters, and family is left scrambling. It’s good you're being proactive. And don't worry about the 'hazy' details; we can go through everything step-by-step. First, let's just confirm - are you thinking specifically about a living will and a durable power of attorney for healthcare?
PATIENT: A… durable power of attorney? That sounds correct. And a living will… yes, that rings a bell. I think I read something about those. Honestly, Doctor, the names all blend together. Is one more important than the other, perhaps? Or are they… connected? I apologize for my confusion; it's not that I’m trying to be difficult, I simply… struggle to retain information these days.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Buoniconti. It is a lot of legal terminology. They are connected, yes, but distinct. A living will outlines what medical care you want or don’t want in certain situations – end-of-life care, for example. A durable power of attorney designates someone you trust to make those decisions for you if you are unable to. One isn’t necessarily “more” important, but you really should have both. Do you have someone specific in mind for the power of attorney?
PATIENT: Someone… specific. That's… a difficult question. My ex-husband, perhaps? We remain amicable, and he's… very organized. Though I’m unsure if he’d truly understand my preferences. I have a cousin, Naraa, but she lives quite far away. And truthfully, I haven't spoken to many people regularly since… well, since the divorce. Perhaps it’s best to consider this carefully before naming anyone. Is there a time constraint on this?
DOCTOR: A time constraint?
PATIENT: I meant… do I need to decide immediately? Or can I take some time to consider who would be best suited before completing the paperwork? I don't wish to rush into a decision, especially considering the importance of choosing the right person. I apologize again for being indecisive, Doctor. It’s just… a significant responsibility.
DOCTOR: No, no rush at all, Ms. Buoniconti. Absolutely no need to decide today. It's far better to take your time and choose someone you genuinely trust and who understands your wishes. A poorly chosen healthcare proxy can cause a great deal of… friction, let's say. We can revisit this at a future appointment. Now, while we're discussing future planning – and frankly, it’s good you're thinking about these things – have you considered any other aspects of advanced care?
PATIENT: Other aspects? I'm afraid I'm not certain I understand. Are you referring to… financial matters? Or perhaps funeral arrangements? My mind is rather foggy on anything beyond the basic idea of a living will and a power of attorney. Perhaps you could offer some examples, Doctor? It might help me grasp what you mean.
DOCTOR: Well, it's about more than just who makes decisions and what treatments you want. It's about where you want those treatments, for instance. Do you have strong feelings about staying at home versus going to a hospital?
PATIENT: Staying at home… that sounds preferable, certainly. Though I worry about the burden on others. I live alone, as I mentioned. I wouldn't want to cause undue hardship. A hospital… well, I've never been particularly fond of hospitals. Too… sterile, perhaps. And crowded. I suppose, if it were absolutely necessary, a hospital would suffice, but my preference would be to remain in my own home, if at all possible. Is that something that can be documented in this… directive?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can specify your preference for home care. And we can also outline what level of intervention you're comfortable with – for example, do you want aggressive life support if there’s little chance of recovery?
PATIENT: Aggressive… life support. No. Definitely not. I… I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of regaining… quality of life. That sounds… dreadful. I’d prefer a more… natural end, if you will. Focusing on comfort, perhaps? Ensuring I’m not in pain? Is that something that can be included as well? I apologize for being so… morbid, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s not morbid, Ms. Buoniconti, it’s responsible. It's far better to discuss these things before a crisis arises. Comfort care is, of course, paramount. We can specify a ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ order, or DNR, if you wish. It states that you don’t want CPR performed if your heart stops. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… illnesses. Oh dear. My memory is truly failing me. I had my appendix removed as a child, I believe. And… I’ve always been prone to migraines, though they’ve been less frequent lately. Nothing else springs to mind, Doctor. I'm afraid I'm not very helpful in this regard. I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but I doubt that's relevant. I'm sorry. Would it be helpful to consult with my previous physician? Perhaps they have more detailed records?
DOCTOR: Consulting your previous physician could be useful, yes. Do you recall their name and location?
PATIENT: … Dr. Altan… Altanbaatar. He was located in… Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Though that was… some time ago. I moved here nearly ten years ago now. I haven’t been in contact with him since. I'm uncertain if he's even still practicing. I do have some old medical records at home, if I can locate them. They're likely stored in the attic, which is… rather disorganized. I apologize for the difficulty, Doctor. I’m truly trying to be helpful. It's just… a lot has changed over the years.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we can proceed without those records for now. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I recall a mild reaction to penicillin as a child, a rash, I believe. Nothing severe. I’ve also found that certain strong perfumes can trigger migraines, but I wouldn’t classify that as a true allergy. Aside from that… I don't believe I have any significant allergies. I generally tolerate medications quite well. I'm fairly certain, at least. My memory is… unreliable, as we’ve established.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Buoniconti?
PATIENT: …No. Not currently. I used to take something for the migraines, but I stopped a few years ago. They became less frequent, as I mentioned. I haven’t needed anything regularly since. Just the occasional over-the-counter pain reliever for minor aches and pains, but nothing prescribed by a doctor. I try to avoid medications whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, if they’re effective.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a brief physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Could you please step up on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Though I haven't weighed myself in some time. I suspect the number won’t be particularly flattering. I… haven’t been as diligent with my health as I should be, I confess.
DOCTOR: 123 pounds. And your height is recorded as 183 centimeters. That gives us a BMI of… 36.8. That places you in the obese category, Ms. Buoniconti. Not that I'm judging, but it's something we should be aware of. Blood pressure is 142/92. A little elevated. Let's listen to your heart and lungs. Lungs are clear, but I can hear a slight murmur. Nothing alarming at this point, but it warrants further investigation. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Everything appears within normal limits for a preliminary exam. However, given your blood pressure and the heart murmur, I'd like to order some blood work and an EKG.
PATIENT: Blood work and an EKG? Oh dear. That sounds… rather involved. Is it something serious, Doctor? I confess, I get quite anxious about medical procedures. My heart murmur… I wasn't even aware of that. I suppose I should have been more diligent about regular check-ups. Is it something I should be concerned about immediately?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily something to be immediately concerned about, Ms. Buoniconti. Many murmurs are benign, harmless even. But it’s important to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. The blood work will give us a baseline of your cholesterol, glucose levels, and kidney function, among other things. The EKG will look at the electrical activity of your heart. It’s standard procedure, really. I wouldn’t order these tests if I didn’t think they were necessary. The blood work will require a fasting sample – nothing to eat or drink after midnight tonight. We can schedule the EKG for tomorrow morning. And perhaps we can discuss a referral to a cardiologist just to be on the safe side. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: I suppose that sounds… reasonable. A cardiologist… yes, perhaps that's best. I’d rather be cautious, as you say. Fasting… yes, I can manage that. I suppose it’s better to know one way or another. I just… don't enjoy feeling unwell. And medical procedures always make me anxious. I apologize for my apprehension, Doctor. So, blood work and an EKG tomorrow, and a referral to a cardiologist. And we’re still working on the advance directive, of course. Is there anything else I should be aware of at this time?
DOCTOR: No, that's a good summary, Ms. Buoniconti. We'll get the lab order and EKG referral to you before you leave. In the meantime, I recommend you focus on improving your diet and getting some regular exercise – even just a 30-minute walk each day can make a difference. We can discuss that further at your follow-up appointment. And remember, addressing these health concerns now will improve your quality of life in the long run. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience with my… fog. I confess, I'm still rather overwhelmed, but I feel… somewhat reassured, knowing we have a plan in place. I suppose that's a good start. Thank you for your time and attention. I’ll see you at the follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Buoniconti. I'll have the nurse print out the lab order and referral for you on your way out. Remember, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And try not to worry too much. These things are far more manageable when addressed proactively. Have a good day.
