DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jase. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Piet, it's nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, mostly. It’s been… off. For a while now, I think. I keep getting diarrhea. It’s… persistent, I guess you'd say.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent diarrhea. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to explain it… It’s not like, a sudden thing every time, usually. It just… starts. And it doesn't really stop. It's been going on for… I don’t know exactly how long. Weeks, maybe? I feel fine otherwise, mostly. Just… a lot of bathroom trips. It's kinda embarrassing to talk about.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be embarrassing, Jase, but it’s important we talk about it so we can figure out what's going on. “Weeks” is helpful. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or does it just happen randomly?
PATIENT: That's a good question… I honestly don’t think so. I mean, nothing obvious. I've tried to think about what I eat, but it doesn't seem to matter. Sometimes it happens after I eat, sometimes it doesn’t. I don’t really notice a pattern. My husband has been asking if it's something I’m eating, but I really don't think so. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, no obvious triggers. And it doesn’t seem related to what you’re eating. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think… I’ve been a little tired, maybe? But honestly, I'm always a bit tired. It’s hard to say if that’s connected. And… sometimes my stomach feels a little crampy, but not always. It’s not super painful, just… uncomfortable. No fever or anything like that. I don't think so, anyway. I haven't checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and occasional cramping, but no fever. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in the color or consistency beyond just being diarrhea?
PATIENT: Blood… Um, I don’t think so. I haven't really… looked, if that makes sense. I know I should, but I just… don’t. And consistency… it’s just watery, usually. Sometimes looser than others, but always… not normal. Sorry, that’s probably too much information.
DOCTOR: No, it’s okay, Jase. It's important for me to understand what's going on. We don’t need to go into excessive detail, but knowing the general consistency is helpful. You mentioned it's been going on for weeks. Has anything made it worse recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, I think it’s been a little worse the last week or so. Not a huge difference, but I'm going to the bathroom more often, if that makes sense. And I feel… a bit more drained, maybe? Like, the tiredness is more noticeable. I don't know if that's related to the diarrhea or just… life. I've been a bit stressed at work recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, worsening symptoms over the last week, with increased frequency and more pronounced fatigue. Stress at work is also a factor. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… That’s a good question. I haven’t really been weighing myself. I… I don’t know. I feel about the same, but I haven't actively been trying to lose weight. My clothes still fit, I think. But honestly, I’m not super attentive to that sort of thing. My husband might notice if I’d lost a lot, but he hasn’t said anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, have you traveled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anyone who has been sick with similar symptoms?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t traveled anywhere. Not recently, anyway. And… no, I don’t think so. No one I’ve been around has been sick. My husband and I have been pretty careful, especially with everything that’s been going around. We mostly just go to work and come home. I don't really go out much these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen, and I'll gently press on it to check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm not feeling any significant tenderness, though there is some mild discomfort when I press here , and here It doesn’t seem particularly acute. Your bowel sounds are… normal. No distention or masses that I can feel. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s where it feels a little funny. Um, let’s see… I don’t take much. Just a daily multivitamin, really. And I sometimes take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Maybe once a month, if that. Oh! And I take a probiotic, actually. I started taking it a few weeks ago, hoping it would help with… well, with all of this. It doesn't seem to be making much of a difference, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, occasional ibuprofen, and a probiotic. And no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My husband always checks when I try something new, just in case. He’s very cautious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms – persistent diarrhea for weeks, mild cramping, increased fatigue recently, no fever, no blood in stool, and no significant findings on physical exam – several things could be going on. It's possible this is a viral gastroenteritis that’s just taking a long time to resolve. Sometimes, stress can also exacerbate gastrointestinal issues. However, given the persistence of your symptoms, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a stool sample to check for infections like parasites or bacteria, and a blood test to check for inflammation and rule out any underlying conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I mean, I want to know what’s going on. A stool sample… that sounds a bit unpleasant, but if it helps… And a blood test is fine. I hope it's nothing serious. What kind of conditions are you looking for?
DOCTOR: It's good you want to get to the bottom of this, Jase. The blood test will help us look for things like inflammatory bowel disease – Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis – or celiac disease, which is an autoimmune reaction to gluten. We'll also check your vitamin levels, just in case a deficiency is contributing to your symptoms. The stool sample will help us identify any bacterial or parasitic infections that might be causing the diarrhea. These are just preliminary tests, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. We’re just trying to rule things out. I'll give you the requisition forms for both tests. The stool sample needs to be collected in a clean container – I’ll provide instructions on how to do that. And you can go to [local lab name] for the blood test. They're open [lab hours]. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. I understand. Crohn’s disease and celiac… that sounds a bit scary, honestly. But I guess it’s better to know, right? [local lab name]… okay, I’ll try to go tomorrow. Are there any specific things I should do before the blood test? Like, should I fast or anything? And… do you think I should change my diet in the meantime? Maybe avoid gluten, just in case?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Jase, but remember that these are just possibilities, and many people have these tests and everything turns out to be fine. For the blood test, yes, it’s best to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand, so schedule it for the morning. Just water is okay. As for diet, I wouldn’t restrict anything drastically just yet. Changing your diet before the tests can interfere with the results. We want to get an accurate picture of what's going on before we make any changes. However, staying well-hydrated is important, especially with the diarrhea. And you can continue to eat a normal, balanced diet. I will provide you with a pamphlet on hydration with diarrhea. I’ll also write you a note to take to work, explaining that you’re undergoing medical testing. Let me know if you have any concerns or questions before you go. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Piet. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll schedule the blood test and try to get the stool sample done as soon as possible. And I’ll read the pamphlet. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
