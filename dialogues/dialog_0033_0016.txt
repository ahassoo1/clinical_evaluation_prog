DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. So, why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this bruising, really. It’s… excessive, even for being on the stuff the doctor put me on. I bump into things, normal things, and I end up looking like I’ve been in a fight. It’s embarrassing, frankly. And my wife… well, she would always fuss about it. It’s just… more noticeable now.
DOCTOR: "The stuff the doctor put me on?
PATIENT: Warfarin. That’s what she called it. The blood thinner. She was very particular about the name of everything, you see. Made sure I understood. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to these things. I just take the pills like I’m told.
DOCTOR: Right. Warfarin. And how long have you been taking it, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Since… well, since the heart scare. Let me think… nearly five years now, I suppose. Maybe a little longer. Time just… slips away, doesn’t it? Especially now.
DOCTOR: And this bruising… when did you start noticing it was more excessive?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, not like a switch flipped. More… gradual. Maybe the last few months? It started with just little things, you know? A bump here, a scrape there. Now… well, now it’s like tissue paper. A gentle breeze could probably cause a hematoma. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the bruising?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… No, not really. I feel… tired, maybe? But who doesn’t feel tired these days? And my appetite isn't what it used to be, but again, that could be… well, everything. No, I wouldn’t say anything serious. Just the bruising, really. And the tiredness, but that’s probably just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Do you have any difficulty with bleeding from cuts, nosebleeds, or… other areas?
PATIENT: Bleeding… No, not really. A little longer to stop when I shave, perhaps. Nothing dramatic. My nose gets dry sometimes, especially in the winter, but no… nosebleeds. And… other areas? I hardly think that’s something we need to discuss, Doctor. But no, everything is… functioning as it should, thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. There’s the blood thinner, of course. And I take a little something for my arthritis, helps with the stiffness. Can’t remember the name offhand. And… oh, yes! A multivitamin. My wife insisted on that. Said I wasn’t getting enough… something or other. I really should write these things down. But no, that’s it, I think. Just the basics.
DOCTOR: "The 'something or other' in the multivitamin… do you happen to remember if it contained any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Herbal supplements? Goodness, no. My wife wasn’t one for… alternative medicine. She was a very practical woman. It was just a standard multivitamin. Vitamins A, B, C… you know, the usual. Nothing fancy. Are you implying I'm not being truthful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Farson. Just trying to gather all the information. Now, regarding your arthritis medication… could you describe what it's for?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s for my hands, mostly. And my knees. Gets awfully stiff in the mornings. Makes it difficult to… well, to do anything, really. Holds me back. The doctor prescribed it a couple of years ago. Little white pill. Can’t recall the name, I’m afraid. They all look the same, these days. Is this important, Doctor? Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Farson. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and look at the bruising on your arms and legs. Please, roll up your sleeves.
PATIENT: Very well. There. Happy now? Honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing, isn’t it? Looks like I’ve been in a brawl. My wife would have a fit. She always said I was too clumsy for my own good.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular. The bruising… it’s widespread, as you said. Mostly ecchymoses – that’s just a medical term for bruising. Some of them appear relatively recent, others are older. I’m also noting some petechiae on your lower legs. These are tiny, pinpoint hemorrhages. It's concerning.
PATIENT: Hemorrhages? Pinpoint… what now? Is that… bad? Should I be worried? This is starting to sound… serious. My wife always said I shouldn’t be afraid to ask questions, but I… I never liked bothering the doctors with all my… anxieties.
DOCTOR: It could be concerning, Mr. Farson. The petechiae, combined with the widespread bruising, suggests a possible issue with your blood clotting. We need to run some blood tests to investigate further. Specifically, I'd like to check your complete blood count, coagulation studies—PT, PTT, and INR—and potentially a platelet count. I also want to rule out any other underlying causes.
PATIENT: Underlying causes? What sort of… underlying causes? Is this something… serious? Like… cancer? Or something like that? My wife… she passed away from leukemia, you see. And I… I don’t think I could go through something like that again. Please, Doctor, just tell me straight. What are we dealing with here?
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, please, try to remain calm. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you, I'm not jumping to any conclusions. While it's important to investigate these findings thoroughly, it doesn’t automatically mean it's something serious. Many things can cause bruising and petechiae, including medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, and even minor infections. Leukemia is one possibility, yes, but it’s only one possibility among many. We need the blood tests to determine the cause. I’m going to order them immediately. The lab is down the hall. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan of action. I recommend we rule out all possibilities and get you the answers you need. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Reasonable… yes, I suppose so. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. But… how long will it take to get the results? And… will it hurt? My wife… she hated needles. I always used to hold her hand… Never mind. Just… let’s get it over with. The sooner we know, the better.
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes a few hours to process the results, Mr. Farson. Depending on their workload, it could be later today, or tomorrow morning. As for the blood draw… it’s a standard procedure, and it’s usually only a mild pinch. The phlebotomist is very experienced. You can go down to the lab whenever you're ready. And if you’re feeling particularly anxious, just let them know. They’re used to it. I’ll call you as soon as the results are in. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could cause injury, and if you notice any new or unusual bleeding, please come back immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
