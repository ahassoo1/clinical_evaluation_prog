DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. Like a heavy weight, you know? Not like after working hard, just… there. My wife says I need to come, she worries. She says my… insides aren’t right. I have problems with my liver, been that way a long time.
DOCTOR: Tiredness… alright. And this has been going on for… how long, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, a while now. Months, I think. Hard to say exactly. Time… it all blurs. Not new, though. Comes and goes. Worse lately, maybe. Definitely worse than… last year, I remember that. Much worse. I used to be able to do things, even with the… the liver. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: “Months,” is… rather vague, unfortunately. Is it a constant tiredness, or does it come and go in waves?
PATIENT: Waves, I suppose. But the waves are getting… bigger. Longer. Used to be a bad day, then good days. Now it’s… mostly bad. Some mornings I wake up feeling like I haven’t slept at all. My wife makes me tea, but even that doesn't help much anymore. It used to, you know? She tries.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned problems with your liver. Do you have any records of what those problems are, specifically?
PATIENT: Records? I… don’t think so. Doctor told me things a long time ago. Something about… swelling, maybe? And something about not cleaning right. I went to a doctor in the city, years back. Before I moved here. He gave me pills. I took them. Stopped taking them after a while. Too many trips to the city. This place is… easier.
DOCTOR: “Not cleaning right…” That’s… not very specific, unfortunately. Do you recall why you stopped taking the pills?
PATIENT: They made my stomach upset. And... they didn't really help, did they? Felt the same. My wife said they were expensive too. And the city… it’s far. Lots of traffic. I just… decided it wasn’t worth it. Maybe I was foolish. Now I’m tired all the time, so…
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll need to get a clearer picture of what's going on with your liver. I’m going to do a physical exam, and then I’ll order some blood work. Just to get a baseline, you understand. We need to see exactly what we’re dealing with. It’s possible the tiredness is unrelated, but given your history, we need to rule things out. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn't involve too much city travel. Blood work… needles bother me, but if you say it's important… I trust you, Doctor. You seem… sensible. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Good. Sensible is… adequate, I suppose. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll palpate your abdomen. And I’ll check for any swelling in your extremities. Just routine. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright. It's a bit cold, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is… soft, but there’s some tenderness in the upper right quadrant. And I do detect some slight swelling in your ankles. Not alarming, but worth noting. Have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Urine? Let me think… I go to the bathroom as often as always, I guess. It’s… darker sometimes. A bit… brownish, maybe? Not always, but when I'm really tired. My wife says I should drink more water. She worries about everything. I don't think it's a big deal. Just tired.
DOCTOR: “Brownish” urine… is concerning, especially with your history. It could be a sign of… several things. We need those blood tests, Mr. Grumman. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function panel. And a urinalysis, of course. We’ll also check your bilirubin levels. That will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. I’ll have the lab draw the samples now. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I get a bit of a rash sometimes, if I rub against certain plants. Nothing serious. My wife uses a cream for it. I don't remember the name. Pills… I don’t like pills. They always make me feel sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known drug allergies. Good. We'll get you scheduled for blood work. The nurse will be in shortly to take you down to the lab. I'll review the results as soon as they come in. And Mr. Grumman, I strongly advise you to increase your fluid intake. It won't fix everything, but it can help. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions… No, I don’t think so. Just… how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks. And will the nurse give me a ride back home? My wife... she’s busy.
DOCTOR: The results should be back in approximately three to five business days. The nurse can assist you with transportation back home, though she may have other patients to attend to. I’ll make a note of your request. In the meantime, try to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid any strenuous activity. We’ll discuss the results and a potential plan when they're available. Is there anything else, Mr. Grumman?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You seem… thorough. I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: Adequate. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
