DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I am Dr. Yackey. I see you’re eighty-three years of age. Now, without wasting any time, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Eighty-three, yes… a long time, really. It’s… a delicate matter, to be frank. A rather unpleasant discomfort, down there. I suppose you have read the notes? It’s… a discharge. Not something a man of my age should be troubled with, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Yes, I skimmed the notes. A discharge, you say. Right. Well, these things happen, regardless of age. It’s… not ideal, certainly. Could you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Hmm. That’s… difficult. It’s not… copious, thankfully. More of a… a dampness, really. And a bit… yellowish, I believe. Though, truthfully, my eyesight isn't what it used to be. It’s certainly not… clear, if you understand what I mean. And there’s a slight… odor. Not terribly strong, but… noticeable. It’s quite bothersome, and frankly, undignified.
DOCTOR: Yes, “noticeable.” Right. And how long has this… dampness, as you call it, been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now, that is a question. Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? I’d say… perhaps a week? Maybe a little longer. It came on rather suddenly, I recall. I thought it might just be… a bit of irritation, at first. But it hasn’t gone away. In fact, it seems to be… persisting. I can’t pinpoint the exact date, I’m afraid. My wife handles most of those details, and she's… unavailable at the moment.
DOCTOR: Right. Persisting. And have you experienced any pain, burning, or itching in that area?
PATIENT: Pain… not precisely pain. More of a… discomfort, a sensitivity. Especially when… well, when I relieve myself. It’s not agonizing, mind you. But it’s… unpleasant. And yes, there’s a bit of itching, now that you mention it. Not constant, but… it flares up occasionally. It’s rather distracting, really. Honestly, Doctor, it’s most unbecoming for a man of my standing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling, redness, or sores in the area?
PATIENT: Swelling… now, let me think. No, I don’t believe so. Nothing obvious, at least. Redness… perhaps a little? It’s difficult to say, as my skin tends to be… well, a bit flushed, generally. And sores… no, definitely no sores. It’s mostly just… this discharge and the discomfort. I do try to keep myself… presentable, you understand. I wouldn’t want to neglect my hygiene.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Krok, based on your description, it could be a number of things. A mild infection, perhaps. Or… something else. To be certain, I’m going to need to perform a quick examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: An examination? Well… I suppose it’s unavoidable, isn’t it? Though, I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of the idea. It’s… a sensitive area, as you can imagine. But if it’s necessary to determine the cause of this… unpleasantness, then very well. Proceed. Though, please be… gentle. And discreet. I have a reputation to uphold, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be as efficient and professional as possible. Please lie down on the examination table and position yourself… accordingly. I’ll need to briefly expose the area. I’ll provide a drape for modesty. Just let me know if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Very well. Modesty is appreciated, I assure you. Though, at my age, one tends to lose some of their… inhibitions. Still, a drape is… thoughtful. This is… undignified. Utterly undignified. I trust you'll be swift, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. There’s some mild inflammation and a small amount of discharge, as you described. No obvious sores or lesions. It appears to be a case of balanitis—inflammation of the glans. It’s not uncommon, especially in older men.
PATIENT: Balanitis… inflammation, you say? Is that… serious? Will I require… hospitalization? My wife would be most distressed if I had to be admitted to the hospital. She’s… not very good with medical matters, you see. And what caused this inflammation? Is it… contagious? I wouldn't want to…transmit anything to her.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Krok, it is not serious. Hospitalization is certainly not required. It’s usually caused by poor hygiene, irritation, or sometimes a fungal infection. It is not sexually transmitted, so your wife is not at risk. We'll prescribe an antifungal cream to apply topically for two weeks. Ensure the area is kept clean and dry. And… improve your hygiene. That’s usually sufficient.
PATIENT: Improve my hygiene?! I assure you, Doctor, I maintain a perfectly adequate level of cleanliness! Perhaps it’s simply a… a minor irritation, as you suggested. Still, an antifungal cream… very well. And is there anything else I should be aware of? Any specific dietary restrictions? Or… activities I should avoid? My wife enjoys our evening walks…
DOCTOR: No dietary restrictions or activity limitations are necessary. Just follow the instructions on the label and keep the area clean and dry. If the condition doesn't improve after two weeks, or if it worsens, then schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Well… no, I suppose not. Though, I must confess, I’m still rather… perturbed by your suggestion regarding my hygiene. Very well. I shall follow your instructions. Thank you, Doctor. I trust this… balanitis… will not recur. Good day.
DOCTOR: Good day.
PATIENT: Defensive… indeed. The nerve of some doctors… .
