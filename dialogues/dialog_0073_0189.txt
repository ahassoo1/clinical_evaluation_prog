DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Rowbottom’s the name. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, waste of time if you ask me. But my daughter insisted. Said I needed to get this… checked out. It’s my stool. There was blood in it. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to get her worked up. Frankly, I feel fine. Probably just something I ate.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s always best to investigate these things, even if you feel alright. Your daughter sounds like a sensible woman. Blood in the stool is never something we ignore, regardless. Now, can you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe it? It was… red. What else would it be, green? Honestly, doctor, I’m not a scientist. It wasn’t like a fountain, just… streaks. Mixed in. And it was… well, it was in my stool. That’s about all I can tell you. Is this going to take long? I have a perfectly good schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, of course it was red. I simply meant was it bright red, dark red… was it coating the stool, or mixed through it, as you say?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Darker, I suppose. Not bright, like… like fresh paint. More… muted. And it was in it, mixed through, yes. Like I said. Honestly, I don't pay that much attention to the colour of my… waste products. Is this important? You’re making a lot of fuss over nothing, probably. I’ve been flying planes for sixty years, seen more things than you’ve had hot dinners. A little blood isn’t going to bother me.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: How long… Let me think. It’s been… a couple of times now. Maybe three times in the last week or so. Didn’t think much of it the first time. Old age, you know? Things… leak. But my daughter, she gets it in her head… Now, is this going to involve poking and prodding? I’m not keen on either, if you must know.
DOCTOR: We may need to do a quick physical exam, yes. I understand your reluctance, but it's important to gather all the information we can. It will be a simple examination of your abdomen and a rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits along with this?
PATIENT: Rectal exam?! Now hold on just a minute. You’re not poking around there. Absolutely not. I didn’t agree to any… invasions of privacy. And changes? Well, I’m eighty-eight years old! Everything changes. I go to the bathroom when I need to, same as always. Maybe a little… slower sometimes, but that’s just age. Look, I'm a practical man, I deal with engines and instruments, not… this. I’m starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your discomfort, but a rectal exam is often crucial in determining the cause of bleeding. It allows me to assess for any polyps, masses, or other issues that may be present. While I respect your wishes, declining this exam significantly limits my ability to provide an accurate assessment. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, cramping, or nausea accompanying this?
PATIENT: Nausea? Cramping? Good heavens, no. I feel perfectly fine, like I said before. Just a bit… irritated, now, if you want to know the truth. And look, I've never been one for doctors, always seemed like a lot of fuss over nothing. My daughter’s a worrier, always has been. She sees a shadow and thinks the world’s ending. Now, are you going to tell me I’m wasting my time, or are we going to get on with it? I have a perfectly good afternoon planned, you know. Birdwatching.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Since you are reluctant to have a physical exam, and you report no other concerning symptoms, we will proceed cautiously. However, I strongly advise you understand that this limits our ability to properly diagnose the source of the bleeding. I will order a fecal occult blood test, or FOBT, to see if there is blood in your stool. We will also need to get a complete blood count, or CBC, to check for anemia. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Steak, fish, vegetables… whatever’s put in front of me. I've never had a problem with any of it. Never been one for fancy foods, mind you. Just good, solid meals. A little too much salt, maybe. But no allergies. Now, this… blood test… Does it involve a lot of needles? I’m not fond of those either, to be frank. And how long am I going to have to wait for the results? I don't have all day, you know.
DOCTOR: It will require a standard blood draw, yes. It's a small needle, and it's usually quite quick. The results typically take a few days to come back, and the lab will contact you directly. I will also have my nurse give you instructions on how to collect a stool sample for further analysis. While we are waiting for the results, if you experience any change in your symptoms—increased bleeding, abdominal pain, weakness, or dizziness—please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: Stool sample... Wonderful. More poking and prodding, just indirectly. Alright, alright. I suppose I can manage that. Lab will contact me, you say? I don’t trust those people. Always losing things. And dizziness… well, I’m eighty-eight. A little dizziness comes with the territory. I suppose that's all I need to know for now. Just get it over with, and tell me what you find. And please, no surprises. I don’t do surprises. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. My nurse will be in shortly to collect the necessary samples and provide you with instructions. If you experience any concerning symptoms before the results are available, don’t hesitate to call. We will discuss the results as soon as they are ready. .
