DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My… how you say… the place for old people? My son, he want me to go there. He say I need paper from doctor, yes? For… to make sure I am okay for live there. I am Lindra.
DOCTOR: Right. A nursing facility. Your son wants you evaluated to see if you’re a suitable candidate for placement, and he needs a physician’s documentation. I understand. So, to clarify, he’s concerned about your ability to live independently?
PATIENT: Independently? Oh… yes. Sometimes I forget things. Not… big things, you know? Like… where I put my keys. Or… what I eat for breakfast. Small things. My son, he worry about me being alone. He work very hard. It is a long drive for him to come see me every day.
DOCTOR: Okay. Memory lapses. And he's concerned about you being alone due to his work schedule. Let's talk about these memory issues a little more specifically. Can you tell me how long you’ve been noticing this forgetfulness?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time. Maybe… a year? Two years? It is not new, but maybe… worse lately? I do not know. It is hard to say. I still cook, I still clean. I talk to my friends. But sometimes… I look for something and… it is right there! But I cannot see it. It is silly.
DOCTOR: A year or two, gradually worsening. Still able to perform daily tasks like cooking and cleaning, but experiencing difficulty with object location… Okay. Besides the memory issues, have you noticed any changes in your thinking or reasoning?
PATIENT: Thinking… reasoning? I do not know. Everything feels… slow sometimes. Like… words don't come easy. And I get confused sometimes, with dates. August… is it still August? My birthday is in September, I think. But… maybe it is already September? I get mixed up.
DOCTOR: Okay. Difficulty with word finding and some confusion with dates. That's helpful. Let’s do a quick cognitive assessment just to get a better baseline. It won't be a full neuropsychological evaluation, but it will give us a starting point. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Assessment? Like… a test? I am not good at tests. I never was. Will it be hard? I just want the paper for the… the place. Is test… necessary?
DOCTOR: It’s a very simple assessment, Ms. Abdollahi. Just a few questions to help me understand what's going on. It’s not like a school test. It won't have a right or wrong answer necessarily, it’s just to see how your brain is functioning. And yes, it is necessary. I need to gather as much information as possible before I can provide a proper recommendation for placement, and that includes understanding your cognitive abilities. It’s for your safety and well-being. Would you be willing to try?
PATIENT: … For my safety? My son say the same thing. He say I need help. Okay… okay, I try. But please… go slow? And if I… I don't know the answer, just tell me. Do not make me feel bad.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We will go very slowly, and I promise I won't make you feel bad. If you don’t know an answer, that's perfectly fine. It simply gives me more information. Let's start with something easy. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today… August… the second? Yes. August the second. I think. Is Tuesday? No… Monday? Oh, dear. I am not so good. Is okay if I look at calendar?
DOCTOR: It is Monday, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s alright. Knowing the date can be difficult sometimes. We'll move on. Can you tell me the name of the current President?
PATIENT: President? Oh… I… I do not know. Is… a man? I see him on television, but… I forget the name. So many people on television now. Is very confusing. I remember when… when Kennedy was president. That was a long time ago. But now… I cannot remember. I am a terrible test-taker.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s not about ‘passing’ or ‘failing.’ This is simply helping me assess your current cognitive function. Let's try something different. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to try and repeat them back to me after I say something else. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Three words? Okay… I try. But please, not too hard words. My English… is not so good. Ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. The words are: table, penny, orange. Now, I'm going to ask you a simple question, then I'll ask you to recall the three words. What season are we currently in?
PATIENT: Season… hmm… is… summer. Very hot summer. So much rain. Now… the words? Table… and… oh dear. I cannot remember. Penny… was there a penny? I am so sorry. My mind is… blank.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Abdollahi. Don’t apologize. We’ve gathered enough information for now. Let’s do a brief physical examination just to rule out any other potential contributing factors. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: … Okay. Whatever you need, Doctor. I just want to… get this over with. My son… he worry so much. Just make sure I am… not crazy, okay? Is important to him. And to me. Is good to know what is happening. Blood pressure… is okay. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and I'll slip this cuff on. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Is tight. But… okay. Breathe… just breathe. My son, he always tell me to breathe when I worry. He is a good boy. He works very hard… to take care of me.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 142/88. Slightly elevated, but not concerning at this moment. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a mild murmur. That's not necessarily indicative of anything serious, but it's something we'll want to monitor. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. I'm also going to do a quick balance test. Can you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh… is hard. My legs… they feel weak sometimes. See? I am clumsy. I trip… very easily. My son, he say I need a cane. But I do not like cane. Makes me feel… old. Am I… am I very bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Please sit down, Ms. Abdollahi. Based on the assessment and the information you’ve provided, you're experiencing some cognitive decline, including memory loss and difficulty with word finding, as well as some physical limitations, such as decreased balance and diminished reflexes. This is consistent with mild cognitive impairment, possibly related to age-related changes or early stages of dementia. However, further testing is needed to determine the exact cause. We need to rule out other potential causes, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I’m going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your brain. Also, I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: … Dementia? Is that… bad? My son… he always worry about my brain. He say his grandfather… he had dementia. I do not want to be like his grandfather. He… he did not know who we were. Is that what happens? The CT scan… is that… scary? I just want to know… what is happening to me. And… what will happen to my son? He already has so much stress.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re scared, Ms. Abdollahi. Hearing that word – dementia – is very frightening. It's important to remember that dementia is not a single disease, but rather a collection of symptoms caused by different underlying conditions. And there's a wide range of severity. The CT scan is not painful. It's a simple imaging test that allows us to see what's happening inside your brain. It will help us rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as a stroke or a tumor. And it will give us a better understanding of what might be going on. As for your son, we'll work together to ensure he has the support he needs. We can also connect you both with resources and support groups. Before we proceed, I want to be clear: I'm not making a definitive diagnosis right now. We need more information. But based on my initial assessment, a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation is the best course of action. We'll get those tests ordered, and then we can discuss the results and develop a plan together. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: … No. I… I am too scared to ask. Just… do what you think is best, Doctor. For my brain… and for my son. He will want me to… to do everything right. And… thank you. For… not laughing at me. Is a lot to take in. A lot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Abdollahi. We'll take things one step at a time. I'll have my nurse schedule you for the blood work and the CT scan. She'll also provide you with a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a neurologist I highly recommend. I'm also going to write you a note for your son explaining the situation and outlining the plan. Remember, you're not alone in this. We're here to support you and your son every step of the way. Do you need any assistance getting up?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I think… I can manage. But… could you please, when you talk to my son, tell him I am not crazy? That is very important to me. And… tell him I love him. Even if I forget sometimes. That would… that would be good.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Abdollahi. I will certainly tell your son that you are not crazy and that you love him very much. That's my priority. I'll also reassure him that we're working together to get you the best possible care. I'll have my nurse check on you before you leave to make sure you're feeling okay. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Abdollahi. And remember, we're here for you.
