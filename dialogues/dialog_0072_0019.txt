DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what bring me? My wife... she want… baby. We… old, you know? We want to make sure… everything okay before… before we try. It’s been a long time. I forget… what they call it… planning? Before the baby come.
DOCTOR: Right. Preconception planning. Yes, of course. It’s… commendable that you and your wife are being proactive, despite the… time that has passed. While it’s less common for individuals of your age to consider starting a family, it’s certainly not impossible. To get a better understanding of your situation, and to ensure your wife’s safety and the potential health of the baby, I need to gather some information. First, let’s discuss your wife's medical history. Do you know if she has any existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my wife… she is healthy. Very healthy woman. But… she see doctor sometimes for… for aches. Old lady aches, you know? Not… not serious. She take a little pill for her… water. Not diabetes, something else. She forget the name. I forget too! She see Dr. Johnson, down the street. He is good doctor. Does that… help?
DOCTOR: "Old lady aches"… alright. And a pill for… something related to water?
PATIENT: Yes, water. Not much water, but… she take the pill. I think it’s for… making sure she go pee enough. She say it help with… with holding it sometimes. She worry about… accidents. I don't know the name of the pill, sorry. It is small, white pill. She take it every day. I… I try to remember, but my head… it is not what it used to be. Does that make sense? She is very careful with her health, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Carlotta. It sounds like she may be taking a diuretic, a medication to help the body get rid of excess fluid through urination. We’ll need to confirm this with Dr. Johnson’s office. Now, let's focus on you. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Me? Hmm… I work with metal and plastic, you know? Model making. Good work, keeps my hands busy. I have… aches too! In my back, from bending. Not serious. And… sometimes my knees bother me. Old man problems. I see a doctor sometimes for my knees, but just… creams. No pills. I… I had something a long time ago, when I was young, with my… heart? But they fix it. Long, long time ago. I don't worry about it now. I think. Does that… help?
DOCTOR: Alright. A history of heart issues… even if it was a long time ago, that is important. And aches and pains… naturally, those can develop with age and occupation. Do you recall the specific heart condition you were treated for?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… they said something about… a valve? My heart valve. Something wasn’t… working right. They fix it with… with surgery. A long time ago. Very long time ago. I was young man then. I don’t remember much about it. They said I was lucky. And I was… I feel fine now. Mostly fine. Sometimes I get… a little short of breath when I climb stairs. But I take it slow. Is that… bad? I don't want to worry you. I just… forget things. It’s a trouble, getting old.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, it's not about worrying me. It's about gathering complete information to ensure your and your wife’s well-being. A history of heart valve surgery, even decades ago, is very relevant to this discussion. The shortness of breath is also important. We need to obtain your medical records from the hospital where you had the surgery and get a recent EKG to assess your current heart function. And I'm going to order a full blood panel for both you and your wife, to check for any underlying conditions that may affect a pregnancy. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm… I don't think so. Never had… reaction to anything. My wife, maybe? She said she get… itchy when she take… amoxicillin? Is that right? Something with an "a" in it. She avoid that one. I don't take much medicine, so… I don't worry about allergies. Mostly just creams for my knees. I… I hope this isn’t too much trouble. We just… want to make sure everything is okay. It is a big thing, baby. A very big thing.
DOCTOR: It is important to be thorough, Mr. Carlotta. Not a trouble at all. The amoxicillin allergy is noted. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you and your wife smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoke. My wife… she used to, a long time ago, but she stop. Many years ago. Drink… we have a little wine sometimes. With dinner. Not much. Just a glass. Maybe two. And… drugs? No. Never. We are old people. We don’t… do those things. Just wine. With dinner. Is that… okay? We try to be healthy. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Right. Moderate alcohol consumption... it's generally advisable to abstain from alcohol entirely if your wife were to become pregnant. Now, before we proceed further, I need to be frank with you both. Given your ages and your history of heart valve surgery, a pregnancy would be considered high-risk. There are potential complications for both your wife and the baby. Do you understand that?
PATIENT: High risk? … Oh. I… I understand. But… we really want this. We talk about it for a long time. We have… we have no children. It is a long dream. Is… is it impossible? Even if it is… difficult? Is there anything… anything we can do? I know I am old. And my heart… but my wife is strong. We both are. We just… want a baby. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I understand your desire. It's not about whether it's "too much to ask," it's about realistically assessing the risks and ensuring the best possible outcome. It's not impossible, but it would require a very close monitoring throughout the pregnancy, and a multidisciplinary approach involving a cardiologist, a high-risk obstetrician, and potentially other specialists. Before we even consider proceeding, we must obtain all of your medical records, perform a thorough cardiac evaluation, and have your wife undergo a comprehensive pre-conception assessment. I will need to refer you both to a cardiologist and a specialist in high-risk obstetrics. Would you be willing to pursue these evaluations?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, we will. We will do anything. If that’s what it takes… We will see the doctors. The heart doctor… and the… the other doctor. Whatever it takes. We want to be… prepared. And we want to know… the truth. Even if it is… not what we want to hear. We just… want to make sure we do everything right. Can you… can you help us with that? Find the doctors? Make the appointments? It is… a little hard for us, with… everything.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Carlotta. I will provide you with referrals to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly respected cardiologist specializing in geriatric cardiac care, and Dr. Evelyn Reed, a high-risk obstetrician. My nurse will schedule appointments for you both. Please be prepared to bring all of your medical records to the appointments. In the meantime, I recommend that your wife begin taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid. And I strongly advise against any attempts to conceive until we have completed the evaluations and determined whether it is safe to proceed. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Prenatal vitamin… folic acid… yes, okay. We will do that. No attempts… yes, we understand. I… I think that is all for now. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for… being honest. And for helping us. It means… a lot. My wife will be… very relieved to hear you will help us. She worries a lot. Is there… anything we need to do before the appointments? Any tests we should ask for? Or anything we should… prepare?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Carlotta. Before the appointments, I recommend compiling a comprehensive list of all medications you and your wife are currently taking, including dosages. Also, any previous surgical reports or imaging studies would be helpful. It’s best to have everything organized and readily available for the specialists. My nurse will provide you with instructions on how to access the patient portal, where you can view your medical records and communicate with our office. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I will also send a summary of our conversation to your primary care physician, Dr. Johnson, to ensure continuity of care. .
