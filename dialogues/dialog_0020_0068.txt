DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It’s…well, it’s my leg. It’s been swelling up. It’s after the…the treatments, you know? For the cancer. It's been a few months now, but it’s getting…bigger.
DOCTOR: Okay. Swelling in your leg after cancer treatments. I understand. A few months now, and it’s progressively getting bigger. That's good information to start with. Just to be sure I have everything right, when you say "treatments", can you tell me what kind of treatments you had for the cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, um… Let me see… it was… radiation. And some… pills. Lots of pills. I don't really remember the names, honestly. They gave me so many! It was at the big hospital in the city, a long time ago now. Does that make sense? I'm not very good with remembering things.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Sasha. Many patients find it hard to remember all the details of their treatment, especially after a long time. Radiation and pills… okay. And this swelling… is it in one leg, or both?
PATIENT: It's just the left one. It started small, like after a long day, you know? But now… now it's pretty noticeable. Even with socks on, you can see it. It doesn’t really hurt, just feels…heavy. Heavy and warm sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the left leg, starting small and gradually getting bigger. No pain, but heavy and sometimes warm. Have you noticed any changes in the skin on your leg?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm… it looks a little… red, maybe? And it feels… rough. Not smooth like the other leg. I don't know if it's always been like that, or just now. My eyesight isn't what it used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, some redness and roughness to the skin on the left leg. I understand your eyesight might make it harder to notice changes. And have you had any fevers, chills, or any pain in your chest, or trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Oh no, no fevers or chills. And I can breathe just fine, thank you. No chest pain either. Just…the leg. It’s mostly just annoying, to be honest. It makes it hard to find shoes that fit properly! And I don’t like how it looks, you know? It feels…wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand, Sasha. It's frustrating when something doesn't feel right, and it interferes with your daily life. I'd like to take a look at your leg, if that's alright with you. And I’ll listen to your heart and lungs just to be thorough. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on with it. It’s been worrying me, you know? It's probably nothing, but... it's best to check.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take a look. Alright, I’m checking the temperature…and I'm feeling for any areas of tenderness. It is warmer than your right leg, and there is some pitting edema present when I press on it. And I’m listening to the blood flow in the leg… sounds normal, thankfully. Skin is slightly discolored, and a little rough as you mentioned. I don’t feel any lumps or bumps.
PATIENT: Oh…pitting edema? Is that bad? It does feel a bit… squishy, I guess. I haven’t really noticed that before. It’s just been… swelling. Like my foot just gets bigger and bigger at the end of the day. What does this mean, Doctor? Is it from the cancer treatments? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, so pitting edema means that fluid is collecting in the tissues of your leg. It's often associated with problems with circulation or fluid balance. It can be a sign of something more serious, which is why we’re checking it out. Given your history of cancer treatments, it’s definitely something we need to investigate. It could be related to the treatments, yes. Radiation and some chemotherapy drugs can sometimes cause lymphedema, which is swelling due to a blockage in the lymphatic system. However, there are other possibilities too, like a blood clot, or problems with your veins. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. Well… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. Please. I just want to know what’s happening. What kind of tests? Will they hurt? I don't like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles, Sasha. We’ll try to minimize any discomfort. The first test I’d like to order is a Doppler ultrasound of your leg. It uses sound waves to look at the blood flow in your veins and arteries and rule out a blood clot. It doesn't involve any needles. Then, I’d like to draw some blood to check your kidney and liver function, and to rule out any other underlying causes of the swelling. That will involve a small needle prick, but it’s usually very quick. Finally, if the ultrasound is inconclusive, we might need to consider an MRI, which gives us a more detailed picture of the tissues in your leg. That doesn’t involve any needles, but you would need to lie still for a bit inside a scanner. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh…that’s a lot. No needles for the first one is good. Blood tests… well, I suppose I can manage that. An MRI… that sounds scary. But if you think it's needed… then okay. Just… please be quick with the needle, if you have to use one. And tell me everything that's happening, okay? I don't like surprises. When can I have these tests done? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a doctor's appointment next month, and I’d like to know before then.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sasha. I completely understand your concerns. We'll take everything one step at a time, and I'll explain everything along the way. No surprises, I promise. We can get the blood tests done today, right here at the clinic. They usually take just a few minutes. The results should be back within a week. As for the Doppler ultrasound, I'll have my nurse schedule that for you at the imaging center. They have appointments available next week. We’ll hold off on the MRI for now, and see what the ultrasound shows. We don't want to do any unnecessary tests. I'll also write a referral to a vascular specialist, just in case. They're the experts in problems with the veins and arteries, and it’s good to have a consultation lined up if we need it. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… better. No MRI right away is good. And seeing a specialist… that makes sense. You think they can help? Okay, blood tests today, and the ultrasound next week. And you'll schedule all of that for me? I have my Medicare card here, just in case. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. It’s… it’s been a bit overwhelming. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. That’s what I’m here for. Yes, my nurse, Maria, will take care of all the scheduling for you. She'll also need a copy of your Medicare card, which is perfect that you have it with you. She will come in shortly to get that and to go over the instructions for the blood tests. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, or if you notice any shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before Maria arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now. Just… thank you again, Doctor Beinborn. I feel a bit better knowing we’re getting it checked out. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I suppose I should just try to relax, and not worry too much. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sasha. That’s exactly right – let’s focus on getting it checked out, and try not to worry too much in the meantime. That's the best approach. Maria will be with you in just a moment. If anything comes up before your next appointment, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Take care of yourself, Sasha. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
