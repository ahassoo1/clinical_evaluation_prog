DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Just need a card to drive, you know, for ride-sharing. It's a commercial driver thing, I think? I don't really understand all the paperwork, honestly. Just want to make sure I'm legal to keep working.
DOCTOR: Right. A commercial driver’s license medical card. Of course. Well, we need to ensure you meet the Department of Transportation’s standards. It’s…important. Now, have you been seeing a primary care doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Dr. Nakamura, over in town. Been going to him for…oh, goodness, almost twenty years now. He’s a good man. I go in for check-ups twice a year, usually. Nothing major wrong with me, thankfully. Just the usual old lady stuff, you know? Though my knees do bother me sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me pull up Dr. Nakamura’s records… Hmm. Yes, I see it here. Twice yearly visits, generally well-controlled hypertension… and a note about osteoarthritis in both knees. "Usual old lady stuff," as you put it, is good information, but let's be a bit more specific. When did you first notice the knee pain?
PATIENT: Oh, the knees…let me think. It started…probably about ten years ago, give or take. Not all at once, it just gradually got worse. Started as a little ache after a lot of walking, and now it’s just…there, most of the time. Worse when it’s cold, or if I've been on my feet all day. Doesn’t stop me, though. I'm a stubborn woman! But it’s definitely something.
DOCTOR: Ten years of gradual onset knee pain, worse with activity and cold temperatures. Alright. Do you experience any swelling, redness, or warmth in either knee?
PATIENT: No, not really. No swelling, no redness…sometimes they feel a little warm after working, but I think that’s just from being on my feet all day in the sun. It’s more of a stiff, aching feeling, really. And a little clicking when I bend them. Nothing dramatic, Doctor. I can still walk and drive just fine.
DOCTOR: Clicking, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a little clicking. It doesn't hurt, it just… clicks. Like little pebbles moving around in there. It’s been that way for a long time, honestly. I didn’t think it was important, but you asked, so I told you. Is that bad? I really just need this card to drive, I don't want to make a big deal out of anything.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good you mention it. Everything is relevant. We need to be thorough. Now, aside from your knees, are you experiencing any other pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, not really. My back gets a little stiff sometimes, but that's just from lifting things. I've always been a strong woman, you know? Been working hard my whole life. Nothing that keeps me from doing anything. And my hands ache a little when it's cold, but I think that's just getting old! I don't have any serious pain, Doctor. Truly. Can we just get this card done? I have a shift to get to later.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to assess things. I’ll need to check your blood pressure, pulse, vision, and reflexes. And I’d like to examine your knees. I understand you're eager to get back to work, but it’s my responsibility to ensure you're medically fit to operate a vehicle safely. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Perfectly understandable, Doctor. Safety first. Here I am. Just…be gentle with the knees, alright? They aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, but within acceptable limits. Pulse is regular. Now, let's check your vision. Alright, vision is good. Now, reflexes… Reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon for someone your age. Now, about your knees… Could you bend them for me, as far as comfortable?
PATIENT: There we go… it’s a little stiff, as you can see. I can’t bend them all the way like I used to. There’s a little bit of creaking and popping… and a little bit of pain when I go too far. I can’t really put a lot of weight on them when I'm bent either. Not terrible, but definitely not young anymore. Honestly, Doctor, is this going to be a problem for the card?
DOCTOR: There’s definitely crepitus with range of motion, and some tenderness to palpation along the medial joint lines of both knees. I'm also noticing a slight limitation in full extension. Ms. Sciarotta, based on my exam, you do have significant osteoarthritis in both knees. While it may not prevent you from driving entirely, operating a commercial vehicle requires a certain level of physical capability. I’m concerned about your ability to safely operate the pedals and react quickly in emergency situations.
PATIENT: Oh dear. I knew it. Something was wrong with them. So, what does that mean? Can I still get the card? I need to drive, Doctor. It’s how I make my living. Is there anything I can do? Maybe some exercises? Or medication? Please tell me there’s something. I really don't want to lose my job over this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sciarotta, I understand your concern. The issue isn’t necessarily preventing you from getting the card, but it requires further evaluation. I recommend a consultation with an orthopedic specialist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They may recommend imaging, such as X-rays, to assess the extent of the osteoarthritis. As for treatment options, physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve range of motion. Pain medication, such as over-the-counter NSAIDs or, in some cases, stronger prescriptions, can also help manage the pain. However, I cannot in good conscience clear you for a commercial driver’s license without a specialist’s assessment. It’s a liability issue, frankly, and more importantly, it’s about ensuring your safety and the safety of others on the road. I can provide you with a referral to Dr. Ito, a highly-regarded orthopedic surgeon in town. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An orthopedic surgeon…of course. More appointments, more waiting… Fine. Dr. Ito, you said? Yes, alright. Give me the referral. I guess I’ll have to go. It’s just…this is so much hassle. I just wanted a simple card, not a whole medical investigation. Do you think…do you think this will take a long time? And will they definitely say I can't drive? I really need this job, Doctor. It's all I have.
DOCTOR: I’ve sent a referral to Dr. Ito’s office. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. As for how long it will take, that depends on their availability and the extent of the evaluation they deem necessary. It’s impossible to say definitively whether they will clear you for driving. However, many patients with osteoarthritis are able to manage their symptoms effectively with treatment and continue to drive safely. It will depend on the severity of your condition and your response to therapy. I understand your concerns, Ms. Sciarotta. I'm not trying to make things difficult for you, but I have a responsibility to ensure your safety and the safety of others. This evaluation is necessary to make an informed decision. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid driving until you have been cleared by Dr. Ito. I’m happy to provide a note for your employer explaining the situation. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: A note for my employer…yes, that would be good. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose there's nothing else I can do. I guess I’ll go make some phone calls. It's just…a lot. One last question…do you think I should tell my boss about this now, or wait until I see Dr. Ito? I don’t want to worry him unnecessarily. He's been good to me, and I don’t want to lose my job before I even know if I’m going to be able to keep it.
DOCTOR: That’s a difficult question, Ms. Sciarotta. In my professional opinion, transparency is usually the best approach. However, I understand your concerns about potentially jeopardizing your employment. If you feel comfortable doing so, I would advise informing your boss about the referral and the need for a medical evaluation, without going into too much detail until you have a clearer understanding of your condition. That way, he’s aware of the situation and won't be caught off guard. Ultimately, the decision is yours, and I respect whatever you choose. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
