DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I've been having some trouble with my blood pressure, that's what the nurse said, anyway. She took it a couple times and it was a little high, she said I should come in and get it checked out properly.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. It’s always best to get things checked out. High blood pressure, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. I don’t really… know much about it, to be honest. I just know the nurse looked a bit worried when she took my reading. She said something about it being important to keep an eye on, but I didn’t really press her for details. I was a bit flustered, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It can be a bit unsettling when you’re not sure what’s going on. No need to worry, we’ll figure it out together. Now, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed things weren’t quite right, or when you first had your blood pressure checked?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I had it checked at a health fair last month, and it was a little high then too, but they just told me to watch my salt intake. I didn’t think much of it, honestly. But then when I came in for my usual check-up with the nurse last week, she said it was up again and wanted me to come see you. I haven’t really felt anything different, if that makes sense. No headaches or anything.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, thank you. So, it's been a bit elevated at least a couple of times now, but you haven’t experienced any symptoms like headaches, dizziness, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing like that at all. I feel pretty normal, to be honest. Just… a little worried, I guess. My mom had some heart trouble when she got older, so that’s probably why I’m a bit anxious about it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, it makes perfect sense. Family history is important. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let’s talk a little bit about your medical background. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of – things like diabetes, kidney problems, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, sir. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox and all that – but nothing serious. I had my gallbladder taken out a few years ago, but that’s it. The doctor said it was just a bit inflamed. I'm on Medicare, so I get regular check-ups, and they haven't ever told me about anything else. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's good information, thank you. Gallbladder removal... alright. And you said you haven’t had any other surgeries besides your gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, sir, none that I can remember. Just the gallbladder. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, to be honest. This blood pressure thing is kinda throwing me for a loop, you know? I usually just go to the doctor for my yearly check-up and a flu shot. I don't really do medical things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to be healthy, but it’s also good to check things out when something seems a little off. Now, let’s talk about your family a bit more. You mentioned your mother had some heart trouble. Do you know what specifically was wrong with her?
PATIENT: Well, she had a really bad heart attack when she was about 70. Then she had some… I think it was called congestive heart failure after that. She was really tired all the time and had trouble breathing. She was in and out of the hospital for a while. It was… rough. That’s why I’m worried about this blood pressure, I guess. I don’t want to end up like her.
DOCTOR: That's certainly understandable. A history of heart attack and congestive heart failure makes it important to be thorough. Now, do any other family members – siblings, aunts, uncles, grandparents – have high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. My dad had high blood pressure, I think. He was on medication for it for years. And my aunt, my mom’s sister, she has diabetes. She lost a toe because of it, which was really sad. Other than that… not that I know of. We don’t really talk about health stuff much in my family, if I'm being honest. It's kinda considered private. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense. Many families are like that. Alright, that's good to know. Now, just to round things out, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir, nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to eat healthy – lots of fruits and vegetables – and I walk a little bit most days, but that’s about it. I'm not big on medication, to be honest. I'd rather just try to take care of myself naturally, if I can.
DOCTOR: That's a good approach, Mykeisha. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. I can eat anything and everything, which is nice. My friend is allergic to peanuts, and I feel so bad for her. But me? I'm clear.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Alright, Mykeisha, that gives me a good start. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see where things stand. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable or anything. I don't like surprises, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll explain everything as I go. No surprises. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Here I am. Ready when you are. I hope I’m not too wrinkly! I haven’t been on one of these in a while.
DOCTOR: You're perfectly fine. Let’s start with your blood pressure, just to confirm what the nurse found. Okay… 150 over 92. A bit elevated, as the nurse indicated. Heart rate is 78, regular. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. I’m not hearing any wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s take a quick look at your throat and ears. Throat looks clear, no signs of infection. Ears look normal as well. Pulses are good and strong. Now, just a quick check of your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Everything seems normal aside from the blood pressure, which is a little high.
PATIENT: Okay. That’s good to know everything else is okay, at least. Is 150/92 really bad? My mom always said numbers were important, and I never was good with those. Is that something I need to be really worried about? It sounds scary just hearing those numbers, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel worried when you hear numbers like that. It's not necessarily an emergency, but it is something we need to address. 150/92 is considered Stage 2 hypertension. That means your blood pressure is higher than we’d like. High blood pressure, if left untreated, can increase your risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney problems, and other health issues. But it’s also very manageable with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. We’ll work together to get it under control. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Okay… So, it’s not like I’m gonna have a heart attack tomorrow, right? That’s what I was afraid of. But it’s manageable… that’s good. Lifestyle changes… what does that even mean? Do I have to give up all my favorite foods? I like a good dumpling now and then! And I’m not really a big exercise person, if I’m honest. This sounds like a lot of work, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, you are absolutely not going to have a heart attack tomorrow. That's not what I meant at all. What I meant was that it's something we need to take seriously and start working on now to prevent those kinds of problems in the future. As for lifestyle changes, it doesn’t necessarily mean completely giving up your favorite foods! It’s more about making small, sustainable changes. Reducing your salt intake, eating more fruits and vegetables, and getting some regular physical activity are all important. We can start with something small, like going for a 30-minute walk a few times a week. And we can discuss ways to reduce your salt intake without sacrificing the flavors you enjoy. We'll work together to create a plan that fits your lifestyle. I’m going to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. That will give us a more complete picture of your overall health. We will also do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay… Small changes… I can probably manage small changes. Walking… yeah, I think I can walk. I live kinda close to the park. And blood tests… yeah, that’s fine. EKG… is that where they put stickers on your chest? I’ve seen that on TV. It doesn’t hurt, does it? I’m just a little nervous, Doctor. All this just feels like a lot. I haven’t had to deal with anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Yes, an EKG is where they put stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It doesn’t hurt at all. It’s a very quick and painless procedure. It just records the electrical activity of your heart. It’s a routine test, and it helps us make sure everything is working properly. I completely understand that this feels like a lot. It’s normal to feel overwhelmed when you’re first diagnosed with something new. But we’ll take it one step at a time. We'll start with the blood tests and EKG, then we’ll discuss the results and create a plan together. I'll also give you some information about high blood pressure and lifestyle changes. You’re not alone in this, Mykeisha. I’m here to help you every step of the way. Let me write down the orders for the blood tests and EKG. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and get you set up for the EKG. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, sir… I think that covers it for now. You’ve explained everything really well. I guess I’ll just wait for the nurse, then. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little less scared now, to be honest. It’s good to know I’m not alone in this, like you said. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mykeisha. That's my job. Don’t hesitate to ask if anything else comes to mind. The nurse will be in shortly. We'll get this sorted out together. I’ll check back with you after the tests are completed. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Okay, you too, Doctor. Thank you again.
