DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I’ve noticed a… discharge. A rather unpleasant one, if I may say so. And I thought it best to get it looked at, before it… worsened. It’s just… not proper, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely, Jinnie. It's good you came in to get it checked. It's always best to address these things promptly. Can you tell me a little more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… yellowish, mostly. And it’s not terribly… abundant, but it’s there. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, perhaps a week now? Maybe a little longer. I do try to keep things… clean, you understand. It's just… concerning. I haven’t been… with anyone, if that makes a difference. Not for quite some time. It's not as if I've been the cause of this, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish discharge for about a week, and you haven’t had any recent sexual activity. That’s helpful information. Is there any odor associated with it?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It’s… not a pleasant odor, Doctor. It’s difficult to describe… sort of… fishy, perhaps? Though I wouldn’t say strongly fishy. Just… not right. It’s making me rather self-conscious, to be perfectly honest. One doesn’t expect these things at my age. I maintain a very… respectable lifestyle.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fishy odor… that’s good to know. And you said it’s been about a week. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, yes. A bit of… discomfort. Not exactly painful, but… irritating. Especially when I… urinate. It’s a slight burning sensation, really. Nothing dreadful, but noticeable. And… I’ve been feeling rather… tired lately. But I assumed that was just… the heat. It’s been quite warm, you see. It's hard to know what's what these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have yellowish discharge with a fishy odor, some discomfort with urination - a burning sensation - and you've been feeling tired. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I had a touch of arthritis in my hands a few years back, but it’s well-managed with some cream the doctor prescribed. And… I had my gallbladder removed years ago. But that was a long time ago, and I recovered perfectly well. Nothing else, not that I recall. I try to stay healthy, you see. I eat a balanced diet and… well, I wouldn’t say I exercise, but I do get plenty of walking done. I do worry about these newfangled things they diagnose these days. It’s always something, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis managed with cream and gallbladder removal years ago. Good to know. And you haven’t been diagnosed with anything else. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or STIs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. Never. I… I’ve been a very careful woman, you understand. I wouldn’t… I mean, I haven’t been… active, as I said before. It’s not something I’ve ever had to worry about. The thought! It’s… improper, really. I’ve always maintained a very… respectable reputation. Are you suggesting… ? It’s rather insulting, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question came across that way, Jinnie. It’s standard to ask about that possibility as part of evaluating any discharge. It wasn’t meant to imply anything about you personally. Let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright then. I suppose I understand. It’s just… unnerving, that’s all. As for medications… just the cream for my arthritis, as I mentioned. And sometimes I take a little something for my… indigestion. Just when it flares up, you understand. Nothing regular. It’s an over-the-counter tablet, I believe. Something my neighbor recommended. I can’t recall the name, unfortunately. I have a terrible memory for such things. It's probably nothing important, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the arthritis cream and an occasional over-the-counter tablet for indigestion. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything, practically. I used to be a bit sensitive to certain perfumes, but that was years ago. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I consider myself quite robust, actually. I rarely get sick. It’s just… this discharge is rather unsettling, given my usual good health. I really do hope it’s nothing serious. I’m not a young woman anymore, you see. One doesn't recover as quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jinnie. No known allergies. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll need to take a look at the area and possibly take a sample to send to the lab for testing. That will help us determine the cause of the discharge and get you the right treatment. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… Well. I suppose it’s necessary, isn’t it? It’s just… rather personal, Doctor. But yes, alright. If you must. I do hope it won’t be too… invasive. And I do hope you have… proper hygiene standards. One can’t be too careful these days. Please be gentle. And… perhaps explain what you're doing as you go along? I do appreciate being informed.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jinnie. I understand your concerns and will be as gentle and respectful as possible. I'll explain everything as I go along. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your abdomen. After that, I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. I’ll use a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visually inspect the area. Then I’ll take a small sample of the discharge to send to the lab. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but it should only last a few seconds. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A speculum… I’ve heard stories. It sounds… unpleasant. And you'll be… looking at things? Really? Well. If it’s absolutely necessary. But please, Doctor, be very quick about it. And gentle, as you promised. I do have a… sensitive constitution. And perhaps, try not to make too much conversation while you’re… examining. It would be… rather awkward. I suppose I have no choice, do I? Very well. Let’s get it over with, then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jinnie. If you could please lie down on the examination table, face up, with your knees bent and feet flat on the table. I’ll explain each step as I go. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. This is just to get a baseline of your overall health. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Now, if you're comfortable, we'll proceed with the pelvic exam. I'm going to use a warm, lubricated speculum to gently open the vaginal canal. This allows me to visualize the cervix and take a sample of the discharge. It may feel a little pressure or discomfort, but it shouldn't be painful. Just breathe deeply and try to relax.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must say, I’m already feeling rather… exposed. And the thought of that… instrument… it’s rather unsettling. Please be as quick as possible, and… do try not to look surprised by anything you see. I assure you, I maintain a very… respectable lifestyle. Just… get it over with. Quickly, please. And tell me when it’s finished. I find it difficult to… relax under these circumstances.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jinnie. I’m going to gently insert the speculum now. Just take a few deep breaths. This may feel a little cool at first, but it shouldn’t be painful. Okay, I can see your cervix now. It appears slightly inflamed, and I do notice some yellowish discharge as you described. I’m going to take a small swab sample now. This will only take a few seconds. Okay, all done. That’s it. I’m removing the speculum now. There. That wasn't so bad, was it?
PATIENT: No. It was… not pleasant. And certainly not comfortable. I do hope you obtained sufficient sample. I’d rather not have to repeat that experience. It was… rather invasive. And frankly, undignified. Is it finished now? Can I get dressed? I feel rather… vulnerable. And cold. I'd like to know what you think it might be, though I suppose I’ll have to wait for the results. Very well. Just… tell me when it’s safe to get up.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are finished now, Jinnie. You can get dressed whenever you're ready. I’ll give you a few moments of privacy. Alright, Jinnie. So, based on what I saw and the sample we collected, the most likely cause of your symptoms is bacterial vaginosis, or BV, or a yeast infection. It’s very common, and easily treatable. We'll know for sure once the lab results come back, but I’m leaning towards one of those two. It explains the yellowish discharge, the fishy odor, and the discomfort you’ve been experiencing. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Bacterial… what was it? And a yeast infection? Those sound… dreadful. Are they… contagious? I certainly don’t want to be passing anything on to anyone. And… easily treatable, you say? With what? More instruments? I do hope not. And… is it something I did? I maintain a very… clean lifestyle, you understand. I’ve always been very careful. It's just… unsettling to think it could be something… my fault. Will I need to abstain from… activities? Honestly, Doctor, it's all rather… distressing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jinnie. Let's address those one by one. Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is an imbalance of the bacteria naturally present in the vagina. It's not a sexually transmitted infection, so it's not contagious. It's also not caused by anything you've done wrong. It can happen for a variety of reasons, even with very good hygiene. Sometimes it’s just a disruption in the natural balance. A yeast infection is also not a sexually transmitted infection. It’s caused by an overgrowth of a fungus naturally present in the vagina. As for treatment, thankfully, it doesn't involve any further invasive procedures. It’s usually treated with either an oral medication or a topical cream. Both are very effective and have minimal side effects. We'll wait for the lab results to determine the best course of action for you. And no, you don’t need to abstain from activities while we’re determining the treatment. It’s fine to continue as usual. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. Not contagious. That’s good. And no further… instruments. Excellent. Oral medication or a cream… I prefer a cream, if possible. I dislike taking pills. And… it’s not my fault? Truly? That’s… a relief. I was beginning to worry I had… neglected something. So, the lab results… how long will those take? And… what if it’s something else entirely? Something… more serious? I do worry, you see. I’m not a young woman anymore, and one’s health is… precarious at my age. Will you be contacting me? Or will I need to schedule another appointment? Honestly, Doctor, I just want this… unpleasantness… over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Jinnie. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I will contact you directly, either by phone or through the patient portal, as soon as they are available. If the results come back as something other than BV or a yeast infection, we’ll discuss it thoroughly and determine the best course of action. But please try not to worry too much. Those are the most likely causes, and easily treatable. If the results confirm either BV or a yeast infection, I will call in a prescription to your pharmacy for the appropriate medication – either the oral medication or the cream, as you prefer. I will also provide you with clear instructions on how to use the medication and what to expect. And of course, you can always call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you. Contacting me directly… that’s good. And clear instructions… excellent. I do appreciate your patience and… reassurance. It’s unsettling, these things. And one does worry. One last thing… Medicare… will that cover the medication? I do worry about costs. It’s… a concern. I wouldn’t want to be faced with a large bill. Honestly, Doctor, it's enough to make one ill.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare typically covers both oral medications and topical creams for bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections, Jinnie. Let me just verify your coverage here… Okay, yes, you have coverage for both. There may be a small co-pay, depending on your specific plan, but it should be manageable. I’ll also make a note on your chart to alert the pharmacy, so they can check your coverage and inform you of the exact cost before you pick up the medication. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… wonderful. Manageable co-pay… that’s a relief. And alerting the pharmacy… excellent. No, Doctor, I think that’s all. You’ve been most helpful and… reassuring. Honestly, it’s a comfort to have a doctor who takes the time to explain things and… listen. Thank you again, Doctor Alzoubi. I do appreciate your kindness. I’ll await your call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jinnie. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
