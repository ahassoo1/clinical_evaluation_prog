DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. I get really red, you see. Happens sometimes. Not always, but… yeah. My face gets hot, and then red. It's been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Flushing,” you said. And it’s been going on for a little while. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Not easy to say when. Sometimes after I eat… not always spicy food, just… food. And sometimes… just happens. When I’m talking, maybe? Or… I don’t know. It doesn’t seem to have a pattern. It just… does it. It's not painful, just… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems to be somewhat unpredictable, and can happen with or without eating, and sometimes even while you're speaking. You mentioned it's not painful, just embarrassing. How long does an episode of flushing usually last?
PATIENT: Oh… maybe five, ten minutes? Sometimes shorter. It comes on pretty quick, then fades. Not a long time, thankfully. But it’s enough to… notice, you know? People look. It’s… not nice. I don’t think it's getting worse, but it's definitely not going away.
DOCTOR: Okay. Five to ten minutes, comes on quickly, and fades relatively fast. Not getting worse, but not improving either. Do you notice anything else happening when you flush?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes my heart feels a little fast. Not like racing, but… thump-thump-thump a little louder. And… maybe a little warm feeling, not just my face, but… all over. Like a little bit sweaty. But not a lot. Just… warm. Is that important? I don't know what's important.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a slightly faster heartbeat and a little bit of warmth and mild sweating accompanying the flushing. That is helpful information. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. No, not really. I sleep okay, I think. I eat… mostly okay. I don't drink much alcohol, never have. And I don't smoke. I used to feel a little sad after my wife… well, after she passed, but that was a long time ago. I'm okay now. Just the flushing. It's just... it bothers me. Is there something wrong with my heart?
DOCTOR: Okay. No changes in sleep or appetite, minimal alcohol or tobacco use. You’ve experienced grief, but feel you’ve largely recovered. And the main concern is the flushing itself. You’re understandably worried about your heart. Let’s take a look at your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I haven’t taken many medications in my life, to be honest. A little something for a cold sometimes, but… nothing serious. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I’m pretty careful with what I put in my body.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you don't take any regular medications. Let me just ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I've been to the doctor for checkups, you know, when I needed to, but they always said I was… healthy enough. A little high cholesterol once, but they said diet would fix it, and it did. My wife… she had some problems, but I didn’t. I’m a pretty simple man, I think. Not much trouble with my health. Mostly. This flushing is new.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, generally healthy, cholesterol was managed with diet, and the flushing is a new symptom. And just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never needed any. Broken a bone when I was a boy, fell out of a tree, but that’s it. Just a cast on my arm for a few weeks. Nothing serious. I'm lucky, I guess. Always been pretty good at avoiding trouble. Except for this… flushing. It's very strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries, just a broken arm as a child. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, high blood pressure, skin problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm... My mother, she had some problems with her stomach. And my father... he had high blood pressure, I think. It made him tired a lot. And my sister… she had some skin problems, rashes sometimes. But that’s all I can really remember. We didn’t talk about health much. It wasn’t… polite, you know? I don't know if it’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of stomach problems in your mother, high blood pressure in your father, and skin issues in your sister. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I want to find out what's causing this. Listening to my heart sounds… sensible. Please do what you need to. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. That's not drastically high, but something we should keep an eye on. Your heart rhythm sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your skin. I'm not seeing any obvious rashes or abnormalities right now. Your skin appears generally healthy, but I can see some mild redness in your cheeks. And I'm noticing some small visible blood vessels, telangiectasias, on your nose and cheeks. Do you have a history of sun exposure?
PATIENT: Sun exposure? Not much, Doctor. I mostly work inside. I try to stay out of the sun when I can. I did spend some time in India when I was younger, of course, it gets very hot there, but that was a long time ago. I don't burn easily, I don’t think. I always thought my skin was… strong. These little lines… are those bad? Are those causing the flushing?
DOCTOR: Okay. Minimal sun exposure, some time in India years ago, and you don’t burn easily. These small visible blood vessels—telangiectasias—are common and can develop with age or sun exposure. They don’t necessarily cause the flushing, but they can be more visible when you do flush. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing rosacea. It’s a common skin condition that causes redness, flushing, and sometimes small bumps. It's often triggered by things like spicy foods, alcohol, stress, or even temperature changes. It’s not serious, but it can be bothersome. Would you be alright if we tried a topical cream to see if that helps?
PATIENT: A… topical cream? Like, put on my face? Is it strong? I don't want anything that will burn my skin. Rosacea… I've never heard of that. Is it something I got from the sun? Or… from eating something? It’s just… I want to know what’s happening. And I want it to stop. Is the cream safe?
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s understandable to be cautious. The cream I'm thinking of, metronidazole, is generally very safe. It's an antibiotic that helps reduce inflammation. It’s not a strong medication, and it doesn’t usually cause burning, though some people experience mild dryness or irritation initially. As for what causes rosacea, it’s not entirely clear. It’s likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors – things like sun exposure, stress, diet, and even your gut microbiome. It's not contagious, and it’s not caused by anything you’ve done wrong. We’ll start with a low dose and see how your skin responds. If it doesn't help, or if you experience any irritation, we can try something else. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… alright. Low dose is good. I don't want to put anything strong on my face. And it’s not my fault? That’s good to know. It’s just… I want to feel normal again. What will happen if it doesn’t work? Is there anything else I can do? Like… change my diet? Or… avoid stress? I want to understand everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're right to ask those questions. It's not your fault, and rosacea isn't caused by anything you did. If the metronidazole cream doesn’t help, we have other options, including other topical medications, oral antibiotics, or even laser therapy. Lifestyle modifications can also be helpful. Avoiding known triggers like spicy foods, alcohol, and excessive sun exposure can reduce flushing. Managing stress is a good idea, although you're right, it's easier said than done. We can talk about stress management techniques, if you'd like. Also, using a gentle cleanser and moisturizer can help protect your skin. And wearing sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher is crucial, even on cloudy days. I’m going to write you a prescription for the metronidazole cream. Use it as directed – usually a thin layer to the affected areas twice a day. It may take several weeks to see improvement. I want you to follow up with me in six weeks so we can see how it’s working. Do you have any questions about the prescription or the instructions?
PATIENT: Six weeks… alright. That seems… long. But I understand. A gentle cleanser and moisturizer… I can do that. And I will try to avoid spicy foods. And sunscreen, definitely. My mother always told me to wear sunscreen. I will follow up in six weeks. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I feel a little bit better, knowing what it might be. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any side effects from the cream, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here’s the prescription, and a handout with more information about rosacea. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in six weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
