DOCTOR: Alright, Bradlee, good to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor Auelua. Well, it's… about getting surgery. For weight loss. My wife helped me set up the appointment. I don't really… remember all the details, to be honest. Something about needing an evaluation before they’ll do it? It’s bariatric, I think she said. I just… I want to feel better, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, bariatric surgery evaluation. That's perfectly alright, it can be a lot to take in. It is a big step. And no worries at all about not remembering everything - we'll go through it together. So, your wife helped set up the appointment, which is great. Just to clarify, you're hoping to discuss whether bariatric surgery is a good option for you?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. That's it. I just… I've been bigger for a long time, and nothing really seems to stick, you know? Diets, trying to exercise… it feels like a losing battle. My wife is worried about my health, and she thought this might be a good way to… well, to finally do something that actually works. I trust her judgement. But I'm a little nervous, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable. It is a big decision, and it’s good you’re thinking it through and have your wife’s support. It sounds like you've already put a lot of effort into trying other methods, which is really important. Okay, let's start by getting a bit more information. Can you tell me a little bit about how long you’ve been dealing with weight issues?
PATIENT: Uh… a long time. Honestly, most of my adult life, probably. I was… not small as a kid either. Maybe since high school? It's hard to pinpoint. It's just… always been something I struggle with. I don’t really remember a time when I wasn't trying to lose weight, you know? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. And it sounds frustrating to have been dealing with it for so long. “Always trying” – I hear that a lot. Okay. And roughly, what’s your current height and weight?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I'm… not very tall. Maybe five foot… one? Five-one, five-two? And weight… I think around 140? Give or take a few pounds. I haven't weighed myself recently, to be honest. It's… easier not to. My wife has a scale, but… I don't ask her to tell me.
DOCTOR: Alright, roughly five foot one or two, and around 140 pounds. Thanks for sharing that, even if it's an estimate. It’s helpful to get a general idea. And have you noticed any health problems that you think might be related to your weight?
PATIENT: Um… well, I get tired easily. Really easily. And sometimes my knees hurt, especially after I’ve been walking or standing for a while. My doctor… a different doctor… said something about my blood pressure being a little high a few years ago, but I don't really remember all the details. I think I was supposed to watch my salt intake or something. And… sometimes I get winded just climbing the stairs. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts. Fatigue, knee pain, and getting winded easily, along with a history of slightly elevated blood pressure – those can all be related to weight. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don't take any regular medications. Nothing at all. And allergies… I think I’m allergic to… dust? It makes me sneeze sometimes. But that's it, as far as I know. Nothing serious, anyway. My wife says I should probably get tested, but… I haven’t gotten around to it. I don't think it’s that bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, and a mild dust allergy. Good to know. Now, I'm going to ask some questions about your lifestyle, if that's alright. Just to get a broader picture. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Uh, no, I don't smoke. Never have. And… I used to drink, a little. Maybe a beer or two on the weekends. But I stopped a few years ago. My wife didn’t like it, and honestly, I didn’t really miss it. It didn't make me feel very good. So… no, not anymore.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Okay. And what about your diet right now?
PATIENT: Uh… well, it's not great. I work in retail, so I'm often grabbing something quick for lunch – sandwiches, or fast food. My wife tries to cook healthy meals, but sometimes I’m just too tired when I get home to eat them. We eat a lot of rice, I think. And… I like sweets. I have a bit of a sweet tooth. Chocolate, mostly. I try not to eat too much, but… it’s hard. I’m not a big breakfast person, if that makes a difference. Mostly just coffee.
DOCTOR: Alright, so coffee for breakfast, quick lunches due to work, rice frequently, and a fondness for sweets. That’s a pretty typical pattern, honestly. Now, before we discuss potential surgical options further, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Just to get a baseline and check your overall health. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your abdomen. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, okay. That’s fine. I guess. Just… don’t make it too uncomfortable, alright? I’m not very good with… medical stuff. I get a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll make sure it’s as comfortable as possible, and we can take breaks whenever you need them. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 142 over 88. A little elevated, as you mentioned previously. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Finally, let's just quickly examine your abdomen. It’s soft, no tenderness to touch. Your weight is distributed evenly. Okay. Everything seems relatively normal so far. Now, do you have any family history of obesity, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. My mom… she was a little overweight. And my dad… he had some heart problems, I think. He had to have… a procedure or something, a long time ago. But that's about it, as far as I know. Nobody else in my family… really had any serious health problems. I think. It's hard to remember all the details, honestly. My wife knows more about that sort of thing. But yeah, my mom was a little overweight, and my dad had heart problems. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of some overweightness in your mother and heart problems in your father. That's helpful to know. Now, Bradlee, based on what you've told me—your history of struggling with weight, your previous attempts at weight loss, your lifestyle, and your family history—bariatric surgery could be an option. However, it's a significant procedure, and it's not right for everyone. Before we proceed, we’ll need to get some blood work done to check your overall health and ensure you're a suitable candidate. We'll also need to get an EKG to check your heart function. I’ll also need you to have a consultation with a cardiologist. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Wow… that’s a lot. Blood work, an EKG, a cardiologist… It feels… overwhelming. Is that normal? I just… I was hoping it would be a little simpler. So… you're saying I might be a candidate, but I need all these tests first? And… what if I don’t pass the tests?
DOCTOR: It is a lot, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. It is a complex process, and we need to be thorough to ensure your safety and the best possible outcome. Think of these tests as a way to make sure you’re in the best possible shape to undergo the procedure, and to rule out any potential risks. And yes, you’re right – you might be a candidate. These tests will give us a clearer picture of your health. And what if you don’t pass?
PATIENT: Um… what would happen if I didn’t pass? Would that mean I just… couldn’t get the surgery? And what kind of things would make me not pass? Would I have to… lose weight first? It’s just… I’m not sure I have the energy for all this. I've been trying for so long. I just want something to work.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, and it’s important to know. If you didn’t pass the tests, it wouldn’t necessarily mean you can never have the surgery. It would mean we need to address those health concerns first. For example, if your blood work shows uncontrolled diabetes, we’d need to get that under control before proceeding. Or if the EKG shows a significant heart issue, we’d need to get that evaluated and treated. Sometimes, it does mean weight loss is necessary beforehand. The surgery is safer and more effective when you’re at a certain weight. But we would work with you to create a plan – perhaps with a nutritionist or weight loss program – to help you achieve that. And it's understandable that you're feeling tired and discouraged after trying for so long. This process isn't about immediately jumping to surgery. It’s about creating a healthier you, regardless of whether surgery is the right path. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you want me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Um… yes, please. That would help. Just… knowing what to expect would make me feel a little less… anxious. And what… what exactly does a nutritionist do? I've heard the word, but I don't really know what they’re supposed to… do. And how long would all this take? I work full time, and honestly, I don't have a lot of free time. I just… I feel like I'm already overwhelmed. I don't want to make things worse. .
DOCTOR: Alright, let's break it down. First, the tests. Blood Work: We'll take a sample to check your blood sugar levels, cholesterol, kidney and liver function, and some other important indicators of your overall health. This helps us rule out any underlying medical conditions that might make surgery risky. EKG : This is a simple, non-invasive test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us identify any heart rhythm problems or other heart issues. Now, a Nutritionist: A nutritionist can help you create a personalized eating plan that is healthy, sustainable, and tailored to your needs and preferences. They can teach you about portion control, healthy food choices, and how to manage cravings. They aren’t there to put you on a strict diet, it’s more about learning how to make long-term, positive changes to your eating habits. As for how long this will take… it varies. The blood work and EKG can usually be done within a week. The cardiologist appointment might take a few weeks to schedule. If you do need to lose weight, that timeline will depend on your starting weight and your rate of loss. We can work around your work schedule as much as possible, and there are resources available to help you manage your time. Look, Bradlee, it's okay to feel overwhelmed. This is a big commitment, and it's a lot to take in. We can take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Does that sound alright?
