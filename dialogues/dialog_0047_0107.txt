DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Puder, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's me. Philipp Puder. It’s good to meet you, Doctor... Press, right? I think the lady on the phone said that.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. Dr. Press. Though please, just Genna is fine. So, what brings you in today, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: Well, my heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it's racing, but not… strong racing, you know? More like… flapping. It started a few weeks ago, maybe a month. It comes and goes. My wife, she said I should come see someone. She worries.
DOCTOR: “Flapping,” right. And it comes and goes… how often would you say this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… not every day. Maybe… two or three times a week? Sometimes not for a few days at a time. It's hard to say exactly. It doesn't last long when it happens, maybe a minute or two. It just… feels weird. Not painful, just… unsettling. Like something is not right.
DOCTOR: And does anything bring it on?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I try to think… No. It happens when I’m doing nothing, when I’m walking, even when I’m sleeping sometimes, my wife says. I don’t feel stressed or anything when it starts. Maybe after I eat something heavy? But I eat heavy food a lot, and it doesn’t always happen. It’s confusing.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Do you have any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Sometimes I feel a little… tired afterwards. Not very tired, just… more tired than usual. And maybe a little… short of breath, but just for a moment, when the flapping is happening. Not like I can’t breathe, but… I notice it more, you know? It’s hard to explain. I don't think that's always happening though. Sometimes just the flapping.
DOCTOR: And do you have any medical problems at all?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu, like everyone, a few times. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed good. Nothing the doctors ever had to do anything about, if you know what I mean. No high blood pressure or anything like that. My wife keeps telling me I need to go to the doctor more, but I feel okay most of the time. Except for this heart thing, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my father, he had… something with his heart. I don’t remember exactly what, I was young. It was a long time ago. He passed away when I was maybe fifteen. My mother, she is still alive, she is okay. She's old now, though. She doesn’t have any heart problems that I know of. I think my grandfather, on my mother’s side, maybe he had something too… but I don’t really know for sure. Everyone back home doesn’t talk much about these things.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. I just drink tea, mostly. And coffee, sometimes. My wife tries to get me to take vitamins, but I forget. I told you, I don't like many pills. Just tea and coffee, that's it.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Just to get a baseline. Then, depending on what I hear, we might need to do some further testing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on with my heart. I don’t want it to get worse. Listening and checking, that's fine. Go ahead. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Right. If you’ll just lie down on the table here. I'll need you to remove your shirt.
PATIENT: Okay. Is it cold in here? I feel a little chilly. I hope it doesn't take too long. Just the shirt, right? Nothing else?
DOCTOR: Just your shirt, Mr. Puder. And yes, the air conditioning can be a bit… enthusiastic. We'll be quick. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that… normal how tight that is? It feels a bit… snug. I don't like feeling restricted. But if you say it's okay, I trust you, Doctor. Just tell me if it's going to hurt.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142 over 90. Not critically high, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Take deep breaths, if you would. Breathe in… and out… Breathe in… and out… Anything causing you stress recently?
PATIENT: Stress? Not really. Work is work, you know? The same every day. My wife worries a lot, maybe that stresses me out a little, but… it’s nothing major. Just normal life stuff. Is something wrong? You’re listening for a long time. Did you hear something? I hope it's not serious. What do you think is going on?
DOCTOR: Your heart rhythm is a little irregular. I’m hearing what sounds like a few extra beats, what we call premature atrial contractions, or PACs. It's not immediately alarming, but it explains what you're feeling. Your lungs sound clear. Given your family history, and the irregular rhythm, I think we should do an EKG to get a better picture. It's a simple test, and it will give us more information. We'll also order some blood work to check your thyroid and electrolytes. It is important to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: EKG? Is that… painful? Will it take long? And blood work… how much blood? I don’t like needles. My wife said something about my heart… she’s very worried. Is this… serious? Are you going to have to give me pills? I really don’t want pills.
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, let's not jump to conclusions. An EKG is not painful. It involves placing small stickers on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It takes about five minutes. The blood work is a standard test, and we'll only take a small amount. As for pills… we will cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now, we need information. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood and set up the EKG. I’m ordering these tests as a precaution, to rule out anything serious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Precaution. That sounds better. So, just stickers and a little blood? No… cutting or anything? And the nurse will explain everything? I'm a little nervous. My wife… she always worries too much, and then I worry. But I’m glad you’re checking, Doctor. Thank you. How long until I get the results? Will they tell me right away if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: The nurse will explain everything. It will take a few days to get the results back. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If anything urgent shows up, we will call you immediately. Now, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just… please, if it's not too serious, don’t give me pills. My wife will be so happy to hear you're checking. Thank you, Doctor Press. You've been very helpful. I'll just wait for the nurse, then. I hope she's gentle with the needles. I'm not very good with those. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
