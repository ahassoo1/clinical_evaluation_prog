DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It’s…Kammer, yes. Early Kammer. Look, it’s not a problem, exactly. More… a little encouragement, you understand? My daughter, she thinks I should get one of those… cards. A “Get Well” card. Even though I feel alright. But she worries so. It’s a nice thought, I suppose, if you think it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: A “Get Well” card…right. And she's concerned about…what specifically, Mr. Kammer?
PATIENT: Well, she says I’ve been… low. A little down. But I always been a quiet man. Doesn’t mean I’m sick. I used to work with boilers, you know? Big machines. Powerful things. A man doesn’t get sad working with those. It’s just… life, you know? She fusses too much. But she’s a good girl. Wants me to have a card from the doctor. Says it’ll… show her I’m being taken care of. It’s silly, really.
DOCTOR: So, she's worried about a change in your mood, and feels a visit – and documentation of that visit – would reassure her. Is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: Yes. That's… pretty much it. She always needs things official. A piece of paper, a doctor’s note… something she can hold. Like it makes it real. I told her I’m fine. Been fine for years. But she insists. It's a waste of your time, really. A strong man doesn’t need a card to feel better. But... I don’t want to upset her. You understand. It's just…a card. From a doctor. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, while I appreciate your daughter's concern, and understand you're feeling well, a medical visit is about more than just a “card.” It's about making sure you are healthy. Even if you feel fine, there could be underlying issues. To be thorough, let’s go through a brief review of your health history and do a quick physical exam. It'll be quick, and it'll give both you and your daughter peace of mind. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Now hold on just a minute. A physical exam? For a card? That's… that's ridiculous. I told you, I’m perfectly fine. Boilers don’t let you be weak. And I don't see how poking and prodding is going to help with my daughter’s… worries. I just want you to write the card, Doctor. Say I’m doing well. That’s all. This is getting to be a waste of my time. You’re a doctor, not a… a boiler inspector.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, I am not simply “writing a card.” I am a physician, and my responsibility is to assess your overall health. A “quick visit” as you describe it, without a proper evaluation, would be irresponsible. I understand you feel well, but changes in mood can indicate an underlying medical condition. Dismissing those changes without investigation is not in your best interest. To reiterate: I need to understand your medical history, and perform a basic physical exam to ensure there isn’t something else going on. It’s not about the card, it’s about providing you with appropriate medical care. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. Strong lungs, you see? From the steam. Always fresh air down in the boiler room. Look, I don’t understand why you’re making this so difficult. It's just a… a formality. My daughter wants a card, you write a card. Simple. You’re a doctor. Write that I’m… robust. Healthy. Capable. Is that so hard? I swear, they don’t make doctors like they used to. Always poking and prodding… What do you even need to know my history for? I’ve lived a long life. A good life. Boilers don’t let you be weak, I tell you. It's… frustrating. Just write the card, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration. However, I am not going to simply write a card stating you are “robust” without any assessment. That is not ethical medical practice. Let’s try this. Can you tell me about any changes you have noticed in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes… well, I sleep more, maybe. But that’s… old age. What do you expect? And my appetite isn't what it used to be, but who needs to eat like a horse? I worked hard all my life. A man gets tired. It’s… natural. I don't see what this has to do with anything. Look, I used to be able to climb those boiler stairs without even breathing hard. Now, it takes me a little longer. That’s it. A little longer. But I still climb them. Does that make sense? It’s just… getting old, Doctor. That’s all. It's not a disease. Just… time passing. Are we done now? Can you please just write the card?
DOCTOR: Okay. You’ve mentioned sleeping more and a decreased appetite. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, Mr. Kammer?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Maybe a little. The clothes fit a little looser, I suppose. But it’s the heat, you know? Summer. Makes you sweat. And I don’t eat as much when it’s hot. I don't weigh myself every day like some women I know. It's not important. I feel… alright. Still strong enough to fix things around the house. Still drive the car. Still… exist. But I suppose my daughter would say I'm fading away. She always exaggerates. Are we getting anywhere with this card yet, Doctor? Honestly, this is… tedious.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, a decrease in appetite coupled with weight loss can be significant, even if you don't feel particularly unwell. And changes in sleep patterns can also indicate underlying issues. Before I dismiss anything, I need to ask a few more questions to get a complete picture. Have you been experiencing any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Now hold on. What kind of questions are you asking now? I came here for a card, Doctor, not… a personal interrogation. I don’t discuss those things with strangers. It’s… private. And frankly, it’s insulting. I don’t see how my… bathroom habits have anything to do with my daughter wanting a “Get Well” card. I think I’ve had enough of this. I’m leaving. Just write on the card, "Mr. Kammer is a strong, capable man." and be done with it. I have better things to do than answer… those questions.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, please. I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, but they are necessary for a proper assessment. I understand your discomfort, but changes in bowel habits can be indicative of serious medical conditions. It's my responsibility to investigate these changes. I am not trying to be insulting, I’m trying to ensure your health. Look, how about this?
PATIENT: What now? I swear, this is ridiculous. I came in for a simple card and I’m getting a full-blown medical examination. I’m not sick! I just want my daughter to stop worrying. You’re making a mountain out of a molehill. And frankly, I’m starting to feel… offended. I’ve lived a good, long life. I’ve taken care of myself. I don’t need you poking and prodding and asking me about… about everything. It’s just a card… just a card.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand you're frustrated and feel I'm overstepping. However, I have a duty to ensure your well-being. You mentioned changes in sleep, appetite, and weight, and now you're understandably reluctant to discuss further details. Given your discomfort and refusal to cooperate with a proper assessment, I cannot in good conscience simply write a card stating you are healthy. I'm concerned about potential underlying issues that I cannot rule out without more information. Therefore, I recommend you schedule an appointment with a specialist – a gastroenterologist – for a more thorough evaluation. I can provide a referral. In the meantime, I will document my concerns and your refusal to cooperate. I will not write the card. It would be unethical to do so. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A specialist? A gastroenterologist? For a card? This is… preposterous! Absolutely preposterous! You’re a doctor, not a… a card writer! I came here for a simple act of kindness, and you’re sending me to a… a stomach doctor? My daughter will never believe this. She’ll think you’re trying to… to scare me! I’ve wasted enough of my time here. You clearly don’t understand what I came for. And frankly, I don’t think you want to understand. I’m leaving. And I’m finding another doctor. One who understands the importance of… a simple card. .
