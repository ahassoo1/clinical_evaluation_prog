DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s about my coloring, I suppose. A bit yellow, you see. It’s been bothering me, and… someone suggested I come see about it. I believe it has something to do with my liver? Though, frankly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It's all a bit of a blur, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Yellowing of the skin can be concerning, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. You’re right to think it could be liver-related, but there are other possibilities as well. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. When did you first notice the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s… difficult. It was some time ago, I think. Perhaps a few weeks? Or maybe longer. Honestly, Doctor, dates just slip my mind these days. It wasn't sudden, that much I remember. It just… gradually became more noticeable. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. It’s perfectly understandable. A few weeks, gradually becoming more noticeable… that’s helpful. Has anything else changed along with the coloring?
PATIENT: Let me think… I've been… rather tired lately. More so than usual, I suppose. And… my appetite hasn’t been very good. Not a large change, but not quite myself. Oh, and perhaps a bit of discomfort… a dull ache, under my ribs on the right side, sometimes. But it comes and goes. Is that… relevant? I do hope I'm not bothering you with all this uncertainty.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Annelle. This is all very relevant information. Tiredness, decreased appetite, and that discomfort under your ribs… all things we need to explore. Now, has this discomfort been constant, or does it come and go with certain activities, like eating?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. It’s not…sharp, you understand. Just a dull ache. And it seems… worse after I eat, perhaps. Especially if I’ve had anything…rich. Although, truthfully, I haven’t been eating much of anything lately, so it’s difficult to say for certain. It’s all rather muddled, Doctor. I wish I could be of more assistance.
DOCTOR: Okay. Muddled is alright, we'll sort through it. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as liver problems, gallbladder issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh my… that's a difficult question. I’ve seen doctors over the years, of course. But… I don't recall any specific diagnoses. I believe there was something… a bit of trouble with my liver, a long time ago? Perhaps decades. But it was… minor, I think. Nothing serious enough to… well, to remember clearly. I truly apologize. I’m afraid my memory is a sieve. I’m not even certain what they said was wrong. Is there a way to… find out?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Annelle. We can certainly try to find out. Do you recall where you received medical care back then?
PATIENT: No, I don't, Doctor. It was…so long ago. Different doctors, different towns… I’ve moved about quite a bit in my life. It wasn’t a specific hospital, or practice. Just… visits as needed. And frankly, I didn’t keep very good records. It's all rather frustrating, I know. I wish I could be more helpful. Perhaps if we just… ran some tests? That might be easier. I really don’t want to waste your time dredging up things I can’t recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, running some tests is a very good idea. Before we do that, just a few more quick questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I believe I had my appendix removed, a very long time ago. When I was quite young. But that’s the only one I can recall with any certainty. Perhaps… perhaps a small procedure on my… gall bladder at some point? But it was minor, I believe. Honestly, Doctor, I’m grasping at straws here. It was all so long ago. I hope you’ll forgive my confusion.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and possibly a gallbladder procedure. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything regularly. Just… a little something for aches and pains, occasionally. Over-the-counter, you understand. Nothing prescribed. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I’ve always been a bit… cautious about putting things into my body, if you understand. It's probably foolish, but… that’s just me. So, no regular medications, no. Just the occasional pain reliever when absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything, thankfully. Perhaps a slight rash once or twice, but nothing serious. I haven't specifically been diagnosed with any allergies, no. I believe I’m generally quite… resilient. But it’s always possible, of course. I do apologize for being so vague. I wish I could provide more concrete information.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family, such as liver disease, gallbladder problems, or any cancers?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history. That’s… difficult. I haven’t been in close contact with my family for many years, you see. My parents… they’ve both passed away, long ago. And I don't recall any specific illnesses that afflicted them. Perhaps heart trouble? My father was quite… robust, so I doubt it. And my mother… she lived a long life, thankfully. But honestly, I don’t recall any significant medical history. It's all a bit of a blur, Doctor. I truly apologize. I’m afraid I can’t be of much assistance. I'm just not a very good record keeper, it seems.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much and how often?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not drink alcohol. Never have, actually. It never appealed to me, you see. I prefer a cup of tea, if anything. It's… a habit from my childhood, I suppose. But no alcohol, not at all. I've always been rather… cautious about putting things into my body. It’s probably foolish, but… that's just me. I hope that’s helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Annelle. And finally, do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve never smoked. Never have, and never will. I find the smell… quite unpleasant, actually. It’s always been something I’ve avoided. My lungs are… important to me. I try to take good care of myself, you see. I apologize for being so…verbose. I do ramble sometimes. But no, I’ve never smoked. Is there anything else I can help you with? I'm quite eager to get to the bottom of this, and I'm hoping the tests will provide some answers. Perhaps we should just get started?
DOCTOR: Okay, Annelle. That's very helpful. Thank you for being so thorough, even if it’s been difficult to recall everything. It sounds like we have a pretty good starting point. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement, and I'll also check your skin color more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly alright. I trust your judgment implicitly. Do whatever you need to do. I’m ready, whenever you are. I'm hoping this will help us determine the cause of my… coloring. Perhaps if we hurry, we can have some answers soon?
DOCTOR: Alright, Annelle. Let’s begin. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, rate is 78. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. A little. Just… a dull ache, when you press there. It's not sharp, you understand. Just… uncomfortable. It's been… intermittent, you see. Not always there. But yes, a little discomfort when you press on the right side. It's not terribly painful, but I do notice it. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Okay, I notice some mild tenderness in your right upper quadrant, and your liver feels slightly enlarged. It's subtle, but it’s there. No rebound tenderness, which is good. The rest of your abdomen is soft and non-distended. Your skin does have a yellowish tinge, as you mentioned, mostly noticeable in the sclera of your eyes. Based on what I’m finding, your symptoms and the exam, I think we need to run some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll check your liver function, bilirubin levels, and a complete blood count. Do you have any allergies to blood draws?
PATIENT: Blood tests… No, Doctor. I don't believe so. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve had blood drawn before, a few times. It’s never been a pleasant experience, but I haven’t had any…reactions. Just a little bruising, occasionally. But yes, no allergies to blood draws, as far as I know. Will this tell us… what’s wrong? I’m rather anxious to know the cause of all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The blood tests will give us a lot of information. We'll check for signs of liver inflammation, obstruction, and overall liver function. It will also rule out some other possibilities. I’m going to order those tests now. The lab is just down the hall. They will draw about two vials of blood. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It usually takes 2-3 business days for the results to come back. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or changes in your stool or urine color—please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Two to three business days… No, I don’t think so. Perhaps just… what could this be, Doctor? Is it serious? I know you can’t say for certain without the tests, but… what are the possibilities? I’m rather anxious, you see. And I wish I could be more helpful, providing a clearer history. I do apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Annelle. It’s good you’re asking. Based on your symptoms and the exam, the possibilities include several things. It could be something relatively minor, like a temporary liver inflammation, perhaps caused by a mild infection. However, the yellowish color and enlarged liver could also indicate a more serious condition, such as gallstones blocking the bile duct, hepatitis, or, less commonly, a problem with the liver itself. That's why the tests are so important. They'll help us pinpoint the exact cause. I want to emphasize that we don’t have enough information to make a diagnosis yet, and it’s important not to jump to conclusions. We’ll take things one step at a time. The most important thing right now is to get these tests done, so we can get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. One step at a time… yes. I’ll go to the lab then. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I do appreciate it. I’ll let them know you sent me. I do hope the tests are… informative. .
