DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Kandy. I'm Dr. Galena. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it’s my waterworks, really. I’ve been having a bit of trouble… going. It just takes me a long time, and sometimes it doesn’t feel like I get everything out, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, “trouble going,” takes a long time, and a feeling of incomplete emptying… right. And how long is “a little while” exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, hmm… probably around February, maybe March of this year. So, about six months now. It wasn’t terrible at first, just a little slow. But it’s gotten… more noticeable lately. I remember because the snow was still pretty bad then. We had that big storm… the one that shut down the post office for a week. It started around then.
DOCTOR: February, March… with the big snowstorm… okay, that helps me pinpoint things. And has anything changed recently that’s made it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of. I haven’t been sick, no different diet, same routine really. I still walk to work most days, weather permitting, of course. And I haven’t changed any of my… well, anything, really. I'm quite a creature of habit, you see. It just… gradually got harder. Though, now that I think about it, I did switch brands of tea a few months back… but I doubt that would do anything, would it? It’s just Earl Grey now, instead of English Breakfast.
DOCTOR: No changes in routine, consistent walking… and a switch to Earl Grey tea. We’ll make a note of that, though it's unlikely to be the cause. Just trying to be thorough. Now, tell me a little bit more about how it's difficult. Is it painful?
PATIENT: Painful? Not exactly painful, no. It's more like… straining. Like I have to push a bit harder than I used to. And sometimes it starts and stops, you know? It's not a strong stream, not like it used to be. It's just… weak and hesitant. And I have to go back to the bathroom again not too long after I’ve been, which is… inconvenient, to say the least. Especially when I’m at work.
DOCTOR: Straining, intermittent stream, weak flow, and frequent trips to the bathroom… alright. And would you say you feel like you're completely emptying your bladder each time, or is there always a little bit left?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. No, I don’t, really. It doesn't feel like I get everything out. Like there’s still a little bit left in there. It’s not a lot, but it’s enough to… bother me, you know? I find myself having to go more often because of it. It’s just… nagging, really. And it keeps me up at night sometimes, worrying about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a feeling of incomplete emptying, and that’s causing you to go more frequently, and it’s impacting your sleep. We need to get this sorted out. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine? Hmm… let me think. No, I don't think so. It looks… normal, I suppose. The usual color, no blood, no foam, nothing strange. I haven't noticed anything different about that, no. It just goes in the toilet like it always does. Though, it does smell a bit stronger sometimes, maybe? But that could just be the tea… or maybe I'm just noticing it more now.
DOCTOR: No changes in urine appearance, perhaps a slightly stronger odor… alright. And have you had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain alongside this?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And no abdominal pain, not really. My stomach feels alright. Sometimes a little bit of discomfort, just like… a dull ache, but that's probably just my age, you know? I get a bit of indigestion sometimes, but nothing serious. It's not related to my waterworks, I don't think. It’s just… old lady problems, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or significant abdominal pain. Just some occasional indigestion. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I have a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. I take a little pill for it every day. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be twenty years ago now. Other than that, nothing much, really. I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think. I try to eat right and get my steps in. I’m also allergic to penicillin, if that matters.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and a penicillin allergy. Good to know. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: No, just the one. A small white pill. I take it every morning with my tea. And sometimes a little something for my arthritis when it flares up, but that's just over-the-counter, you know? Ibuprofen, or something like that. Nothing regularly, though. Mostly just the blood pressure pill.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication, occasional ibuprofen for arthritis. Now, let's move on to family history. Is there anyone in your family who has had similar problems with their bladder or kidneys?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… My mother, she had some trouble with her waterworks when she got older, I remember that. She didn't talk about it much, but I know she had to go to the doctor a few times for it. And my aunt, on my father’s side, she had kidney stones, I think. But other than that, not that I know of. Nobody talked much about their… insides, you know? It wasn’t really the done thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, your mother had some bladder issues and your aunt had kidney stones. That's helpful to know. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I only drink a little bit of wine with my dinner sometimes. Just a small glass, maybe two, on a special occasion. Nothing regular, I assure you. I’m not much of a drinker, never have been. A cup of tea is more my style.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional wine. Alright, Kandy, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check things out and see if we can get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's going to be… uncomfortable. I’m not as spry as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll explain everything as we go, and we'll take it slow. First, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then, I’ll do a quick neurological check, and finally, a gentle pelvic exam. It might be slightly uncomfortable, but we'll be as gentle as possible. Would you like to undress from the waist down, and I’ll provide a gown?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. A gown would be lovely, thank you. Just let me know if you need me to move in a particular way. My joints aren’t as cooperative as they once were, you see.
DOCTOR: You can change in there, Kandy. I’ll be just outside when you’re ready. Take your time. And please, don't hesitate to let me know if you need any assistance.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, I'm ready when you are. It’s a bit chilly in here, isn’t it? Though, I suppose that’s just my age. I always feel the cold more these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a bit cool in here. I'll try to be as quick as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Just breathe normally, Kandy. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don’t hear any unusual sounds. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Can you please lie flat on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. These old bones aren't as flexible as they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal. Now, I’m going to perform a gentle pelvic exam. I’ll explain everything as I go. Please, let me know if you experience any discomfort. I’m just going to take a quick look inside. This may feel a little cold and slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Hmm… everything looks normal. Your vaginal walls are not atrophied, and there’s no sign of any masses or lesions. Your cervix appears healthy. Now, I’ll just perform a bimanual exam to check your uterus and ovaries. Your uterus feels normal in size and position. Your ovaries are also normal. Everything feels good, Kandy. Okay, that’s all done. You can sit up now when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn't too bad, Doctor, thank you. Everything feels alright. So, what did you find? Is it something serious? I do worry, you know. My mother always had such… troubles.
DOCTOR: Well, Kandy, the good news is, everything felt normal during the exam. There was no tenderness, no masses, and your organs felt healthy. However, your symptoms – the difficulty starting, the feeling of incomplete emptying, and the frequent trips to the bathroom – are concerning, and we need to investigate further. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to rule out a few possibilities. I suspect it could be a combination of things – possibly some weakening of the bladder muscles with age, and perhaps some mild urinary retention. We can do a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. We should also do a urine analysis to check for any infection or other abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A post-void residual test and a urine analysis. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. It’s good to know you’re taking it seriously. I just want to be able to sleep through the night again, you know? And not worry about… accidents. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Kandy, that’s not too much to ask at all. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, we can get you sleeping through the night again. I’ll have the nurse come in and collect a urine sample from you. Then, we’ll do the post-void residual volume test right here in the office. After that, we can discuss the results and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, but avoiding caffeine and alcohol. And try to avoid holding your urine for too long. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds manageable, Doctor. Plenty of fluids, no caffeine or alcohol, and don’t hold it. I can do that. It's funny, isn't it? Such simple things. I suppose I’m just getting old. I'll just wait here for the nurse then, shall I? Thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease a little.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kandy. It's my pleasure. And don't worry about getting old – it happens to the best of us. I'll be right back to discuss the results as soon as they're available. .
