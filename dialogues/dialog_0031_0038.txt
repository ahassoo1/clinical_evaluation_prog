DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um, well, to be frank, it’s a bit difficult for me to explain precisely. I believe I was advised to come speak with a doctor regarding… plans for the future, should something unexpected occur. I think it has to do with a form? An advance directive, perhaps? Honestly, my memory isn’t what it once was, and the details are… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s perfectly alright if the details are fuzzy; that’s what I’m here for. It sounds like you’re thinking about advance care planning – specifically, an advance directive. That’s a very thoughtful thing to consider. To help me understand your needs better, could you tell me a little more about what prompted you to seek this consultation?
PATIENT: That’s… a good way to put it, yes. Advance care planning. My… ex-husband, actually. He mentioned it a few times. Something about needing to be prepared. He handles most of the… paperwork these days, and I trust his judgment. I don’t recall the specific circumstances that led him to suggest it, only that he seemed rather… insistent. I suppose it’s best to have these things sorted, even if I don’t quite grasp the full importance. It's just... a lot to process.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to feel overwhelmed when considering these topics, and it's helpful that you have someone you trust guiding you. So, it sounds like your ex-husband has been the primary driver in bringing this to your attention. To start, do you have any existing documents related to advance care planning, such as a living will or a durable power of attorney for healthcare?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I truly don’t know, Doctor. I’m fairly certain I don’t. My ex-husband manages… everything. Finances, legal matters, correspondence… I’ve always left those things to him. He would have mentioned it if I had something like that already, wouldn’t he? I… I really have no idea. He's quite organized, so if there is something, he'll know where it is. Would he have contacted the clinic directly, perhaps? I sometimes forget what he’s told me, and vice-versa. It’s… rather frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconti. Many people find these processes confusing. Let me check our records to see if we have anything on file regarding advance directives for you. …No, it doesn’t appear we have anything on file. Since your ex-husband manages these matters, it might be best to include him in this discussion, if you are comfortable with that. Would you like me to contact him directly to schedule a joint appointment, or would you prefer to discuss this further on your own first?
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible. Yes, involving him would probably be the most efficient route. I often find I miss important details, and he has a rather… thorough memory. Please, if you wouldn’t mind, contact him directly. His name is Dimitri Volkov. I believe he’ll have all the necessary contact information. He’s… quite good at keeping track of such things. I apologize for the confusion; I truly am trying to be helpful, but my… recall is proving to be a hindrance.
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It's my job to help navigate this, and I appreciate you being so open with me. I will contact Mr. Volkov directly to schedule a joint appointment at your earliest convenience. While we wait to hear back from him, perhaps we could briefly discuss your overall health?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Though, I’m afraid my medical history isn't particularly noteworthy. I generally keep to myself, maintain a quiet lifestyle. I’m a… etcher and engraver, so my work is rather sedentary. No major illnesses, no ongoing treatments… Just the usual aches and pains that come with age, I suppose. I see a… general practitioner for annual check-ups, but nothing significant has ever been flagged. Would knowing my height and weight be useful? I realize I'm rather tall, which sometimes… complicates things.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s good to know, and it's helpful to have a general picture of your health. Knowing your height and weight is useful, and you're right, your height is a bit above average, which can be relevant. I see from my initial assessment that your height is 183 centimeters and your weight is 123 kilograms. Could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Um… let me think. No known medication allergies, I believe. I rarely take anything, to be honest. As for food… I’m not terribly fussy. I do have a slight sensitivity to shellfish, but it’s not a severe allergy. More of a… discomfort, really. A mild rash, perhaps some stomach upset. It's manageable. My ex-husband is very careful to avoid it when preparing meals, thankfully. He's quite… meticulous about such things. I believe I once had a reaction to… a certain type of dye I used in my etching work, but that was many years ago, and I’ve since switched to a different brand.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s good information. So, a mild reaction to shellfish and a past reaction to a specific dye, but nothing currently causing you significant issues. Now, do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I… believe strongly in natural remedies, though I rarely utilize them myself. I have a friend, a herbalist, who often suggests various teas and tinctures, but I haven't found much… benefit in them, personally. I simply try to maintain a healthy lifestyle – quiet work, regular meals, adequate rest. I find that’s usually sufficient. My ex-husband sometimes tries to convince me to take a multivitamin, but I… tend to forget to take it consistently. He’s a very… proactive individual, but I’m rather… set in my ways, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Buoniconti. It sounds like you prioritize a healthy lifestyle. And it's perfectly alright to prefer a natural approach. Now, to get a more complete picture of your health, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Hospitalized… No, I don’t believe so. Not for anything… serious, at least. I had my tonsils removed when I was quite young, but that was a rather routine procedure, I believe. And I broke my arm once, attempting to repair a rather… delicate piece of equipment. But that required only a cast and some minor physiotherapy. Nothing major. I’ve generally been quite… fortunate in terms of my health, I suppose. I try to avoid unnecessary risks, preferring the quiet solitude of my workshop. My ex-husband occasionally worries about my… lack of activity, but I assure him I’m perfectly content.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. A tonsillectomy in childhood and a broken arm, but no other hospitalizations or major surgeries. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… difficult. My family is… rather distant. I wasn't particularly close to my parents, and I have no siblings. My mother… suffered from… some sort of ailment in her later years, I believe. Something neurological, but I wasn’t privy to the details. My father was… a scholar, and he passed away some time ago. I have a few… distant cousins, but I haven’t been in contact with them for many years. I don’t believe there’s a history of… serious illness in the family, but truthfully, I’m not entirely sure. My ex-husband has occasionally inquired about my family history, but I’ve been unable to provide much information. He’s quite… thorough, so I suspect he’s frustrated by my lack of knowledge.
DOCTOR: That's alright. It's common to have limited knowledge of family medical history. We can proceed without it for now. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… social history? Well, I… I live a rather quiet life. I’m divorced, as you likely know. My ex-husband and I remain… amicable, though we don’t share a particularly close relationship. I don’t have any close friends, and I rarely socialize. I spend most of my time in my workshop, working on my etchings and engravings. I don’t… enjoy large gatherings, and I find it difficult to… connect with people. I prefer the solitude, honestly. I don't drink or smoke. I used to… travel occasionally, but I haven't been abroad in many years. It’s… rather lonely, at times, but I’ve grown accustomed to it. My ex-husband… encourages me to be more social, but I politely decline his invitations. He’s a very… outgoing individual, so I suspect he doesn’t quite understand my preferences.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Buoniconti. That’s helpful. It sounds like you value your independence and find contentment in your quiet lifestyle. Finally, just to complete the picture, are there any allergies we haven’t discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. No, I don’t believe so. Not to animals, pollen, or anything like that. I might… occasionally experience a mild reaction to certain types of cleaning products, but nothing severe. Just a slight irritation of the skin. I use… natural cleaning products whenever possible. And, as we discussed, a mild sensitivity to shellfish and a past reaction to a specific dye. I believe that covers everything. Unless… is there something specific you were hoping to inquire about? My memory… is proving to be somewhat unreliable, as you’ve likely noticed. Perhaps my ex-husband would be able to provide a more comprehensive list? He’s quite… meticulous about such things.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Buoniconti, I believe we’ve covered everything for now. You’ve provided a very thorough account, despite your concerns about your memory. It sounds like you’re generally a very healthy individual with a quiet, peaceful lifestyle. Now, before we conclude, I want to reiterate that we are here to discuss your advance care planning. Would you like to proceed with discussing a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare, or would you prefer to wait until your ex-husband is available to join us?
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible. Yes, perhaps it would be best to wait until Dimitri is available. He’s… far more knowledgeable about these things than I am. He’s very… organized, and he’ll likely have a list of questions we should consider. I wouldn't want to… overlook anything important. I’m happy to proceed once he’s available. Thank you for your patience, Doctor. You’ve been very… understanding. And I apologize again for my… forgetfulness. It’s truly… frustrating at times.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. It's perfectly alright. We'll proceed at your pace and include your ex-husband when you’re both ready. I will have my assistant contact him to schedule a joint appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. You've answered all of my… vague inquiries rather thoroughly. I greatly appreciate your… patience and understanding. Thank you once again for your time. And please, do extend my gratitude to your assistant for contacting Dimitri. He'll likely… bombard her with questions, so she should be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. It was a pleasure meeting you. And I'll be sure to let my assistant know. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day. .
