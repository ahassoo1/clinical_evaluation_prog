DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s getting harder to do things, you see. My legs, mostly. Not strong like they used to be. It’s been getting worse, little by little. The wife says I need to come see someone, so here I am.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’ve noticed a gradual weakening in your legs. That’s good of your wife to encourage you to come in. Can you tell me a bit more about how it’s getting harder?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, getting up from a chair is harder. And walking… I used to walk every morning with the wife, but now I need to stop and rest more often. It’s not painful, not really. Just… tiring. Like trying to push through water, sometimes. And I stumble a little more than I used to. It’s worrying the wife, and… well, it’s starting to worry me too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a progressive weakness, primarily affecting your legs, making activities like standing, walking, and getting up from a chair more difficult. You've noticed it's not painful, but causes fatigue and a sense of instability. And it's been happening gradually over time. To help me understand things a little better, could you tell me approximately when you first started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, you see. Maybe… six months ago? Or maybe a little longer. It’s hard to say exactly. I just remember starting to feel a little slower, a little more clumsy. Didn’t think much of it at first. Old age, I figured. But then it kept getting… more. The wife kept saying I was slowing down, and I guess she was right. Six months… maybe eight? It's hard to be sure, Doctor. I don’t keep good track of time like I used to.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Approximately six to eight months is helpful. And it’s good that you’ve noticed the gradual progression. Now, aside from your legs, have you noticed any weakness or difficulty with other parts of your body – your arms, hands, or face, for example?
PATIENT: Hmmm… not really. My hands are okay, I think. I can still do most things. Maybe a little shaky sometimes when I'm trying to button a shirt, but nothing major. Arms feel fine too. Face… no, hasn’t been any trouble with my face. It’s mostly the legs, like I said. Though… …sometimes I feel a little… fuzzy in my head, if I stand up too quickly. But I thought that was just getting old. Is that something to worry about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily legs, with some occasional shakiness in your hands and a feeling of lightheadedness when standing up quickly. The lightheadedness is good to know. It could be related, and we should investigate. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that have been diagnosed, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me years ago I had a little bit of high blood pressure. But he put me on a pill, and it seemed to keep it under control. I take that every day. And… oh, I had some trouble with my back a long time ago, when I was younger. Working hard, you know. But that’s been okay for many years now. Other than that… not much, I don't think. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I've always been a strong man.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. You have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some past back trouble. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a hard one. The wife handles most of the pills, you see. I just take them when she tells me. It’s… a little white pill, I think. And maybe… a little bit round? I’m sorry, Doctor. I really don't know the name. I should probably pay more attention, shouldn't I? The wife will know, though. She keeps a list.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Astore. It’s common for patients to not remember the names of their medications. We can easily find out from your wife or your pharmacy records. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or other substances?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any trouble with allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, take most anything. I’ve always been a pretty robust man, like I said. … well, I don’t care much for spicy food, if that counts. But that’s just a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmmm… let me see. Years ago… many years ago… I had my appendix taken out. When I was still a young man, working on the farm. That was… a long time ago. Other than that… I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. Just a few stitches here and there over the years, from working hard. But no real surgeries. Just the appendix, Doctor. That was many years ago now.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in the past. And finally, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, stroke, or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a hard question. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She passed away when I was still a young man. And my brother… he had some trouble with his memory when he got older. Not sure what it was, but he wasn’t himself towards the end. My wife’s side… her father had diabetes, I think. And… …there was an aunt, on my mother’s side, who had some trouble walking when she got old. But I don’t know much about it. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t see them much. It’s hard to keep track, Doctor. A lot of family history lost over the years.
DOCTOR: I understand. History of heart problems in your mother, memory issues in your brother, diabetes in your wife’s father, and walking difficulties in an aunt on your mother’s side. Okay, that gives me a good start. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, and your pulse is 78, regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Finally, I’d like to check your strength and balance. Okay, I’ve observed some mild weakness in your legs and some difficulty with your balance. These findings, combined with what you’ve told me, suggest several possibilities. It’s too early to say definitively, but we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is getting harder, isn’t it? I stumble a little, and have to steady myself. Well… that doesn’t sound very good, Doctor. What possibilities are we talking about? I’m a bit worried now, I must admit. Is it something serious? I just want to be able to walk with my wife again, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Astore, and it's good that you're addressing this now. It’s important to remember that we haven't reached a definitive diagnosis yet. Several things could be contributing to your symptoms. Some possibilities include general age-related muscle weakness, a vitamin deficiency, or issues with your nerves. There are also more specific conditions we need to rule out, such as peripheral neuropathy or early signs of Parkinson's disease. It’s also important to consider the possibility of a stroke, although your symptoms don’t currently suggest that’s likely, it's important to be thorough. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies and other underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a neurological evaluation to assess your nerve function and balance. This will involve seeing a specialist. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a specialist… alright. Yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, you see. And I want to be able to walk with my wife again, like I said. Parkinson’s disease… that sounds… serious. Is that what you think it might be? I don’t want to be… shaky all the time. Is there anything I can do to… prevent it, if that’s what it is?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Astore. It’s natural to be worried when you hear those terms. I want to reassure you that I’m not saying you definitely have Parkinson’s disease. It’s simply one of the possibilities we need to rule out. Many things can cause similar symptoms, and we haven't gathered enough information to make any conclusions. Regarding prevention, there’s currently no known way to prevent Parkinson’s disease. However, studies suggest that regular exercise and a healthy diet may help slow its progression if a diagnosis is made. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done and seeing the specialist. I’ll write you a referral to a neurologist. The neurologist will perform a more detailed examination and may order additional tests, such as an MRI of your brain. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay as active as you can, even if it’s just short walks around the house. We also want to ensure you’re getting enough vitamin D, as a deficiency can contribute to muscle weakness. I'll order a blood test to check your vitamin D levels. Do you have any questions about the tests, the specialist, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. A neurologist… and blood tests. And try to stay active. Alright. Will the blood tests take long? And how long will it take to see the neurologist? I don’t want to wait too long to know what’s going on. My wife is very worried, you see. Is there anything I can do to help speed things up?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. I know waiting can be stressful. The blood tests should be relatively quick – usually just a few minutes to draw the sample. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. Regarding the neurologist, scheduling can sometimes take a bit of time, as they are often very busy. I'll fax the referral to their office immediately, and my staff will follow up with you to schedule an appointment. We’ll do everything we can to get you seen as quickly as possible. I anticipate it might take 1-2 weeks to get an appointment, but we’ll keep pushing for an earlier slot. To help speed things up, please ensure you have your insurance information readily available when my staff calls to schedule the appointment. And if you can recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure, that would be helpful. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as sudden weakness, difficulty speaking, or vision changes – please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: One to two weeks… alright. I’ll make sure my wife has the insurance information ready. And I'll try to ask her about the medication name, but I really don't remember. I just take the little white pill, like she tells me. No… I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly and for being so patient with me. I feel a little better knowing we’re taking steps to figure things out. I appreciate your help very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. Remember, we’re a team in this, and we’ll work together to get you the answers and care you need. My staff will be in touch shortly to schedule your blood tests and the neurology appointment. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Astore, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You have a good day too. And thank you for your kindness. .
