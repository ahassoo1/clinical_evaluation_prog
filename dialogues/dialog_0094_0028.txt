DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Gegan. I understand you’re here today for a check-up. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this cough. It just won't go away, and my heart… it hasn't been feeling the best lately. It gets tired easily, you know? Been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and some heart fatigue… that’s good information to start with. Let’s break that down a bit. When did the cough start exactly, if you can recall?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it was after that little bit of rain we had. Mid-July, I believe. Yes, around the 15th of July. It started as just a tickle, really. I didn't think much of it at first, just figured it was a little dust. But it got worse after that. A bit more…productive, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A productive cough, starting mid-July… thank you for that detail. And you mentioned your heart feeling tired easily. Could you describe that sensation a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a pain, Doctor. It's more like… when I walk to the mailbox, which isn't far, I get very winded. And I have to sit down afterwards. Used to be I could walk to the grocery store, no problem. Now, I need someone to drive me. And sometimes, when I lie down to sleep, I feel like I’m… struggling for breath. It wakes me up.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down… that’s important information. It sounds like it’s impacting your daily activities, and waking you at night is concerning. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now that you mention it, my feet have been a bit swollen lately. Not terribly, but enough that my shoes feel tighter. I thought it was just the heat, honestly. We've had some very warm weather. And I did notice a little bit of puffiness around my ankles yesterday.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Swelling in the ankles adds another piece to the puzzle. Let’s go through some other things to get a clearer picture. Have you had a fever or chills with this cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, Doctor. Just the cough and the tiredness. And the swollen feet, of course. I haven’t felt hot at all, thankfully. I do get a little cold sometimes, but that’s just my old bones acting up!
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever or chills, just cough, fatigue, and ankle swelling. Now, thinking about your medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any heart conditions, lung problems like asthma or COPD, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Years ago, the doctor told me I have something wrong with my heart. Congestive heart failure, he called it. I’ve been taking pills for it ever since. I don’t remember exactly when he told me, probably…oh, fifteen years ago, maybe more. And I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. But nothing else, not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, congestive heart failure diagnosed approximately fifteen years ago, and a history of pneumonia. Do you remember what medications you're currently taking for your heart condition?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have a little bag here. There's Lisinopril, that’s for the blood pressure, I think. And Furosemide, that's a water pill, the doctor told me it helps with the swelling. Oh, and Metoprolol, that's for my heart rate. And… Digoxin, that’s a very important one, he said. I take those every day, same time. Do you need to know how much of each?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. If you don't mind, could you read off the dosages for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let's see… Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, one in the morning. Furosemide, 40 milligrams, also in the morning. Metoprolol, 25 milligrams, twice a day. And Digoxin, 0.125 milligrams, one in the morning. I usually take them with a glass of water.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's very helpful. And have you had any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of, Doctor. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, thankfully! My mother always said I had a strong stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, thinking about your family, has anyone in your family had heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother, she had a weak heart too. She ended up in the hospital a lot when she got older. And my brother, he had diabetes. He wasn't very careful with his diet, poor man. And my father... he smoked his whole life, so his lungs weren't very good either. It runs in the family, I guess.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That family history is important information. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone now, my husband passed away a few years back. I mostly stay home, read, watch TV. I don’t do much cooking anymore, too tiring. My granddaughter helps me with groceries and things. I used to love to garden, but it's too much work these days. I don't drink or smoke, never have. And I try to take it easy, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nadene. That gives me a very good understanding of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles to assess the swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated at 160/95. I’m hearing some crackles in your lungs, which can indicate fluid buildup. Your heart rate is a little fast and irregular. And there’s definite swelling in both ankles. I also notice some mild pitting edema when I press on your ankles. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m hearing and seeing today, it sounds like your congestive heart failure may be worsening. The shortness of breath, ankle swelling, and crackles in your lungs are all consistent with that. The elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a BNP level, which is a marker for heart failure. We’ll also want to get an EKG to evaluate the irregularity of your heartbeat. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? Yes, of course I’m comfortable with those tests. Whatever you think will help me feel better, Doctor. I just want to be able to breathe easier. When would I be able to get those done?
DOCTOR: We can get those done right away in the lab just down the hall. It shouldn’t take too long. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to adjust your medication slightly. I’m going to increase your Furosemide from 40 milligrams to 80 milligrams daily to help get rid of some of the fluid. And I'm going to add a low dose of Lisinopril if your kidneys are okay based on the bloodwork. I’ll also want to see you back in a week to review the results and see how you're doing. In the meantime, if you experience any severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Increasing the water pill, that makes sense. And I'll be careful, Doctor, I promise. I’ll watch for those things you mentioned. Shortness of breath, chest pain… I'll have my granddaughter take me to the hospital if I need to go. Thank you for taking such good care of me. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nadene. It’s my pleasure. A nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together. Here are some written instructions outlining the medication changes and the warning signs to look out for. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. I feel a little bit better just knowing what's going on. Thank you again, Doctor Gegan. You’re a very kind woman. I think that's all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nadene. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns at all. .
