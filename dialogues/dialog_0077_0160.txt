DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Honestly, I wish I wasn’t here. It’s just… this tiredness. It’s getting ridiculous. And… well, it’s embarrassing to even say, but I’ve been craving dirt. Actual dirt! Don’t look at me like that. It sounds crazy, I know, but I can’t seem to help it. Is that even possible to be tired and want to eat… earth?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it’s certainly…uncommon, but we take all symptoms seriously here, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s good you’ve brought it to my attention. This tiredness… how long has it been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… well, it started gradually, maybe six months ago? At first, I just thought I was getting old, you know? But it’s gotten worse and worse. I used to be able to get everything done, garden, volunteer at the church… now, I can barely make it through the day. And the dirt craving? That's more recent, maybe a month or so. Though I’ve been feeling…off… for longer, hard to explain. It’s just a…feeling. Don't waste your time on that though, it's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Six months of increasing fatigue… and this craving has been present for about a month. And you mentioned a general feeling of being “off”?
PATIENT: Yes, “off.” It’s like…a hollowness, I suppose. Not sadness, exactly, but…empty. And I get these little spells where I feel dizzy when I stand up too fast. Nothing major, but it’s annoying. I don’t understand what’s happening to me. I've always been healthy as a horse, until now. And frankly, I haven't got time for this. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Well, my appetite has been all over the place. Some days I can eat a horse, other days…nothing. And I’ve been more irritable than usual, I suppose. My neighbor, bless her heart, keeps offering me cookies, and I just…snap at her. I feel terrible afterward, but I can’t help it. And…oh! My hands have been cramping up lately, especially when I’m trying to do things in the garden. Is that important? Honestly, I’m not sure what is important anymore. Everything just feels…wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all helpful details, Ms. Hardenburgh. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Really? Is that what we're discussing now? Look, I’m an old woman, not a baby. But…well, yes, actually. They’ve been…irregular. Sometimes constipated, sometimes…the opposite. I thought it was just the change in diet, with me not feeling hungry all the time. But maybe it’s something else. Everything is something else lately! It's just a mess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I’ve never had an allergy in my life. I eat everything. I’ve always been strong as an ox, I told you. No allergies, no chronic illnesses, nothing. Until now, of course. And please, Doctor, don’t tell me it’s something serious. I don’t have time for serious. I have a garden to tend, a church group meeting, and a life to live. Frankly, I’m starting to suspect I’m just getting old and falling apart. Is that it? Just…old age?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Hardenburgh. While it could be related to age, we need to rule out other potential causes. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don't take anything! I pride myself on not needing pills. A little bit of arthritis cream when my knuckles ache, that’s it. I’ve always believed in letting my body heal itself. That's it. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing. I'm a very simple woman, Doctor. I eat my vegetables, I get plenty of fresh air… honestly, I don’t understand what’s happening to me. It's all very unsettling. Can we just get this over with? I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Heavens, no! Not since I was a little girl with the measles, and that was ages ago. I’ve always been lucky enough to stay out of hospitals. A little bit of a cold here and there, a sprained ankle when I was younger… but nothing serious enough for a hospital stay. I’m a very healthy woman, Doctor. Or was a healthy woman. It’s all very confusing. Honestly, I'm starting to feel lightheaded. Is this conversation going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Just a few more questions, Ms. Hardenburgh. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, never. I’ve always been too scared of hospitals and doctors, ironically enough! And frankly, I’ve always been healthy enough to avoid them. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was ages and ages ago. That’s it. Nothing else. Honestly, Doctor, is something wrong? You're looking at me very seriously. And I’m starting to feel quite faint. I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh, let’s take a moment. It's good you mentioned the faintness. Now, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! Now that you mention it, sometimes my chest feels a little tight. Not often, but it happens. And I do get a little breathless when I walk up the stairs. I just thought it was because I was getting old! It's not a sharp pain, just a…pressure. And I've been having these little palpitations, like my heart is skipping a beat. Is that serious? I knew it! I knew something was wrong. Honestly, I feel terrible. And my hands are cramping up again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure, if that’s alright. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Honestly, I’m not one for doctors poking and prodding. But do hurry, please. I have things to do. And try not to be too rough, my bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your pulse is somewhat irregular, which is consistent with your reported palpitations. I also hear some slight crackling in your lungs. Now, I’m going to check your hands and feet for any swelling. And can you please tell me if you’ve noticed any changes in your skin, such as paleness or bruising?
PATIENT: Paleness? Bruising? Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t been paying attention to my skin. I have a garden to tend! But… now that you mention it, I think my hands are a little swollen. And my ankles too, perhaps. And my skin does feel a little rough, I suppose. But I always chalked that up to the sun and the dirt! It’s probably just old age, honestly. Can we please be done soon? I’m starting to feel very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I have a few concerns. Your fatigue, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, lung crackling, hand and foot swelling, and craving for dirt…it’s quite a constellation of symptoms. The craving for dirt, specifically, can sometimes be a sign of a nutritional deficiency, particularly iron. However, given the other symptoms, we need to investigate further. I'm concerned about the possibility of anemia, heart failure, or another underlying condition. I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, iron levels, and kidney function tests. We may also need to do a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs and heart. Do you agree?
PATIENT: Tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, this is all very stressful. But… fine. Do whatever you think is necessary. I just want to feel better. I have a life to live, you know? And I can’t do that if I’m constantly tired and lightheaded and craving dirt! But please, hurry. And tell me, realistically, how long is this going to take? I have a church group meeting tomorrow. I’m not sure I can miss that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hardenburgh. We will get this done as quickly as possible. The blood tests should take only a few minutes, and the chest X-ray shouldn't take long either. The results usually come back within a couple of days. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you an iron supplement. It may help address the craving for dirt and improve your energy levels. However, it's crucial to remember that this is just a temporary measure until we get the results of the tests. I will also write a note for your church group meeting, explaining your condition and excusing your absence if necessary. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I told you, no allergies! Honestly, Doctor, are you even listening to me? No medications, no allergies, nothing! Just a little bit of arthritis cream when my knuckles ache. But I don’t take anything regularly. Fine, give me the iron. Anything to get this dirt craving to stop. It's incredibly embarrassing. And thank you for the note for the church group. They'll be worried sick if I don't show up. Honestly, I’m just hoping this isn’t something serious. I’m too old for serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. Here's the prescription for the iron supplement. Take it as directed, and let's schedule a follow-up appointment in a few days to discuss the test results. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness. I understand your concerns, and we will do everything we can to get you feeling better. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Honestly, I just want to go home and lie down. And maybe… maybe avoid dirt for a while. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, even if it was a lot of poking and prodding. And thank you for the note. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll just be going.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hardenburgh. It was my pleasure. Please, take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. The nurse will escort you to the checkout desk, and we’ll schedule that follow-up appointment for you. And remember, we are here to help. Get some rest, and I hope you start feeling better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you… .
