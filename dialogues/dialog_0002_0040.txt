DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Espinueva, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it's this pain in my side, mostly. It comes and goes, but it’s been happening quite a bit lately. And… well, I seem to be getting urinary tract infections rather frequently now too. It's a bit bothersome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain in your side and frequent UTIs. Let's definitely look into both of those things. To start with the side pain, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Right, the pain… it’s… hard to describe exactly. It’s not sharp, not usually. More of a dull ache, lower down on my side, you see? Sometimes it feels like a pressure, like something’s full. And it can radiate around to my back a little. It comes and goes as it pleases, really. Some days I barely notice it, others… well, others it makes it difficult to get comfortable. I suppose it’s on both sides, but more often the left.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache and pressure, more often on the left side, radiating to your back. Does anything specific seem to make it worse or better?
PATIENT: Hm… that’s a good question. I don't think anything specifically makes it worse, not that I’ve noticed. Drinking lots of water seems to help a little, but that’s probably just a good idea anyway, isn’t it? And lying down flat… sometimes that eases it. But truly, it’s rather unpredictable. It doesn’t seem to be connected to what I’ve eaten, or how much I’m moving about. It just… happens. It's been like this for a while now, I suppose. Years, really. Though it's been more frequent lately, as I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been going on for years, but getting more frequent recently, and isn’t really connected to anything specific. Drinking water and lying down help a little. And you said you've also been having frequent UTIs?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. The water infections, as my doctor used to call them. I’ve had… well, I’ve lost count, to be honest. Seems like every few months now. I get the usual symptoms – burning when I go to the toilet, needing to go all the time, and feeling rather weak. I always get it checked, and they give me tablets, which clear it up. But it keeps coming back. It's worrying, you see. My old doctor mentioned something about my kidneys, years ago. Something about little… pockets in them? I can’t quite remember the details, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent UTIs that keep recurring despite treatment, and you remember your previous doctor mentioning something about pockets in your kidneys. That's good information, thank you. Do you currently have any symptoms of a UTI right now?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not at this very moment. I finished the course of tablets about a week ago, I think it was. I'm feeling alright now, just a bit… anxious about it coming back, as usual. That’s mostly why I came in, you see. To try and get to the bottom of it all, and see if there's something more we can do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no current UTI symptoms, but concerned about recurrence. It's good you’re being proactive about it. Let’s talk a little bit more about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. I’ve had the usual things, I suppose – high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-managed with tablets for years now. And arthritis in my knees, gets a bit painful when the weather changes. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, back in the eighties, I believe. As for anything else… not that I can recall, specifically. My old doctor, Dr. Sharma, he was the one who mentioned something about my kidneys… Polycystic Kidney Disease, I think it was called. But he never really went into much detail. I just remember him saying I had little cysts on them. It wasn’t causing any problems at the time, so I didn’t press him for more information.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure and arthritis, gallbladder removal in the eighties, and a possible diagnosis of Polycystic Kidney Disease mentioned by your previous doctor, Dr. Sharma. That’s very helpful. And you’re currently taking medication for your blood pressure, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. I take one tablet every morning for the blood pressure. It’s… Amlodipine, I believe it’s called. Been taking it for years now, keeps it stable. I have the prescription refilled regularly. I have no issues with it, just the usual routine, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine for blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hm… Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve never had any reactions to any tablets, or any foods, as far as I can recall. I’ve always been able to eat whatever I like without any issues. My wife, bless her soul, always made sure to ask when I started a new medication, just to be safe. But no, no allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I've lived in this town all my life, mostly. Retired now, used to work at the local post office. I was married to my wife, Lani, for over forty years, but she passed away five years ago now. We didn't have any children. I live alone, but I have a few cousins nearby who check in on me regularly. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little bit of wine with my dinner sometimes, purely for enjoyment, you see. I like to garden when the weather is nice, and I enjoy reading. A quiet life, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet life, retired, no smoking or excessive drinking. I’m sorry to hear about your wife. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound good. Blood pressure is 138/82. Now I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. I'm noticing a little tenderness when I press here on your left side, but nothing too concerning. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… a bit tender, yes. Not sharp, but a dull ache, like the pain I’ve been describing. It’s not constant, but it’s definitely more noticeable when you press there. It doesn't feel new, you understand. It's just the usual discomfort, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's consistent with what you’ve been describing. Now, I want to order some lab tests, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. We'll also do a kidney function test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly Doctor, that sounds sensible. Whatever tests you deem necessary. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do to prepare for them, you see. And when can I expect the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. No special preparation is needed for these tests. You can eat and drink as usual. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. If you develop a fever, or if your side pain suddenly gets much worse, or if you notice any blood in your urine, please contact me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all quite clear, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. Just… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime, to help with the pain? Any particular foods I should avoid? I’m just trying to be proactive, you see. And… thank you again for taking the time to listen to me. It’s a relief to finally be getting to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I understand your concern. While we wait for the lab results, I recommend staying well-hydrated - aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. There aren’t any specific foods you need to avoid, but a balanced diet is always a good idea. As for the pain, you can continue to manage it with over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen , if you’re able to tolerate them. However, don't exceed the recommended dosage. And as I mentioned before, if the pain gets significantly worse, please contact me immediately. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together. Do you have any other concerns before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s all perfectly clear. You’ve been very helpful. I feel much more reassured now, knowing we’re taking steps to find out what’s going on. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I’ll wait for your call. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could help. You have a good day as well, and please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
