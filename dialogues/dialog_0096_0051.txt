DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Nini, welcome. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's... well, my son, he said I should come. Something about needing to know what kind of blood I have? He was very insistent. Honestly, I don't quite recall why it's important, but he worries so.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your son is…concerned about the type of blood you have, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it! The type. He said it’s good to… know. For, uh… things. I do apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s not a bad thing, just… faded, you see? I used to be very good at remembering things when I was a rigger, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, knowing your blood type is generally a good idea, though not usually urgent. It’s helpful in case of a transfusion, and can be relevant for certain medical conditions. Let's start with a little background. Have you ever had a blood test done before, for anything in particular?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a blood test… I honestly can’t say. I've had… well, I've lived a long life, you see. Lots of scrapes and bumps when I was working, but I don't think a proper blood test. Maybe at the hospital once, a long time ago? But I couldn’t tell you what they were looking for. Everything’s a bit… blurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly alright. We can certainly do one now. It's a very quick procedure. Before we go ahead with that, let's just run through a few general questions, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… the doctor back home – in Spain – he said my pressure was a little high once, years and years ago. He gave me some little pills. I think. Or maybe it was the dentist… It all blends together, you see? I've been quite healthy, actually, for my age. Worked hard all my life, kept moving. No serious illnesses that I recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any surgeries or hospital stays?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… There was a time, a very long time ago, when I broke my wrist. I was rigging, and… well, things happen. They set it at the hospital, of course. A small operation, I think. And… oh! When I had my son, that was at the hospital, naturally. But other than that… nothing comes to mind. It was… a long time ago. I’ve been very fortunate, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, herbal supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I take a little something for my joints, sometimes. They get stiff, you see? It's… a cream, mostly. I rub it on. And occasionally, a pain reliever, when they’re really bothering me. Just the usual sort of thing, I think. Nothing special. My son gets me the vitamins, sometimes, but I forget to take them half the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… I don't think so. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, traveled everywhere. Nothing ever bothered me. Not that I recall, anyway. My skin gets a little itchy sometimes, but that's just the sun, I think. I live in a sunny place, you see.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, before we get to the blood test, let me just do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust your judgment. My son always says I should listen to the doctors. He worries so. Please, go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright then. If you could just sit up straight for me… First, I’ll listen to your heart. Take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds are… regular, but a little faint. Not unexpected for your age. Now, lungs… take a deep breath in… and out… Lungs are clear. Now let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/90.
PATIENT: Oh, is that… good? I never really pay attention to those numbers. My son is always telling me to watch it, though. He says it's important. Is it bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's… slightly elevated. Not immediately alarming, but it’s something we should be aware of. That’s why your son is right to be concerned. It's not something to panic over, but it does mean we should monitor it. Pulses are… weak, but present. Now, let me just take a look at your hands and skin… Some age spots, typical for your age, and your skin is a little dry.
PATIENT: Oh, the skin is just from the sun, I think. I used to spend a lot of time outdoors when I was working, you see. Rigging, it's hard on your hands. They've seen a lot, these hands. Now, about this blood test… what exactly will it tell us? I'm just curious, you understand.
DOCTOR: It will determine your blood type – A, B, AB, or O, and whether you are Rh-positive or Rh-negative. Knowing this is important for potential transfusions, should you ever need one. It can also be helpful if we need to investigate other medical issues in the future. It’s standard information to have. The phlebotomist will be right in to draw the sample. It’s a quick and relatively painless procedure. It will take a few minutes. Then we’ll send it to the lab, and we should have the results in a couple of days. Now, is there anything else you want to tell me before the phlebotomist arrives?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don’t think so. Just… thank you for taking the time. My son will be very pleased to know we're getting this done. He worries so much, you see. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a little garden I need to tend to. The tomatoes are almost ripe.
DOCTOR: Alright then. We’ll get this taken care of as quickly as possible.
