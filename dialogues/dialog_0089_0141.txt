DOCTOR: Good morning, Brendan. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's this itching, really. It's all over, pretty much. Not awful, just…constant. Been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say. Maybe a month? It’s hard to keep track, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a constant itch for about a month. All over, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty much everywhere. Arms, legs, back…even my stomach. It doesn't look like anything’s wrong, no rash or bumps or anything. That’s what’s confusing me. It just…feels itchy. And it’s driving me a little crazy, if I’m being honest. I haven't changed anything – soaps, detergents, nothing.
DOCTOR: Right, no visible changes to the skin, and you haven't altered any of your usual products. Hmm. And is the itch worse at any particular time of day, or after doing anything specific?
PATIENT: Not really, no. It's pretty consistent, honestly. Maybe a little worse at night when I’m trying to sleep, just because I notice it more when I’m not distracted. But it’s not like it starts at night. It's just...there. All the time. I haven't noticed it getting worse after eating anything or being outside, either. I’m trying to think of anything that might make it different, but…nothing comes to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent, not tied to any specific activity or time, and no rash. Have you had any other symptoms along with the itching – fever, fatigue, weight loss, changes in your bowel habits, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. I feel…normal, otherwise. No fever, no tiredness, haven’t lost any weight that I’ve noticed. Everything’s…regular, if you know what I mean. I was a little worried at first, thinking it was something serious, but I feel fine otherwise. Just this itch. It's just…annoying. Really annoying. My wife…well, she always knew what to do for things like this, but… It's different now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that you don't have any other symptoms. And I'm sorry to hear about your wife; that must be difficult. Let's try to figure this out. Now, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, um, let me think. Nothing major, really. High blood pressure, but it’s been controlled with medication for years now. And I had my gallbladder out maybe fifteen years ago. Other than that…not much. I get the usual colds now and then, but nothing serious. I'm on Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for checkups. They haven’t noticed anything unusual, but they don’t usually ask about itching. And, um, I’m allergic to penicillin. That's important to know. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. High blood pressure, controlled with medication, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, and a penicillin allergy – noted. Do you know what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… I have it written down here somewhere… Ah, here it is. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And I take it every morning with my breakfast. I haven't missed a dose in years, I don't think. It's all here, if you need it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 20mg daily. Now, regarding your family history, are there any skin conditions that run in your family – eczema, psoriasis, allergies?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My mother had… well, she had sensitive skin, always complaining about dryness and rashes, but it wasn't anything specific, I don’t think. Not like eczema or psoriasis. My father… he didn't really have any skin problems. And I don't think either of my siblings did, either. No, I don’t recall any major skin conditions in the family, honestly. We weren't really the type to talk much about health stuff, if I’m being honest. It's probably not very helpful, sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s okay, it’s helpful to know either way. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure. I’m retired now. Used to work as a dispatcher, mostly. Not police or anything like that, more…transportation stuff. I live alone, as I mentioned. My wife passed away about two years ago. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I don’t have any pets, and I don't travel much anymore. Mostly I just…keep to myself, read books, watch TV. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t had much energy for it lately. It’s…quiet. That’s probably it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to take a closer look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. I'm ready when you are. I'm just hoping we can figure out what's causing this itch. It's really starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brendan. I'm just going to examine your skin now. As you mentioned, there’s no visible rash or bumps. Skin temperature is normal. No visible lesions. Palpation doesn't reveal any obvious abnormalities. Skin texture is…slightly dry overall, but nothing remarkable. I'm listening to your lungs now. Breathing sounds are clear. Heart sounds are regular. Given your history and the exam findings, it’s possible this could be a case of dry skin exacerbated by something we haven't identified yet, or possibly a mild allergic reaction to something you're exposed to. We also need to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test just to get a baseline and see if anything stands out. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. Tests are fine. I just want to stop itching, if you know what I mean. I'm happy to do whatever it takes to figure it out. So, blood tests, you said? Is there anything I need to do to prepare? And where will I go to get them done?
DOCTOR: Yes, blood tests. Nothing special to prepare for – just don't eat a large meal beforehand. We can draw them here at the clinic. The lab technician is available this afternoon. It will take about 15-20 minutes. Once we get the results back – typically within a few days – we can discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a good emollient lotion to help with the dry skin. I’ll write you a prescription for CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion. It’s fragrance-free and non-irritating. Apply it liberally twice a day, especially after showering. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Lotion and blood tests. Okay. CeraVe, you said? I’ll make sure to get some. Twice a day. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. It’s…reassuring to know we’re doing something. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. And thank you for being patient with me. I tend to ramble, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. And please, don’t worry about rambling. It’s important for me to get a complete picture of what’s going on, and I appreciate you sharing everything with me. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood now. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Here's the prescription for the CeraVe. If you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen before then, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. That’s very kind of you, Doctor. I’ll go get the blood work done now, and pick up the lotion. Thank you again for your time and patience. I really appreciate it. I feel a little better just knowing we’re looking into it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. Take care, and please do call if you have any concerns.
