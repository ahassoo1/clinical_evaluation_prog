DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara, have a seat. I’m Dr. Sink. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, it’s about… them wanting to do things. You know, poking and prodding. Honestly, at my age, I just want to be left alone. I’ve lived a long life, and I don’t see the point of all the fuss. It’s just… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Right. "Them wanting to do things." Can you be a little more specific, please?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, goodness. Well, the nice young man at the… the place, said something about tests. And maybe… surgery? I can’t rightly recall. It was a lot of medical jargon, truthfully. All I heard was “procedure” and “risk” and… frankly, it sounded dreadful. I just want my feet to feel better, not be messed with.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your feet, you said. What exactly is bothering you about your feet?
PATIENT: Well, they ache, of course. They ache something awful, especially when I try to walk any distance. And they’re… well, they’re not as pretty as they used to be. Bunions, I think my daughter called them. And these… hard spots. They rub against my shoes, you see. It's just… old age, dear. What can you do about old age?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s see… I have some notes here from a previous visit. Bunions, plantar fasciitis… and some decreased sensation in your feet. And you mentioned pain with walking. How long have you been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, a long time. Years, I suppose. It comes and goes, you know? Some days it’s barely noticeable, other days… well, other days I need to sit right down. It's just… gotten worse lately. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to the details anymore. It’s just… pain. And I don’t see the point in making a big deal about it.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, with all due respect, ignoring pain isn’t a strategy. It indicates something is wrong. And at your age, it’s especially important to address these things. Now, can you tell me if the pain radiates anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate? Oh, goodness no, I don't do radiation! That's terribly unhealthy, you know. Is that what you meant? Because I avoid all that sort of thing. No, the pain...it stays in my feet. Mostly the bottom, I think. And sometimes in my toes. It doesn't go up my legs or anything. Honestly, I just want a simple fix. A cream, maybe? Something easy. I don't want any of those complicated… procedures.
DOCTOR: Right. Not radiation. I meant does the pain travel along your foot. Never mind. And a cream... while creams can sometimes offer temporary relief, given the length of time you've been experiencing this, and the notes from the previous visit, I suspect it's more than just a simple issue. Have you tried any other treatments?
PATIENT: Treatments? Oh, dear, I don’t go in for all that. My daughter, bless her heart, she gets me all sorts of things. Little cushions for my shoes. Some of those stretchy bandages. But honestly, they don’t do much good. I tried those fancy arch supports once, but they just made my feet hurt more. I’m not one for fuss, you see. I just want to be comfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Gunasekara, I’m going to do a quick examination of your feet. Just so I can get a better idea of what we’re dealing with. Please remove your shoes and socks. And please, try to be as specific as possible when I ask about the pain. It’s difficult to help you if you aren’t able to describe what you’re feeling.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose I can do that. It's just... I don't like being touched, you know? My circulation isn't what it used to be. They swell up something awful, and it’s… unpleasant. But alright. Here we go. Just be gentle, dear. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay. Yes, I see some significant calluses here… and the bunions are quite prominent. Your pulses are weak, as you mentioned, and there’s some loss of sensation in your toes. Does this hurt?
PATIENT: Hmmph. No, not particularly. It feels… a bit numb, actually. Like when your foot falls asleep. It doesn't really hurt, it just… isn’t there. See? I told you. It's just… gone. Honestly, I don't understand why you're poking at me. It’s not going to fix anything, is it? It's just old age, dear. You can't fix old age.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, the numbness is concerning. That, combined with the weak pulses, suggests possible peripheral artery disease. We need to investigate that further. I’m going to order a vascular ultrasound to assess the blood flow in your legs and feet. And I’m also going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. It's standard procedure, really.
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Blood work? Oh, goodness no. Absolutely not. I am not having all sorts of tests done. I've lived a long life without poking and prodding, and I intend to keep it that way. Honestly, you doctors just want to make things complicated. I just want a simple cream, or maybe some new shoes. That's all. I'm perfectly capable of managing my own feet, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, I understand you’re reluctant to have these tests, but ignoring these symptoms could have serious consequences. Peripheral artery disease can lead to amputation if left untreated. I am recommending these tests for your safety. I strongly advise you reconsider. If you refuse, I can only offer palliative care—pain management. But I cannot, in good conscience, simply ignore potential serious health risks.
PATIENT: Amputation?! Oh, my goodness! You're trying to scare me, aren’t you? Honestly, I don’t trust you doctors at all! You just want to cut things off! No, absolutely not. I’m leaving. I'm perfectly fine, thank you very much. I don't need your poking and prodding, and I certainly don't want you cutting off my feet! I’m going home.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, please sit down. We can discuss this calmly. However, if you continue to refuse necessary medical evaluation, I cannot provide further treatment. I strongly urge you to reconsider. I will have the nurse provide you with information on vascular specialists. Perhaps a second opinion would be beneficial. But I must reiterate, ignoring this could have severe consequences. .
