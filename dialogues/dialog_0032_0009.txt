DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. AlCorta. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you're 52 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 52, though I feel younger most days. It’s… well, it’s my eyesight. It’s just not what it used to be. Seems to be getting worse, and frankly, I’d hoped it was something easily remedied. I’ve always had excellent vision, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent vision is good to know, though unfortunately, things do change with age. And while we can often address vision changes, it's important to determine the cause. So, when did you first notice this decline in your eyesight?
PATIENT: Oh, I suppose… six months, maybe? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. It wasn’t sudden, you understand. More… gradual. Things just seem a bit blurry, especially when I'm reading. And at night, driving has become… less enjoyable. Though, truthfully, I haven't been driving as much lately. It’s a nuisance, really. I like to keep up with current events, and straining to read the paper isn’t particularly dignified.
DOCTOR: Blurriness, particularly with reading and night driving… alright. And you mentioned it's been about six months. Has this been constant, or does it fluctuate throughout the day?
PATIENT: Fluctuate? Hmm. I hadn’t really thought of it that way. Now that you mention it… it’s probably worse in the evenings. After a long day, I suppose. When I’m tired. It’s not as if I wake up with perfect vision every morning, but it is noticeably poorer when I’m winding down. I do spend a fair bit of time on the computer, if that makes any difference. For…research purposes, naturally. Not just idle browsing.
DOCTOR: “Research purposes,” of course. Computer use can contribute to eye strain. But we need to rule out other causes. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the blurry vision?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No pain, thankfully. No floaters, or spots, or anything dramatic like that. Though, I have been getting more frequent headaches, yes. Mild ones, mostly behind the eyes. I assumed it was stress, honestly. The divorce was… trying, to say the least. And finding suitable employment these days is a constant headache in itself. I doubt it's related, but one tends to catalogue these things, doesn't one?
DOCTOR: Headaches along with the blurry vision are worth noting. While I understand you attribute them to stress—and stress is certainly a factor for many ailments—we cannot dismiss a potential connection. Now, have you had any changes in your overall health recently?
PATIENT: Changes… well, my appetite hasn't been what it used to be. I’m not a large man, as you can see, and I’ve lost a bit of weight, perhaps five or ten pounds. Nothing drastic. And I've been…less active, if that makes sense. It's difficult to motivate oneself, you understand? Particularly without… a proper support system. I used to enjoy hiking, but the trails seem rather…lonely these days. Beyond that, no. No fever, no sudden illnesses, nothing of that nature. I maintain a… reasonable level of hygiene, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Weight loss and decreased activity… alright. It’s important to get a full picture. Now, regarding your medical history – have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Heavens, no. I watch my diet, you know. Though, admittedly, I do enjoy a sweet treat now and then. High blood pressure… I had it checked years ago, but it was perfectly normal. My father had some heart trouble, but he wasn’t exactly…disciplined, shall we say? As for other conditions…no. Nothing significant. I’ve never been one for ailments, if you get my meaning. A bit of the common cold from time to time, naturally, but nothing serious enough to warrant a doctor’s visit, until now, of course. I pride myself on maintaining a robust constitution.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. I’ve always been rather… cautious about such things. Too much risk, in my opinion. Hospitalized… well, a brief stay for a bout of influenza as a child, decades ago. Nothing more. It was a very mild case, hardly worth mentioning. I’ve always preferred to manage my health independently. Preventative measures, you understand? Fresh air, a balanced diet, a rigorous mental regimen. That sort of thing. I find modern medicine…overrated, frankly. Though, I suppose I’m here now, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts—that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had rather poor eyesight in her later years. She wore thick glasses, and I believe she had cataracts eventually. Though, she wasn't one for discussing such things in detail. A rather stoic woman, my mother. As for the rest of my family… my grandfather on my father’s side had some sort of eye problem, I vaguely recall. But details are… hazy. It was a rather large family, and I wasn't particularly close to most of them. We weren't ones for keeping detailed medical records, you understand? More focused on…practical matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, thankfully. I’ve always been rather… resilient, as I’ve mentioned. No sensitivities to any medications that I’m aware of. As for drugs or supplements… well, I take a multivitamin occasionally. A bit of Vitamin D in the winter months, naturally. But nothing regular. I prefer to obtain my nutrients through a balanced diet. And I certainly wouldn’t burden myself with unnecessary pharmaceuticals, if I can avoid it. Modern concoctions are… suspect, in my opinion. Too many side effects, not enough benefit.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. AlCorta. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. I'll assess your vision, check your pupils, and measure your eye pressure. This will help me determine the potential cause of your blurry vision. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An examination… yes, I suppose. Though, I must confess, I'm not particularly fond of poking and prodding. I trust your expertise, Doctor, but I’m rather sensitive, as you may have gathered. And please, be gentle. I have no desire to exacerbate the situation. Proceed, but with due caution.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please look straight ahead. I’m going to shine this light into your eyes, and I’d like you to focus on a point in the distance. This won't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if you experience any discomfort. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light… slightly sluggish, however. Fundus appears relatively normal, though there is some mild pallor of the optic disc. Similar findings in the left eye. Mild pallor of the optic disc bilaterally. Now, I’m going to measure your eye pressure. This will involve a brief puff of air into each eye. It may feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please keep your eyes open and look straight ahead. Right eye pressure is 16 mmHg. Left eye pressure is 17 mmHg. Alright, Mr. AlCorta. The examination revealed some mild sluggishness in your pupils and mild pallor of the optic disc bilaterally. Your eye pressure is within normal limits. These findings, combined with your symptoms, suggest… a possible optic neuropathy. However, further investigation is required to confirm this diagnosis.
PATIENT: Optic neuropathy? That sounds…ominous. What exactly is that, Doctor? And what sort of “further investigation” are we talking about? I’ve already expressed my aversion to invasive procedures, you understand. Is it something serious? Perhaps it's just stress. As I mentioned, my life has been…rather disrupted lately. Could that not be the cause?
DOCTOR: While stress can certainly exacerbate various conditions, Mr. AlCorta, it is unlikely to be the sole cause of these findings. Optic neuropathy refers to damage to the optic nerve, which transmits visual information from the eyes to the brain. The pallor of the optic disc, which I observed during the examination, is indicative of nerve fiber loss. Now, there are various causes of optic neuropathy, ranging from inflammation and infection to vascular disease and compression. Determining the underlying cause is crucial for proper treatment. As for further investigation, I would like to order a visual field test to assess your peripheral vision. This is a non-invasive procedure that involves looking into a specialized machine and indicating when you see lights in your peripheral vision. I would also recommend an optical coherence tomography, or OCT, scan, which provides detailed images of the retinal nerve fiber layer. This is also non-invasive. Finally, I would like to order a blood test to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions or vitamin deficiencies. These tests will help us determine the cause of your optic neuropathy and guide our treatment plan. Without further investigation, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis or prognosis.
PATIENT: Peripheral vision test… retinal scan… blood test… It’s all rather… involved, isn’t it? And rather inconvenient, frankly. I’m not sure I’m comfortable subjecting myself to such scrutiny. Couldn't we simply monitor my condition for a while? Perhaps the symptoms will subside on their own. I’m certain a change of pace, a more… tranquil environment, would do wonders.
DOCTOR: Mr. AlCorta, while I understand your reluctance, I must emphasize the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment. Optic neuropathy can lead to permanent vision loss if left unaddressed. Simply “monitoring” your condition without determining the underlying cause is not an appropriate course of action. These tests are relatively quick and painless. The visual field test takes approximately 30 minutes, the OCT scan takes about 15, and the blood test requires a small sample. Delaying these tests could significantly impact your vision. Furthermore, I must adhere to the highest standards of medical care, which includes thorough investigation of any potential neurological concerns. I understand you prefer a more “tranquil environment”, however, medical conditions do not simply resolve on their own without proper intervention. I strongly recommend scheduling these tests as soon as possible. If you are unwilling to undergo these investigations, I can refer you to a neurologist for a second opinion. However, please be aware that they will likely recommend the same course of action.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. You’ve made your position quite clear. I suppose I have little choice. But I insist on a detailed explanation of each procedure beforehand, and I expect them to be completed as efficiently as possible. I have… commitments, you understand. And I expect a full report of the findings, in layman’s terms, of course. No medical jargon. I am, after all, a reasonably intelligent man. Schedule the tests, then. But do not expect me to be pleased about it. And I trust your staff is…competent? I have no desire to be subjected to unnecessary delays or…inefficiency.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will have my staff schedule you for a visual field test and an OCT scan. The blood test can be completed at the lab across the street, and they do not require an appointment. I assure you, my staff is highly competent. They will explain each procedure in detail before proceeding, and I will personally review the results and discuss them with you at your next appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activities and ensuring adequate rest. If you experience any sudden changes in your vision, such as double vision or complete vision loss, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No. I believe that covers it. Though, I must reiterate my displeasure with this entire situation. I trust these tests will yield a satisfactory result, and that I will not be required to undergo any further… invasive procedures. Schedule the appointments, and inform me of the dates and times. I have… better things to occupy my time. Good day, Doctor. And I sincerely hope we will not be meeting again under such…unfortunate circumstances.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. AlCorta. My staff will contact you shortly to schedule the appointments. I trust they will provide all the necessary information. .
PATIENT: .
