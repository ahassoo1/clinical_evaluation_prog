DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking… lately, things have been a little… scattered, you know? A friend suggested I look into mindfulness or meditation. I was hoping you might have some information, or could point me in the right direction. I’ve never really tried anything like that before.
DOCTOR: Right, scattered… I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with focus or concentration, perhaps feeling a bit overwhelmed. That's perfectly alright, many people go through phases like that. It’s good you’re being proactive about it. Before we delve into mindfulness techniques, I'd like to get a better understanding of what you mean by “scattered”. Could you describe what that feels like for you?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see… It’s not exactly anxiety, not like a racing heart or anything. It’s more like… I start a task, like unloading groceries, and then I remember I need to call my sister, then I think about the garden, then… oh, and did I lock the back door? It’s just a lot of little things popping into my head all at once. I finish the groceries eventually, but it feels… less efficient, and I'm a bit frazzled afterwards. And sometimes I forget small things – where I put my keys, for example. Though I do remember exactly when I last changed the oil in my car… July 14th, 2024, at 10:15 am. It's just… random.
DOCTOR: That’s a very helpful description, Ms. Sugino. It does sound like difficulty with sustained attention and a bit of mental clutter. The fact that you recall specific details like the oil change is interesting, and we'll keep that in mind. Now, has this been happening for a long time, or is this a recent development?
PATIENT: It’s… gradual, I think. It’s definitely gotten worse in the last six months or so. Before that, it was just the occasional forgetfulness – misplacing things, that sort of thing. But lately, it’s been more frequent, and it's starting to bother me. It's not crippling, but it makes things… harder. And honestly, a little stressful, worrying about forgetting important things. I work on the railway, repairing signals and switches, and you really need to be focused for that. So it's good I haven't made any mistakes... yet.
DOCTOR: I understand. A gradual onset over six months is helpful information. And your profession is very important to consider – needing to maintain focus while repairing signals and switches is critical. It’s good you haven't experienced any errors so far, but it's wise to address this proactively. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if that’s alright. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Please, ask away. Hmm… sleep. Now that you mention it, I think I’m waking up a bit more during the night. Not every night, but maybe two or three times a week. It’s usually just for a few minutes, I don't have trouble falling back asleep, but it’s… restless sleep, I suppose. Not like tossing and turning, just… not as solid as it used to be. And I do get up to use the bathroom once, sometimes twice, during the night. I’ve always been a good sleeper though, so this is a little unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, restless sleep and waking up once or twice a night… that’s good information. It could be related to what you’re experiencing. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or have you lost or gained any weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. My appetite is the same as usual, I think. I eat pretty regularly, mostly healthy food, though I do enjoy a good piece of baklava now and then. And my weight… I haven’t weighed myself recently, but my clothes feel the same, so I haven’t lost or gained anything noticeable. I’m about 136 pounds, usually. I try to stay around that. I was 140 a few years ago, but I lost a bit of weight during a particularly busy time at work.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s helpful. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Sugino?
PATIENT: Just Medicare, really. I don't take any regular medications. I had some ibuprofen for a sore back a couple of months ago, but that was just for a few days. Otherwise, nothing. I'm generally very healthy. I walk a lot at work, and I try to eat well, like I said. No allergies either. Though I do sometimes get a bit of a sniffle during pollen season, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sugino. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. It sounds like you're generally quite healthy, which is wonderful. Based on what you’ve told me—the gradual onset of difficulty with focus, some restless sleep, and no medication use—several possibilities come to mind. It could be stress-related, particularly given the demands of your job. It could also be a normal part of aging, though it’s good we’re exploring it. Less commonly, it could be related to a mild vitamin deficiency or something else entirely. To get a better understanding, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. Just a basic neurological check and listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A physical exam is a good idea. Please, go ahead. I'm not worried, but it's always best to be sure, isn't it? I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It’s always best to be thorough. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is a little elevated, but not concerning given your profession and recent conversation. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to do a few simple neurological tests. I'll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I'll check your reflexes. Okay, everything appears normal so far. Your reflexes are good, your eye movements are normal, and your balance is steady. I don’t see anything immediately concerning. Based on this brief exam, I don’t think there's anything drastically wrong. However, to rule out any underlying causes, I'd like to order some basic blood work. It will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work is a good idea. I'd rather be safe than sorry, as you say. It's good to rule things out. Please, go ahead and order whatever you think is necessary. I'm happy to do it. And thank you for being so thorough. I feel much better already, just talking it through with you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. I'll write the order for the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get you in right away. While we wait for the results, I'd like to suggest a few things you could try at home. Things like getting regular exercise – you’re already doing that with your job, which is excellent – maintaining a healthy diet, and ensuring you get enough sleep. We can also explore mindfulness techniques or stress-reduction exercises if you're interested. I'll also give you a handout with information on improving sleep hygiene. Now, while we wait for the results, if you do experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as headaches, dizziness, or significant memory loss – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. The handout is wonderful, thank you. And no, I don’t have any questions at the moment. I’ll follow your advice and see how things go. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and for being so… calm and reassuring. It really does make a difference. And if I do think of something, I know I can call the office, which is good. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. That’s what I’m here for. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, it’s always best to address these things early. I’ll call you with the blood work results as soon as they come in, usually within a few days. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. Goodbye!
