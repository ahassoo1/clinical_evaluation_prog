DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. My name is Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 71 years of age. Thank you for coming in today. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 71, that's right. Well, it's these bumps on my legs. On my shins, mostly. They're red and…painful, you know? Especially when I’m walking around. It’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: “A little while now…” Could you be more specific, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… hmm. Let me think. Maybe… three, four months now? It started with just one, I think, and then more popped up. It's hard to remember exactly, Doctor. I’ve been doing a lot of work lately, moving things around, so things kinda blur together. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Three to four months. And this work you’re doing… is it new physical activity, or have you been doing this type of work for some time?
PATIENT: Oh, no, it's not new. I've been doing this kind of work for… well, a long time, Doctor. Since I was a young man, really. Moving stock and things, loading and unloading. It’s just… maybe I’ve been doing a little more of it lately. The company's been busier, you see? Lots of deliveries. Nothing too crazy, though. Just a bit more walking and lifting.
DOCTOR: I see. And you’ve noticed the bumps are directly related to this increased activity?
PATIENT: Well, I think so. They seem to get worse when I've been on my feet all day. When I sit down and rest, they feel a little better, you know? Not completely gone, but not as achy. It’s hard to say for sure, though. I'm not a doctor, I just know what I feel. Is it something serious, Doctor? I hope it's not something that will stop me from working. My wife… she worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Aluia, it's difficult to say without a proper examination. However, based on your description, it could be a number of things. Let's start with a physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best. Just tell me what to do. I’m ready when you are. Is it going to hurt? I don't have a high pain tolerance, you see. My wife always says I’m a big baby.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be painful, Mr. Aluia. Just let me know if anything is uncomfortable. If you could please sit on the examination table and raise your legs, that would be helpful. I’ll need to take a look at these bumps directly.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Here you go. Be careful now, my knees aren't what they used to be. They crack a lot, you know? My wife says it’s the weather. Do you need me to move them a certain way?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. There are several erythematous papules and nodules on both shins. Some appear to be slightly ulcerated. No signs of active infection at this time, but there is some hyperpigmentation surrounding some of the lesions. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You're speaking a little fast, Doctor. Ery-what-now? And hyper… what was that? Just the bumps, really. They itch sometimes, but not too bad. And they ache, like I said, when I’ve been on my feet. No fever, no chills, no nothing else. Just the red bumps on my legs. Is it… is it serious? My wife is going to be so worried.
DOCTOR: Mr. Aluia, I understand your concern. “Erythematous” means red, and “hyperpigmentation” means there’s some darkening of the skin. It appears to be stasis dermatitis, likely exacerbated by venous insufficiency. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a lower extremity Doppler ultrasound to assess your venous blood flow. We'll also do a complete blood count to check for any underlying infection.
PATIENT: Oh. Doppler… ultrasound? And blood work? That sounds… complicated. Is it going to be expensive? My Medicare… it doesn’t cover everything, you know? And will it take long? I promised my wife I’d help her with the garden this afternoon. She’s been wanting to plant tomatoes. Is it something bad, Doctor? You can just tell me straight, you know. I'm an old man, I’ve seen things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Aluia, I understand your concerns about cost and time. The ultrasound and blood work are standard procedures to rule out more serious conditions. Medicare should cover the majority of the costs, but we will have billing confirm that for you. As for the garden… the tests will take a few hours, at best. It’s unlikely you’ll be able to assist your wife this afternoon. While it’s unlikely to be anything grave, it’s essential we determine the cause of these lesions before determining a course of treatment. I'm also going to order a skin biopsy, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Skin biopsy? Oh dear. That sounds… painful. Are you going to cut me? My wife always said I bruise easy. And… will it leave a scar? I don’t want a big ugly scar on my leg. She'll be so upset. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe some cream? I used to use a cream for my eczema when I was a boy. Would that work?
DOCTOR: Mr. Aluia, the biopsy is a very small procedure. It involves removing a tiny sample of skin for examination under a microscope. It will likely cause minimal discomfort, and we will use a local anesthetic. A small bandage will be applied, and yes, there may be a small, faint scar, but it will likely be minimal. A topical cream for eczema will not be sufficient. We need to determine the underlying cause of these lesions before attempting any treatment. Given your age and medical history, it’s imperative we be thorough. I will arrange for the tests to be scheduled immediately. The lab will contact you to set up an appointment. Do you have any other questions… or concerns, that we need to address before you go?
PATIENT: Well… I guess not. It just… all sounds so complicated, Doctor. And scary. I just want the bumps to go away so I can help my wife in the garden. Okay. If you think it’s best, I guess. Just… please be gentle with the biopsy. And tell the lab to be careful. Tell them I bruise easy. I suppose I should go then. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing serious. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Aluia. I’ve made a note of your concerns. The lab has been informed. The nurse will provide you with instructions regarding the tests and follow-up appointments. Please review these carefully. Have a good day.
