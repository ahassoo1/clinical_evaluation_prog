DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Lason is fine. And you can skip the “nice to meet you,” we haven’t met before. My wife made the appointment. She says I've been… well, a bit off lately. Confused, she calls it. I just feel like things aren’t as sharp as they used to be, I suppose. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It's perfectly alright to feel that way, and it's good your wife encouraged you to come in. It’s always best to check things out. "A bit off" can mean a lot of things, and we want to get a clearer picture. So, you mentioned feeling less sharp – can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Less sharp… honestly, it's frustrating. I've been setting tile for forty years, you know? Forty years! And now… sometimes I look at a pattern, and I second-guess myself. Little things. Like, did I use the right adhesive? Or if I cut a tile correctly. Things I know I can do in my sleep. It’s not a big deal, really. It’s just… annoying. My wife worries too much.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like this is impacting your work, which is understandably frustrating after forty years of experience. And it’s good your wife is attentive, even if it feels like worrying at times. It's certainly worth investigating when changes like this happen. Now, has this been a sudden change, or has it been developing gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Not like I woke up one morning and couldn't tell a trowel from a hammer. It’s been… creeping up on me, maybe six months, a year? Hard to say exactly. I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about these things, you know? I’m a tile setter, not a… a head shrinker. I just want to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Lason. You're a craftsman, focused on the task at hand, and that's admirable. Six months to a year… that’s helpful. And it's good to know it wasn’t a sudden onset. Besides the uncertainty with your work, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… my wife says I repeat myself sometimes. Ask the same question twice in a row. I don’t remember doing it, though. She also says I’m more… irritable. Which is ridiculous. I’ve always been a direct man. Don’t beat around the bush, you know? Honestly, I think she just wants attention.
DOCTOR: I see. Repetition and irritability… those can be things to pay attention to. It's good your wife is observant. Sometimes these things are easier for others to notice. And it’s completely understandable to feel frustrated when others point out changes in your behavior. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Have you experienced any memory problems outside of work – forgetting appointments, names, or recent events?
PATIENT: No. Not really. I mean, I forget where I put my glasses sometimes, but who doesn’t? And I might not remember the name of that actor… you know, the one in all the action movies. But nothing serious. I still know my way around, I still know what day it is. And I definitely remember my wife’s birthday. I’m not senile, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that, Mr. Lason. It's good to hear you’re still oriented and remembering important things. Forgetting an actor's name is perfectly normal, we all do that. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. They put me on something for it… a little white pill. Take it every morning. Other than that, nothing much. I’ve always been a strong man. Never really got sick. A cold now and then, but nothing a little rest and some good broth couldn’t fix. And I definitely don’t have… what was it? Dee-ah-bee-tees? I eat a perfectly good diet. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Diabetes, yes. And that's good to hear you're generally healthy. High blood pressure is important to manage, so it’s good you’re taking medication for it. Do you know the name of the medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Not offhand. My wife handles all that. She fills the little pill box every week. I just… take the pills. It’s a small, white one, I think. Maybe two small, white ones. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to the details. I trust my wife, you know? She’s a very organized woman. Is this really important, Doctor? I’m here because I’m a little forgetful, not because I’m a pharmacist.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Mr. Lason. It is important. Knowing the medication helps us understand potential interactions and side effects. Don't worry, we'll figure it out. Let me quickly check your electronic health record. Okay, it looks like you’re taking Lisinopril, 20mg, once daily. Is that what you take?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yeah. That sounds right. Lisinopril. See? My wife does know what she’s doing. I told you. Now, can we get back to the reason I’m here? My confusion, or whatever you want to call it. This is taking a long time. I have tiles to set, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lason. I apologize if it felt like we were getting sidetracked. It's important to have a complete picture, and medication is a part of that. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, or grandparents – have any history of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Now that’s a good question. My mother… she got a little… distant towards the end. Didn’t recognize me sometimes. My wife said it was just old age. She passed away ten years ago, maybe more. My father… he was a strong man, like me. Never got sick. And as far as grandparents… I didn’t know them very well. They lived in Cambodia, you know? Different life. It wasn’t something we talked about much. Family history. It’s… complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It is complicated. Knowing your mother experienced some memory loss is helpful information, though. We don’t need a detailed family history, just general awareness. Now, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. My wife doesn’t allow it. And smoking? Disgusting. I work with my hands, you know? Need good lungs to set tile. Recreational drugs? Are you serious, Doctor? I’m a hardworking man, not some… layabout. What kind of questions are these?
DOCTOR: I apologize if those questions felt intrusive, Mr. Lason. I’m simply gathering information to get a complete picture of your health. It's good to hear you maintain a healthy lifestyle. Now, one final question before we move on to a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. Not to penicillin, not to shellfish, nothing. I eat everything my wife puts in front of me, and I take whatever pills she gives me. She’s a very careful woman, you know? Always looking out for me. Alright, Doctor. Let's get this exam over with. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's very helpful. Alright, Mr. Lason, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and do a brief neurological assessment – just checking your reflexes, balance, and memory a little further. It won't take long. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And try not to take too long, Doctor. I'm losing daylight.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not significantly different from what’s recorded in your chart. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in... and out... again... and out... Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please sit on the edge of the exam table and I will test your reflexes?
PATIENT: Reflexes? What for? I'm a tile setter, not a… a test subject. Just get it over with. I don’t have all day. And be careful. I'm not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, good reflexes there. And now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and tell me when I touch your fingers. Can you tell me when I touch your fingers, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Left… right… left… right… Yes, I can feel it. What is the point of this? I told you, I’m perfectly fine. This is just… a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words after me. Remember them, and I’ll ask you to repeat them back to me in a few minutes. The words are: apple, table, penny. Apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me, please?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. There. Now can we please get this over with? I have tiles to set, you know. A man's gotta work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for your patience. That concludes the physical exam. Now, I’d like to ask you one final question. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, hearing, or sense of smell?
PATIENT: No. Not a bit. Vision's still sharp enough to cut tile, hearing's good enough to hear my wife yelling, and I can smell a bad adhesive from a mile away. A tile setter needs his senses, you know. Now, what's the verdict, Doctor? Am I losing my mind?
DOCTOR: You're not losing your mind, Mr. Lason. Based on what you've told me, and the brief exam, you're experiencing some subtle changes that are worth investigating further. Your neurological exam was largely normal, but the subjective reports of confusion and repetition, along with your family history, suggest we should rule out some potential causes. I’d like to order a few blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin B12 levels, and rule out any underlying infections. I also recommend a cognitive assessment – a simple series of questions that will help us evaluate your memory and thinking skills more objectively. And finally, I’d like to schedule an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: MRI? Blood tests? Cognitive assessment? This is getting out of hand. All this for a little forgetfulness? I told you, my wife worries too much. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your thoroughness, but I don't want to spend my retirement getting poked and prodded. Can’t we just… leave it alone? Maybe it’ll go away on its own? I have work to do, you know. A man's gotta earn a living.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. And I assure you, I’m not trying to alarm you. However, it's important to rule out any serious underlying causes for these changes. The tests will help us determine if there’s anything we need to address, or if it’s simply age-related changes that don't require treatment. Early detection is key, especially with cognitive issues. If we identify a problem early on, we can often manage it more effectively. And the tests will give you peace of mind, knowing that we’ve thoroughly investigated your symptoms. I’m not pushing you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. But I strongly recommend at least the blood tests. They're relatively simple, can provide valuable information, and won’t take up much of your time. What do you think about starting with the blood tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests. But that’s it. No MRI, no cognitive assessment, no poking and prodding. Just the blood tests. And tell me quickly, how long will they take? I have a schedule to keep, you know. And can I still work while I’m waiting for the results? I need to earn a living, Doctor. This retirement business isn't as easy as it looks.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a good start. The blood tests are relatively quick – just a few vials of blood, and they should take about 15-20 minutes. We can draw them here at the clinic today. And yes, you can absolutely continue working while we’re waiting for the results. There's no reason to stop doing what you enjoy. It may take a few days for the results to come back, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they’re available. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and draw your blood. She’s very good, and will make sure you’re comfortable. In the meantime, if you notice any worsening of your symptoms – increased confusion, difficulty with everyday tasks, or changes in your vision or speech – please don’t hesitate to call us immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just get it over with. I have tiles to set, you know. And tell Sarah to be gentle. I don’t have the patience for a lot of poking around. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll let Sarah know to be as gentle as possible. Sarah?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: She'll be in shortly. We'll get everything taken care of quickly and efficiently. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today?
