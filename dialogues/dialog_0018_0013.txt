DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Stilaire. It's good to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, you see. Like it just… stops. It's been happening for a little while now. Not every time, but often enough it worries me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. Trouble with complete bladder emptying, and it’s been occurring intermittently for some time now. Could you describe a typical instance?
PATIENT: Well… let’s see. I go to the bathroom, feel like I gotta go, and it comes out okay for a bit. But then… it just… slows way down. And I have to… strain. Push a little. Sometimes it feels like there’s still some left in there, even after I’m done. It’s… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but just… not right. It takes a good long time sometimes to get everything out.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Mr. Hilber. It sounds frustrating to experience. You mentioned straining to empty your bladder and a sensation of incomplete emptying. Has this been getting progressively worse, or has it been fairly consistent?
PATIENT: It’s… gotten a little worse, I think. Not a lot at once, but… over the last few months, I have to push more often, and it takes longer each time. It didn’t used to be like this, you know? I could go, and be done quick. Now it feels like I gotta go back a little while later, even if I just went. It's just… getting old, maybe?
DOCTOR: It's good you're bringing this to my attention, Mr. Hilber. It’s certainly worth investigating, regardless of whether it's age-related or something else. To get a better understanding, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. Well, I get up a couple times at night to go to the bathroom, which I always have, but maybe a little more lately? Not every night, but… more than I used to. And sometimes, when I do go, it feels like it takes a bit to even start. Like it’s slow to begin. Not a lot of pain, just… a little hesitant. And I drink a normal amount of water, I think. Not a whole lot, not a whole lot less.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, increased nighttime urination – nocturia – and hesitancy when starting to urinate. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, prostate problems, or neurological issues?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t have diabetes, no. Doctor told me years ago I was close, but I changed my eating and it went away. And… no, I haven’t been told I have any prostate problems. Never had any tests for that, if that's what you mean. Neurological issues… I don't think so. I forget things sometimes, like everyone my age, but nothing… serious. I had a bad fall last year, broke my wrist, but it healed up fine. I get Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Hilber. No known diabetes or prostate issues. And the wrist fracture last year. I appreciate you mentioning that. We'll keep that in mind. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, in my hands. It's called… let me see… Naproxen, that’s it. And sometimes, when it’s really bad, I take Tylenol. But that’s it. Just those two, when I need them. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills when I can, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Hilber. Naproxen and Tylenol as needed for arthritis. Thank you. Now, before we move on, could you tell me about any allergies you have, to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I eat most everything, and I've taken a lot of different pills over the years, for colds and aches and pains, and never had a problem. My wife, God rest her soul, she was allergic to bee stings, but I never was.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. No known allergies. I'm sorry to hear about your wife. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife, she tried it once when she was young, but didn’t like it. I always said it was a silly habit. I fish a lot, you know? Out on the Kuskokwim River. Good for my soul, that is. Keeps me busy, keeps me out of trouble.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mr. Hilber. Fishing sounds like a very healthy and fulfilling activity. And good for you for never having taken up smoking. Now, regarding alcohol, do you drink, and if so, how much and how often?
PATIENT: I have a little beer sometimes, with my friends. Not every day, maybe once or twice a week. Just one or two, nothing crazy. It's more about sitting and talking with them, you know? It’s not like I need it, or anything. I don't go out to bars or anything like that. Just at home, with good company.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. That’s helpful to know. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I ain't as young as I used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. I will explain everything as we go and stop if you experience any discomfort. First, I'll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then, I'd like to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. It’s a standard part of the evaluation for urinary issues, and will help us determine if further testing is needed. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Oh. Well… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? I mean, I’m not having any pain there, just trouble with my water.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It's not the most comfortable exam, and many men feel apprehensive about it. However, it’s a very important step in evaluating the cause of your urinary symptoms. The prostate gland sits very close to the bladder and urethra, and a physical exam can help me assess its size, shape, and consistency, which can provide valuable clues about what might be going on. It also allows me to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It's a quick procedure, and I will explain everything as I go. If you are still uncomfortable, we can discuss other options, but it may limit our ability to determine the cause of your symptoms. Would you like me to take a moment to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Well… if it’s really important, I guess. You said it might help figure out what’s wrong. And I do want to figure out what’s wrong. It’s just… not something a man looks forward to, you know? Tell me what it involves. Slowly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. You will lie on your side, typically your left side, with your knees bent. I will apply a small amount of lubricating jelly to a gloved, finger and gently insert it into your rectum. I will then feel the size, shape, and consistency of your prostate. I'll also be checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. The exam usually takes less than a minute. You might feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I will explain each step as I go, and you can let me know at any time if you’re feeling uncomfortable. It’s a very common procedure, and many men find it’s not as bad as they expect. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… get it over with, I guess. I trust you, Doctor. But… maybe tell me when you're starting, so I don't get startled.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. I will absolutely let you know before I begin, and I’ll explain each step as I go. Just relax as much as possible. Now, if you’ll just lie down on your left side and bend your knees… Alright, I’m going to apply a little lubricant to my gloved finger now… and then I'll gently insert it into your rectum. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. This will only take a moment. Okay, I'm starting now. Just relax your muscles... Alright, that's all done. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but not significantly. It was symmetrical and didn't seem tender. That’s a good sign, but it doesn't rule out other possibilities. Now, I’d like to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. If you could lie flat on your back, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Enlarged, you say? What does that mean? Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: An enlarged prostate is very common as men age, Mr. Hilber. It’s called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it can sometimes cause urinary symptoms like the ones you're experiencing – difficulty starting, a weak stream, and incomplete emptying. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, such as an infection or, less commonly, something more serious. That's why I want to run a few tests. I’m going to order a urinalysis to check for infection, and a prostate-specific antigen test, which is a blood test that can help us assess the health of your prostate. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Seems like a lot. What’s a… a PSA test, exactly? And what if… what if it is something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hilber. It does seem like a lot, and I apologize for that. But it's important to get a clear picture of what’s going on so we can develop the best plan for you. A PSA test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland, and elevated levels can sometimes indicate prostate cancer, but they can also be caused by other conditions, such as BPH or an infection. It’s important to remember that an elevated PSA doesn’t necessarily mean you have cancer. Many men have elevated PSA levels without ever developing the disease. If your PSA level is elevated, we would discuss further testing, such as a biopsy, to determine if cancer is present. I want to emphasize that we’re just gathering information at this point. We won't jump to any conclusions until we have all the results. Would you like me to explain anything else about the tests or the potential results?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, I guess so. Tests are tests. Better to know, I suppose, than to just sit around worrying. So… you'll take some blood and… and a sample of my water? How do I… how do I give you a sample of my water? It's a bit embarrassing to ask, you know.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your embarrassment, Mr. Hilber. It’s a common concern, and there’s absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. I'll give you a sterile cup and instructions on how to collect a clean urine sample. It's important to clean the area thoroughly before collecting the sample to ensure accurate results. The instructions are straightforward, and if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. We have a private restroom just down the hall. After you’ve collected the sample, you can leave it with the nurse, and she’ll send it to the lab. As for the blood test, we’ll draw a small amount of blood from your arm, just like any other blood test. The whole process will only take a few minutes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, that sounds… manageable. A cup and some instructions. And a little blood. I can do that. Just… tell me how to clean the area, okay? I don’t want to mess it up and have to do it all over again.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. Here's a pamphlet with detailed instructions. It’s important to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before you begin. Then, use the antiseptic wipe provided to clean the area around the opening of your urethra – that’s the tube where urine comes out – in a front-to-back motion. It’s important to avoid touching the inside of the cup. Then, collect a mid-stream sample – that means let a small amount of urine go into the toilet first, and then collect the sample. Finally, let a small amount of urine go into the toilet after collecting the sample. It's important to take your time and follow the instructions carefully. The nurse will be happy to answer any questions you have as well. Do you have any questions about those instructions right now?
PATIENT: Mid-stream… right. Don't touch the inside of the cup. Seems… a lot to remember. I think I understand. Alright. I’ll go to the restroom and… and try my best. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask the nurse if you need any assistance. Once you’ve collected the sample and we have the blood drawn, the lab results usually take a few days to come back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a plan based on what we find. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… get the tests done, and let me know what they say. Thank you again, Doctor Stilaire.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. It was a pleasure meeting you. The nurse will be right in to draw your blood and give you the instructions for the urine sample. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
