DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. Been havin' this fever come and go, see? It's been botherin' me for a little while now. Not sure what's causin' it, that's why I figured I'd come get it checked out. Don't like feelin' weak, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I understand. A fever that comes and goes can certainly be unsettling. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about this fever?
PATIENT: Well, it ain't a high fever, not like the ones you hear about. More like…warm. Usually in the evenings, it'll spike up a little, then go away by mornin'. Happens maybe three, four times a week now. I take some over-the-counter stuff, but it doesn't really do much, just takes the edge off for a bit. My wife keeps tellin' me to come in, she worries.
DOCTOR: I'm glad your wife encouraged you to come in, Clide. It’s always best to get these things checked out, and it's good you're being proactive. When you say 'warm,' could you give me a rough estimate of your temperature when you feel the fever?
PATIENT: Hmm…I haven’t actually taken my temperature, Doc. Never been one for thermometers. But I'd say…around 100, maybe 101 when it's at its worst? Like I said, it's not sendin' me to the hospital or anything. Just makes me tired, kinda achy. Mostly just uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand, Clide. It’s helpful to have some idea of the temperature, even a rough estimate is useful. And it’s good to know it’s not accompanied by more severe symptoms. Besides the tiredness and aches, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fever?
PATIENT: Let me think……Well, I've been sweatier than usual, even when I'm just sittin' around. And my appetite’s been off, not eatin' as much. My wife made arroz con gandules the other day, and I barely touched it, which is sayin' somethin'. No cough, no runny nose, nothin' like that. Just…feel kinda blah, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, "kinda blah" is a good way to put it. Loss of appetite and increased sweating are certainly things we should consider. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel movements or urination recently?
PATIENT: …Well, now that you mention it…I have been goin' to the bathroom more often, gotta pee a lot more than usual. Everything else is…normal, I guess. No trouble goin' or anything like that. Just…more frequent trips to the bathroom, especially at night. It's been botherin' my sleep a little.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Clide. That’s important information. And I appreciate you being so open with me. Now, to get a broader picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Not much to tell, Doc. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles, mumps, you know. Broke my arm once fallin' off a roof when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. Been seein' a chiropractor for years, keeps my back in line. Otherwise, nothin' major. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothin' like that. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out maybe ten years ago. That was a little rough, but I recovered okay.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. That’s helpful. And good to know about the gallbladder removal. Now, do you have any family history of medical conditions?
PATIENT: …My father had high blood pressure, towards the end of his life. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, had…I think it was arthritis, bad pain in her joints. My mother was pretty healthy, lived to be 85. My wife's side…I don’t really know much about their medical history, to be honest. We didn’t talk about it much. She doesn't remember much either. So, not a whole lot to go on there, Doc. Sorry about that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Clide. You’ve shared what you know, and that’s what’s important. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I'm retired now, used to be a chiropractor myself, so I was on my feet a lot. Now I mostly just take it easy, do a little gardening, spend time with my wife. I try to eat healthy, but I got a sweet tooth, I won’t lie. I don't smoke, haven’t touched a cigarette in years. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then. Mostly just try to stay active and enjoy life, you know?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a good lifestyle, Clide. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin' a doctor's given me. My wife always double-checks when they give me somethin' new, but so far, so good. No food allergies either, I eat just about anything. I’m a pretty simple guy, Doc. Don’t need much to make me happy.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for that thorough information, Clide. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your temperature and blood pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine, Doc. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I just wanna figure out what's makin' me feel so crummy, you know? I trust your judgment. Get it over with quick, if you could, though? I got a little garden I need to get back to. My tomatoes are startin' to ripen.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. First, let's take your temperature and blood pressure. Your temperature is slightly elevated at 100.3°F, and your blood pressure is within a normal range. I listened to your heart and lungs, and everything sounds good. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I noticed some mild tenderness in your right upper quadrant. This area is where your liver and gallbladder are located. It could be related to your previous gallbladder removal, or it could be something else. Now, I'm going to check your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes don’t feel enlarged.
PATIENT: Okay. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant…that’s somethin’, huh? I haven’t really noticed it much, just a little discomfort sometimes after I eat. But it's nothin' terrible. Is that somethin' I should be worried about, Doc? And what do you think is goin' on? I just wanna get back to my tomatoes, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Clide, and your desire to get back to your garden. The tenderness in the right upper quadrant is worth investigating, even if it's not severe. Given your history of gallbladder removal, it could be related to scar tissue or some inflammation in the area. However, the recent fever, loss of appetite, and increased frequency of urination are also important symptoms that need to be considered. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us assess your liver function, check for any signs of infection, and rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. Specifically, I'd like to order a Complete Blood Count , a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel , and a Liver Function Test . Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests……Alright, Doc, if you think it's necessary. I don't like needles, but I trust your judgment. Just get it over with quick, okay? And tell me what the results mean, in plain English, not a bunch of medical mumbo jumbo. I just wanna know what's goin' on and how to fix it. Is there anything else I need to do? Or can I go back to my tomatoes now?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I'll make sure the phlebotomist is as quick and gentle as possible, and I promise to explain the results in plain English, no medical jargon. For now, there isn't anything else you need to do. We'll get the blood tests done, and I'll review the results as soon as they come back, which usually takes a couple of days. I'll call you with the findings and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, please continue to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any worsening of your fever, abdominal pain, or develop any new symptoms such as jaundice or dark urine, please contact the clinic immediately. For now, you can go back to your tomatoes, but please keep me updated if anything changes. I’ll be in touch soon. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doc. Just call me when you have the results. And thanks for not makin' me sit here all day. Hopefully, it's nothin' serious. Gotta get back to those tomatoes…they won't pick themselves, you know? Stop.
DOCTOR: .
