DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… family. My mother, she… had some problems. Heart, I think. And my brother, he had… something with his blood sugar. I just want to make sure I am okay. You know? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. It’s very wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart problems and diabetes. It's good you're thinking ahead. To get a better understanding of your current health status, and to see if there’s anything we should be paying particular attention to, I’d like to ask you a few questions. We'll cover your symptoms, past medical history, and lifestyle. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you need to know, Doctor. I don’t always remember everything perfectly, though. So, you might have to ask things a couple of times. No problem, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schwer, no problem at all. It's perfectly normal to not remember every detail, and I'm happy to repeat things as needed. We’ll take our time. Let’s start with your current symptoms. Have you been experiencing any specific health concerns recently?
PATIENT: Not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but I’m an old man, you know? That happens. Nothing bad. No pain, no… coughing, nothing like that. Just… old. I eat okay, I think. Mostly. Maybe too much salt. My ex-wife always said that.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so open, Mr. Schwer. It's good to know you haven't been experiencing any acute pain or concerning symptoms like coughing. Feeling tired can be a symptom of many things, so we'll explore that a bit further. And it sounds like you're aware of your dietary habits, which is excellent. Now, regarding that tiredness – would you describe it as a new symptom, or something you’ve been dealing with for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, a while now. Years, I guess. Comes and goes. Some days I feel okay, other days… I just want to sit and watch TV. It's not bad tired, just… not much energy. I used to like to garden, but I don't do that much anymore. Too much bending. My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s a gradual fatigue that’s been present for years, and seems to affect your activity level. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned some knee discomfort, which is common as we age. Let's move on to your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, my mother had heart trouble. And my brother, diabetes. Me? I don't think so. I went to the doctor sometimes, for check-ups. But I don't remember them telling me I had anything… special. I had the flu a couple of times, that's about it. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But that healed okay. I always thought I was pretty healthy, honestly. Just… getting older now, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like you haven’t had any significant medical diagnoses yourself, which is positive. A history of good health is always a good starting point. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the broken arm you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been in the hospital, except for when I broke my arm as a kid. That was a long time ago. I always tried to stay out of hospitals, if I could help it. Not my favorite place. I usually just… toughed things out. That's what we did back then. You didn't go to the doctor for every little thing.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. Many people of your generation feel that way. Let's talk about your family history a bit more specifically, since you mentioned your mother's heart trouble and your brother's diabetes. Do you know what specific heart condition your mother had?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don't remember the exact name. Something with… her heart not pumping right? She was very tired a lot. And she had swelling in her legs. She was in the hospital a couple of times for it. And my brother… he had to take shots for his sugar. He said it was… type two? Is that right? I don't know all the medical names, Doctor. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Schwer. You’re doing just fine. It sounds like your mother may have had heart failure, based on the fatigue and swelling. And yes, your brother likely had type 2 diabetes. Now, do you have any other family members – siblings, parents, grandparents – who have had heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or stroke?
PATIENT: Let me think… My father, he had high blood pressure, I think. He was always grumpy. Maybe that's why. And my aunt, on my mother's side, she had a stroke, I think. She couldn't talk right after. It was a long time ago. That's all I can really remember, Doctor. My family wasn't very good at talking about health things. Very private people.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's quite common. Knowing about these family conditions gives us a better picture. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone now. My ex-wife… well, that's a long story. I don’t do much. Watch TV, read the paper. I used to like to fish, but it's hard to get out now. I drive sometimes, to the grocery store. I eat mostly at home. I try to eat healthy, but I like my salt. And I don't exercise much. I walk a little, around the house. That's about it. Nothing exciting.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like you're relatively independent, but lead a somewhat sedentary lifestyle. Now, just to cover all the bases, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, but that’s it. The doctor gave it to me a couple of years ago. It seems to be working okay. Never had any trouble with allergies, though. Not like some people.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what is the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure, if you happen to recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… It’s a little white pill. I think it starts with an ‘A’… Am… something. I’m sorry, Doctor, I’m really not good with names. I just know I take it every morning. It comes in a little orange bottle. That’s about all I can tell you. I should probably look it up, shouldn’t I? It’s just… I never really paid much attention to it. It’s just a pill.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schwer. Don’t worry about it at all. We can look it up in the system here. I type into the computer. Ah, yes. It says you’re currently taking Amlodipine 5mg. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I don’t mind. Just try to be gentle, okay? My old bones aren’t what they used to be. I chuckle softly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schwer. I will be as gentle as possible. I proceed with the physical exam, listening to his heart and lungs with a stethoscope, checking his blood pressure, and briefly examining his ears, nose, and throat. Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/88. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur, which isn't necessarily concerning but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. And your ears, nose and throat look normal. I’m also going to check your reflexes and test your strength. I perform a quick neurological assessment. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common for your age, and your strength is good. Finally, I'd like to check your feet for any signs of neuropathy. I examine his feet, checking for sensation and circulation. Your sensation is slightly diminished in your feet, and your circulation seems a little slow. It's not dramatic, but it's something we should monitor. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Now, based on your family history, symptoms, and the findings from the exam, I'd like to order a few blood tests. These tests will help us assess your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, kidney function, and thyroid levels. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests are fine. Just… no needles, okay? I don't love needles. But I guess it has to be done. You'll tell me what's what afterwards, right? Not too much medical talk, please. Just… what it means. If it's bad, just tell me straight. No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schwer. I understand your apprehension about needles, and I'll make sure the phlebotomist is as gentle as possible. We'll draw a standard panel of blood tests. And I absolutely promise to explain the results in plain language, avoiding technical jargon as much as possible. I'll tell you straight if there’s anything concerning, and we'll discuss a plan to address it. We'll go over everything together, step by step. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve asked me a lot of questions, Doctor. I'm just glad I came in. It makes me feel a little better, knowing someone is looking at things. Maybe I’m just an old worrywart. But my mother… and my brother… I just want to be sure. So, thank you. When will I hear about the tests? I hope it’s not too long. And… where do I go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. It's perfectly natural to be concerned about your health, especially with your family history. That’s precisely why you came in, and I’m happy to help. The lab results should be back within 3-5 business days. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. For the blood work, you can go to the lab located right across the hall, Room 203. They’re expecting you. Just tell them you're here for Dr. Abady’s orders. Do you need a ride home, or are you driving yourself?
PATIENT: I’m driving myself, thank you. I think I can manage that. It’s just… across the hall, you said? Good. That's easy. Well, I guess that’s all then. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. I appreciate your time. I slowly stand up, adjusting my tie once more.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and drive safely. I offer a warm smile and a nod.
