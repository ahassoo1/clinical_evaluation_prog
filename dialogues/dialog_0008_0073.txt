DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time. It's... well, it's my stomach. Been having issues. Really bad diarrhea. And nothing seems to be stopping it. I've tried… things. Over-the-counter stuff. It just won't quit.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Diarrhea can certainly be disruptive. “Tried things” is a bit vague, but we’ll get there. Let's start with how long this has been going on. When did it start, roughly?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t keep track of that sort of thing. It feels like weeks. Maybe a month? Look, I run a business. I don’t have time to chart my… bowel movements. It just started and hasn't stopped. Is there a quick fix or not? I have jobs waiting.
DOCTOR: Right, I appreciate that you're busy. A month is a pretty long time to be dealing with this. Okay, so it's been ongoing for about a month, and over-the-counter medications haven't helped. Besides the diarrhea, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes. Of course there’s other stuff. I’m tired. Really tired. And… cramping. Bad cramping. It makes it hard to get anything done, which, as I said, is a problem. And I've been… well, I haven’t been eating much because of it. Everything just goes right through me. You need to understand, this is affecting my livelihood.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, cramping, and reduced appetite because of the diarrhea – all noted. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Blood? No. I would know if there was blood. That's… obvious. It’s just… watery. And frequent. Honestly, it's embarrassing even talking about it. I don't need a detailed description of my… output, thank you very much. I just want it fixed. Are you going to run some tests or what? This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood noted. I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I want to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. To help me figure out what's going on, I'm going to ask a few more questions, and then we'll do a brief physical exam. First, have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No fever. No vomiting. Just… this. And the cramping. Sometimes a little nauseous, but nothing I couldn't push through. Look, I'm a strong person. I don't just sit around feeling sorry for myself. I work. So, can we please get this over with? I have painters waiting for me. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or vomiting, just the diarrhea and cramping. I hear you, and I'll be as efficient as possible. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I was married for a long time, does that count? My husband… passed away a few years back. Otherwise, I’m healthy. Always been active. Never been one to sit still. I don't go to doctors much. Usually, things just… fix themselves. I’m a Tlingit woman. We’re made of tougher stuff. I don't need a list of conditions. Are you going to ask me about my life story now? Just fix my stomach.
DOCTOR: I understand. No pre-existing conditions noted. I apologize if my questions seem intrusive; I’m just trying to get a complete picture. Okay, have you taken any medications regularly – even over-the-counter ones besides what you've used for the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Look, I take a multivitamin sometimes. That's it. Occasionally ibuprofen if I pull something painting, but that's rare. I'm not one for pills and potions. I'd rather just get on with things. Are we getting anywhere with this or are we just going in circles? I really need to get back to work. I'm losing money with every minute I'm sitting here.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin occasionally, ibuprofen as needed. No regular medications. Just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I've eaten all sorts of things in my life, I assure you. I'm not some delicate flower. I've lived in Alaska most of my life. I eat fish, berries, whatever's available. I don't go around having allergic reactions. Can we please move on to actually doing something about this? Are you going to listen to my stomach or what?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. I understand your frustration. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’m going to feel your belly to check for any tenderness. Okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But if it hurts, I’m telling you right now, I’m not going to be gentle. I don't have time for coddling. Just do it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen. Just relax as much as you can. Okay. Your bowel sounds are… a little hyperactive, which isn't surprising given the diarrhea. Now I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. I'm starting here, on your right side. Anything here?
PATIENT: It’s… uncomfortable. You're pressing pretty hard. And don’t poke so much! Honestly, I do a lot of physical work. I’m used to some discomfort, but this isn’t necessary. Just… get it over with. This is making me anxious, and anxious people don’t have good stomachs. Just tell me what you find. Is it something serious or not? I need a straight answer. No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I apologize if I’m causing you discomfort. I'm just trying to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities. There is some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, but no obvious masses. It's not severe, but it's present. Given your symptoms – the prolonged diarrhea, cramping, fatigue, and some tenderness on palpation – I think we need to run a few tests to figure out what's going on. Specifically, I want to check a stool sample for any infections, and I’d like to do a blood test to look for signs of inflammation and dehydration. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, tests. Of course. More wasted time. Fine. Do what you have to do. Just… can’t I just get a shot or something? A quick fix? I really don’t have the patience for waiting on results. But fine. Stool sample and blood test. Get it over with. I need to know how long this is going to take. And can I get a note for work? Explaining why I’m… indisposed? I have deadlines.
DOCTOR: Okay, a note for work is no problem at all. I'll write one explaining that you're experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms and require some time off for testing and recovery. The stool sample will take about 2-3 business days to get results back. The blood test should be available in about 24-48 hours. We have a collection kit for the stool sample in the bathroom. Just follow the instructions, and bring it back to the lab technician by the front desk. I'll also have the nurse draw your blood. In the meantime, it's important to stay hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids – water, broth, electrolyte solutions. And try to eat bland foods if you can tolerate them – bananas, rice, toast, applesauce. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. Just… how much is this going to cost? I have insurance, but… I don’t want a surprise bill. And can I get a copy of the results when they’re back? I don’t trust doctors to just tell me what’s wrong. I want to see it myself. Look, I’m a business owner. I have to keep track of everything. Just give me the numbers and the reports. And a note for work. That’s all I need. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me pull up the estimated costs for you. The stool sample analysis is approximately $150, and the blood test panel will be around $200. Your insurance should cover a portion of that, but the exact amount will depend on your specific plan. I can have the billing department contact you directly to provide a more detailed breakdown once the tests are processed. And yes, absolutely, you'll receive copies of all your results as soon as they're available. We can either email them to you or provide you with a hard copy. Here's a form to request the work note. Please fill out your employer's information, and I'll have it ready for you before you leave. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
PATIENT: No. That’s everything. Just… let’s get this paperwork done and get me out of here. I have a business to run. Thank you. And please make sure the billing department actually calls me. I don't have time to chase people down.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll make a note to ensure the billing department contacts you promptly. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood and collect the stool sample kit. Thank you for your patience, Ms. Woodring. I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly and get you feeling better soon.
