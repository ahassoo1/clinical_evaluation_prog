DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to Early KAMMER clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you, I suppose. I’m here because… well, my daughter, she says I need a card. A “get well” card, she called it. Seems silly, but she’s very insistent. I don’t feel sick, exactly. Just… a little low, you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kammer. It’s very thoughtful of your daughter to encourage you to come in, even if you don’t feel acutely ill. Sometimes a little check-up is all it takes to put your mind at ease. And “low” can mean many things. Could you tell me a bit more about what you mean by feeling “low”?
PATIENT: Well, it’s hard to explain. Just… not myself, I guess. Tired, even when I sleep. Not enjoying things like I used to. The garden, for example. Used to spend hours out there. Now… I look at it, and it just… is. No pleasure in it. And my appetite is… off. Don’t really want much. It’s not a pain, or anything. Just… blah.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Kammer. That's very helpful. A loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, along with fatigue and changes in appetite, are certainly things we should explore. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me how long you’ve been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. It’s been building, I think. Maybe… three, four months now? Started slow, just a little less energy. Then it just… kept going. My ex-wife keeps telling me I need to “get out more,” but honestly, I don’t want to get out more. It’s just… easier to stay in.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Three to four months of gradual change is significant. And it’s understandable that you wouldn’t feel inclined to socialize if you’re not feeling your best. Now, to get a more complete understanding, I’d like to ask a few questions about your general health. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or unintentional weight loss during this time?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And no, I haven’t lost weight. Actually, maybe a little… the pants are a bit looser, but I figured that was just… getting older. You know? I'm not exactly a young man anymore. Sixty-two in November.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Kammer. It's good to be aware of changes in your body. And you’re right to mention it. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the usual. Something for my blood pressure, a little pill every morning. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Nothing fancy. My doctor back in the city, he prescribed everything. Don’t really see him anymore, moved out here after the divorce.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kammer. Knowing your current medications is very important. And it’s good to know you were previously under a doctor's care. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Never had a problem with anything. I eat pretty much anything. My ex-wife always said I had the stomach of a goat. She wasn't wrong.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Kammer. Now, let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, or lung problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. Had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox. Broke my arm once when I was a kid, climbing a mango tree. But nothing serious. My blood pressure's been a bit high for a few years now, that's all. The doctor keeps an eye on it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kammer. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, actually. Years ago, when I was still working on the ships, I had my appendix out. That was… must have been thirty years ago. Everything went fine, recovered quickly. It was just a routine thing, the doctor said.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kammer. And finally, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father, he had a heart attack when he was pretty young, maybe in his fifties. My mother, she lived a long life, but she had arthritis, bad as mine. Lots of aches and pains, towards the end. My sister’s healthy as a horse, though. Always has been.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kammer. That’s helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your heart, lungs, and overall well-being. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try not to poke too much. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 142/88, which is a bit elevated, but not dramatically so. Your pulse is 76 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Your lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, with no tenderness or masses. Your extremities have good range of motion, but I do notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Everything seems within normal limits, Mr. Kammer, although the slightly elevated blood pressure and ankle swelling are things we should monitor.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean, Doctor? Am I sick? Is it something serious? I just want to know. And honestly, I'd really like that card now, if you don't mind. My daughter will be very happy.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Kammer. It’s natural to want answers, and I want to assure you, there’s no immediate cause for alarm. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, your symptoms—fatigue, loss of appetite, and low mood—along with the slightly elevated blood pressure and ankle swelling, could point to a few possibilities. It could be related to stress, mild depression, or even a vitamin deficiency. The ankle swelling could be a sign of mild heart issues, but it’s too early to say for sure. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. We will also do an EKG, which is a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. Regarding the "get well" card, I believe it's a good idea to address these symptoms proactively, and the results of these tests will help us create a plan to get you feeling like yourself again. I will write the orders for the lab and EKG now. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests… more poking and prodding. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel better. This is all very… complicated. But alright, alright. If you think it’s necessary. But please, nothing too painful. And can you write a note saying I came to see the doctor? My daughter will want proof. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Kammer. It can be frustrating to go through testing, and I assure you, we’ll do everything we can to make it as comfortable as possible. The blood draw is quick, and the EKG is non-invasive—just some sensors attached to your chest. I’m happy to write a note confirming your visit today. It will state the date of your appointment, the reason for your visit, and that you underwent a physical exam and ordered blood tests and an EKG. Is there anything specific you’d like me to include in the note for your daughter?
PATIENT: Hmm… just say I’m taking things seriously now. That’ll keep her happy. And… maybe mention the doctor thinks I need to rest more. She’s always telling me to slow down. But please, no big words. She doesn’t understand all that medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. Here is the note. It states: "Mr. Kammer visited the clinic on August 2, 2025, for evaluation of fatigue and decreased appetite. He underwent a physical exam and blood tests were ordered to assess his overall health. Dr. Stilaire recommends rest and follow-up after the lab results are available." Is that satisfactory?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Perfect, even. She’ll be pleased. Now, about those tests… where do I go? And how long will it take? I don’t want to spend all day in some waiting room.
DOCTOR: Here are the instructions for the lab and EKG. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, just a few blocks from here. You don’t need an appointment, just bring your insurance card and this request form. The EKG is done at the same location, right next door to the lab. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. Do you have any questions about the location or the testing process?
PATIENT: Three to five days? That’s a long time to wait. Well, alright. I suppose I don’t have much choice. And… is there anything I should do in the meantime? Besides rest, which she already told me a million times.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the wait, Mr. Kammer. It can be frustrating, but it’s important to get accurate results. In the meantime, aside from resting, I recommend focusing on eating a balanced diet, even if your appetite is low. Small, frequent meals can be easier to manage. And gentle exercise, like a short walk, can help boost your energy levels. Most importantly, try not to worry too much. We’ve taken the first step in understanding what’s going on, and we’ll have a clearer picture once the lab results are back. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening to me, even if it’s just… blah. And thank you for the note. My daughter will be very happy. Alright then. I’ll see you when the results come back.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Kammer. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we're here for you. If anything changes or you have any new concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
