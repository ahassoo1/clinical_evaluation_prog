DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It's good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My back… it is very painful. I would like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Back pain can be quite disruptive. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. To start, can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It began… let me think… approximately three weeks ago. I was erecting a section of fence – barbed wire – on the Miller property. It was a hot day, and the post was… difficult to set. The pain started in my lower back, and it has not lessened. It is…constant, but worsens with movement. Especially bending.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started about three weeks ago while you were setting a fence post, and it’s been constant with worsening pain when you bend. That gives us a good starting point. Is the pain radiating anywhere – down your legs, for instance?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. Down my left leg, mostly. Sometimes it feels like… pins and needles. Not all the time, but often enough to be bothersome. It doesn’t go all the way to my foot, though. Stops about halfway down my calf.
DOCTOR: Okay, radiating pain down your left leg, stopping around mid-calf, and you’re experiencing some tingling or “pins and needles” sensation. Have you noticed anything that improves the pain?
PATIENT: When I sit perfectly still, it is… less. But I cannot be perfectly still for very long. I work, Doctor. I need to be doing things. Laying down, flat on my back, helps a little, too. But not much. It’s… a temporary relief, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Temporary relief is helpful to know. And it sounds like movement definitely aggravates it. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you experienced any numbness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not numbness. Just the pins and needles I mentioned. And sometimes a… a weakness. In my left leg, when I try to stand up quickly. It doesn't happen every time, but it is concerning. I have not fallen, but I worry I might.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness, but some weakness in your left leg, particularly when standing quickly. That's important information. Let's move on to some other areas. Have you had any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills. And my weight has been… stable. I eat regular meals, although not always what I should be eating. It is difficult when you work all day. I have not lost any weight that I am aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, thinking about your medical history – have you ever had back problems before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not until this. I have been… generally healthy. A few colds, of course. But nothing serious. My husband… he had some issues with his heart, but that was years ago. This back pain is… new. Completely new.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new onset of back pain with no prior history of back problems. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. I haven't needed them. I try to avoid hospitals if I can. It reminds me… of my husband. It is a difficult topic.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's perfectly alright. We can certainly move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I take nothing regularly, so I have not had much opportunity to be allergic to anything. I have used some creams for aches and pains, over the counter, but nothing caused a reaction.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you aren't currently taking any medications. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any back problems that run in your family – like arthritis or scoliosis?
PATIENT: My mother… she had arthritis in her hands, terribly. She was always complaining about it. And my brother… he had something with his spine, when he was a young man. A curvature, I believe. He had to wear a brace for a time. But that was many years ago. I do not know the specifics.
DOCTOR: Alright, a family history of arthritis and some spinal issue in your brother. Thank you for sharing that. Finally, can you tell me a little about your work and daily activities?
PATIENT: I erect fences. Mostly barbed wire for cattle. It is physical work. Lifting posts, stretching wire, driving staples… It is hard on the body. I live alone now. I wake up early, have a quick breakfast, and go to work. I work until it gets dark, usually. I try to take breaks, but it is often hot, and I push through. I do some cooking in the evenings. Simple things. I do not have much time for… leisure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a physically demanding job with a lot of lifting and stretching, and a long workday. That gives me a much better understanding. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. I just want to be done with this, if possible. I have another job scheduled for tomorrow. I need to be able to work. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand. I'll do my best to be as efficient as possible. It won’t take long. I’m just going to have you lie down on your back on the examination table. First, I’ll gently palpate your spine to check for tenderness or muscle spasms. Then I'll assess your range of motion and check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds alright. I will lie down. Please be gentle. I am already in pain.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, Ms. Reihner, I’m just going to gently feel along your spine. Can you tell me if you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes… right there. That is… very tender. And a little to the left. It feels… tight. Not just painful, but constricted. It makes it difficult to breathe deeply.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness to palpation on the left side of your lower spine, with a feeling of tightness. Now, I'm going to gently bend your leg up towards your chest. Can you tell me if that causes any pain down your leg?
PATIENT: Yes! Down my left leg. The same pain. And a little tingling. Not as bad as when I’m moving, but it’s there. It’s… pulling. A pulling sensation. Like something is being stretched.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain radiating down your left leg with leg lift, accompanied by tingling and a pulling sensation. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. This will just involve a few simple movements. Please let me know if you feel any pain or weakness. Let's start with your left leg… Can you lift your leg while keeping it straight?
PATIENT: It is… difficult. I can lift it, but not very high. It feels… weak. It doesn’t want to go up. And it hurts a little to hold it there. It feels like it might give out.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness noted in left leg extension. Now, let’s try the same thing with your right leg... Can you lift that leg while keeping it straight?
PATIENT: That is… easy. No pain, no difficulty. I can hold it there for a long time. It is… strong. Much stronger than the other one. It feels… normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, full and pain-free range of motion in the right leg, with good strength. Alright, Ms. Reihner, you can sit up now. Based on the physical exam and your history, you have tenderness to palpation in your lower back, pain radiating down your left leg with straight leg raise, and weakness in your left leg extension. The reflexes are normal bilaterally. This is consistent with possible lumbar radiculopathy – meaning irritation of a nerve in your lower back. However, to get a more definitive diagnosis, I would like to order an X-ray of your lumbar spine to rule out any structural issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. If it will help to find out what is wrong, then yes. I just want to be able to work. What does this X-ray involve? Will it be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have another job scheduled for Monday.
DOCTOR: An X-ray is a very quick and painless procedure. You’ll simply stand or lie down while a machine takes a picture of your spine. There's no radiation exposure to worry about. The technician will position you and take a few images. It should take about 10-15 minutes. As for results, the radiologist typically reviews the images within 24-48 hours. I will review the report as soon as it is available and contact you to discuss the findings. If everything appears normal on the X-ray, we can discuss possible conservative treatments such as physical therapy and pain management. If the X-ray shows any abnormalities, we may need to consider further imaging like an MRI. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. 24 to 48 hours is… manageable. I will wait for your call. Please contact me as soon as possible. I would like to know what is wrong, and what I can do about it. What is the next step? Do I need to schedule another appointment?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The next step is to go down to the radiology department and have the X-ray taken. I'll have the receptionist schedule that for you now. It's located just down the hall to your left. They'll give you instructions on how to prepare, but generally, you don't need to do anything special. And yes, I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. That will be on August 9th, at 10:00 AM. Does that time work for you?
PATIENT: August 9th… yes, that should be… fine. As long as I know what is going on by then. Thank you, Doctor. I think… that is everything. May I go now? I have another job to consider.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You are welcome to go now, Ms. Reihner. The radiology department will contact you to confirm the appointment details. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And if your pain worsens significantly, or you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, please seek immediate medical attention. Here is the referral slip for the radiology department. I hope you feel better soon. Have a safe day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
