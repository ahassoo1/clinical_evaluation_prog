DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Yackey. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Perhaps you could begin by telling me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it's about a letter. A letter for… my pet. Yes, that’s it. A pet ownership letter. Honestly, the whole thing is a bit silly, but they need it, you know? For… somewhere. I can’t quite recall where exactly right now. It’s… important though. Very important.
DOCTOR: A letter… for your pet. I see. And what kind of pet are we discussing, Ms. Wrye?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A pet… hmm. It’s… fluffy. Definitely fluffy. And… it makes noises. Little chirping noises, I think. Or maybe it’s a squeak? I really can’t say for certain. It’s been with me a while now, you see. A long while. It’s just… one of those things. You wouldn’t understand unless you had one.
DOCTOR: Right. Fluffy… that makes noises. And you require documentation pertaining to its ownership. Is this for travel, perhaps?
PATIENT: Travel? Possibly. Yes, that rings a bell. Somewhere warm, I think. Or maybe it was… with someone? Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. It's a bit of a blur. They just said I needed a letter from a doctor, and well, here I am. Is that enough? I mean, do you need to know where, exactly? It's all very stressful, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, with all due respect, I require some information to fulfill your request. A doctor’s letter requires a legitimate medical basis. Is your pet experiencing a health concern that necessitates travel, or perhaps requires special accommodations?
PATIENT: Accommodations? Oh, goodness no. It's perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Runs around just fine. No, it's… well, it's more about me, actually. I need the letter to… prove I can handle it. To… someone. They don't think I'm responsible enough, you see. It's ridiculous, really. They just want to make things difficult. Honestly, it’s a whole mess.
DOCTOR: So, to clarify, Ms. Wrye, this letter is not for your pet’s wellbeing, but rather to demonstrate your capacity to care for it to an unspecified individual?
PATIENT: Exactly! You understand! Finally. Yes, that’s precisely it. They think I’m… scattered, you know? That I’ll forget to feed it or something. It’s insulting. I’ve had pets my whole life. Perfectly good, healthy pets! This one is just… smaller. And fluffier. But perfectly capable of being cared for, I assure you. Now, can you just write the letter? Please? It would really make things easier.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I am a physician. I provide medical care based on objective findings and established protocols. A letter attesting to your responsible pet ownership, based solely on your assertion, is… not within my professional purview. I can, however, offer a referral to a qualified mental health professional who could assess your concerns and potentially provide documentation. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: A mental health professional? Honestly, Doctor, that’s quite unnecessary! I’m perfectly fine. A bit forgetful, perhaps, but who isn’t these days? I just need a simple letter saying I’m capable of caring for a small, fluffy animal. Is that so much to ask? You’re a doctor, you write letters all the time! I’m sure you can just… make an exception. It's really just a formality.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration, but I must adhere to ethical medical standards. Providing documentation without a legitimate medical basis is irresponsible and could potentially be detrimental. I am unable to fulfill your request. I can, however, provide you with a list of local veterinarians who may be willing to write a letter confirming your pet's health and your ownership. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, pertaining to your health?
PATIENT: A veterinarian? Really? That’s absurd! I don’t need a vet to tell me I can care for a pet! Fine. This has been a complete waste of my time. I suppose I’ll just have to find another doctor. One with a little more… common sense. .
