DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. So, to start us off, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Petrimoulx. It nice to meet you as well. Well, is just... I been feeling very thirsty lately. And hungry too. More hungry than usual, you know? I eat a good meal and I still feel like I want more. Is very strange.
DOCTOR: That is unusual, Bianca. Increased thirst and hunger can certainly be concerning. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Is start maybe... about a month ago, I think? Not sure of the exact date, but around then. It start slow, just feeling a little more thirsty than normal. Then the hunger come along after that. I didn't think much of it at first, you know? Old age, I tell myself. But it getting worse now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. And you're right to seek it out if it's worsening. Has anything else changed along with the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Well... now that you ask... I been going to the bathroom more often. To pee, you know? Especially at night. I have to get up sometimes two, three times to go. Is really bothering my sleep, to be honest. And maybe... I feel a little tired too, but I always a little tired. Is hard to say if is different.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Increased urination, especially at night, along with the thirst, hunger, and fatigue… those symptoms together do point us in a certain direction. Before we jump to conclusions, I’d like to get a more complete picture. Do you have any vision changes – blurry vision, perhaps?
PATIENT: Vision changes? No, not that I notice. I does wear glasses for reading, you know, but I been wearing them for years. Is the same as always. Everything look clear enough. I haven't notice nothing different with my eyes. Should I be looking for something specific?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No, don’t worry about actively looking for anything specific right now. I just ask because sometimes changes in vision can be associated with what I’m considering. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… my husband, he does talk about that sometimes. He say I should watch my salt. But I never been told by a doctor I have it, you know? Diabetes… no, never. And heart problems… no. I feel my heart alright. Is beating steady. I does get a little breathless when I climb the stairs, but I always put that down to my weight. I always been a bigger woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No formal diagnosis of high blood pressure or diabetes. And you’ve noticed some breathlessness with exertion. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… years ago, when I was a young woman, I had my tonsils taken out. And I had a baby, of course! That was a hospital stay, but that was a long time ago now. No other surgeries, not that I can remember. And no other hospital stays, no. I mostly stay healthy, you know? I try to. Just this thirst and hunger is worrying me now. Is just not normal for me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No significant surgical history beyond tonsillectomy and childbirth. Let's move on to your family. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother... she had something with her sugar, I think. My husband, he does talk about it. She was always tired and thirsty, like me. And my brother... he had problems with his kidneys a few years back. He was always swelling up, I remember. But that was years ago now. Is he alright now, I don't really know. We don't see each other much. But yes, both of them had problems. You think that could be something?
DOCTOR: It certainly could be, Bianca. A family history of diabetes and kidney problems is important information. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't smoke. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don't drink alcohol either. My husband, he does have a little rum sometimes, but I don't. It never appealed to me, you know? I prefer a good cup of tea. And I eat pretty good, mostly. We eat a lot of fish and vegetables. My husband, he does like his doubles, but I try to keep it to a little bit.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and a generally healthy diet. Lastly, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I does take a little painkiller sometimes for my knees, when they acting up. Just paracetamol, you know? The regular kind. And I take a vitamin C tablet sometimes, but that’s about it. Nothing else. I don’t like taking too many pills, you know? I prefer to let my body do its own work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. That gives me a good overall picture. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a few other basic things. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s alright. You go ahead. I trust you. I want to find out what’s going on with this thirst and hunger, you know? Is just not right. I’m a little nervous, but I want to know. Go ahead and do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Your heart sounds normal, and your lungs are clear. I'm going to listen to your abdomen now. Do you have any pain or tenderness anywhere in your belly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. My belly is alright. Sometimes a little gassy, you know? But no pain. I does get a little bloated sometimes, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. Is probably just my eating habits, you know? I try to eat healthy, but sometimes I slip up.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. I’m going to check your feet now, just to look for any signs of nerve damage. Your pulses are present, but slightly diminished in your feet. And there's a little bit of reduced sensation here and here. It’s not alarming, but something to be aware of. Based on your symptoms – the increased thirst and hunger, frequent urination, family history, and the findings on the exam, I’m concerned about the possibility of diabetes. However, we need to run some tests to confirm that. I want to order a blood sugar test, a kidney function test, and a urine test. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Diabetes… oh dear. My mother… you think so? Yes, Doctor, please do the tests. I want to know for sure. Is better to know, you know? If is diabetes, I want to get it under control. My mother... she didn't know early enough. Yes, please do the tests. What do I need to do? Do I need to fast? Or can I eat something before? I does get a little shaky when I don’t eat.
DOCTOR: You're right, it’s always better to know. And yes, your mother’s experience is something to keep in mind. For the blood sugar test, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand. So, no food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. You can drink water, of course. The kidney function test and urine test don't require fasting. The lab is just down the hall. They'll draw a small amount of blood and collect a urine sample. It shouldn’t take long. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. I'll have the lab technician explain everything to you before they begin. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Eight hours… hmm, that will be hard. I does get hungry very easily, you know? But I will do it. I will try my best. Water is alright. And the other tests don’t need fasting? That’s good. Just… if is diabetes, is it… bad? Can it be cured? And what happens if it runs in the family? Will my husband get it too? He does like his sweets, you know. He worries about me. He’ll want to know all this. Is a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid and important questions, Bianca. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let’s address them one by one. Diabetes is a chronic condition, meaning it requires ongoing management, but it is not necessarily a “bad” condition. With proper diet, exercise, and sometimes medication, many people live long and healthy lives with diabetes. As for a cure, there isn’t currently a definitive cure for type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form. However, in some cases, people can achieve remission through significant lifestyle changes. Regarding your husband, having a family history does increase his risk, but it doesn’t guarantee he’ll develop diabetes. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, and getting regular exercise are important for everyone, but especially those with a family history. We can discuss screening tests for him if you'd like. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action for you. I’ll explain everything in detail, and we’ll make a plan together. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better, Doctor. Thank you. Knowing we have a plan… is good. Yes, please, let’s get the tests done. And maybe… maybe we can talk about my husband later? So, I just go down the hall to the lab? And they will tell me what to do? Is that right? I don't want to go to the wrong place. I does get a little confused sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. You just go down the hall to the lab. They’ll have your order form – I’ve already sent it over electronically. They’ll explain everything to you step-by-step. The receptionist there can direct you. Don’t worry about getting confused, they are very helpful. Here, I’ve written down the lab address and phone number, just in case. And my name and number are on the form as well, so you can reach out if you have any questions afterwards. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it. I'll be here when you get back, and we'll discuss the results as soon as they are available. Is there anything else I can do for you right now before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly. You have been very kind. I feel a little less worried now. I will go to the lab now. And I will call you if I have any problems. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bianca. I’m glad I could help ease your worries. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. I’ll see you soon.
