DOCTOR: Right. Terasa MayHugh, 59 years old. Well, let's get down to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s my ears, mostly. They… well, they go funny sometimes. And I get really dizzy. It’s… hard to explain. It comes and goes, you see. And my daughter, bless her, she said I should come in because… well, my husband, he used to get something similar. It's been a while though, I can't quite remember when it started.
DOCTOR: “Funny” how?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s like… everything gets muffled, like someone turned the volume down real low. And then… a rushing sound, like water. Not in my ear, but… around it? And then the dizziness. Not all the time, thank goodness. It feels like the room is spinning, or I'm spinning. It only lasts a little while, usually. A few minutes, maybe an hour. I just… get very unsteady. It's unsettling, you know? It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes. Right. So muffled hearing and a rushing sound with dizziness. And you said this comes and goes… can you recall anything that triggers it?
PATIENT: Triggers? Oh, dear… not really. I haven’t noticed anything specific. Sometimes it happens when I'm bending over, I think. But not always. And… sometimes when I'm just sitting, quiet as a mouse. It's very unpredictable, honestly. I wish I could tell you what sets it off, but… my memory isn’t what it used to be. I do spend a bit of time at the club… the gambling club, you know. But I don't think that has anything to do with it. It's just… a place to be, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Bending over, you say. And you spend time at a club. Alright. Let’s get a basic exam done. I need to look in your ears, check your balance, and maybe a quick check of your blood pressure. It's probably nothing, but we need to rule things out. Sit up straight, please.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you think is best, dear. Sit up straight… yes, I can do that. Just… take your time, won’t you? I don't like surprises. And… is it going to be uncomfortable? I do worry a bit easily.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be. The ear check is quick. I’ll be gentle. Just need to see if there’s any wax buildup or anything obvious. Open wide… and look slightly up. Hmm… a little cerumen, but nothing significant. Now the right ear… Yes. And the eardrums look… normal. No obvious signs of infection. Let's check your balance now.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Normal is good, isn't it? Balance… alright. What do you need me to do for the balance test? I’m not very steady on my feet as it is, you know. I don't want to fall over and make a mess.
DOCTOR: It’s simple. I need you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Try to maintain your balance for about 30 seconds. I’ll be right here to catch you if needed. It's just to see if you have any issues with your inner ear. Don't worry, I’m here. Ready?
PATIENT: Oh… close my eyes? That sounds… precarious. But alright, if you say so. I'm not very good at this, I warn you. Just… be quick, please? And… are you sure you'll catch me?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, that’s enough. Yes, you do have some balance issues. Definitely. And it seems worse with your eyes closed. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, 145/90. Now, given your history, the dizziness, and balance problems… it could be something simple like benign positional vertigo, or a touch of Meniere’s disease. But we need to rule out other things. I'm going to order a basic blood work panel, and I think you should get an MRI to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. MRI? That sounds… frightening. And Meniere’s… is that… bad? All this is a bit much, dear. Blood work, I can manage, I suppose. But an MRI… what exactly are you looking for? And is this going to be expensive? My insurance… it’s just Medicare, you see.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. MayHugh, an MRI is a precaution. We need to see if there's anything affecting your inner ear, or your brain. It's a simple scan, you lie still for about 30 minutes. As for Meniere's, it’s a disorder of the inner ear that causes episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. It's manageable with medication and lifestyle changes, but we need a diagnosis first. As for cost... Medicare should cover most of it, but you'll need to check your coverage details. I'll have the receptionist send you a referral and information on scheduling the MRI. I’ll also prescribe some meclizine for the dizziness in the meantime. Now, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. Um… let me think. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything now… unless you count dust, maybe. I do sneeze a bit when I’m cleaning. But nothing serious. And meclizine… is that… a strong medication? Will it make me sleepy? I have a bit of a mahjong game on Friday… .
DOCTOR: Meclizine is an antihistamine; it can cause drowsiness. Start with half a tablet and see how you feel. If it makes you too sleepy, skip it. Avoid driving if you’re feeling drowsy, of course. Alright, that’s all for now. The receptionist will schedule your MRI and give you the prescription. And try to get some rest, Mrs. MayHugh. .
