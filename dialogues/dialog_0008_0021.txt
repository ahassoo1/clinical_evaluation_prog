DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascandola. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s my foot, see? It’s been swelling up something fierce. Mostly just the one, the left one. It started a few days ago, I think… maybe Tuesday? It's hard to keep track, honestly. It hurts to walk on it, especially first thing in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Swelling in your left foot, started a few days ago, worse in the mornings. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. Can you tell me a bit more about the pain?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… ache, deep inside. Like a bruise, but… bigger. And it feels warm to the touch, if that makes sense. I haven't noticed any cuts or anything, though. Just puffy and sore. I did twist it a bit last week, getting out of the car, but I didn't think much of it at the time. I figured it would just go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, an ache, warm to the touch, no cuts, and you twisted it last week. Did you hear a pop or feel any instability when you twisted it?
PATIENT: No pop, no. It just… felt a bit funny when I stepped down. Like it wanted to give way, but it didn't. I just kinda wobbled for a second, then got myself steady. I walked it off, and like I said, didn't think much of it. I've always been pretty good at ignoring pain, to be honest. My mother used to say I had a high tolerance, haha. But this swelling… this is different. It’s not going away.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no instability, just a funny feeling when you stepped down. And the swelling is persistent. Have you noticed any redness, or has the pain spread anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm… redness, let me think. Yeah, actually, now that you mention it, it’s a little reddish around the ankle bone. Not bright red, but… a bit flushed, maybe? And the pain… it’s not spreading exactly, but it feels like it’s going up my calf a little bit now. Just a dull ache, not anything terrible. Is that bad? I haven’t done anything to make it worse, I don't think. Just walking, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, redness around the ankle and a dull ache going up your calf. That's helpful. Let’s check your medical history quickly. Do you have any known medical conditions like diabetes, heart problems, or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I watch my salt, try to eat my vegetables… you know. My biggest problem is probably just being on my feet too much. I’m a loan interviewer, so I spend a lot of time visiting people. That can be rough. And I haven’t seen a doctor in… well, a long time. I usually just try to tough things out. I don't have insurance, so… it’s expensive.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, and you're on your feet a lot for work, which could be contributing to this. No insurance, I understand. Alright, Mr. Parascandola, I’d like to take a look at your foot and ankle. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to be able to walk without feeling like I’m going to fall over. It hurts a bit even just resting it, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, let’s start with range of motion. Can you point your toes up and down for me?
PATIENT: Like this? It's a bit stiff... and it hurts a little going down. Feels… tighter than it should, I guess. And when you touch right here ...that's where it really bothers me. Sharp pain for a second, then just the ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion, tightness, and pain with palpation on the inner side of the ankle. I’m checking your pulses now… good, strong pulse here. There’s definitely some swelling around the medial malleolus – that's the bony part on the inside of your ankle. And it is warm to the touch, as you mentioned. I'm also noticing some slight discoloration, a bit of bruising starting to develop. Based on what I’m seeing and hearing, it sounds like you may have a sprained ankle, possibly with some early signs of a developing hematoma – that's a collection of blood under the skin. It’s hard to say for sure without an X-ray, but given the history of the twist and the location of the pain, that's my initial thought.
PATIENT: A sprain, huh? That doesn’t sound too bad, does it? I’ve sprained a wrist before, playing soccer when I was a kid. It just needed a wrap and some rest, right? Will I need one of those… cast things? I really can't afford to be off my feet for too long. I have bills to pay. Is an X-ray expensive? I really don’t have a lot of money.
DOCTOR: It’s good you have some experience with sprains, but ankle sprains can be a little different. It could be a simple sprain, but given the swelling, warmth, and the fact that it's been a few days without significant improvement, I’m a little concerned about a possible fracture or a more severe ligament injury. An X-ray would help rule those things out. As for cost… they can be expensive, you are right. Let me see if I can find a facility that offers a reduced rate or financial assistance for patients without insurance. In the meantime, we can start with the RICE protocol: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. That will help reduce the swelling and pain. I'm going to recommend limiting weight-bearing on the foot as much as possible for the next 24-48 hours. Do you have access to crutches or a cane?
PATIENT: RICE… I think I remember that. My mother used to do that for my knees. I don't have crutches, no. Or a cane. I have some bandages, I guess. And ice… yes, I can do ice. What about work? I need to go to work. People are counting on me. Can I just wrap it really tight and keep going? Is that a bad idea? I really don’t want to lose my job over this.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's address that. Continuing to work on it like this, especially if it's a more significant injury, could actually delay healing and potentially make things worse. You could risk further damaging the ligaments or even causing a more serious complication. I understand needing to work, but protecting your foot now is important. We need to figure out a way to at least reduce your workload for a few days. As for a cane, I can write you a prescription for one. They’re relatively inexpensive. And I'll try my best to find an X-ray facility with a lower cost or payment plan. Let me see if I can locate a local community clinic that might offer financial assistance. In the meantime, let's get you started with the RICE protocol. I’ll also write you a note for your employer explaining that you've been evaluated for a foot injury and are advised to limit weight-bearing. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds better, yes. A note for work would be good. And a prescription for a cane… maybe I can manage with that. I really appreciate you trying to help. It’s just… hard when you don’t have money. Everything is so expensive. Okay, RICE and the note. And you’ll try to find a cheaper X-ray place? Can you tell me a bit more about how to do the RICE thing properly? I don't want to mess it up. And how long do I usually ice it for? My mother always said “until it goes numb,” but that doesn’t sound right.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, and I understand your concerns. It is hard. Okay, let’s go over the RICE protocol step-by-step. R - Rest: Avoid putting any weight on the foot as much as possible. That means no standing for long periods, no walking long distances, and definitely no running or jumping. I - Ice: Apply an ice pack – you can use a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel – to the injured area for 20 minutes at a time, every 2-3 hours. Don’t apply ice directly to the skin, as that can cause frostbite. And you’re right, “until it goes numb” isn't the best approach. You want to feel cold, but not a burning or painful cold. C - Compression: Wrap the foot and ankle with an elastic bandage – like an ACE bandage – to help reduce swelling. Make sure it’s snug, but not too tight. You should be able to slip a finger comfortably under the bandage. If your foot starts to feel numb, tingling, or excessively cold, loosen the bandage immediately. E - Elevation: Elevate your foot above your heart as much as possible, especially when you’re resting. This helps to reduce swelling by allowing fluid to drain away from the injured area. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a lot more sense. 20 minutes, not until numb. And make sure the bandage isn’t too tight. Elevate it… I can do that. I think I can manage that. What about pain? It hurts even when I'm just sitting here. Can I take something for the pain? I don’t have anything fancy, just some old ibuprofen. Is that okay? And will that interfere with anything else? I’m not on any regular medications, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. You’re doing well to remember all of that. As for pain, ibuprofen is fine to take. It’s an NSAID – a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug – and it can help reduce both pain and swelling. Follow the dosage instructions on the bottle – usually it’s 200-400mg every 4-6 hours as needed, but check the label to be sure. Since you’re not on any other medications, there shouldn’t be any interactions. However, if you have any history of stomach ulcers, kidney problems, or heart issues, you should talk to a pharmacist before taking it. And don’t take it on an empty stomach, as it can cause upset. I’m going to write you a prescription for a cane, and a note for work. I will also write down the instructions for RICE, and the cane. Here you go. I’ll also try to locate some lower cost X-ray options for you, and get back to you later today. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. The cane and the note… and you’ll look for cheaper X-rays. That’s very kind of you, Doctor. I really appreciate it. I hope it’s not too bad. I just want to be able to get back to work. Thank you again, Doctor Cumper. I’ll try my best to follow your instructions.
