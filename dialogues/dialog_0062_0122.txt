DOCTOR: Hi Venus, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, precisely. I am noticing…lapses. Small things, mostly. But they are becoming more frequent, and my blood pressure is…high, they tell me. I want to be sure everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus, that’s perfectly alright. It’s good you're getting it checked out. “Lapses” – can you tell me more about those?
PATIENT: Yes. Well… yesterday, for example. I went to the market for apples. Green apples, specifically. But when I returned home… I had oranges. Not a large amount, but…oranges. And the name of the baker… the one I see every week…it was…gone. Just…empty space where his name should be. Things like that. Small things, but unsettling. It is not…a complete forgetting, you understand. More like…a difficulty to find the right word, or the right… recollection.
DOCTOR: That does sound unsettling, Venus. It’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. So, these lapses – are they happening every day?
PATIENT: Not every day, no. Perhaps…three or four times a week? It is hard to say for certain. Some days, I feel perfectly clear. Others…it is like a fog. A very thin fog, but…present. And they seem to be more frequent when I am… tired, perhaps? Or stressed. It is difficult to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you mentioned your blood pressure is high. Do you know what your readings have been, or where they were taken?
PATIENT: Yes. My neighbor, Mrs. Petrova, she is a nurse. She checks it. Usually, it is…above 140, I think. Sometimes higher. She says I should see a doctor, which is why I am here, of course. I do not always remember to take the pills she gives me, I confess. Small pills, white. I… misplace them sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venus. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like we need to get a better handle on your blood pressure and explore what might be causing these lapses in memory. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes. When I was younger… many years ago… I had pneumonia. A very bad case. And…my husband, God rest his soul, he passed away five years ago from heart trouble. Otherwise… nothing significant, I believe. I have always been… relatively healthy, despite the high blood pressure recently. Just…the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia and your husband’s heart trouble – thank you. Any surgeries or hospitalizations, besides the pneumonia?
PATIENT: No. No surgeries. The pneumonia, I was in the hospital for perhaps a week. A long time ago, as I said. Everything else… I have been fortunate. Mostly just… doctor visits for check-ups, and now this. I do not like hospitals. They are… unsettling places.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll try to keep things as brief and comfortable as possible today. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Yes… my mother, she suffered from… what did they call it?…hardening of the arteries, I believe. And my grandfather, on my father's side, he had… something with his mind. He would… forget things. More than just the usual forgetting, you understand. It became quite bad towards the end. I believe it was… the family spoke of it in whispers. It was… a difficult subject.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Venus. That’s important information. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies, thankfully. I eat almost anything. I am not a…fussy eater. I take the pills Mrs. Petrova gives me, when I remember, without any… reaction. Just… sometimes I forget to take them at all. It is… embarrassing to admit.
DOCTOR: No need to be embarrassed, Venus. It happens. Okay, and lastly, are you currently taking any other medications or supplements besides the pills from Mrs. Petrova?
PATIENT: No… nothing else. Just those pills. Sometimes, I drink chamomile tea before bed, if I am feeling… anxious. But that is not a… medication, you understand. Just tea. And I take a multivitamin, occasionally. But I forget most of the time. I really try to remember the pills, though. Mrs. Petrova is very kind, and I do not want to waste her time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venus, thank you for sharing all of that with me. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes… alright. But please, be gentle. I do not… enjoy doctors poking and prodding. And… if I become dizzy, please tell me immediately. I have… a tendency to faint, sometimes. It is… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Venus. We'll take things slowly and gently. I’ll make sure you're comfortable the entire time. And please, tell me immediately if you feel dizzy or unwell. Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated – 152/88 on your right arm and 150/90 on your left. We'll need to keep a closer eye on that. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Your lungs are clear. Your reflexes are a little diminished, and your balance seems a bit unsteady. Now, I’m going to ask you to remember three words… apple, table, and penny. Can you repeat those back to me after I say a few other things?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. I… I believe I can remember them. Though… they seem to be… fading already. It is… unsettling. What did you say? You asked me something, did you not?
DOCTOR: Yes, Venus, I asked you to repeat the three words I just gave you - apple, table, and penny. You remembered them initially, but you’re having some difficulty recalling them now?
PATIENT: Yes… I know I heard them. Apple… something… a wooden thing… and… a small coin? It is… on the tip of my tongue. I feel… frustrated. They are gone. I cannot… I cannot recall them. It is… quite dreadful. What were they again? Perhaps if you tell me…
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Venus. Don’t worry about it. It's just a simple memory test. The words were apple, table, and penny. We’ll repeat it later. Okay, given your history, the lapses in memory, your slightly unsteady balance, and your elevated blood pressure, I think it’s important to run a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin B12 level. I also want to order an MRI of your brain, just to rule out anything structural. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An… MRI? That sounds… invasive. And… expensive, perhaps? I… I do not have much money, you understand. And I dislike… enclosed spaces. But… if you think it is necessary… alright. Do what you think is best. But please, tell me… is it serious? What are you looking for? I do not want to worry unnecessarily. I… I have been through enough stress lately.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Venus. An MRI is non-invasive – it uses magnets and radio waves, not surgery. It's the best way to get a clear picture of your brain and rule out any underlying issues. And you're right to ask about cost. We can discuss options for financial assistance with the imaging. I'll have my office staff help you with that. As for what we're looking for, we want to rule out things like small strokes, tumors, or areas of inflammation that could be affecting your memory and balance. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s best to be thorough. I also want to start you on a low-dose blood pressure medication. We’ll start with something gentle, and monitor your blood pressure closely. I’ll write you a prescription for lisinopril 10mg daily. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… alright. If you think it is necessary. And thank you for helping with the cost of the… the MRI. It is a great weight off my mind. I… I do not like being a burden. But… what if it is something serious? What then? I… I do not want to think about that. But I must be prepared. Please, be honest with me, Doctor. Do not sugarcoat it. I would rather know the truth, however unpleasant. I… I have lived a long life, but I still wish to… understand what is happening to me.
DOCTOR: Venus, that’s a very reasonable request, and I appreciate your honesty. If the MRI reveals something concerning, we’ll discuss all of your options in detail. It could be something manageable, like small vessel disease, which we can treat with medication and lifestyle changes. In some cases, it could be something more serious, but we’ll cross that bridge if and when we come to it. Right now, it’s important to focus on getting these tests done so we can have a clear understanding of what's going on. I want to reassure you that we'll work through this together, step-by-step. And I'll be here to answer any questions you have along the way. For now, let’s focus on getting you scheduled for those tests. My staff will call you tomorrow with details on the MRI and blood work appointments. They’ll also help you with the financial assistance options. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No… I believe that is all. You have answered my questions, Doctor. And… I appreciate your kindness. It is… reassuring to speak with someone who listens. Tell me… how long will it take to get the results of these tests? And… will I need someone to accompany me to the MRI? I… I do not drive anymore, and I do worry about feeling… anxious in the machine.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Venus. The blood work results should be back within a few days. The MRI results typically take a little longer, about a week or so, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. My staff will contact you as soon as they’re available. And yes, I strongly recommend having someone accompany you to the MRI, especially given your anxiety. It's always helpful to have someone there for support. They’ll also be able to drive you home afterward. Here's a prescription for the lisinopril. Start taking one tablet daily, and let me know if you experience any side effects, like dizziness or a persistent cough. It was a pleasure meeting you, Venus. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get through this together.
