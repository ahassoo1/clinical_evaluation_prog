DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get this over with. I've been feeling… tired. Really tired. And it's not just normal tired, you know? It's like… bone-deep. And I have this… craving. It's embarrassing, honestly. I keep wanting to eat dirt. Not like, a little bit. A lot. And it makes me feel awful afterwards, but I can’t stop. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tiredness, and… a craving for dirt. It’s alright, no need to be embarrassed; we’re here to figure things out together. It's good you're telling me everything. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's been creeping up for months, maybe even longer. It’s hard to say exactly. At first, I just thought I was getting old. You know, slowing down. But it's gotten worse lately. Like, I used to be able to get everything done around the house, and now… now I just want to nap all the time. And the dirt thing… that started a few weeks ago, I guess. It’s disgusting, really. I don't even like dirt.
DOCTOR: It sounds very frustrating, and you're right to want to get to the bottom of this. It's good you're paying attention to these changes. When you say "tiredness," can you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I'm just sleepy, alright? It's… everything feels heavy. Like my arms and legs are filled with cement. And I have no energy. I can barely get up the stairs without having to stop and catch my breath. It's not like I've been doing anything strenuous, either! Just normal things. And even after a full night's sleep, I wake up feeling just as exhausted as when I went to bed. Honestly, it's ridiculous. I used to be so… vital.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy limbs, exhaustion even with sleep, difficulty with stairs… that gives me a better picture. And you mentioned this started gradually. Have you noticed anything else alongside the tiredness and the craving?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Well, I haven’t been eating much, if that matters. Everything just tastes… bland. Like cardboard. And I’ve been a bit… forgetful, I suppose. Though, at my age, who isn’t forgetful? It's probably just old age. I keep misplacing things, and sometimes I struggle to remember names. Nothing major, though. And I've felt a little… off, you know? Like I'm walking in a fog. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, loss of appetite, food tasting bland, some forgetfulness, and feeling “foggy.” Those are all important things to mention. Thank you for sharing all of that. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Ugh, are you serious? We’re going there now? Look, I don’t discuss my… bathroom habits with strangers. It’s just… inappropriate. And frankly, what does that even have to do with wanting to eat dirt?
DOCTOR: I apologize, Candis. You are absolutely right to be uncomfortable. It's a standard question, and I understand it feels intrusive. It’s simply to rule out potential causes, and I won’t press it if you’d rather not discuss it. Let’s move on. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Fine. No, I don't have any pain, alright? Just this… overwhelming tiredness and this ridiculous craving. Honestly, I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask? I used to be so independent, and now… now I feel like a useless old woman.
DOCTOR: It's not too much to ask at all, Candis. And you are not useless. It sounds like this is really impacting your quality of life, and we'll do our best to figure out what's going on. I'm going to ask about your medical history now, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had a bad case of the flu when I was younger, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. And my blood pressure is a little high, the doctor told me, but I don’t take anything for it. I try to watch my salt intake. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy years ago, maybe 30 years ago. That’s about it, I think. Honestly, I don’t go to the doctor much. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, hysterectomy. And you don’t take any medication for the blood pressure currently. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I can eat anything, touch anything, do anything. Except, apparently, not get tired all the time. And stop craving dirt. Honestly, it’s just… bizarre. I feel like something is seriously wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history? Honestly, I barely know my family. My parents are gone, and I don't have any siblings. I had an aunt who… well, she was a bit… eccentric. Spent most of her life in a mental hospital, if that counts. And my grandfather… he died of something, I think. Old age, probably. I honestly don’t pay much attention to that sort of thing. It’s depressing.
DOCTOR: Okay, an aunt with a history of mental illness, grandfather died of unspecified causes. Thank you. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t had a drink in… well, decades. Not my thing. I used to work as a physical therapist aide, so I always took care of myself. Healthy diet, plenty of exercise… until recently, of course. Now, I mostly just nap. And crave dirt. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a crazy person.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol. You used to be physically active, but less so recently. It doesn't sound like you're acting crazy at all, Candis. These symptoms are concerning, and we need to investigate them further. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to check your vital signs and look for any obvious physical causes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Honestly, the longer I’m here, the more tired I get. And the more I want to eat dirt. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll take a look in your ears and throat. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. Lungs are clear, but you are breathing a bit shallowly. Blood pressure is a bit elevated – 140 over 90. Pulse is 88. Ears are clear. Throat looks a little dry, but otherwise normal. I’m going to check your reflexes now… Reflexes are a bit diminished. And your hands… I notice some slight pallor. I’m going to order some blood work, Candis. This will help us to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms, such as anemia, vitamin deficiencies, or thyroid issues. I also want to check your iron levels and a complete blood count. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood work? Of course. Why not? Everything takes forever. And it's probably just old age anyway. Honestly, I just want to go home and take a nap. And maybe… just maybe… find a little bit of dirt to eat. Don't judge me. .
DOCTOR: No judgement at all, Candis. We're just trying to figure out what's going on. I'll have the lab technician draw a few vials of blood. It shouldn’t take long. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a referral to a hematologist. They specialize in blood disorders and can help us to interpret the results and determine the best course of treatment.
