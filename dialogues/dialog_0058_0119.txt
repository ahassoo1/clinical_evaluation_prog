DOCTOR: Alright, Jinnie, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s a rather delicate matter. And frankly, I’m not entirely sure why I even have to be here. It's about… a problem with my… companion. A gentleman friend, you see. He’s experiencing… a discharge. It’s most unpleasant.
DOCTOR: A discharge, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. A most… unusual discharge. Not something one expects, certainly. And rather… concerning. He’s a respectable man, you understand. This simply isn't becoming. I assumed it was… a temporary ailment, but it persists. Frankly, it’s quite embarrassing for both of us.
DOCTOR: Right. And this gentleman friend… is this a recent development, or has this been ongoing for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started, oh, perhaps a month ago? Maybe a little longer. It wasn't immediately noticeable, you understand. Just… a slight dampness. But it has become… more pronounced lately. It’s truly distressing. And I do wish he’d be more forthcoming about these things, but men… well, you know how they are. They bury their heads in the sand.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what does this discharge look like?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, must we be so graphic? It’s… yellowish. And rather thick. Not… clear, certainly. And there’s a… a rather unpleasant odour. I attempted to inquire, but he dismissed it as simply… a bit of perspiration. Honestly, the man has no sense. It’s not perspiration, Doctor, I assure you! It’s… something else.
DOCTOR: Right. And is he experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, he has been a bit… irritable lately. More so than usual. Complaining of a slight… burning sensation, he said. Though he didn’t elaborate. And perhaps a bit of discomfort when… well, when he is… active. But he attributes that to his age, naturally. Men are always blaming their age. It’s simply ridiculous. I do believe that’s all. Though he has been avoiding… certain intimacies. Which, frankly, is rather rude.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how old is this gentleman friend, Jinnie?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, he’s… a bit older than myself. Let me see… he turned sixty-two just last month. Though he insists he feels much younger, naturally. Most men do. He’s… a retired accountant. Very particular about his appearance, you see. Always well-groomed. It’s simply unfathomable that he’d be suffering from… this. It just doesn’t seem… right.
DOCTOR: Alright. Jinnie, I’m going to need to ask some potentially embarrassing questions, but it’s important for me to get a full picture. Is he sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh, my! Doctor, really! Is that necessary? Well… yes. Of course. He’s a… a gentleman. But I assure you, it's perfectly… discreet. It's not as though we are… flaunting it. It’s a private matter. I simply came because… well, the discharge is most concerning. It’s simply not hygienic, you see. I hardly think the details of his… activities are relevant.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Jinnie. And has he had any previous sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness! Doctor, you are asking quite personal questions! I should hope not! He is a respectable man! I have never… I would never… The very idea! He would never engage in such… behavior! Honestly, I’m beginning to question the discretion of this office. It’s simply… appalling. Are you suggesting… something untoward? I find that terribly offensive! .
DOCTOR: Jinnie, with all due respect, I need accurate information to help him. If you are unwilling to provide it, I can't assist you. And frankly, I'm starting to suspect this "discharge" is a symptom of something we need to address seriously. Perhaps a referral to a urologist would be the best course of action if you're not comfortable discussing this further.
