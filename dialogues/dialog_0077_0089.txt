DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Glymph. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. Um… let me see. It’s this pain, really. Down low. My abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it’s… well, quite severe. I believe that's what prompted the visit. I apologize if I'm being vague; things haven’t been entirely clear lately. I think it has something to do with the… the lupus? That’s what they told me, years ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, lupus. I see. And how long has this abdominal pain been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. It feels like it waxes and wanes, you see. I’ve had… flare-ups, I suppose they called them, for many years. But this recent bout… it started a few weeks ago, I believe. Perhaps a month? It's hard to pinpoint. It’s more frequent, and… sharper, than I recall previous episodes being. Does that make any sense? I truly apologize for my… lack of precision.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Glymph. It’s perfectly understandable to have difficulty recalling exact timelines, especially with chronic conditions. So, a month or so of increased frequency and sharpness… And where specifically in your abdomen are you feeling this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you to say. Um… let me see… It’s… lower down, of course. On both sides, actually. But more pronounced on the… right side, I think. Not a stabbing pain, exactly. More of a… deep ache? And sometimes, it feels like cramping. Yes, that’s a good way to describe it – cramping. And it seems to come and go in waves. It isn’t constant, thankfully. But when it’s present… it’s quite debilitating. I find myself… lying still, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower abdomen, bilateral but more prominent on the right, described as a deep ache with cramping in waves. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes, or anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s another good question. Triggers… I haven’t been very diligent in tracking, I confess. Though, I do believe stress exacerbates it. When I’m feeling… overwhelmed, it tends to flare up. And… yes. Large meals. Definitely large meals. I’ve found I need to eat smaller portions, and more frequently, if I want to avoid discomfort. As for things that make it better… warmth, I suppose. A warm bath usually provides some relief. And… lying very still, as I mentioned before. Perhaps a heating pad? I can’t say for certain, it’s all rather… muddled in my memory.
DOCTOR: Alright, stress and large meals seem to be contributing factors, and warmth provides some relief. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it… I have been rather fatigued, lately. More so than usual. And… occasionally, I experience a bit of nausea. Not vomiting, thankfully. But a queasy feeling, particularly after eating. And… let me think… My bowel movements haven’t been… regular, shall we say? Sometimes constipated, sometimes… not. It’s rather unpredictable. And… I think I’ve had a low-grade fever, on and off. Though, I could be mistaken. I’ve been feeling rather warm, generally, but I haven't taken my temperature recently.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, nausea, irregular bowel movements, and possible low-grade fever… Thank you, Ms. Glymph, that's helpful. Now, regarding your lupus… Do you currently take any medications for it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I do. Let me see… I take… hydroxychloroquine, I believe. A small white pill. And… occasionally, prednisone, when I’m having a particularly bad flare-up. Though, I haven’t taken it in a few weeks, thankfully. And… oh dear. There’s another one… a pain reliever. Something for the aches and pains. I apologize, Doctor. My memory is truly failing me. I rely on my daughter to manage most of my medications, and I don’t always pay close attention to the names. I believe it’s… a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory. But I couldn’t say for certain.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Glymph. We can certainly verify everything with your daughter. So, hydroxychloroquine regularly, and prednisone as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else, that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That would be wonderful, thank you. Let me think... Allergies... No, I don’t believe so. Not to medications, at least. I do have a slight sensitivity to… certain fragrances. They can sometimes give me a headache, but it’s not a serious allergy, thankfully. And… oh, yes. Shellfish. I’m allergic to shellfish. It causes a rash, and… some difficulty breathing. But that’s not relevant to this, I suppose. No medication allergies, as far as I know. I haven’t had any adverse reactions in the past. Though, I do apologize if I'm being vague. It has been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your abdomen, and feel for any tenderness. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary. I hope you don’t mind my asking… what are you looking for, specifically? Just so I know what to expect. I'm not trying to interfere, truly, but I always feel better when I understand what's happening.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Glymph, that's a perfectly reasonable question. I’m listening for any unusual sounds in your abdomen, and gently palpating to assess for tenderness, guarding, or masses. I'll be checking for any areas that feel particularly painful to the touch. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know immediately if anything does cause you pain. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… reassuring, actually. Thank you for explaining. And thank you for being so considerate. Please, proceed at your own pace. And I will certainly let you know if anything is uncomfortable. I truly appreciate your kindness, Doctor. This is… a bit overwhelming, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. I’m listening to your abdomen now… and gently pressing. I’m noticing some mild tenderness in your right lower quadrant, but nothing alarming. Your bowel sounds are a little quieter than usual. No significant masses detected. Do you feel any pain specifically when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… that is… a little tender, actually. Not excruciating, but… definitely noticeable. It's a dull ache, really. It feels… similar to the pain I’ve been describing. Perhaps a little sharper, now that you're pressing. Is that… concerning? I apologize for being so anxious. I tend to worry.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Glymph, it’s perfectly normal to be anxious. It’s good you're letting me know. The tenderness is mild, and it's not a sharp, sudden pain, which is reassuring. However, given your history of lupus and the abdominal pain, we need to investigate further. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood work and a urine analysis. The blood work will check for inflammation, infection, and kidney function. The urine analysis will rule out a urinary tract infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Absolutely, please do. Anything that might help pinpoint the cause, I am happy to do. Blood work and a urine analysis… Yes. It's just… what if it's something serious? I know I shouldn't worry prematurely, but it’s difficult not to.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Glymph. It's natural to worry when you're experiencing pain and don't know the cause. However, we're going to take things one step at a time. The blood work and urine analysis will give us a lot more information to work with. The lab technician will come up shortly to draw the blood. The urine sample can be collected in the restroom. I’ll also order a pelvic exam to rule out any gynecological causes for your pain. We'll review the results as soon as they're available, and discuss the next steps. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… a pelvic exam… Yes, I suppose so. I hadn’t considered that. It's… not my favorite, but I understand it’s thorough. A pelvic exam, in addition to the blood work and urine analysis… Yes, Doctor, that sounds acceptable. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for your patience. I truly appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I'll have the nurse come in to collect your sample and draw your blood. I will also schedule you for the pelvic exam. While we wait for the results, it's important to stay hydrated and avoid any strenuous activity. Please contact the office immediately if you experience a fever, severe pain, nausea, or vomiting. I'll be back to discuss the results as soon as they're available. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. I believe that’s everything for now. I’ll remember to stay hydrated, and I'll contact the office if anything changes. Thank you again for your kindness and thoroughness. I truly appreciate it.
