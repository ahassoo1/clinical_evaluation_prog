DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Teretha. Well, it’s my hands, mostly. They’ve been… tingling. Like little pins and needles. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s starting to bother me when I’m sorting mail. I gotta get this sorted, you know? Long days at the post office.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Tingling, you say. And it interferes with your work at the post office?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. Especially with the smaller letters and packages. Makes it hard to feel what I’m holding, if that makes sense. Dropped a few things here and there, nothing major, but… it’s worrying me. I need my hands for my job, you know? And…well, I don't have insurance, so I try to ignore things as long as I can.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Teretha. Dropping things is…unfortunate. And the lack of insurance is…a complication. Now, can you describe where exactly you feel this tingling?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my fingers and thumbs, both hands. And sometimes it goes up my arms a little, but not usually. It’s not constant, it comes and goes. Worse when I’m using my hands a lot, like sorting through the mail. It’s… hard to explain. Just a funny feeling. Not painful, just…tingly. Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as bad. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: A vague comparison, but I suppose so. And how long has this been going on, Teretha?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started… maybe six, seven months ago? It was just a little thing at first, I didn't pay much attention to it. Thought it was just my hands getting tired. But it’s been getting worse lately, that’s why I finally came in. I really don't like complaining, you know? Always been one to just push through things. But it’s starting to feel… constant sometimes. And it worries me.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed anything else accompanying this tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Sometimes my hands feel a little weak, but I just figured that was from all the work. Maybe a little stiff in the mornings, but that's just getting old, right? I haven't noticed any pain, or numbness, or anything like that. Just the tingling, and sometimes a little weakness. No swelling, either. I'm pretty sure. I haven't really… looked closely, to be honest. Mostly just trying to ignore it!
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Teretha, it could be several things. Given your occupation and the gradual onset, we should explore the possibility of a repetitive stress injury, perhaps carpal tunnel syndrome. It’s not definitive, of course. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just a few simple tests to assess your hand strength, reflexes, and sensation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, and hopefully get it sorted out. I need my hands, you know? I don’t want to lose my job over this. And… I don't really understand all the fancy medical terms. Carpal… what was it again? But yes, go ahead. A quick exam sounds good.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition affecting the nerves in the wrist, causing tingling and weakness in the hand. We'll just perform a few tests to see if that's likely. Alright, Teretha, can you make a fist for me, as tight as you can?
PATIENT: There. Like this? It feels… a little stiff, if that makes sense. And a little bit of tingling when I do that. Not awful, but… noticeable. It’s worse on this hand, I think. This one.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. And does that cause any tingling?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! Right there. That’s… definitely it. A sharp little tingle, shooting up my arm a bit. That’s the spot. It always feels a little funny there. I just thought it was old age!
DOCTOR: I see. And can you bend your wrists fully, like this?
PATIENT: Not really. Not without it feeling… uncomfortable. It’s stiff. And it feels… tight. It doesn’t bend as far as it used to, I don’t think. I haven't really paid much attention to it until now. This one’s worse too.
DOCTOR: Alright, Teretha. Based on this brief examination, and your description of the symptoms, carpal tunnel syndrome is certainly a strong possibility, particularly in your left hand. However, to be certain, and to rule out other potential causes, I would recommend a nerve conduction study. It's a non-invasive test that measures the electrical activity in your nerves. It would require a referral to a specialist – a neurologist, most likely. Unfortunately, without insurance, it may be… costly. Are you aware of any local resources that might provide financial assistance for such testing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A neurologist? That sounds…serious. And costly… yes, that’s my biggest worry. I don’t have any savings to speak of, and I haven’t heard of any local resources. I usually just… try to ignore things and hope they go away! I’m really not good with all this medical stuff, Doctor. I don’t know what to do. I need my job. But I can’t afford to be running around to specialists. Is there… anything else we can try first? Maybe some exercises or something?
DOCTOR: Well, we could attempt a trial of conservative management, but it’s unlikely to provide a definitive answer. This would involve wrist splints – to immobilize your wrists, particularly at night – and some simple hand exercises to improve strength and flexibility. We can provide you with some literature on appropriate exercises. And I can recommend over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication, like ibuprofen, for pain relief. However, without a proper diagnosis, we are simply treating symptoms, not the underlying cause. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve within a few weeks, the nerve conduction study is still the most appropriate next step. I can provide you with a list of neurologists in the area, and you can inquire about their fees and payment options. It’s a matter of weighing the cost of testing against the potential loss of function in your hands, Teretha. It's rarely ideal, I know, but we must be realistic.
PATIENT: Realistic… yes. You’re right. I just… I don’t like being a burden. And I really don't have the money. The splints and the exercises… I can try those, I suppose. I can try anything. But I don't know… it just feels like I’m delaying the inevitable. Could you… just write down the names of those neurologists, please? And maybe the names of those exercises? If it gets worse, I guess I’ll have to figure something out. I really appreciate you taking the time, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. The names of a few neurologists in the area, along with some basic hand exercises. I also have a pamphlet outlining the use of wrist splints. I suggest you start the exercises today, and wear the splints at night. If your symptoms do not improve within four weeks, or if they worsen, schedule an appointment with one of the neurologists. I must reiterate, however, that without insurance, the cost of treatment may be substantial. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Teretha?
