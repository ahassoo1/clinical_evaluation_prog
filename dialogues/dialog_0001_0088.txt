DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Name and… why are you here today?
PATIENT: Jaylyne DHANOA: My name's Jaylyne Dhanoa. And… well, it’s my ears. They’ve been ringing. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, and it’s really starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Ringing, huh?
PATIENT: Jaylyne DHANOA: Yeah. It’s not like… a loud ringing, all the time. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s high-pitched, sometimes it’s more of a… buzzing, I guess? It’s hard to explain. And it's mostly in my right ear, I think.
DOCTOR: Right ear. Okay. And has anything… specific happened?
PATIENT: Jaylyne DHANOA: Hmm… not that I can think of. I work at a restaurant, it can get pretty noisy, lots of chatter and music. Maybe that? I dunno. It started around the time things got really busy with the tourist season, so… possibly? Nothing major, like a really loud bang or anything. I wish I knew what caused it, honestly. It’s driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Restaurants are…loud. Alright. Any hearing loss?
PATIENT: Jaylyne DHANOA: I… haven’t really noticed. I mean, I can still hear people talking, and the music at work, so… no, I don’t think so. But maybe it’s gradual? I haven't had my hearing checked in ages. I’m not sure if I’ve ever had it checked, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a look. I'll need to examine your ears. Just sit there. Don't move.
PATIENT: Jaylyne DHANOA: Okay, sure. Whatever you need. Just… try to be quick, if you don't mind? I have a shift starting in a few hours.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tympanic membrane looks…normal. Some cerumen present, but nothing remarkable. No obvious signs of infection or obstruction. Probably just noise exposure.
PATIENT: Jaylyne DHANOA: Noise exposure? So… working at the restaurant? Is there anything I can do about it? Like, will it just go away on its own? Because honestly, it's really annoying. And I need to be able to hear customers!
DOCTOR: Well, you work in a noisy environment. What did you expect?
PATIENT: Jaylyne DHANOA: I… I don't know, I guess? I didn't expect my ears to ring constantly! Look, I’m not a doctor. I just want to know if there’s something I can do to make it stop. Is there any medication, or… I don't know… earplugs? Anything?
DOCTOR: There are… options. But frankly, it's probably just something you'll have to learn to live with. I can prescribe some earplugs. Foam ones. Wear them at work. And I’ll write a referral for an audiologist, just to rule anything serious out. But don’t expect miracles.
PATIENT: Jaylyne DHANOA: Earplugs… okay, that’s… something, I guess. An audiologist, too. Right. Will the audiologist… figure out why it’s happening? Because knowing would be good. And… is there anything I should avoid? Like, loud music even outside of work?
DOCTOR: The audiologist will… assess your hearing. As for avoiding loud noises… common sense, really. Don’t stand next to speakers at concerts. Protect your ears. Look, I’ve got patients waiting. Here's the referral. If it doesn't get better, or gets worse, then come back. Next!
PATIENT: Jaylyne DHANOA: Oh. Right. Okay… thanks. I guess. I appreciate it. .
