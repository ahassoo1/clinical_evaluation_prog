DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, pleasure's all mine, I suppose. Look, to be honest, I barely remember why I booked this appointment. Something about…not sleeping well? And maybe getting a bit…flabby? My wife used to handle all this sort of thing. It's all a bit of a blur, really. I just know I felt like I needed…optimizing. Is that the word?
DOCTOR: “Optimizing,” yes, that’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you're experiencing some fatigue and perhaps some concerns about your physical condition. It's very common to feel a bit lost when navigating these things, especially with life changes. Let’s start with the sleep issue. When did you first notice you were having trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Trouble sleeping… hmm. Honestly? Probably… after she passed. It's all a bit fuzzy, like looking at something through dirty glass. I’d say… around six months ago? Maybe seven? Time doesn't really mean much these days. I just… lie there. Stare at the ceiling. Sometimes I get up and wander around, but it doesn’t really help. It’s just… being awake, mostly. It's not exactly a tragedy, you know? People sleep too much as it is.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing someone can profoundly disrupt many aspects of life, and sleep is often one of the first things affected. It’s certainly not just “not a tragedy” to be struggling with this after such a loss; it’s a very common and understandable response. To get a better picture, could you describe what a typical night looks like for you now?
PATIENT: Typical night… right. Okay. I usually… go to bed around eleven, I think. Sometimes later. I read a bit. Nothing exciting, just… news, I guess. Or old history articles. Then I turn off the light and… just lie there. I don’t really try to fall asleep, if that makes sense. I just… wait. Sometimes I get up and make a cup of tea. Herbal stuff, chamomile, that sort of thing. Doesn’t really do anything. Eventually I just… doze off, whenever. And then I wake up a few times during the night, usually just… thinking. It’s… irritating, more than anything. It’s not like I’m suffering, Doctor. Just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you’re having trouble initiating sleep, staying asleep, and it sounds like your mind is quite active when you are trying to rest. You mentioned waking up during the night with racing thoughts. Could you tell me a little more about what you're typically thinking about when you wake up?
PATIENT: Oh, everything and nothing. Honestly, it’s mostly… regrets, I suppose. Things I should have done, things I said. Old arguments. And… just stuff. Work, mostly. Even though I don't really need to worry about work anymore. It’s… pointless, really. My wife always said I overthink things. She was probably right. It’s not like I’m plotting world domination or anything, just… reviewing the past. And… sometimes worrying about the future. Though there’s not much future to worry about, is there? It’s… a bit pathetic, really. I shouldn’t be wasting my time on this.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound pathetic at all, Mr. Redfern. It’s perfectly natural to have thoughts and feelings like that, especially after a significant loss. It sounds like grief is very much present, and it’s impacting your sleep and causing some rumination. Let's move on to the other concern you mentioned – feeling “flabby.” Has this been a gradual change, or something you’ve noticed more recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that. Yeah. It's… gradual. I used to walk a lot with my wife. Every evening. We’d go down by the river. Beautiful walks. Now… not so much. I sit around a lot. Fixing instruments, mostly. It’s not exactly strenuous work, you know? I used to be quite active, played football when I was younger. But that was a long time ago. It's just… everything feels a bit pointless, so I don’t really bother anymore. It’s not like I’m trying to become a bodybuilder, Doctor. Just… noticing the spare tire around the middle. It’s… unsightly.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a decrease in physical activity following your wife's passing has led to some weight gain and a sense of diminished motivation. That’s a very common pattern. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. I don't really have much of one, to be honest. I’ve always been fairly healthy. A few colds, the occasional flu. Nothing serious. I had my wife check up on me regularly, though. She was a nurse, you see. Always nagging me to get my blood pressure checked. I’m on Medicare, of course, but I haven’t really needed to see a doctor much. Last thing she arranged was a tetanus shot a couple of years ago. I think. Honestly, I barely remember. I’m not a sickly man, Doctor. Never have been.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Redfern. And it’s helpful to hear your wife was proactive about your health. To be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No. Definitely not. My wife would have known. She kept meticulous records. Blood sugar was always fine. Cholesterol was… normal, I think. Blood pressure was a little high sometimes, but she always said it was just stress. She’d tell me to slow down, take a deep breath. She always knew best. I just… didn’t listen enough. Anyway, I’m certain I don't have anything like diabetes or heart disease. If I did, she'd have told me. She wouldn't have let it go unnoticed. It's just… sleep, and a bit of… padding. That's all.
DOCTOR: I understand your confidence in her assessment. To complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. My wife always said I had a cast-iron stomach. She was the one with the allergies, actually. Pollen, dust… all sorts of things. Always carrying tissues and antihistamines. I never had to worry about any of that. She was always so careful. I wasn't nearly as… organized.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I stopped taking the herbal tea a few weeks ago. Didn't seem to be doing much good, so what was the point? I don't believe in all that… hocus pocus, really. My wife liked her vitamins, but I never got into it. Just… tea, briefly, and then nothing. Is that all the questions, Doctor? I’m starting to feel a bit… examined.
DOCTOR: That's all for the questions, Mr. Redfern. Thank you for your patience. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. It will just take a few minutes. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: No. Go ahead. Doesn't really matter to me. I suppose it can’t hurt. Just… get on with it, then. I haven’t had a proper check-up in years, I suppose. Might as well.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax and breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Your lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds bilaterally. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/88. Not alarmingly high, but something we should monitor. Ears look clear. Nose and throat appear normal as well. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and your report of sleep difficulties and decreased activity warrant further attention.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure, eh? Not surprising, I suppose. My wife always warned me about that. Stress, she said. It's always something, isn't it? So, what now, Doctor? Am I dying? Because honestly, at this point, it wouldn’t be the worst thing. Just… tell me what you think I need to do. I’d rather know. No point in sugarcoating it, is there?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Mr. Redfern. You are not dying. Your blood pressure is mildly elevated, and that’s something we can address. It’s often manageable with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. Given your reported sleep difficulties, decreased activity, and the slightly elevated blood pressure, my initial thought is to rule out any underlying issues that could be contributing to these symptoms. I recommend a few basic blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. We should also check your thyroid function, as that can sometimes affect sleep and energy levels. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Tests, eh? Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Just get it over with. I suppose I should have gotten checked up years ago, but… well, it doesn’t matter now. Just tell me where to go, and how long it will take. And… will it be expensive? Medicare doesn't cover everything, does it? I'm not really in a position to pay a lot of money.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll get that sorted for you. I’ll write you a lab requisition now. The tests are standard blood work, and Medicare should cover the majority of the cost. There might be a small co-pay depending on your specific plan, but our billing department can help you with that. I’ll have the receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from today to discuss the results. The lab is just across the street. It shouldn't take more than 30 minutes, and you don't need an appointment. They're open until 5 PM today. In the meantime, I’d like to suggest a few things you can start doing now. Try to establish a regular sleep schedule, going to bed and waking up around the same time each day, even on weekends. And aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Even a brisk walk is a good start. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Manageable? I suppose. Sleep schedule… I can try. Exercise… I haven't done that in years. But I’ll try. It’s just… everything feels so pointless, you know? But… alright. I'll try. So, lab across the street, appointment next week. Anything else? Because honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit… overwhelmed. It’s a lot to take in, Doctor. A lot.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s a lot, Mr. Redfern, and it’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. We don’t need to do everything at once. Let’s focus on getting the blood tests done and then discussing the results next week. One final thing: given your recent loss and the sleep difficulties, it might be helpful to explore some coping mechanisms for stress and grief. We have a list of support groups and counseling services available here at the clinic. Would you be interested in learning more about those resources?
PATIENT: Support groups? No. Thank you. I don't really… do groups. I'm perfectly fine on my own. Always have been. Talking about my feelings… it’s not really my thing. I just want to get some sleep, and maybe… feel a bit less tired. That's all. No. No support groups. Just the tests, and the appointment next week. Is that everything now, Doctor? Can I go? I have… things to do. Or, well, not really things. But… I need to go.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Redfern. That is perfectly alright. The lab requisition is here, and your follow-up appointment is scheduled for next week at the same time. Here's a summary of our plan: complete blood count, metabolic panel, lipid panel and thyroid function tests, follow up next week. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions before your appointment. Thank you for coming in today, and I look forward to discussing the results with you next week. Do you need help getting to the lab?
PATIENT: No. I’m fine. It’s just across the street, you said? I can manage. Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mr. Redfern. Take care.
