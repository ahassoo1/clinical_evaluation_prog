DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the lady on the phone said I needed to get it checked. Honestly, I don't even feel sick. It's just… a waste of my time, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney, but even without symptoms, high blood pressure—or hypertension—is a serious condition that needs attention. The nurse likely scheduled you based on a reading taken during a routine check, and we want to ensure everything is alright. It’s certainly not a waste of time to be proactive about your health. Now, can you tell me if anyone has ever told you before that your blood pressure was elevated?
PATIENT: No. Never. Not my mom, not my grandma, not even the dentist. I get checked regularly, you know, for work. Everything's always been fine. This is… surprising. And inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Always” is a strong word, Ms. Dudney, and things can change. We’ll get a baseline reading today to confirm. Just to be thorough, do you have any idea when the nurse took the elevated reading?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I didn’t ask. They just told me to come in. I was in and out of there before I could even think to ask. I have a job to do, Doctor. This whole thing is… disruptive.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that your time is valuable, Ms. Dudney. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. It’s not uncommon for readings to be slightly off due to stress or other temporary factors. Before we take your blood pressure, let’s briefly go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I’ve always been healthy. Eat alright, try to get some exercise when I can, even with the work. My husband keeps telling me to slow down, but… someone has to get things done, right? I don't have time for… problems.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never needed 'em. Just a broken arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that healed up fine. Nothing serious. I'm not a delicate flower, Doctor. I can handle things.
DOCTOR: I understand. And that's good. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My mom... she had some issues with her joints when she got older. Arthritis, I think. Dad was a smoker, but he quit years ago. He's… well, he's gone now. No one else really had any major health problems that I know of. They weren't the type to go to doctors much. Old-fashioned, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin sometimes, if I remember. And I take something for allergies during the spring. That's it. I don't like filling my body with… chemicals, if I can help it. It messes things up.
DOCTOR: Okay. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I’m pretty lucky that way. Honestly, Doctor, is this all necessary? I mean, I feel fine. Can we just take my blood pressure and get this over with? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, while I understand your desire for a quick resolution, a thorough assessment is crucial for accurate care. We’ve gone through your medical history to rule out underlying causes and ensure your safety. Now, I’m going to need to check your vital signs, including your blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. Then, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. After that, we can discuss the results and create a plan. Will that work for you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. The sooner this is done, the better. Don't want to fall behind on everything. I got things to do. Let's just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat, Ms. Dudney. I’ll begin with your blood pressure. Relax your arm, and try to breathe normally. 162 over 98. That is elevated. And it’s confirmed with a second reading. Your pulse is 78 and regular, and your respiratory rate is 16. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles. Your heart and lungs sound good, Ms. Dudney, but your blood pressure is significantly elevated. This requires further investigation.
PATIENT: Elevated? How elevated is “elevated”? I feel perfectly fine. It's probably just from…stress. Work's been hectic. Is it something I need to worry about right now? I can’t afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: 162 over 98 is considered Stage 2 hypertension, Ms. Dudney. While it’s true stress can temporarily raise your blood pressure, this reading is consistently high enough to warrant concern. It significantly increases your risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and other serious health problems. It is something you need to address, and soon. Dismissing it because you don’t feel symptoms would be… unwise. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a urinalysis. These tests will help us assess your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and overall health. I also recommend an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check your heart’s electrical activity. Would you agree to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Seriously? This is getting ridiculous. Look, I told you, I feel fine. My husband is going to kill me if I spend all day in doctors' offices. Can’t we just…watch it? See if it goes down on its own? I’m a busy person, Doctor. This is… a lot. I don’t even know what half of those things are. And honestly? I don’t trust these tests anyway. Always something wrong, always something to worry about. I just want to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your reluctance, but consistently high blood pressure isn't something to simply "watch." Ignoring it could have devastating consequences. These tests aren't about finding something wrong; they're about gathering information to create a safe and effective treatment plan. The complete metabolic panel and lipid panel are standard blood tests that give us a snapshot of your organ function and cholesterol levels. The urinalysis checks your kidneys for damage. The EKG is a quick and painless test that records your heart's electrical activity. I strongly recommend we proceed with these tests. If you're still hesitant, I can refer you to a cardiologist for a second opinion. However, I will not dismiss your elevated blood pressure without further investigation. It is my professional responsibility to ensure your health and safety. What is your decision?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? This is getting out of hand. Fine. Fine! Do your tests. All of them. Just… get it over with. But if everything comes back normal, you’re wasting my time. And I expect a full explanation of everything. No doctor-speak, okay? I need to understand what you’re telling me. And I need to get back to work as soon as humanly possible. My schedule… it’s tight. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Dudney. I will ensure you receive a clear and comprehensive explanation of all the results, in plain language. The nurse will draw your blood and perform the urinalysis. I will order the EKG, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they are available, likely within a week. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid excessive salt intake, manage stress as best you can, and refrain from strenuous activity. Do you have any questions before you proceed?
PATIENT: No. Just… where is this nurse? And how long will this all take? I have things to do, remember? This is… inconvenient. Really inconvenient. And I need to know if I need to schedule time off from work. My boss… doesn’t understand these things.
DOCTOR: The nurse should be with you momentarily. The blood work and urinalysis will take about 15-20 minutes. The EKG is quick—about five minutes, tops. Depending on the results, you may need to schedule some time off for further evaluation or treatment. It's difficult to say definitively at this point. However, I will provide you with a note for your employer if necessary. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests completed. I assure you, we'll work as efficiently as possible. Do you have any other questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. I’m wasting time just standing here. Where is the nurse? Seriously.
DOCTOR: She should be right with you, Ms. Dudney. Nurse Ramirez, could you please assist Ms. Dudney with the blood work and urinalysis?
