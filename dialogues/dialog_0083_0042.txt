DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I’m Londell Kammann. I reckon I’m here for a men’s health check-up, like the form said. Just want to make sure everything's still tickin’ right, you know? Gettin' on in years and all.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammann. A routine men’s health check-up is a very good idea. I see you’ve filled out some preliminary paperwork, which is helpful. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Sure thing. Generally, I’m pretty good for my age, I think. I stay active – I do a lot of etching, it keeps my hands busy, and I walk most days. Used to do more hiking, but my knees ain’t what they used to be. No major illnesses, haven’t had any surgeries, if that’s what you’re gettin’ at. I do have some arthritis in my hands, mostly from all the work, but it’s manageable. Oh, and I lost my wife, bless her heart, about five years ago. That was tough, still is sometimes. But physically, I’m holdin’ up okay.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Kammann. It’s understandable that would still be difficult. And it sounds like you’ve been proactive about staying active despite your knees, that's excellent. So, to clarify, you mentioned arthritis in your hands, but no other significant medical history or past surgeries?
PATIENT: That's right, Doctor. Just the arthritis, and maybe a touch of high blood pressure the doctor told me about a few years back. He put me on a little pill for it, I take it every morning. Can't rightly remember the name of it, but it seems to be workin’. Everything else has been pretty smooth sailin’, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And you’ve been taking medication for high blood pressure for a few years now. Do you happen to know the dosage of that medication?
PATIENT: Now see, that’s where my memory gets a little fuzzy. I think it’s a small white pill, and I take one every mornin' with my coffee. The dosage… honestly, I don’t remember. I just let the pharmacy handle that, they always know what I need. I never really paid much attention to the number on the bottle, I just take what they give me. Does that sound bad?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kammann. Many people prefer to leave that to the pharmacy. We can easily verify the dosage with your pharmacy records. I'll make a note to do that. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived a long life, but she had some trouble with her heart towards the end. She ended up havin’ a stroke, I believe. And my father, he had diabetes, but he didn’t take good care of himself. Smoked like a chimney and ate whatever he wanted. On my wife’s side, her mother had breast cancer, but that was a long time ago. And… let me think… her father had problems with his prostate, I remember her tellin’ me that. That’s about all I can recall off the top of my head. It’s been a while since we talked about family health, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Kammann. Heart disease on your mother’s side, diabetes on your father’s, and a history of breast cancer and prostate issues on your wife’s side. I appreciate you sharing that information. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any allergies you have, and any medications you're currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t have any serious allergies. I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that’s about it. I can’t say I’ve ever had a bad reaction to anythin’. As for medications… let me think… just the little white pill for the blood pressure. Oh! And I take a glucosamine supplement for my arthritis, helps with the joint pain a little bit. And sometimes, when my hands are really achin’, I’ll take some ibuprofen. That’s it, I reckon. Pretty simple, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known drug allergies, a mild sensitivity to cats, blood pressure medication, glucosamine for arthritis, and ibuprofen as needed. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life, Doctor. My father smoked, and I saw what it did to him. Didn’t want any part of that. Always figured fresh air was a good thing. And I don’t drink much either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but that’s about it. Mostly just water and coffee, like I said. I try to stay healthy, as much as an old man can.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Kammann. Avoiding both smoking and excessive alcohol is very beneficial for your health. It sounds like you’re doing a lot of things right. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, are you experiencing any current symptoms—any pain, fatigue, changes in bowel or bladder habits, or anything else that’s concerning you?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been gettin' up a little more at night to use the bathroom. Not terrible, but more than I used to. And sometimes, it feels like I don’t completely empty my bladder when I go. Could be just an old man thing, I suppose. Other than that, I’m pretty good. A little tired sometimes, but that’s to be expected, right? I ain't as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency of urination, particularly at night, and a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying. Those symptoms are worth investigating further, Mr. Kammann. It's good you brought those up. It could be a number of things, and it’s best to rule out anything serious. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick abdominal exam. Then I'd like to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds sensible to me. Check whatever you need to check. I’ve had those exams before, so I know what to expect. The prostate one ain’t my favorite, but I understand it’s important. Just let me know if anything feels… too uncomfortable. I trust your judgment. Let's get it done.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kammann. I appreciate your trust. I’ll explain everything as we go, and we’ll take things at your pace. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That’s slightly elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll monitor that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or irregularities detected. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Now, I’ll do a quick abdominal exam. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses noted. Now, for the digital rectal exam. I'm going to explain what I'm doing as I go. This allows me to assess the size and texture of your prostate. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should be brief. Let me know if you experience any significant pain.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m ready as I’ll ever be, I suppose. Just let me know when you’re done.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kammann. That’s all done. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but without any immediately concerning nodules or hardness. It was a bit tender to palpation, which is likely contributing to your urinary symptoms. Based on the exam and your symptoms, I suspect you may have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a common condition in men your age. It’s an enlargement of the prostate that can cause urinary frequency, urgency, and difficulty emptying the bladder. However, we need to confirm this with some additional tests. I’d like to order a urine analysis to rule out any infection, and a PSA blood test to check your prostate-specific antigen level. This will help us determine if further investigation, such as an ultrasound, is necessary. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Sounds reasonable, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. A urine analysis and a blood test… I can do that. I’d rather know what’s goin’ on, even if it ain’t good news. So, yes, let’s get those tests done. When can I expect to get the results? And will I need to come back to the clinic, or will you call me?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can get those tests ordered right away. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will be happy to assist you. Typically, the results take about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results. If anything concerning comes up sooner, my office will contact you directly. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend staying well-hydrated, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and trying to urinate when you feel the urge. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Mr. Kammann?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that covers most of it. Hydrate, avoid caffeine… I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and… well, just put my mind at ease a little bit. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything. Just let me know when the nurse wants to take some blood.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kammann. That’s my job. I’m glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to draw the blood and schedule your follow-up appointment. Here’s a summary of our plan, along with some written information about BPH. If you have any questions before your follow-up, please don't hesitate to call the office. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Kammann. Have a good afternoon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
