DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's... the flushing. My face gets very red. Happens sometimes, not all the time. It's been going on... oh, maybe a month now? Hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Hmm, flushing, you say. A month now. Alright. And when you say "sometimes," can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Not after I eat, not after exercise. It just... comes. Like a wave. Usually in the afternoon, I think. Maybe when I’m... thinking hard? Or talking to people? It’s not painful, just… warm. And red. My wife… she would notice. She's gone now, though.
DOCTOR: I see. So it seems to be somewhat… situational?
PATIENT: Situational… yes, that sounds right. When I am… doing things. Thinking, talking. Not when I’m resting. It's strange. I don't know what could be causing it. Maybe stress? Though I don’t feel stressed, not really. It's just... there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? Let me think. Not really. I eat the same food. I walk the same amount. I… well, I lost my wife six months ago. That’s the biggest change, I suppose. But I’m… getting used to it. Still lonely, of course, but… what can you do?
DOCTOR: Right. A significant loss, certainly. And has this flushing started after your wife passed, or was it happening beforehand as well?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, it started after. Definitely after. She would have noticed right away. She noticed everything. Before… no, no flushing at all. It began maybe a month or two after… after she was gone. It’s not a big deal, I don’t think. Just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. Never really been one for pills. My wife, she had a little something for her blood pressure, but I don't take anything. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, as far as you know?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I’m aware of. I eat everything. Spicy food, sweets… everything. Never had a reaction. My wife… she was allergic to shellfish. But not me. No, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I’ve been very lucky, I think. A few colds, a little flu now and then, but never anything serious. Never been to the hospital for anything big. My wife... she had some trouble with her heart, but I was always healthy. Never diagnosed with anything.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. Not even for my tonsils when I was a boy. My wife… she had her gallbladder out, years ago. But me? No. Never needed one.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother… she had some trouble with her stomach. But that was a long time ago. And they were in India, you know? It’s hard to remember everything clearly. Not a lot of doctors there, back then. I don't really know if it runs in the family. Maybe high blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? Well, I live alone now. I walk about a mile every day. I read a lot. I cook my own food. Mostly Indian food, you know? Dal, rice, vegetables. I watch television sometimes. Not much else, really. Quiet life. A simple life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Just to rule out anything obvious. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Please, go ahead. My wife… she always said I should see a doctor more often. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Your blood pressure is a little elevated – 145/90. Your heart sounds regular, but a bit fast. Lungs are clear. And your skin… well, I do notice some flushing on your face and neck. It's not raised or bumpy, just… redness. It appears more pronounced on your cheeks. No rashes or anything concerning. Now, I would like to order some blood tests just to be safe. We'll check your thyroid levels, rule out any underlying infection, and check for something called carcinoid syndrome, which can sometimes cause flushing. It’s unlikely, but we need to rule things out. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests…? Yes, yes, that sounds… thorough. Carcinoid… that sounds a little scary. But if you think it’s best… please, do whatever you think is necessary. My wife… she always said it’s better to be safe than sorry. Whatever you need. How do we do the tests?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll write you a lab requisition. You can go to the lab downstairs, and they'll draw some blood. It's a standard blood draw, nothing to worry about. It should take about 15-20 minutes. While we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend avoiding alcohol and spicy foods for the next week and noting exactly when these flushing episodes happen and what you’re doing at the time. A small log, if you will. And I would also like you to monitor your blood pressure at home. I can give you a list of affordable home blood pressure monitors. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. A log, and no spicy food… difficult, but I can try. And I will watch my blood pressure. A list of monitors, that would be helpful. My wife… she had one, I think. I can do that. A log, no spice, and watch my blood pressure. Sounds… doable.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the nurse print out that list of monitors and a sample log for you. We'll get the lab requisition sorted, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the results. If the flushing gets significantly worse – if it’s accompanied by dizziness, chest pain, or shortness of breath – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you’ve covered everything. A week… yes, that sounds good. No dizziness, no chest pain… I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very helpful. My wife… she would have liked you. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. You’re very welcome. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly with the information. Have a good day. And don’t worry too much.
PATIENT: .
