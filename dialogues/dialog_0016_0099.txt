DOCTOR: Hi Denis, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Maskal. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I received some results from a test… a test of my insides, I believe they called it an “endo test,” and it wasn’t quite right. My regular doctor thought I should come in to discuss it with a specialist, and so here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, an "endo test"... that sounds like an endoscopy, likely to look at your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. And your regular doctor recommended you see me to discuss the results?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. An endoscopy… that sounds right. It was a bit uncomfortable, but the doctor was very kind. And yes, my physician, Doctor Ramirez, suggested I consult with you specifically regarding the findings. She said it was… abnormal, but she wanted a second opinion, and further assessment. Do you have my test results here, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, let me pull those up now. Okay, here we are... Denis Minatra, date of birth… excellent. I see the report from Dr. Ramirez, dated July 28th. It does indicate some findings. It shows evidence of mild esophagitis, some inflammation in your esophagus, and a few small polyps were found in your stomach. Do you have any idea what polyps are, or would you like me to explain that?
PATIENT: Polyps… I believe Doctor Ramirez mentioned them briefly. Something about small growths, but she said they are quite common. However, I would appreciate it if you could explain it a bit further, if you don’t mind. I always find it helps to understand these things in plain language, you see. And what does this… “esophagitis” mean, exactly? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Denis, that’s a very good question. It’s important to understand what’s going on. Okay, so polyps are essentially small growths on the lining of your stomach or colon, in this case, your stomach. Most are benign – meaning not cancerous – but some can change over time, so they often need to be removed and examined under a microscope to be sure. Think of them like little bumps. Esophagitis is inflammation of the esophagus, the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. It can cause symptoms like heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and chest pain. In your case, the report notes mild inflammation. Often, esophagitis is caused by acid reflux – when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make sense, Doctor. “Little bumps” is a very helpful way to describe them. And acid reflux… I do sometimes experience a burning sensation after eating, particularly if I’ve had anything spicy or acidic. Though I thought it was just… indigestion. So, the reflux could be causing the inflammation? And the polyps… are they related to the reflux as well, do you think? Or is that just coincidence? I apologize for all the questions; I simply want to be fully informed.
DOCTOR: You’re not apologizing for anything at all, Denis! It’s excellent that you’re asking questions; that's exactly what you should be doing. It's quite common for acid reflux to cause esophagitis. The repeated exposure to stomach acid can irritate the lining of your esophagus. As for the polyps, it's a bit harder to say definitively whether they’re directly related to the reflux. Sometimes, chronic inflammation can increase the risk of polyp formation, but they can also develop for other reasons. We'd need to examine them to know for sure. Now, to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a bit more about your symptoms?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, as I mentioned, the heartburn is occasional, usually after a larger meal or certain foods. The burning sensation isn’t severe, but it’s… uncomfortable. I haven’t experienced any difficulty swallowing, thankfully. However, I have noticed a slight loss of appetite lately, and I've been feeling a bit fatigued. Just… generally tired, even after a full night’s sleep. And I’ve had a little bit of bloating, but I thought that was just… age. Is it possible these symptoms are all connected?
DOCTOR: It is possible, Denis, and that's what we need to investigate. Loss of appetite, fatigue, and bloating can all be associated with digestive issues. The combination of your symptoms, along with the findings from the endoscopy, suggests we should explore this further. Do you have any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t experienced any nausea or vomiting at all. Thankfully. It’s mostly just the lack of appetite and the feeling of being tired. And, if I’m being honest, a little bit of worry. I haven’t been feeling quite myself these past few weeks, and I am, naturally, concerned about what all of this means. Are the polyps something I should be very worried about? I know you said most aren’t cancerous, but…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Denis. It’s perfectly natural to feel worried when you’re facing uncertainty about your health. It's good you're expressing that. The vast majority of polyps are not cancerous, and even those that are found to be precancerous are often easily removed. The important thing is to get them checked. To do that, I recommend a colonoscopy. It allows us to visualize your entire colon and remove any polyps for biopsy. We can also take some tissue samples from your stomach to examine under a microscope. It's the best way to determine exactly what we're dealing with and create an appropriate plan. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… I’ve heard about those. It sounds… thorough. And a bit unpleasant, if I’m being truthful. But you are right, Doctor. If it’s the best way to get a clear answer, then I suppose I must be brave. I trust your judgment. What does the procedure involve? And… will it be painful? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I am rather anxious about this whole thing.
DOCTOR: You are not asking too many questions at all, Denis. It’s important to be fully informed and to feel comfortable with the plan. Okay, so a colonoscopy involves inserting a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your rectum. We then gently advance the tube through your colon to visualize the lining. We use a mild sedative to help you relax and minimize any discomfort. You'll be monitored closely throughout the procedure. Most people don't experience significant pain during the colonoscopy itself. You might feel some pressure or cramping, but it's usually manageable. The biggest part of the preparation is the bowel prep, which involves drinking a special solution to completely empty your colon. That can be… unpleasant, I won’t lie, but it’s essential for a clear view. The procedure itself usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. Afterwards, you may experience some bloating and gas, but that usually resolves quickly. We would need to schedule this with the endoscopy center. Would you like me to go over the prep instructions with you now, or would you prefer to have a nurse explain it in more detail?
PATIENT: That… sounds manageable, I suppose. Though the prep doesn't sound particularly appealing. Perhaps a nurse explaining the details would be best. I tend to remember things better when they are explained visually, if that makes sense. And it would be reassuring to have someone walk me through it step-by-step. If you wouldn't mind arranging that, Doctor, I would be very grateful. Then, we can discuss scheduling the procedure itself. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Denis. I'm glad I could help ease some of your worries. I'll have the nurse come in and speak with you now to go over the prep instructions in detail. She’s excellent at explaining things visually and answering any questions you may have. Nurse Evelyn, could you please come in and speak with Denis Minatra regarding colonoscopy preparation?
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor Maskal. I truly appreciate your kindness and patience. I feel much better knowing I’m in capable hands. I shall wait for the nurse, then. And thank you again for taking the time to address all of my concerns.
