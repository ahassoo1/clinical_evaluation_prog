DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, it's about a test, I think? Something… for checking things. My… someone told me I needed it. It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. It’s for work, I believe. A drug test, maybe? I get things mixed up so easily these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It sounds like this might be a work-related screening. No worries at all about being a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me just pull up your information here… Ah, yes. It looks like we have an order from your employer for a pre-employment drug screening and a basic metabolic panel – that's a blood test checking things like your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A blood test too? See, I knew I was forgetting something. Electrolytes… that’s what my… my husband used to talk about when he was… never mind. Yes, that sounds about right. Work wants all sorts of things checked, it seems. Is it going to be painful? I’m not a fan of needles.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Hughston. Many people aren't fond of needles, so you're definitely not alone. The blood draw itself is usually very quick – just a little pinch. We use a very small needle, and our phlebotomist is very skilled. Before we proceed, just to clarify for my records, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… medications… Let me think. I take something for my… for my water retention, I think? A little white pill. And… oh, I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it a while back. Allergies… not that I know of. I get itchy sometimes, but that's just the pollen, I think. My husband always said I was allergic to hard work, but… oh, never mind. Is that the kind of allergy you mean?
DOCTOR: No, not that kind of allergy, Ms. Hughston. We’re looking for reactions to medications or foods. The medication for water retention is good to know – do you recall the name of it?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's the tricky part, isn’t it? I… I don’t, actually. It comes in a little orange bottle… and it has numbers on it, I think. I just ask the pharmacist to fill it every month. I'm terrible with names, always have been. My husband did all the remembering for me. He always said I had a head like a sieve. It's just frustrating, getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Hughston. It's perfectly normal for those details to become a little hazy. We can try to look it up based on your pharmacy information if you’d like. Or, we can proceed with the screening and blood test for now, and if anything comes up, we can always investigate further. For the blood test, it’s best to have an empty stomach, so if you haven't eaten anything in the last few hours, that’s perfect. Are you comfortable with us proceeding with both the drug screening and the blood draw today?
PATIENT: Oh, empty stomach… yes, I haven't had anything since breakfast, I think. It was… toast, maybe? Just a little bit. Um… yes, I think proceeding is fine. The sooner it’s done, the better. It's just… a bit of a worry, you know? I don't want to lose my job. I need the money. So, yes. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Hughston. I understand your concern, and we’ll get everything done as quickly and efficiently as possible. We'll start with the drug screening, and then we'll do the blood draw. Nurse, could you please come in and assist Ms. Hughston with the urine collection for the drug screening?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Urine collection… is it… complicated? I hope I don’t mess it up. I’ve had… issues with my bladder sometimes, you know. Getting old, again. But thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It's my job to make sure you feel comfortable. And no, the urine collection is quite simple. The nurse will guide you through it. It just involves providing a sample in a sterile cup. If you do have any difficulty providing a sample, please let the nurse know immediately. We can always offer assistance or reschedule if needed. Don't worry about it at all. It’s perfectly common. Let’s just take things one step at a time.
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. That sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I… I think I’m ready now. Just… please tell me if I do something wrong. I get so flustered easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Hughston. I will. And don't hesitate to speak up if you have any questions or concerns at all. The nurse will be right with you to explain the process. Nurse, please assist Ms. Hughston with the urine collection when you have a moment. And let me know if you need anything. I'll be just outside if you need me. Take your time.
PATIENT: Okay… thank you. .
