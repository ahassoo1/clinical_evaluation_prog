DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Solero. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Um… well, I’m here for a check-up before… before I have a surgery. A cosmetic one, that is. Honestly, it feels a bit silly even saying it out loud. I just… need to make sure I’m healthy enough, I suppose. It's been a while since I've had a thorough check-up.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Mackenzi. Your health is important, and getting a check-up before any surgery – cosmetic or otherwise – is a very responsible thing to do. We want to ensure everything is optimal. It's good you're thinking ahead. To start, could you tell me a little bit more about the surgery you’re planning?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I was worried I sounded frivolous. It’s… it’s a face lift. It’s been a long time coming, and… well, my husband, he always admired a certain… look. And after… after he passed, I just never quite felt like myself again. It's… a difficult thing to explain. I’m not even entirely sure why I want it, beyond that. It's… a long story, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That sounds… significant, Mackenzi. It's perfectly alright if it’s a long story; we have time. It’s important to me to understand what's important to you regarding this surgery. And it’s completely valid to want to do something for yourself, especially after a loss. Let’s focus on your health for now. Could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… difficult. It feels like a very long time ago, and frankly, my memory isn't what it used to be. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose… measles, chickenpox… nothing major. As an adult… I broke my wrist once, badly, about ten years ago. And… I had a fairly difficult pregnancy and delivery with my daughter. I think I developed pre-eclampsia, but I'm not entirely sure. My husband always handled the medical things… and I just… I don’t remember the details. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not bad at all, Mackenzi. It's very common for patients to not remember all the details of their medical history, especially if others have managed those details in the past. We'll do our best to piece everything together. We can also access your records if you're comfortable with that, which might help fill in some of the gaps. Would you be okay with me taking a look?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please! That would be wonderful, Doctor. I would be so grateful. I feel terrible being so vague… it's just… things have been a bit hazy since… well, you know. Accessing my records sounds like the best thing to do. I just want to make sure I’m a good candidate for this, and that everything is safe.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let me take a moment to review your history here. Okay… I see records from several years ago with your primary care physician, Dr. Ramirez. It appears you did have a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia during your pregnancy with your daughter, and a complicated delivery requiring a C-section. There’s also a notation about some mild hypertension that was being monitored. And a history of seasonal allergies. Does that sound right to you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds about right. The pre-eclampsia… I remember being very sick, and spending a lot of time in the hospital. And the C-section… it wasn’t planned, was it? Oh dear, my memory… I just remember being so relieved when my daughter was born safely. And the allergies… yes, terribly stuffy noses every spring. My husband used to bring me bouquets of lilies, knowing they'd make it much worse. He had a mischievous streak.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've been through a lot, Mackenzi, and it's lovely that you remember those little moments with your husband. Okay, so we have a history of pre-eclampsia, a C-section delivery, seasonal allergies, and some prior hypertension. Are you currently taking any medications for any of these conditions, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not currently. After the C-section, I was on some pain medication for a short while, but that was many years ago. The hypertension… Dr. Ramirez monitored it for a bit, but it seemed to resolve on its own. He said I just needed to watch my salt intake and try to reduce stress. Easier said than done, of course. And the allergies… just over-the-counter antihistamines when they get bad. Nothing prescribed, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, just occasional over-the-counter antihistamines for allergies. And do you have any allergies to medications themselves?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so. I've never had a serious reaction to anything, as far as I know. But… my husband always filled my prescriptions, and I wasn’t always very attentive to the details. I'm really sorry for being so unhelpful. It feels like I’m relying on you to piece together my entire life! It's just… things haven’t been the same since he passed.
DOCTOR: You are not being unhelpful at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly understandable that things are difficult, and you're doing a wonderful job just being here today and sharing what you remember. We can always err on the side of caution, and we’ll take extra care during the surgery to monitor for any potential reactions. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s another tricky one. My mother had… she had diabetes, I think. Type 2, perhaps? She was diagnosed later in life. And my father… he had heart problems, I believe. He passed away when I was quite young, so I don't remember the details. On my husband’s side… his mother had arthritis, badly. She was in a wheelchair for many years. That's all I can really recall, I'm afraid. I wasn't very close to his family, and we didn’t talk about medical things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of diabetes and heart problems on your side, and arthritis on your husband’s side. That's helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle… well, it’s not very exciting, I’m afraid. I work as a landscaper, mostly groundskeeping. So I’m outdoors a lot, which is nice. But it’s physically demanding work, and I'm often quite tired. I don't really have much time for hobbies anymore. My husband and I used to love gardening, ironically enough. And we’d take long walks together. But… that was a long time ago. I try to eat healthy, but sometimes it’s just easier to grab something quick and convenient. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Pretty average, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That doesn't sound average at all, Mackenzi. It sounds like you work very hard, and you’re clearly a resilient person. The outdoor work is good, but it's also important to be mindful of fatigue. Do you have any issues with sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… that’s another problem area, I'm afraid. I don't sleep very well. I often wake up several times during the night. And when I do sleep, I don’t feel very rested. It’s probably the stress, I imagine. And… just the quiet, I suppose. It's hard to explain. It's much easier to be busy. It's not a major issue, though. I manage. I just… wish I felt more energetic.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re experiencing sleep difficulties given everything you’ve been through and the demands of your job. It's good you’re acknowledging it. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes, actually. I’ve lost a little weight, I think. Not intentionally. It’s just… my appetite hasn’t been very good lately. And I’ve been so tired, I haven't been eating properly. It's probably not much, but my clothes feel a bit looser than they used to. I haven't really weighed myself recently, so I couldn’t give you an exact number. It's probably not a cause for concern, though. I just… haven't been myself lately.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mackenzi. It’s important to note these changes, and we’ll investigate further if necessary. Alright, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement completely. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit back and relax, that would be wonderful. Your heart sounds regular, but I do notice a slightly elevated heart rate. Your lungs are clear, but I hear some mild wheezing on both sides. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 138/85. It’s not alarmingly high, but we’ll want to monitor that. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Nose is slightly congested, but no visible inflammation. Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Overall, everything appears within normal limits, but your elevated heart rate and blood pressure warrant further investigation. Given your history of pre-eclampsia, your unintentional weight loss, and your difficulty sleeping, I think it would be prudent to order some blood work. This will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good idea. I want to make sure everything is okay before proceeding with the surgery, and if there’s anything I need to address, I’d rather know about it now. What kind of blood work are you thinking of? And… will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll do a complete metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. We’ll also check a complete blood count to assess your red and white blood cell levels, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level to rule out any thyroid issues. And, given your history, we'll do a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. And yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks other than water. We can schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning, and I'll have the results back within a few days. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, tomorrow morning sounds fine. Twelve hours fasting… I can manage that. I’ll just have a light dinner tonight and skip breakfast tomorrow. Thank you for being so thorough, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we’re taking all of these precautions. Is there anything else I should be doing to prepare for the surgery, or anything I should be worried about in the meantime?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. Your peace of mind is important to me. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay hydrated and getting as much rest as possible. Avoid strenuous activity, and please let me know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or severe headaches. Given your history of pre-eclampsia and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I also recommend checking your blood pressure at home a couple of times a day and keeping a log. We can review the results at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That’s very helpful, thank you. I do have one question, actually. Um… the surgery itself… what are the risks involved? I know every surgery has them, but… I’m a little anxious, if I’m honest. And I don’t want to put too much pressure on you to explain everything in detail, but… just a general overview would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly valid question, Mackenzi. It’s always good to be informed, and I’m happy to discuss the risks involved. Every surgery carries some risks, and a face lift is no exception. The most common risks include infection, bleeding, hematoma formation – which is a collection of blood under the skin – nerve damage, and scarring. In rare cases, there can be more serious complications, such as skin necrosis – which is the death of skin tissue – and adverse reactions to anesthesia. However, these complications are relatively rare, and we take every precaution to minimize the risks. We’ll be using sterile techniques, carefully monitoring your vital signs during and after the surgery, and providing you with detailed post-operative instructions to ensure a smooth recovery. The surgeon will also discuss these risks with you in detail before the procedure, and you’ll have the opportunity to ask any questions you may have. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, that was very thorough, thank you, Doctor. It's… a lot to take in, of course, but I appreciate your honesty. Knowing the risks, even if they're rare, helps me feel more prepared. I think that’s all my questions for now. I'll make sure to write down everything we've discussed tonight. I’m looking forward to getting the blood work done and hopefully moving forward with the surgery. Thank you so much for your time and your patience, Doctor. You've really put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’ll be in touch to schedule your follow-up appointment after the blood work results are available. Have a good evening, and I’ll see you tomorrow.
