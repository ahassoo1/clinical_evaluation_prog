DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I’ve gained a rather significant amount of weight recently, and I haven’t changed anything about my diet or exercise. It’s…concerning, to say the least. I was hoping you could perhaps shed some light on the matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Significant weight gain with no changes to diet or exercise is something we should look into. To get a better picture, could you tell me roughly how much weight we’re talking about, and over what period of time has this gain occurred?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me think… I stepped on the scale just this morning, and it was 198 pounds. Last August – August of 2024, to be precise – I was 175. So, approximately 23 pounds in… almost a year, then. I keep very detailed records, you see. It’s…a habit.
DOCTOR: Okay, 23 pounds in a year, with no changes to your routine. That's helpful. And have you noticed any other changes along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. I’ve been… rather tired lately. More so than usual, I suppose. And my hands… they sometimes ache, just a little. Not constantly, but enough to notice. It’s difficult to describe. And perhaps… I feel a bit colder than I used to. But those could just be the summer air conditioning, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue, some hand aching, and feeling colder… we’ll keep those in mind. Now, just to get a complete picture, let's go through some basics. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing diagnosed. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox… but beyond that, I’ve been quite healthy, thankfully. My husband always says I’m as sturdy as an oak tree. Although, perhaps not currently, given the weight gain. But truly, no pre-existing conditions that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never. I’ve always been…lucky, in that regard. A few broken bones as a child, a sprained ankle here and there, but nothing requiring surgery. My mother always said I was too clumsy to be trusted with knives, which may be why. But truly, no surgeries.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother, God rest her soul, she had… arthritis, quite badly, towards the end. And my father… he had high blood pressure, later in life. My husband’s side… his mother had some problems with her heart, I believe. Nothing too serious, as far as I know, but those are the only conditions that spring to mind. I don’t believe anyone else in either family had any significant health issues.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, hypertension, and some heart issues in the family. Good to know. Now, just to rule some things out, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I've always been able to eat and take most anything without issue. My husband often jokes that I have a cast-iron stomach. I suppose it's been somewhat… diminished recently, but it’s not an allergy. It’s simply… a change. I truly cannot recall any allergic reactions in my life.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I pride myself on avoiding medication whenever possible. A bit of chamomile tea when I’m feeling stressed, perhaps, but nothing prescribed by a doctor, and certainly no regular medications. I believe in letting my body heal naturally, whenever it can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your thyroid gland. Just routine things to start. It'll help me get a better idea of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed. I understand it’s all part of the process. And I appreciate your thoroughness. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142 over 90. Not drastically high, but something we'll want to keep an eye on. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Thyroid feels slightly enlarged, and a little tender to the touch. Okay, Ms. Selbitschka, everything seems relatively normal, but the enlarged and tender thyroid is something we need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood tests. We'll check your thyroid hormone levels, a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. That should give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Blood tests seem… prudent, given what you’ve discovered. An enlarged and tender thyroid… that is concerning. I appreciate you identifying that. Please proceed with the tests as you see fit. I trust your judgment entirely. And… will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. No food or sugary drinks, water is fine. I’ll give you a lab requisition form with detailed instructions. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They're open until 5 PM today. Once you have the results, they will send them to me, and I’ll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms - like rapid heartbeat, excessive sweating, or significant weight loss - please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is quite clear. Eight-hour fast, room 203, and contact you with any concerning new symptoms. I will write that down immediately. Thank you for being so thorough. I feel… somewhat reassured, knowing we are taking steps to understand what’s happening. And… approximately how long will the results take to come back? I have a book club meeting on Thursday, and I was hoping to have an idea of whether I should rearrange it. It's a rather important discussion.
DOCTOR: Typically, the results take between 24 to 48 hours, Ms. Selbitschka. So, you should have them by Wednesday afternoon, giving you plenty of time before your book club meeting on Thursday. I'll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they are available. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate your time and attention. Thank you again for identifying the thyroid issue. I will schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as I hear back. I’ll be sure to fast, and I’ll contact the office if anything changes. Have a good day.
