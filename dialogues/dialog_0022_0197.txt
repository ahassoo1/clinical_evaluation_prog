DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Welcome to San SCIARROTTA clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, I need a card to drive for… those ride-sharing services, you know? Uber and Lyft. And maybe taxis, if that's different. I understand I need a medical check-up for it? I want to get it done quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Many of those services require a medical certification to ensure driver safety. We can certainly get that done for you today. It’s a pretty standard check-up. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. Well, I’m 70, so things aren’t perfect, naturally. I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, mostly. Doesn't stop me from doing things, but they ache sometimes. Otherwise, I think I'm pretty good. I try to stay active. I used to work with logging equipment – very physical job – and I'm still used to being on my feet. I don't smoke, and I don't drink much anymore. Divorced, live alone. Does that cover it? Is there anything specific you need to know?
DOCTOR: That's good information, thank you. The arthritis is helpful to know. And it’s good to hear you stay active despite it. Just to clarify – when you say "not much" regarding alcohol, could you tell me on average how many drinks you have in a week?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. "Not much" means maybe one glass of wine with dinner… once a month, perhaps? Honestly, Doctor, it's very rare now. My late husband used to enjoy a few beers, but I never really got into it. It’s just not a habit of mine. Is that alright? I sometimes forget exactly when I last had a drink, to be truthful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta. It sounds like it's not a significant factor. No need to worry about it. Now, let’s move on to some other things. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think... High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me a few years ago, maybe five or six? I take a pill for it every morning. Name escapes me at the moment, but it's a small white one. No diabetes, though. And I don’t think I have heart problems. I've never been told anything about my heart specifically. I get a little breathless walking uphill sometimes, but I figure that's just my age and the arthritis. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. The high blood pressure is important to know, and good you’re taking medication for it. Knowing the name of the medication will be helpful if possible, but we can look that up later if needed. Now, regarding the breathlessness, do you experience that breathlessness at rest, or only with exertion, like walking uphill?
PATIENT: Mostly with exertion, Doctor. Like I said, walking uphill is the worst. Or if I try to carry something heavy. When I’m just sitting or lying down, I’m fine. I used to be able to hike for miles, but those days are long gone. It’s not terrible, just… noticeable. I have to stop and catch my breath sometimes. It hasn’t gotten worse recently, if that makes sense. It’s just always been a little bit like that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It's helpful that it hasn’t been worsening. Let's talk about any past surgeries or hospitalizations you've had. Have you had any major procedures done?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. That was… oh, goodness, must have been thirty years ago. And I broke my wrist once when I was younger, playing volleyball. That needed a cast, but it healed fine. Nothing else that I can recall, honestly. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years. No major hospital stays, no. Is that everything? I sometimes worry I'm forgetting something, but my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta. It's common to forget details, especially over time. Gallbladder removal and a broken wrist are good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... That’s a tricky one. My mother had… I think it was heart trouble. She passed away when she was in her 70s. And my father had… well, he lived a long life, but he did have some sort of cancer when he got older, maybe lung cancer? He smoked heavily. I don't think anyone else in my family had anything particularly serious. My brother is still alive and relatively healthy, as far as I know. We don't see each other much, though. Does that help? It's hard to remember specific details from so long ago.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Knowing about your mother's heart trouble and your father’s cancer is good information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat just about anything. And I’ve taken all sorts of medications over the years, and never had a problem. I’m pretty lucky that way, I think. I can’t remember a single instance of an allergic reaction. Does that cover it? I’m starting to get a little tired, if you don’t mind me saying so. I’m afraid all these questions are a bit exhausting.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mrs. Sciarrotta. You're doing great, and I appreciate your patience. It’s good to know you don't have any allergies. One last quick question regarding medications: Besides the blood pressure pill, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think... No, Doctor, nothing else. Just the one white pill for my blood pressure. I used to take something for my arthritis, but the doctor said it wasn’t doing much good, so I stopped taking it a long time ago. And I don't take any vitamins or supplements. I try to eat a healthy diet, so I figured that was enough. Is that all? I really would like to get this over with, if possible. I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Sciarrotta, that’s very helpful. So, to summarize, you’re 70 years old, you have a history of high blood pressure managed with one white pill, a past history of gallbladder removal and a broken wrist, and a family history of heart trouble and lung cancer. You have no known allergies and aren't taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your reflexes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Anything to get this done quickly. I’m ready whenever you are. Let’s just get it over with, please. I really appreciate your time. It's been… a lot of questions. I just hope I haven’t forgotten anything important.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Sciarrotta. I understand. Now, if you could please take a deep breath for me... Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes... "Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age, but everything seems within normal limits." Okay, Mrs. Sciarrotta, that concludes the physical exam. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better look at your lungs and heart. And I’ll also order some blood work to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. If it’s necessary, then yes, please do those tests. X-ray, EKG, and blood work, all of it. I just want to get this card and get on with things, if you understand. Hopefully, everything is alright. It's just… a lot. Can the clinic schedule those tests for me? I have an appointment this afternoon, so I'd prefer to get it done as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Sciarrotta. I understand your concerns, and we'll get everything scheduled as quickly as possible. "Okay, I’ve scheduled a chest X-ray for you tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM here at the clinic. The EKG can be done right after the X-ray. And I’ll give you a lab requisition for the blood work. You can go to any lab that accepts your Medicare insurance. It's best to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw, so you can schedule that at your convenience tomorrow. " "Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine if you’re fit to drive. " "In the meantime, to be cautious, I recommend avoiding driving long distances or in stressful situations. " Do you have any questions about the tests or the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doctor. X-ray tomorrow morning, EKG after, blood work when I can. And no long drives, got it. Thank you for scheduling everything so quickly. I appreciate your help. I hope the results are okay. I believe that's all I needed for the card, isn't it? Just the tests and then a follow-up? I’m ready to go now, if you’re finished with me. I have a long afternoon ahead.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Sciarrotta, that’s correct. The tests and a follow-up appointment are all that’s needed. I’ve given the receptionists a note detailing everything, and they’ll be happy to assist you with scheduling the follow-up once the results are in. “Here’s a copy of the requisition for the blood work, and a summary of our discussion today. " I wish you all the best, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. "It was a pleasure meeting you, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Take care." .
