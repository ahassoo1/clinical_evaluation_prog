DOCTOR: Hi Calin, welcome. I’m Dr. Amussen. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Amussen. It’s nice to meet you. Well, I received a letter about being checked to see if I qualify for home health services... or hospice, if needed. I’m hoping to understand what that involves, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you received some information about potential home health or hospice care, and you want to discuss what that means. That's perfectly reasonable. To start, can you tell me a bit about your current health situation?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, things haven’t been easy lately. I work as a presser – you know, ironing clothes, mostly in a dry cleaner. It’s… physically demanding, and I've been having a lot of trouble with my back and my breathing. It’s gotten to the point where it’s hard to even get through a full day without being in a lot of pain. That’s why I was surprised to get the letter, to be honest. I haven't been to a doctor in a while, so I wasn't sure what to think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so back pain and shortness of breath, particularly related to your work as a presser. That makes sense – that is physically demanding. When did you first start noticing the back pain?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... it started gradually, maybe six or seven months ago. At first, it was just a little ache after a long day. But it's gotten progressively worse. Now, it's almost constant, and some days it radiates down my leg. It’s really uncomfortable, especially when I’m standing for long periods. I just thought it was part of the job, honestly. I tried using some over-the-counter pain relievers, but they don't seem to be helping much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradual onset, about six or seven months ago, worsening over time, radiating pain down the leg… and over-the-counter medications aren't providing relief. And the shortness of breath – when did that start, and how would you describe it?
PATIENT: The breathing… that started more recently, maybe three months ago. It’s not like I’m gasping for air all the time, but I get winded very easily. Even walking up a flight of stairs leaves me feeling breathless. And sometimes, I feel a tightness in my chest. It’s worrying, because I’ve never had trouble breathing before. I thought maybe it was stress, because things have been a bit hectic at work, but it doesn’t seem to be getting better with rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath for about three months, worsening with exertion, and accompanied by chest tightness. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the back pain and breathing difficulties?
PATIENT: Let me see… now that you mention it, yes. I've been feeling quite tired lately, even after a full night’s sleep. It's not just regular tiredness; it’s more like a deep fatigue. And my appetite has been… off. I haven’t been eating as much as usual, and things just don’t taste as good. I also seem to be bruising a lot easier than I used to. Just little bumps will leave a mark that takes ages to go away. I didn’t really think much of it at first, but now that I’m saying it out loud, it seems like a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, loss of appetite, and easy bruising… Just to get a fuller picture, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no fever, chills, or night sweats. I haven’t been feeling sick in that way. It’s more just… constant tiredness and the pain, and things feeling “off”, like my body isn’t working right. It’s hard to explain. I just feel… worn down. And honestly, a little scared, now that I’m thinking about all of this. I haven’t been to a doctor in so long, I don’t even know what to expect.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is a lot to process, and it's completely normal to feel scared when you're experiencing new symptoms. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, growing up, I was pretty healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. As an adult… I had a gallbladder removed about ten years ago, and that was the last major thing. I also had a really bad bout of the flu a few years back, but I recovered fully. I don't have any known allergies, and I'm not currently taking any medications, aside from the occasional over-the-counter pain reliever, which, as I said, isn’t helping much. I was divorced a few years ago, and honestly, I haven't been the best at taking care of myself since then. I work a lot to make ends meet.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gallbladder removal ten years ago, no known allergies, not currently on any medications… and you’ve been prioritizing work. What about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit harder to say. My mother passed away a few years ago from heart disease, and my father had diabetes. He's still alive, but he’s quite old and his memory isn’t the best, so it’s hard to get a clear picture of his medical history. I do have an aunt on my mother's side who had breast cancer, but I don’t know much beyond that. We weren’t very close, and we don’t talk often. I don’t really have a strong family history of back problems or breathing issues, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother passed away from heart disease, father with diabetes, and an aunt with breast cancer. And just to get a full picture, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I live alone. As I mentioned, I'm divorced. I don't have any children. I don't smoke and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine on special occasions. I used to enjoy going out with friends, but I haven't been doing much of that lately. Work keeps me pretty busy, and frankly, I haven't had much energy for socializing. I don’t have health insurance at the moment, which is why I haven’t been to the doctor in so long. It’s just… expensive.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you live alone, no smoking or heavy alcohol use, and limited social activity. And you don’t currently have health insurance. Okay, Calin, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. I just want to figure out what's going on and hopefully get some relief. I’m starting to worry a lot about my job, honestly. If I can’t work, I don’t know what I’ll do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. We'll do our best to figure this out. If you could please have a seat here, I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs, then we’ll check your back. First, let’s listen to your breathing. Take a few deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth.
PATIENT: Okay… I’m breathing. It feels a little tight, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m hearing some… diminished breath sounds on both sides, particularly at the bases of your lungs. And I can hear some mild wheezing as well. I’m also noticing some tenderness when I press on your lower back, and some muscle spasm. Can you tell me on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate your back pain right now?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… uncomfortable. Hmm… right now? Probably a 6, maybe a 7. It’s a constant ache, but when you press on it, it shoots up a bit. And it feels like it’s radiating down my leg again. It’s worse when I stand up or walk around.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 6 to 7 out of 10, radiating down the leg. And when you bend forward like this, does that make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. It’s a sharp pain, right in my lower back. And it feels like something is… pinching. I can’t really go any further without it hurting a lot. It feels like my muscles are just locked up.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary examination, your symptoms are concerning and require further investigation. It's difficult to say exactly what’s going on without some additional tests. I'm concerned about the possibility of a musculoskeletal issue, such as a herniated disc or muscle strain, and I also want to rule out any underlying lung conditions given your shortness of breath and diminished breath sounds. Would you be willing to get an X-ray of your lower back and a chest X-ray?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever tests you think are necessary, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and get some relief. I’m happy to get any tests done, as long as they can help figure out what’s wrong. And… if the tests cost money, I’m really worried about that. I don’t have insurance, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concerns about the cost. Let me see what I can do. There are some programs available that can help cover the cost of imaging for patients without insurance. I'll have my staff assist you with applying for those programs. In the meantime, I'm going to order both a chest X-ray and a lumbar spine X-ray. We'll also do some blood work to check for inflammation and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Would you be comfortable providing a urine sample as well?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. I appreciate you looking into the financial assistance programs. Anything would help. And yes, I can definitely provide a urine sample. Where should I go to do that?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. The restroom is just down the hall to the left, and there are collection cups available. Once you’ve collected the sample, you can just bring it back to me. While you're doing that, I'll have my staff draw the blood work. Once we have the results from the blood work, X-rays, and urine sample, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that aggravates your back pain. And if your shortness of breath worsens, or you experience any chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately.
PATIENT: Okay, I understand. I'll go get the urine sample now, and I'll be careful to avoid any strenuous activity. And I will go to the emergency room if my breathing gets worse. Thank you so much for your help, Doctor Amussen. I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Calin. We'll get to the bottom of this. My staff will be right with you to get the blood work started. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns before you leave. "Nurse Emily, could you please assist Calin with the blood work and explain the process to her?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you both so much. I think I’m good for now. I’ll just go with Nurse Emily. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Calin, have a good day. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
