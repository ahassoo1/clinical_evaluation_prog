DOCTOR: Hi Mande, welcome. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Dr. Yoshino. Well, it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and…yellow, for a few days now. It started after I had some fava beans with dinner. I didn't think much of it at first, but it’s not going away.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and yellowing of the skin… that is something we should look into. And it started after eating fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. I had them on Saturday night, and by Sunday I felt…off. Just really drained. And then my wife pointed out I looked a bit yellow, especially in my eyes. I figured maybe I was just coming down with something, but it hasn’t gotten better, and I remembered reading something about fava beans causing problems for some people. I don’t even know if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That is relevant, actually. It sounds like you might be experiencing a reaction related to something called G6PD deficiency. It's a genetic condition where people have trouble processing certain things, and fava beans are a known trigger for some. To get a better idea of what's going on, can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Okay, G6PD deficiency… I’ve never heard of that. Well, the tiredness is… deep. Not just like needing a nap. It’s like all my energy is gone. Even getting out of bed feels like a huge effort. And it’s not really improving with rest, to be honest. I just feel…weak. It’s making it hard to do things around the house, and I certainly can’t go to work like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds really debilitating. And it's good you're not trying to push through it. Let's get some more information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and yellowing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My pee has been darker than usual, I think. Like, a really dark yellow, almost brownish. And… oh, and I’ve been a little short of breath sometimes, just with normal activity, like walking up the stairs. Nothing major, but noticeable. I don’t have a fever, and I don’t think I’ve had any stomach problems, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark urine and shortness of breath are important things to note. That dark urine especially points towards something breaking down in your body. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I want to check your skin color, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Just a routine check, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Absolutely, please do. I trust your judgement, Dr. Yoshino. I'm just hoping we can figure out what's going on. It’s a bit frightening feeling so weak and not knowing why.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your skin is showing signs of jaundice, and your sclera is definitely yellowed. Your heart and lungs sound clear, which is good. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. I'm not feeling any enlargement of the liver or spleen. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6°F. Now, I’m going to order some blood tests. We’ll check your G6PD levels, a complete blood count to look at your red blood cells, liver function tests, and a bilirubin level to see how much bilirubin is in your blood. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Yoshino. I just want to get this sorted out. Those tests sound… thorough, which is reassuring. Will I need to fast before the blood work, or is it okay to eat and drink as usual?
DOCTOR: That's a good question! You do need to fast for about 8-12 hours before the blood draw. So, no food or drinks besides water after tonight. We'll draw the blood first thing in the morning. In the meantime, avoid any foods or medications that could potentially trigger a reaction. We'll talk more about that when we go over your results, but for now, just try to rest and stay hydrated. Do you have any allergies to medications or foods that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any known allergies. I can take most medications without any problems, and I don’t have any food allergies either. That’s good, at least. Eight to twelve hours…okay, I can manage that. It’s just…knowing it might be something serious is a little scary, to be honest. But I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mande. It's always unsettling when you're not feeling well and don't know the cause. But we're going to get to the bottom of this. We'll get those blood tests done tomorrow morning, and I'll give you a call as soon as the results are in. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – like severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or dark, cola-colored urine – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to know about the emergency room. I’ll definitely keep that in mind. Hmm… let me think. You mentioned avoiding triggers… besides fava beans, are there other things I should specifically be avoiding right now? Certain medications, or… anything? I don’t want to accidentally make things worse.
DOCTOR: That's a very smart question. Yes, certain medications can trigger a reaction in people with G6PD deficiency. Specifically, we need to avoid sulfonamide antibiotics, nitrofurantoin, and some antimalarial drugs. Here’s a list of medications to avoid. It’s always best to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any new medication, even over-the-counter ones. Also, avoid exposure to naphthalene, which is found in some mothballs. And be cautious with certain dyes and chemicals. It's a bit of a long list, but we'll go over it in more detail when we get your results back. Do you take any regular medications currently, even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I take a low-dose aspirin every day, prescribed by my doctor for heart health. And I take a Vitamin D supplement, just because I don’t get much sun. I also sometimes take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not regularly. Would those be a problem? The aspirin especially, since it’s a daily thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. The aspirin is something we need to discuss with the cardiologist, as it could potentially be a trigger. Vitamin D is generally safe, but we’ll keep an eye on it. And ibuprofen should be avoided for now. I’m going to call in a temporary prescription for acetaminophen for pain relief. That's a safer option until we know more. And I’ll contact your cardiologist to discuss the aspirin. Is there anything else you want to mention, or any other questions you have?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. You’ve been very thorough, Dr. Yoshino. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly and answering all my questions. It's definitely reassuring to know you’re taking this seriously. I’ll avoid the ibuprofen and wait for your call with the results. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. I’m glad I could ease some of your concerns. And you’re right to be proactive and ask questions. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Just rest, stay hydrated, and avoid those triggers. We’ll talk soon. Have a good evening, and please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if anything changes.
