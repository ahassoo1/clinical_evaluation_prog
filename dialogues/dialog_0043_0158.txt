DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Kalinski, is it? Yes, well, it’s about this… letter. For a pet, you see. My daughter, she’s moving, and they need a letter saying I allow her to have one. Something about the building rules. Honestly, all this paperwork… it’s a bother, really. I just need it signed, if that’s all there is to it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. I see. So, this is a letter confirming your permission for your daughter to have a pet in her new residence. Just to be absolutely thorough – and to ensure I have all the necessary information for the documentation – could you tell me a little more about the pet?
PATIENT: A pet… what kind of pet is it again? Oh, right. It’s a… a small dog. A fluffy one. My granddaughter picked it out, you see. A little thing, really. Not much bigger than a… a shoe box. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those details. They’re always fussing with it. What kind of dog… I couldn’t possibly say. A poodle mix, maybe? Something like that. They do a lot of… grooming. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know, Ms. Wrye, thank you. Knowing the breed, even approximately, is useful for completeness. And yes, grooming habits are good to note. Do you happen to know if the dog is up-to-date on its vaccinations?
PATIENT: Vaccinations? Oh, goodness. Now you're asking me things I really don't know. My daughter handles all of that. She's very responsible, that one. Always getting them to the… the animal doctor. Yes, she’s very good about it. I’m sure it’s all taken care of. Honestly, I wouldn't even know where to begin looking for those records. They probably have a whole folder full of things. Is it necessary for me to know all of this?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Wrye, it’s perfectly alright. I understand. It’s not necessary for you to have all the details. I was just covering all bases for the documentation. Since your daughter manages the pet's care, and you trust she’s kept up with everything, that's sufficient. Just to confirm – and this is a quick question – has the dog ever bitten anyone, or shown any signs of aggression?
PATIENT: Aggression? Heavens, no! That little fluffball wouldn't hurt a fly. My granddaughter practically sleeps with it! It licks everyone who comes near. No, it’s a perfectly sweet dog. A bit yappy, perhaps, but not aggressive. My daughter would never let an aggressive dog near her children. Honestly, you’d have to be quite rude to get it upset. It's a very well-behaved dog, all things considered. Now, can we just get this letter signed? I have a luncheon to get to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. I appreciate your patience. It sounds like a lovely and well-cared-for companion. Just one final quick question, before I finalize the letter: do you have any allergies I should be aware of, just in case you visit your daughter and her pet frequently?
PATIENT: Allergies? Me? Oh, no, nothing like that. I've always been quite robust, really. I can eat anything, touch anything… I don’t get bothered by dust, or pollen, or… well, anything, to be honest. No, I'm perfectly fine. Really, I don't understand why you need to ask so many questions. It’s just a letter, isn't it? Now, if you could just… hurry things along? The luncheon… it’s quite important.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wrye. I apologize if my questions seemed excessive. It's simply my practice to gather a comprehensive overview, even for seemingly straightforward requests. It helps ensure complete and accurate documentation. Here you are. This letter confirms your permission for your daughter to keep a pet in her new residence. Please review it to ensure everything is accurate. It states you have no known allergies and are aware of your daughter’s pet ownership. Would you mind signing at the bottom?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, it looks… fine. There. Is that everything now? Honestly, all this paperwork… I really must get going. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you’ll excuse me… luncheon, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. It was a pleasure meeting you. Here’s a copy of the signed letter for your records. If your daughter experiences any concerns about the pet's health or behavior, or if you develop any unexpected symptoms after visiting, please don't hesitate to contact my office. Just one small recommendation, Ms. Wrye - given the limited information regarding the pet’s vaccination history, it might be prudent for your daughter to confirm those records with her veterinarian, just for peace of mind. Have a lovely luncheon.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I'll mention it to her. Thank you. Really, I must be going. Goodbye, Doctor. .
