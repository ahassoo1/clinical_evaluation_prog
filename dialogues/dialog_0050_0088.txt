DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you are 27 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Yeah, 27. Just...this ringing in my ears. It's been bugging me for a bit now.
DOCTOR: "Bugging you," you say. How long has this ringing been present, Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: Hmm...maybe a couple of weeks now? It comes and goes, but it's definitely more frequent lately. It’s hard to say exactly, to be honest. It's not constant, thankfully.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, intermittent...not constant. I see. And can you describe the ringing itself?
PATIENT: It's...hard to explain. Like a high-pitched whine, sometimes. Other times it’s more of a buzzing. Not super loud, but noticeable, you know? Especially when it’s quiet. It's in both ears, but I think it’s worse in my left one.
DOCTOR: A high-pitched whine, sometimes buzzing, worse in the left ear... Is there any associated hearing loss that you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Hearing loss? Not that I've noticed, no. I mean, I work in a restaurant, it’s always loud, so…maybe? It's hard to tell if things are a bit muffled, with all the noise. I haven't really paid attention, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Restaurants are rather loud environments. Has there been any recent exposure to particularly loud noises—concerts, construction, anything of that nature—prior to the onset of this ringing?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. Work is pretty much the loudest it gets. There was a wedding last month, a live band, but I wasn’t right next to them. I wear earplugs when I’m clearing tables near the speakers, though. I try to, anyway.
DOCTOR: Good. That is responsible of you. Now, let’s move on to some other questions. Have you experienced any dizziness, nausea, or a feeling of fullness in either ear along with this ringing?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No dizziness, no sickness…just the ringing. My ears don’t feel blocked or anything, either. Just…sound. It’s annoying, that's all. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: "Annoying" is a fair description, I suppose. And have you noticed any changes in your overall health recently?
PATIENT: Not really. Same as usual, I guess. Work’s been busy, a bit stressed, but who isn’t? No new illnesses, no medications… I’m pretty healthy. Divorced about a year ago, that’s been stressful, but… I’m getting there. Does that count?
DOCTOR: A recent divorce…stress can certainly manifest in various ways. Let's continue with a brief medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions—diabetes, high blood pressure, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. I had the flu a couple years back, but that was it. Doc, is this something serious? I mean, I need to be able to work. And honestly, I can’t afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: Mr. Dhanoa, while I can understand your concerns, jumping to conclusions is rarely productive. Let’s proceed systematically. Before we delve further, do you have any allergies to any medications or substances?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to anything before, not even insect bites. Just want to get this sorted, Doc. This ringing is driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s conduct a brief physical examination of your ears and perhaps a quick hearing screening, if you don't mind. This will give us a better baseline assessment. Please recline back in the chair.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you think is best. Let's get it over with. Just…try to be quick, yeah?
DOCTOR: I'm observing some cerumen – earwax – present in the ear canal, but no obvious signs of inflammation or infection. Similarly, some cerumen in the left ear canal. The tympanic membrane – eardrum – appears intact in both ears. Weber test is midline, and Rinne test shows air conduction greater than bone conduction bilaterally. Hearing appears grossly intact, although a formal audiometry would be more definitive. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs briefly. Heart sounds are regular and normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No abnormalities detected.
PATIENT: Okay… that doesn’t sound too bad, I guess? So what does that mean though, Doc? Is it just earwax? Could that be causing it?
DOCTOR: The presence of cerumen could potentially contribute, although it's unlikely to be the sole cause, given the duration and bilateral nature of your symptoms. Given your description and the physical exam, the most likely diagnosis at this stage is tinnitus, possibly exacerbated by noise exposure and stress. The formal term for ringing in the ears. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, just to be thorough. We'll also schedule you for a formal audiometry to assess your hearing sensitivity accurately. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible, and practicing stress reduction techniques such as deep breathing exercises or meditation. We can also discuss over-the-counter options for tinnitus relief, if you’d like. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Okay…tests, alright. Avoiding loud noises…easy enough. Stress reduction…I’ll try. Sounds like a lot though. What kind of over-the-counter stuff are we talking about? And is this something that…will it go away? I need to hear properly for work, Doc. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Mr. Dhanoa, I understand your concerns completely. As for over-the-counter options, there are several preparations marketed for tinnitus relief, often containing ingredients like zinc, magnesium, or herbal extracts such as ginkgo biloba. However, their efficacy is often debated, and individual responses vary considerably. I’m not one to enthusiastically endorse such products without a clear scientific basis. As for whether it will go away…tinnitus can be persistent, but it often improves with time, particularly if the underlying cause can be addressed. In many cases, it becomes more manageable as you learn to cope with it. We'll get these tests done and assess your hearing properly. If the audiometry reveals any hearing loss, we can discuss potential interventions such as hearing aids or tinnitus retraining therapy. If the blood tests are normal, and the tinnitus persists, a referral to an otolaryngologist – an ear, nose, and throat specialist – may be necessary for further evaluation. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay…reasonable, yeah. Tests, specialist if needed. Fine. I guess I just…don't want this hanging over me forever. What about the blood tests? How long will those take? And is there anything I can do right now? Just to make it a bit quieter? This is stressing me out, Doc. A lot.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your distress, Mr. Dhanoa. The blood tests should take approximately 24-48 hours to return. As for immediate relief, unfortunately, there’s no quick fix. However, some people find that white noise – such as a fan or a quiet recording of nature sounds – can help mask the tinnitus and make it less noticeable. Avoiding caffeine and alcohol may also be beneficial, as they can sometimes worsen tinnitus symptoms. I'm going to write you a referral for the audiometry and a requisition for the blood tests. I will also provide you with some information on tinnitus management resources, including websites and support groups. In the meantime, focus on stress reduction techniques – deep breathing, meditation, or simply taking some time for yourself. It's important to manage your stress levels, as they can significantly impact tinnitus symptoms. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No…I think that’s everything. Thanks, Doc. I appreciate you taking the time. It's just…a lot to take in. I'll try the white noise. And stress reduction…I'll really try. I guess I’ll see you after the tests? .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Dhanoa. I’ll review the results as soon as they become available and contact you to discuss them further. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or have any concerns in the meantime. Take care, and I hope you find some relief soon. .
