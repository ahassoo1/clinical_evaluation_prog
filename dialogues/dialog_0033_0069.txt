DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Paguiо, yes. Forty-seven. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s about getting some vaccinations, I think. I got a letter in the mail about it, saying I should come in. Just wanted to make sure I’m all up-to-date, you know? I’m a bit rubbish remembering which ones I’ve had over the years.
DOCTOR: Vaccinations. Yes, well, it’s… prudent to stay current. The letter, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, it was from the clinic, actually. Mentioned a few things I might need, but honestly, it was a bit full of… words. I’m not very good with all the medical stuff. Do you have a list of what they recommend for someone my age? Just so I can see what we’re talking about.
DOCTOR: I suppose I can pull up the standard recommendations. It’s generally tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis… influenza, pneumococcal. And potentially a shingles vaccine, given your age. Though frankly, most people aren't diligent enough to keep track of these things. Let's see… Do you recall ever having a shingles shot?
PATIENT: Shingles… hmm. That rings a bell, but I honestly can’t say for sure. It was probably a long time ago, if I did have it. I get so many things done, it's hard to keep track. Is it one you have to get regularly? Like the flu shot? Because I try to get that every year, mostly because my sister always reminds me.
DOCTOR: It’s a two-dose series, initially, and then a booster after a period of time. And yes, it’s advisable, particularly as your risk increases with age. We’ll check your records, of course, but I doubt we’ll find anything definitive. Let’s see… no record of shingles vaccination here. And it appears you’re also due for a pneumococcal booster. It’s been more than ten years. Do you have any allergies to vaccines, or any reactions in the past?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. And no, I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to a vaccine. I remember getting a lot as a kid, going to school, all that. Just the usual little sore arm, nothing major. Is the pneumococcal booster the one for… chest infections? My neighbor got it and said it really helped with his coughs.
DOCTOR: It protects against pneumococcal pneumonia and other serious infections. It's not a guarantee, of course, but it reduces the risk. Your neighbor's experience is… not uncommon. Alright. We can do both today, if you’d like. It will be two injections. Are you… squeamish?
PATIENT: Oh, two? Well, that’s… not ideal, but if it’s what’s needed, I suppose. And no, I don’t think I’m squeamish, exactly. I don't like needles, who does? But I can handle it. Just let me know before you do it, okay? I prefer a bit of warning, if that’s alright. And maybe… don’t tell me how big the needle is?
DOCTOR: Very well. No unnecessary details. I’ll inform you before each injection. We’ll start with the pneumococcal. Please roll up your sleeve. Just a small pinch, and it will be over quickly. And frankly, the anticipation is always worse than the actual sensation.
PATIENT: Okay, here goes… Right, I’m ready when you are. Just… don’t rush it, if you don’t mind. I don’t need any surprises.
DOCTOR: There. That was it. Minimal discomfort, I assure you. A small bandage, and you’ll be fine. Now, for the other one. This one is for… tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Roll up your other sleeve.
PATIENT: Okay, here we go again. Honestly, this is a bit much all at once, don't you think? I usually space them out a little. But… alright. Just try and be gentle, please? And maybe tell me when you’re about to do it this time? A little warning would be nice.
DOCTOR: There. Both done. Minimal risk of adverse reaction, though some soreness is to be expected. Avoid strenuous activity with that arm for the next few hours. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Finished then. Soreness, right. Well, that's always fun. No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Just wanted to get those vaccinations done. Thank you… I think. Where do I go to schedule a follow-up, if I need one?
DOCTOR: Reception will schedule any necessary follow-up. Though it’s unlikely to be required, unless you develop a severe reaction. A handout with post-vaccination instructions is available at the desk as well. Good day.
PATIENT: Right. Okay. Thank you. .
