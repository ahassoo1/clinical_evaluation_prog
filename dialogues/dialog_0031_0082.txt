DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, nice to meet you too, I think. Something about…travel? My wife, she, uh…she booked this. Said I need…shots. For going somewhere. I don’t remember where. Just…travel. Is that right? I work with the planes, you know. Lots of small parts. Not…flying on them though.
DOCTOR: Alright, travel vaccinations, yes. That makes sense. It's good your wife is thinking ahead. To help me determine which vaccinations you might need, could you tell me a bit more about where you might be travelling to, even if it's just a general region?
PATIENT: Region… uh… she said something about… mountains? And… cold. Very cold. Not like the cold at work, but… colder. Somewhere far away. Lots of… people with different faces. That's all I really remember. She did all the planning, you see. I just… build things. Small things. Very important small things for the planes. Don't ask me about the places, I forget everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your wife has handled most of the details. Let me see if I can pull up any travel plans associated with your name... Ah, yes. Here we are. It appears you and your wife are scheduled to travel to Nepal in approximately three weeks, for a trekking expedition in the Himalayas. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Nepal…? Oh. Yes. That sounds right. The mountains… that's it! Nepal. She always liked Nepal. Said it reminded her of…home. She was from… somewhere like that, wasn't she? It's all a bit… fuzzy. Trekking… that means walking a lot, right? I don't…do a lot of walking. Mostly just…bending over small parts. Are the shots painful? Because I don't like needles. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Yes, Nepal. A beautiful country. And yes, trekking involves quite a bit of walking. We can discuss that later, and I can offer some advice to help you prepare. As for the shots… well, they do involve a brief pinch. The discomfort is usually very brief, and the benefits of protecting yourself from potentially serious illnesses far outweigh the temporary discomfort. Before we get to the specifics of vaccinations, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Oh, boy. Uh… I don't get sick much. Never really have. Mostly just… small cuts at work. Nothing serious. The parts are small, you see. Sometimes they’re sharp. My wife always took care of everything if I did get sick. She had a… a special medicine bag. Lots of… things in it. She knew what to do. I… I don't know what I have been seen for. I just… build things. Do you need names of the parts? I know all the part numbers.
DOCTOR: No, part numbers aren't necessary. It’s alright if you don’t remember details. We’ll do our best to figure things out. Have you ever had any serious illnesses, like pneumonia, tuberculosis, or hepatitis?
PATIENT: Pneumonia… tuberculosis… hepatitis…? No. Sounds… bad. I don’t think so. I remember a fever once, when I was a little boy, but my mother, she gave me some tea and it went away. Mostly just… cuts. Small, annoying cuts. And a broken finger once, at work. But it healed. She… my wife, she made sure it healed properly. Always very careful. Is this important? Are you trying to find something wrong with me? Because I feel fine. Mostly. Just…tired sometimes. Work is long hours. Small parts, very important small parts.
DOCTOR: No, I’m not trying to find anything wrong with you. We simply need to make sure we don’t administer any vaccinations that might be unsafe given your medical background. It’s standard procedure. Let's try this: Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else, like insect bites?
PATIENT: Allergic… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat… rice. And noodles. Sometimes meat. Nothing fancy. My wife, she cooked everything. She asked about allergies once, a long time ago. I told her… no. I don’t think so. Insect bites… mosquitoes, yes. Lots of mosquitoes where we work. They itch. I just… scratch them. Nothing serious. She had a cream for the itching. I don’t remember the name. Is this… is this going to take long? I have to get back to work. Small parts are waiting. Very important.
DOCTOR: We’re almost finished with the questions, Mr. Tayar. Just a few more. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications…? No. Just…tea. Sometimes, when I’m tired. My wife, she made special tea. Lots of herbs in it. Helps me focus. For the small parts, you see. Very important small parts. I don’t… take anything from the doctor. Never have. She, my wife, she always knew what to do. She had the bag. The special medicine bag. Is this about her? Are you asking about her? Because she… she’s not here anymore. And I’m not very good at remembering things. Especially not now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tayar. I apologize if my questions are upsetting. I didn't realize… It sounds like your wife played a very important role in your healthcare. And it's perfectly alright if you're finding it difficult to recall details. We can skip the questions for now if that’s easier. But to ensure your safety for the trip to Nepal, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical…? Oh. Alright. If you must. Quick is good. Very quick. I have to get back. Small parts are waiting. They’re very important, you see. Very, very important. I don’t… I don’t like doctors much. She always came with me. She knew what to ask. She knew what they were looking for. But… if you must. Just… be quick, please. And don't ask me about part numbers. I know all of them, but it won’t help.
DOCTOR: Of course. We will be as quick as possible. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. Alright, Mr. Tayar, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in... and out... Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 138/82, but not alarming. We can monitor that. Now, I’ll just check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Finally, I'll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears and throat look clear. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. I did note slightly elevated blood pressure, which is something we should keep an eye on, but it's not an immediate concern.
PATIENT: Elevated…? Oh. She always checked my blood pressure. Said it was… normal, usually. Unless I was stressed. Small parts can be stressful. Lots of responsibility, you see. Very important small parts. What about the shots? Are we getting to the shots now? Because I really don’t like needles. She always held my hand. She said I was brave. But… I’m not very brave without her. Can we skip the shots? Maybe just… take some pills? She had pills for everything. Everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, it sounds like you are understandably upset and anxious. It’s perfectly alright to feel this way. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to make this process as comfortable as possible. Now, regarding the vaccinations for Nepal, they are highly recommended to protect you from several potentially serious illnesses, including typhoid, hepatitis A, and potentially rabies, depending on your activities. Skipping them would put you at risk. As for pills instead of shots, unfortunately, there are no pills that provide the same level of protection against these specific diseases. Before we proceed, I would like to recommend you speak with a grief counselor. You’ve experienced a significant loss, and it’s important to have support during this difficult time. I can provide you with a referral. But first, let's talk about the vaccinations. We can discuss each one, and I can explain the potential side effects. We can also talk about ways to manage your anxiety, like deep breathing exercises, and I promise to be as gentle as possible. Would you like to do that?
PATIENT: Counselor…? No. I don't…need a counselor. I just need to get back to work. Small parts are waiting. They’re… very important. And I really, really don’t like needles. She always said I was brave, but she’s not here anymore. And I forget everything. Everything. Look, can we just… do one shot? Just one? And then I can go? I promise to be very quiet. And I won’t move. Just… one shot. For the mountains. For Nepal. And then I can go back to the small parts. Please? Just one. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. We can start with one shot. We'll administer the typhoid vaccine first, as it's particularly important for travel to Nepal. I promise to be as gentle and quick as possible. I’m going to clean the injection site on your upper arm with an alcohol swab. You may feel a brief pinch, and then a slight burning sensation. It should subside within a few minutes. I'll be right here with you the entire time. There you go... almost done... just a tiny pinch... and it's all finished. See?
PATIENT: Ouch… That wasn’t… pleasant. Is it…over? Really over? My arm feels…funny. Is it supposed to feel funny? She always put a cold pack on afterwards. She knew what to do. Is it going to hurt later? I need to get back to work. Small parts are waiting. They’re… very important. Can I go now? Please? Just let me go back to the small parts. I promise I won’t forget them. They need me.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tayar, it’s over. You were very brave. And it’s normal for your arm to feel a little sore and tender. That’s just a sign that your body is building immunity. We can apply a cold pack if you’d like. However, before you go, I strongly recommend we schedule a follow-up appointment to administer the remaining recommended vaccinations, including hepatitis A and potentially rabies, depending on your planned activities. I also want to reiterate my recommendation for grief counseling. It sounds like you’re still grieving, and it's important to have support during this difficult time. I can provide you with a referral, or I can recommend some online resources. But, if you absolutely insist on going now, I will provide you with written instructions on how to care for the injection site and a list of potential side effects to watch out for. I will also provide you with contact information in case you have any concerns. But please, consider scheduling that follow-up appointment. Your health is important. Here is the aftercare information. And please, take it easy today. And if you start to feel unwell, please don't hesitate to contact us. Now, let's get you checked out. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… need to go. Small parts are waiting. Really important. She always said I was good at building things. Very good. But they need me now. I… I don't think I can schedule anything. Too much. Too busy. Just… let me go. Thank you. Small parts… very important… must build…
DOCTOR: I hope he'll be alright. .
PATIENT: .
