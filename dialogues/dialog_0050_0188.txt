DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Secondi. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. I... my pee is orange. It started a few days ago. I don't know why. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: I see. Orange urine, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… not bright orange, but you can definitely tell it’s not normal. I drink water, I think enough water. Not too much soda. I don’t know what to think.
DOCTOR: "Think enough water" is rather imprecise, Mr. Secondi. Could you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Quantify? Um… maybe two liters a day? Sometimes less. I don’t really measure it. I just drink when I’m thirsty. Is that bad? Should I be drinking more?
DOCTOR: Two liters, occasionally less. We’ll address hydration. Now, aside from the color change, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, no… feeling sick. Just the orange pee. I feel normal otherwise. My wife said I should come, just in case. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: A prudent wife. Are you experiencing any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? You mean…pooping? No, nothing different there. Regular as always, I guess. Sorry, I don’t usually talk about this with doctors. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It can be, Mr. Secondi. The liver and gallbladder, which process waste, can sometimes manifest symptoms in both urine and stool. It helps me to build a complete picture. Now, have you noticed any yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes?
PATIENT: Yellowing? No, I don't think so. My wife would have said something. She notices everything. I look the same as always, I think. I haven't really looked closely. Maybe a little tired, but I work long hours. It could be that.
DOCTOR: Long hours. We'll get to that, I'm sure. Now, let's discuss your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions—anything at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was a kid. But nothing serious, nothing the doctor ever told me I needed to remember. I'm pretty healthy, usually. I think.
DOCTOR: No significant past medical history. Any surgical procedures?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Not even tonsils out or anything. I'm not a surgery kind of person. I don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Now, your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, liver problems… anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… my father had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother, on my mother's side, she had… something with her stomach. I don't remember exactly what. She passed away a long time ago. My mother doesn't talk about it much. It was a sad time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. I don’t like it. And maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not every night. And definitely no drugs. I work hard, I don’t have time for that. My wife would kill me.
DOCTOR: And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can take most medicines fine, I think. Well, I got a rash once from some bug bite, but that's not a medicine, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Secondi. Now, if you would be so kind, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. We’ll start with your abdomen, then check your skin tone. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: No, no objections. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie flat on your back. I'm going to palpate your abdomen now. This may be slightly uncomfortable. Let me know if you feel any pain. Now, breathe deeply... any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It feels... normal. A little pressure, but no pain. Maybe a little… sensitive on the right side, but I don't know if that's normal. I ate a big lunch. Is that the liver area? I read something about that online.
DOCTOR: Indeed it is. I am noting some mild tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant. Your liver does seem slightly enlarged, though it is difficult to say definitively without further investigation. Normal bowel sounds… no murmurs or bruits detected. Now, let’s examine your skin tone. Please roll up your sleeves and let me assess for jaundice. I am also noting a slight yellowing of your sclera… very subtle, but present.
PATIENT: Yellowing? Oh. My wife… she probably noticed that. That doesn’t sound good, does it? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I have to get back to work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: It's too early to definitively say, Mr. Secondi. The yellowing, or jaundice, coupled with the enlarged liver and tenderness, does suggest a possible issue with your liver or biliary system. However, there are numerous potential causes, and we must rule out several possibilities before reaching a diagnosis. We will need to order some blood tests—a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a bilirubin level—to assess the extent of the problem. I would also like to order an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. Do you have any questions before I proceed with these orders?
PATIENT: Ultrasound… and blood tests. Okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Will the blood tests take long? And… is it definitely something bad? I mean, could it be something… simple? Like, from the lunch?
DOCTOR: While a large meal can certainly cause temporary digestive upset, Mr. Secondi, it is highly unlikely to cause jaundice and an enlarged liver. The blood tests will take approximately 24 to 48 hours for results. The ultrasound will require a separate appointment, which we can schedule for tomorrow morning. Until we have these results, it's difficult to say definitively the cause. It could be something relatively minor, such as a temporary blockage, but we must rule out more serious conditions, such as hepatitis or, in rarer cases, a more significant liver pathology. I will write you a referral for the ultrasound, and the lab technician will provide you with instructions for the blood work. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding alcohol and fatty foods. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay. No alcohol, no fatty foods. I understand. So… tomorrow for the ultrasound. And then we wait for the blood tests. It’s… a lot. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you checking things out. I guess I'll go home and try not to worry too much. Is it okay if I ask you questions when I get the results?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Secondi. We will review the results together when they are available, and I will answer any questions you may have. However, I must caution you against self-diagnosing based on information found online. It is often inaccurate and can cause unnecessary anxiety. The front desk will assist you with scheduling the ultrasound and provide the necessary lab requisition. I will see you tomorrow, then. And please, do try to rest.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor. .
