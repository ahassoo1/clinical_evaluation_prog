DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a shaking. In my hands, mostly. It’s been… well, I don’t rightly know how long. Seems worse lately, that’s all. I just want to get it looked at, if you don't mind. Don’t have much time to fuss with it, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik, I understand. A shaking, primarily in your hands, and it's been worsening recently. That’s a good reason to get it checked out. When you say it’s been going on for a while, could you try to give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… oh dear. Months, I suppose. Maybe… six? Eight? It’s hard to say. Things blur, you know how it is. It didn't bother me much at first, just a little tremble when I was… doing things. Fine things. Like… tightening bolts at the plant. Now it happens more often, even when I’m just sitting.
DOCTOR: Alright, six to eight months, starting with fine movements and progressing to occur even at rest. That’s helpful. And you mentioned tightening bolts at the plant – are you currently working, or is this something from a previous job?
PATIENT: Still at it, yes. Water treatment. Been doing it… a long time. Sixty years, maybe more. Hard to keep track. Keeps me busy, at least. Though, this shaking… it’s making some things a bit tricky. Especially with the valves.
DOCTOR: I see. Sixty years at the water treatment plant – that's quite a commitment. And the shaking is impacting your ability to work with the valves. Do you notice anything else that makes the shaking worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Stress, I think. When things aren't going right at the plant, it gets bad. And… cold. Cold weather definitely doesn't help. Makes it harder to control. I try not to think about it too much, just keep working.
DOCTOR: Okay, so stress and cold weather seem to exacerbate the shaking. That’s good information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Well, now that you mention it… sometimes my writing gets smaller. Harder to read, even for me. And… I feel a bit stiff sometimes. Especially in my right arm. But, honestly, I figured that was just old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so smaller handwriting and some stiffness, particularly in your right arm. Those are important details. Have you noticed any changes in your balance, or have you had any falls?
PATIENT: Falls… not recently, no. A bit wobbly sometimes, I suppose. Especially when I’m tired. But nothing serious. I'm careful, you see. Used to being on my feet all day. My wife… she used to worry, but she's gone now.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Jezik. It’s understandable that you’re careful, given your years on your feet. And the wobble, especially when tired, is something we should consider. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. That’s… a long list. High blood pressure, I think. And… something with my heart, a long time ago. They fixed it, though. Had a little operation. Don’t remember much else. Honestly, I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and a heart operation in the past. We'll need to look into the details of those. Do you recall what year you had the heart operation?
PATIENT: Year… hmm. That’s… difficult. Must have been… the nineties? Early nineties, maybe. A long time ago. It was at… City Hospital, I think. They kept me in for a week or so. I was just glad to get home, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, City Hospital in the early nineties for a heart operation. I'll make a note to check our records for that. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I haven’t taken much in the way of medicine, to be honest. Just… aspirin, sometimes, for headaches. Never had a reaction, though. My wife always handled the pills, so I wasn't too involved.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you’re currently taking aspirin as needed for headaches. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Quit that habit decades ago. Too expensive, and bad for your lungs. Drink… a beer now and then. With dinner, maybe. Just one. Nothing fancy. And no, nothing else. Never had much use for strong stuff. Keeps me steady, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, former smoker, one beer with dinner, and no other substances. That’s good to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and take a look at your hands and how you move. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Get it over with, if you don't mind. I have things to do, you see. Just… try to be quick, if you could.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please sit here, and I’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 145/85. Your pulse is 78 and regular. I'm noticing a slight tremor in both of your hands, more pronounced on the right side. The tremor seems to be present even at rest, and it increases slightly with movement. I also notice some mild rigidity in your right arm. Your reflexes are normal, and your gait is steady, though a little slow. I'll need to document these findings.
PATIENT: Sounds… bad? Is it serious, Doctor? I just want to know if I need to worry about… stopping work. That's all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, it’s understandable you're concerned. The tremor and rigidity we're seeing, along with the stiffness and handwriting changes you mentioned, could suggest a few possibilities. One common cause would be essential tremor, which is often benign and doesn't necessarily worsen over time. However, given your age and the combination of symptoms, we also need to consider Parkinson’s disease. It’s too early to say definitively, and more testing is required. Stopping work immediately isn't necessary, but I recommend we get some further investigations done to understand the cause of your symptoms. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out other conditions and potentially a referral to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A neurologist…? Oh dear. More doctors… Honestly, I'm not good with all these tests and specialists. But… if you think it's necessary. I suppose. Just… try to keep it simple, if you could. And quickly. The plant needs me, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Jezik. I’ll do my best to streamline the process and keep things as simple as possible. The neurologist is the best person to evaluate these types of symptoms thoroughly. I will send a referral with my initial findings. The blood tests I am ordering will help rule out other possible causes like thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. To start, I will have the nurse draw a standard metabolic panel, a complete blood count, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and vitamin B12 and D levels. These tests will give us a good baseline. The neurologist may order additional tests like a DaTscan, which is a specialized imaging scan of the brain. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you continue your regular activities as much as possible, but be mindful of any tasks that are particularly difficult or dangerous due to the tremor. Are you able to modify your work tasks if needed?
PATIENT: Modify… Hmm. The foreman, he’s a good lad. I could ask him for lighter duties, maybe. Less valve work, more… paperwork. Though I hate paperwork. But… if it means keeping my job… yes. I could try that. I suppose.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a good plan, Mr. Jezik. Communication with your foreman is a sensible first step. I will write a note for your primary care physician detailing my concerns and recommendations, including the potential for modified work duties. I will also give you a copy for your records. To summarize, we've discussed the tremor in your hands, stiffness, changes in handwriting, and your concern about maintaining your employment. We’re ordering blood tests and a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. I'll also write a note suggesting you discuss modified work tasks with your foreman. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… when will I hear back about the tests? And how long does all this take? I really need to know if I'm going to be able to keep working.
DOCTOR: The blood tests should be processed within a few days, and I will contact you directly as soon as the results are available. Typically, that's within a week, but sometimes it can take a little longer. As for the neurologist appointment, scheduling can vary. I'll have the nurse send the referral immediately, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. It usually takes a few weeks to get an appointment, but the nurse can inquire about any cancellation slots to expedite the process. I understand your concern about your employment, and I will do everything I can to get you answers as quickly as possible. The neurologist will be able to provide a more definitive diagnosis and discuss potential treatment options if needed. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… not making me feel like an old fool.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. It’s my job to listen and provide the best possible care, and you’re not an old fool at all. You're proactive about your health, and that’s admirable. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood samples and provide you with the referral paperwork. If you have any questions after you leave, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye. .
