DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagarís. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Chagarís, is it? Well, honestly… I’m not entirely sure. My daughter, bless her heart, thought I should come. Said I’ve been… well, she used the word “forgetful.” I just thought I was getting older, you know? It’s not like I need anything done, I just… wanted to see what all the fuss was about, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Calvery. It’s very common to experience some changes in memory as we age, and it’s always a good idea to get things checked out, especially if it’s causing concern for you or your family. Your daughter is very thoughtful to encourage you to come in. To help me understand what’s been going on, could you tell me a bit more about what she—or you—have noticed specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, she worries so. Always has. Let me see… specifically… Hmm. It's not like I can't function, you understand. I still get up, I still cook… mostly. But… things. Names, mostly. And where I put things. I’ll be looking for my glasses, and… well, they’re usually on my head. Silly, isn’t it? And sometimes… I blank on what I was saying mid-sentence. It's just… frustrating. Not a big deal, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Calvery. Those are certainly common concerns, and it's good you're able to articulate them. It is frustrating when those little things happen. It sounds like you're still very capable, which is excellent. To get a better picture, could you tell me roughly when you started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… that's a tough one. It's not like there was a specific day, you know? It's been… gradual. Maybe… a year or so? Possibly longer? Honestly, Doctor, time just sort of… blurs together these days. I used to be so organized, kept everything in its place. Now… it's just a bit of a mess. But I’ve always been busy, you know? Raising a family, working… a surgical tech for… oh, a long time. It just feels like my brain is… slowing down, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mrs. Calvery. A busy life certainly keeps you going, and it’s common for things to feel a bit more challenging as we age. It sounds like these changes have been happening gradually over the past year or so. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality lately?
PATIENT: Mood? Oh, I don't know about changes. I’m usually… pragmatic. Realistic. I don’t get overly excited about things, you know? And I certainly don’t get upset easily. Though… sometimes I find myself… a little impatient. Especially with people who are… well, not very bright. My daughter says I’m more critical than I used to be, but honestly, some people just don’t try. I suppose that's my personality though, always have been a bit of a… straight shooter. I just don't see the point of pretending things are better than they are. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mrs. Calvery. It sounds like your core personality remains very much intact, which is reassuring. A little impatience is perfectly normal, too. Now, thinking about your past medical history, do you have any significant medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out… a long time ago. And arthritis, of course. Who doesn’t have arthritis at my age? It's mostly in my hands, makes gardening a bit difficult. And… high blood pressure, I think. I take a pill for that. A little orange one. I can't remember the name of it, though. I used to be very good with names, but… well, you know. Nothing else… I think. I had a nasty flu a few years back, but I recovered just fine. And the usual things, you know? Colds, sniffles… Nothing major. I haven’t been to the doctor much in recent years. Didn’t see the point, really. If it ain’t broke…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery, that’s very helpful. So, gallbladder removal in the past, arthritis, and high blood pressure managed with an orange pill. We’ll try to get the name of that medication shortly. It's good you've been generally healthy otherwise. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… besides the gallbladder… hmmm… there was… a small procedure on my knee, years ago. Something about a torn cartilage, I think. It didn’t really fix anything, though. Just a bit of pain relief for a while. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy, a long, long time ago. When I was still quite young, actually. But that was… decades ago. Really, nothing much else. Just the usual bumps and bruises, you know? I’ve always been quite… resilient. Never one to complain. Though I will say, this arthritis is getting to be a nuisance. It's hard to get around sometimes. But that's just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a hysterectomy many years ago, a knee procedure for a torn cartilage that didn't provide much relief, and the gallbladder removal. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, to get a full picture, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a tricky one. My mother… she lived to be quite old, actually. Ninety-something, I think. She was always very… stoic. Didn’t complain much. She did have some… memory problems towards the end, though. Not as bad as mine, I don’t think. My father… he died young, from a heart attack. My sister… she’s still alive, but we’re not very close. She lives far away. As for other relatives… I don’t really know much about their medical history. We weren’t a very close-knit family, you see. Everyone just sort of… did their own thing. I don’t think there was much Alzheimer’s or dementia in the family, but I honestly couldn’t say for sure. It's not something we talked about much. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mrs. Calvery. It sounds like your mother had some memory issues later in life, and your father passed away from a heart attack. It’s common for family medical history to be a bit vague, so don't worry about it. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I live alone, as I mentioned. My husband passed away several years ago. I keep busy, though. I garden, when the arthritis allows. I read a lot. Mostly mysteries. And I watch television. I used to volunteer at the library, but I had to stop when my knees started bothering me. I eat pretty well, I think. Lots of vegetables. I don't drink or smoke. And I try to get some exercise, but it's difficult with this pain. Mostly just walking around the house. I don’t really socialize much. My daughter visits when she can, but she’s very busy with her work and her family. It’s a quiet life, but I’m content. I don’t need much to keep me happy, you see. A good book, a cup of tea, and a bit of sunshine. That’s all I ask for. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mrs. Calvery. It sounds like you lead a very independent and active life, despite some challenges with arthritis. It’s good you stay engaged with reading and gardening. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, besides the orange pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… besides the orange one… I take something for the arthritis. A little white pill. I think it’s naproxen, or something like that. It doesn’t help much, to be honest. Just takes the edge off. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take a pain reliever. Tylenol, usually. Nothing else, I think. Oh! And I take a vitamin D supplement. My daughter told me I should, said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a blur. I have so many little pills, it’s hard to keep track of them all. That’s probably why I forget things! Too many medications messing with my brain, you see? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mrs. Calvery. So, an orange pill for blood pressure, a white pill for arthritis , Tylenol as needed for knee pain, and a vitamin D supplement. It is possible for medications to have side effects, including memory issues, though it’s not always the cause. Alright, Mrs. Calvery, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any other potential causes for your concerns. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, if you think it’s necessary. I’ve never been one for doctors, to be honest. Always seemed like a waste of time. But if you think it will help… go ahead. Just be gentle, my knees are a bit sensitive. And don’t expect much, I’m not in very good shape, you see. But I suppose I should cooperate. After all, my daughter would be very upset if I didn’t. Just tell me what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Calvery. We'll take things very slowly and gently. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and take a look at your reflexes. I'll also do a brief neurological exam to assess your memory and coordination. Please just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. First, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Alright. <I slowly extend my arm, wincing slightly.> There. Be careful, it’s a bit tender. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know why you need to check it again. We already went over this. But if you insist… go ahead. Just don’t squeeze too tight, alright? It feels like a vise sometimes. <I shift uncomfortably in the chair.>
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery. Just relax and take some deep breaths. <I inflate and deflate the cuff, carefully reading the numbers. After a moment, I remove the cuff.> Your blood pressure is 138/82. That’s slightly elevated, but not overly concerning. We can discuss managing that later if needed. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Alright. <I take a slow, deliberate deep breath in, followed by a slow exhale.> There. Is that alright? I always feel a bit silly when you listen to my chest. It feels like… an invasion of privacy, you know? But I suppose it’s necessary. Just tell me if you hear anything strange. And please, don’t take too long. My lungs aren’t what they used to be, you see. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit. It was the best thing I ever did. But it did damage my lungs, I’m sure of it. <I cough lightly.>
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and I didn’t hear any unusual sounds. Your lungs are clear, though I can hear a slight wheeze, which could be due to your past smoking history. It's good you quit, Mrs. Calvery! Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please sit back and relax. I’ll gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. It might be a bit surprising, but it shouldn’t be painful. Is that alright?
PATIENT: <I shift slightly in my chair, looking wary.> Alright. But be gentle, Doctor, I mean it. My knees are very sensitive, you know. I don’t want you to hurt them. And please, don’t hit me too hard. It feels… undignified, you see? Having someone hit your knees with a hammer. But if you insist… go ahead. Just be quick about it, alright? And tell me if it hurts. <I tense my legs slightly.>
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery. <I observe your reflexes.> Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common at your age. Nothing to be overly concerned about. Now, I'd like to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory. This isn't a test, just a way for me to get a better understanding of your cognitive function. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, questions. Wonderful. <I sigh lightly.> Very well. But please, don't ask me anything too complicated. My brain isn't what it used to be, you see. And if I forget something, please don't get upset. It happens. Just ask me again, alright? And please, speak slowly and clearly. I don't hear very well, either. Go ahead, ask your questions. Just try not to make me feel too foolish, alright? <I cross my arms and look slightly apprehensive.>
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Calvery. We’ll take things very slowly, and there are no wrong answers. First, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: <I pause, furrowing my brow. I glance around the room as if looking for a clue.> Oh, goodness. The year… Let me see… Is it… 2023? No, wait… It must be… 2024? No… I always get confused. Is it August already? Oh dear. <I sigh again.> I honestly can't remember. I think it’s… 2025? I think my daughter told me it was 2025. But I'm not very sure. It's all a blur, you see? It feels like yesterday was 2020… or was it 2010? <I shake my head.> I really can’t remember. Is that alright? I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mrs. Calvery. It’s common to have some difficulty with dates. Let’s move on to the next question. Can you tell me the names of three objects in this room?
PATIENT: <I look around the room, scanning the various objects with a somewhat bewildered expression. I point hesitantly at a chair.> Um… that’s a… chair. And… <I look around again, squinting.> That’s a… a lamp. And… <I pause, struggling to find a third object. I point at the window.> That’s a… window. Is that alright? They're not very interesting objects, you see. Are you sure you want me to name them? I'm probably getting them wrong. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good at this. My brain is just… foggy. <I shift uncomfortably in my chair.>
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Mrs. Calvery. You’ve named three objects correctly. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words that I'm going to say. Please try to remember them, and I’ll ask you to repeat them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: <I nod slowly, looking slightly apprehensive.> Alright… I suppose so. But please, don’t make them too difficult. And speak slowly and clearly. I have trouble remembering things, you see. And if I forget them, please don’t get upset. Just tell me again, alright? Go ahead, say your words. I’ll try my best. <I take a deep breath and focus my attention.>
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please try to remember those words. I'll ask you to repeat them in a few moments. Take your time.
PATIENT: <I repeat the words softly under my breath.> Apple… table… penny. <I close my eyes for a moment, trying to visualize the words. I open them again, looking slightly uncertain.> Apple… table… and… um… <I pause, struggling to recall the third word. I frown.> Something shiny… a coin? No… What was it? It started with a… <I sigh again, looking frustrated.> I’m so sorry. I’ve already forgotten it. My brain is just… terrible. Is that alright? I really try, but it just… slips away. What was the third word, Doctor? Please, tell me again. <I look pleadingly at you.>
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mrs. Calvery. It's very common to have some difficulty with short-term memory. The third word was penny. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions about your daily life. This will help me get a better understanding of your overall functioning. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh, more questions? <I sigh softly, but nod slowly.> Alright, I suppose so. But please, don’t ask me anything too complicated. I have trouble remembering things, you see. And if I forget something, please don’t get upset. Just tell me again, alright? Go ahead, ask your questions. Just try not to make me feel too foolish, alright? <I cross my arms and look slightly apprehensive.>
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Calvery. We'll keep it simple. First, can you tell me what day of the week it is today?
PATIENT: <I pause, furrowing my brow and glancing around the room as if searching for a calendar. I tap my chin thoughtfully.> Oh, goodness. The day of the week… Let me see… Is it… Wednesday? No, that doesn’t feel right. Is it… Friday? No… <I sigh softly, looking frustrated.> Honestly, Doctor, I have no idea. It’s all a blur. It feels like yesterday was Sunday, or was it Tuesday? I really can’t remember. <I shake my head.> I'm so sorry. I really try, but it just… slips away. Is that alright? <I look pleadingly at you.>
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mrs. Calvery. It’s very common to have some difficulty with days of the week. Now, can you tell me your full name?
PATIENT: <I pause for a moment, concentrating. I frown slightly as if searching my memory. My full name… Oh dear. That’s… Lilly… Lilly… <I tap my chin thoughtfully. That’s my first name, isn’t it? Lilly… and… Calvery. Yes, Calvery. <I pause again, struggling to recall my middle name. Oh… it's… it’s… Oh dear, I’ve forgotten my middle name. I used to know it so well. <I sigh softly, looking frustrated. I know I have a middle name, but it just won’t come to me. Lilly… Calvery. Is that alright? <I look pleadingly at you.>
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mrs. Calvery. It’s not uncommon to have some difficulty with recall. We’ll proceed. Alright, Mrs. Calvery, I think I have enough information for now. Thank you for your patience. I’d like to discuss my findings with you and formulate a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Oh, a plan? <I nod slowly, looking relieved.> Yes, that sounds good. Honestly, Doctor, I’m glad it’s almost over. This has been… exhausting. I just hope it’s not anything too serious. I’m not very good with doctors, you see. And I don’t like being told what to do. But if you think a plan is a good idea… alright. Just please, don’t make it too complicated. And try not to use too many big words. <I take a deep breath and look hopeful.> Just tell me what you think, Doctor. And I’ll try my best to cooperate. Is that alright? <I look pleadingly at you.>
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Calvery. I'll keep it simple and straightforward. Based on our conversation and the brief examination, you are experiencing some memory difficulties, which is not uncommon at your age. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further testing. However, your symptoms don't suggest anything immediately alarming. It's likely a combination of normal age-related changes, and possibly some mild cognitive impairment. I recommend a few things. First, I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory problems, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. Second, I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. They can perform specific tests to assess your memory and thinking skills. Finally, I recommend engaging in activities that stimulate your brain, such as reading, puzzles, or social interaction. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work and a neurologist? <I sigh softly and frown slightly.> Honestly, Doctor, that sounds… complicated. I don’t like going to lots of different doctors. And I don’t like having blood taken. But… if you think it’s necessary… alright. I suppose I can do it. But please, don’t make me go too often. And try to find a neurologist who is… gentle. I don’t like doctors who are… brusque. <I pause, thinking for a moment.> And as for stimulating my brain… I do read, sometimes. And I do try to socialize, when I can. But it’s hard, you see. I get tired easily. <I sigh again.> Alright, I suppose I can try to do more. But please, don’t expect too much. I’m an old woman, you see. <I look pleadingly at you.> Is that alright? <I nod slowly.>
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Calvery. We'll take things at your pace. I understand your concerns, and we won't rush into anything. I’ll write you a referral to a neurologist who is known for being gentle and patient. And I’ll order the blood work, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. The blood work is just to rule out any other possible causes, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. I’ll also provide you with a list of activities that can help stimulate your brain, and you can choose whichever ones you enjoy. We’ll discuss the results of the blood work and the neurologist’s evaluation at your next appointment, and we’ll formulate a more specific plan based on those results. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… better. Yes, much better. A list of activities… I suppose I can look at that. And a gentle neurologist… that’s good. I appreciate that. <I nod slowly, looking relieved.> So, just a list and a neurologist… and the blood work. Alright. I can do that. <I pause, thinking for a moment.> When will my next appointment be? And how long will the blood work take? And how will I get to the neurologist? I don’t drive anymore, you see. <I look pleadingly at you.> I just hope this doesn’t become too complicated. <I sigh softly.> Alright. Let’s just get it over with. <I nod slowly.> Thank you, Doctor. <I smile weakly.>
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Calvery. We’ll take care of everything step-by-step. I’ll schedule your next appointment for six weeks from today. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work, and it should only take about 30 minutes. As for getting to the neurologist, my office can help you arrange transportation. We have a list of reliable transportation services that we work with. I'll also provide you with a written summary of our conversation and the recommendations, so you have everything in writing. I'll give you the referral, the lab order, and the list of transportation services before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. Arranging transportation… that’s good. I appreciate that. <I pause, thinking for a moment.> Hmm… I suppose not. No, I don’t think so. I’m just… overwhelmed. <I sigh softly.> I think that’s all for now. Just the list, the referral, and the transportation… Alright. <I nod slowly, looking relieved.> Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been… very patient with me. <I smile weakly.> I hope this all works out. <I look pleadingly at you.> Alright. Let’s just get it over with. <I nod slowly.> Thank you, Doctor. <I stand up slowly, looking tired.> I think I’m ready to go now. <I smile weakly.> Thank you. <I nod slowly.>
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Calvery. It was my pleasure. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Here are the documents you need. And my nurse will walk you out. Take care, Mrs. Calvery, and I look forward to seeing you in six weeks.
