DOCTOR: Good morning, Thyra. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Tosca. Nice to meet you too. Well, I don't really need anything, I just need to get some forms filled out for Medicare. They said I needed to come see a doctor to get them signed off on. It's kinda silly, but here I am!
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Thyra. It's quite common, actually. Medicare often requires a physician's signature for certain forms. No problem at all – happy to help get those completed for you. Before we just sign off on everything, though, I always like to briefly review a patient's medical history, just to be thorough. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s perfectly fine. I don’t have much of a history, honestly. I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I work out on the reservation, mostly fixing things – pipes, valves, that sort of stuff. Keeps me moving, you know? But yeah, go ahead and ask whatever you need to.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Staying active is great! Let's start with the basics then. You mentioned working on the reservation – do you have a primary care physician out there?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. There's a clinic, but it’s more for when you’re sick sick, if that makes sense. It's not like having a regular doctor you see all the time. I usually just handle things myself, or my husband helps if it’s something bigger. We mostly just try to stay healthy and avoid needing to go in.
DOCTOR: I understand. Many people in rural areas face that situation. Okay. Have you been hospitalized for any reason in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never been in the hospital. Not even as a kid. Just a few broken bones here and there from being clumsy, but nothing serious enough for a hospital visit. My grandma always had home remedies for everything, and they usually worked just fine.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Good for your grandma! Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries either. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Or maybe it’s just good genes! I try to be careful at work, but sometimes accidents happen. Thankfully, nothing that needed a doctor to cut me open!
DOCTOR: That's excellent news, Thyra. Let's talk about family history then. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that your family members have been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mom had high blood pressure when she got older, and my grandpa on my dad's side had some problems with his heart. But other than that, not really. A lot of my family lived long, healthy lives, mostly doing outdoor work. We're Blackfeet, you know? We used to live off the land for generations. I don't really know much beyond that, honestly. We didn't talk about those things a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And it's understandable that those conversations weren't always common. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to eat pretty healthy, and get enough sleep. Sometimes I take ibuprofen if my back is bothering me from work, but that’s about it. Really, that’s it. I'm not much of a medicine person.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No current medications. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies either. I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve always been lucky that way. My husband is the one with allergies, poor thing! He has to watch out for pollen and stuff. But me? I’m good.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s all very helpful, Thyra. It sounds like you’re generally in very good health. Just to be thorough, I’d like to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. That sounds good. I don’t mind. Like I said, I don’t really have anything to hide! Go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Just relax your arm for me... Okay, 128 over 76. That’s a good reading. Now, if you’ll just take a few deep breaths… Heart sounds are normal, regular rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Everything sounds good. Do you have any current pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Nope, no pain right now. My back gets a little sore sometimes after a long day at work, but that's just normal muscle aches. Nothing I can't handle with a little rest and stretching. It's the price you pay for fixing things, I guess!
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional muscle aches. No other pain. Alright. Now, before we get to signing off on those forms, are you a smoker?
PATIENT: No, never. My grandma always said smoking was a waste of good air. And I kinda agree. Plus, I like being able to breathe easy when I’m climbing around fixing pipes!
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just socially, now and then. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, or a beer with my husband on a hot day. Nothing excessive. We're pretty laid-back about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so social alcohol use. Finally, do you have any concerns or questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Nope, I think that covers everything. You've asked all the right questions. I really appreciate you taking the time to do all this, even though it was just for some forms. I guess we can just get to the signing off part now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Thyra. I was happy to do it. It’s always good to get a quick overview, even for routine things. Here are the forms. Just need you to sign here and initial here. Let me know if you have any trouble. I'll make copies for your records and send the originals to Medicare. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Okay, perfect! There we go. And no, that’s all I needed. Thank you so much, Dr. Tosca. You were very kind and helpful. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Thyra. I’m glad I could help. Have a wonderful day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. .
