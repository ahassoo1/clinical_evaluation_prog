DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It's lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you here?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's just get on with it, shall we? It's my… well, it’s my stool. It's black. Been taking these painkillers for years, you know, for my arthritis. And now this. Honestly, it's probably nothing, but my Harold insisted I come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Dawnetta. I appreciate you being direct, and I assure you I'll be as efficient as possible. Black stool can be a sign of something we should investigate, so it's good Harold encouraged you to come in. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the black stool?
PATIENT: Well, it's… black! Like tar, almost. Not bright red, thankfully. It started a few days ago, I think. Maybe a week? Time just… slips away, you know? I haven’t changed anything in my diet, not that it matters. I eat sensible things. Not one of those fad dieters. And like I said, these pills… I take 'em religiously. Harold gets them for me. He knows the pharmacist, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, “like tar” is helpful information, thank you. And it’s good to know it hasn’t been accompanied by any bright red blood. A week is a reasonable timeframe. You mentioned you take painkillers regularly for arthritis. Could you tell me the name of the medication, and how much you typically take each day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Harold handles all that. Let me think... It’s the… the orange ones. No, wait, the white ones! No… they’re capsules. Little white capsules. Ibuprofen, I think? Maybe 800 milligrams? He gives me two, twice a day, usually. Sometimes three if my knees are really bad. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to the numbers. He knows what he’s doing. Been doing it for years, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ibuprofen, 800 milligrams, typically two capsules twice a day, sometimes three. That’s very helpful, thank you. Long-term use of Ibuprofen, even over-the-counter, can sometimes lead to stomach issues, which could explain the black stool. Now, besides the change in stool color, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, don't ask me to list symptoms. I’m not a doctor, am I? Let me think... My stomach's been a bit… unsettled. Not sick, you understand. Just… a bit queasy, especially after I take the pills. And tired. I'm always tired, honestly. But maybe that's just old age. Harold says I need more iron. He’s always telling me what I need. Nothing really bad, if you know what I mean. No pain, no throwing up… just a bit off.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a bit queasy after the pills” and “a bit off” – I appreciate you sharing that. It’s good to know there’s no pain or vomiting. Dawnetta, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your stomach and check a few things. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have Harold’s roast in the oven, you see. He makes a lovely roast. And I don’t want it to burn. Just… be quick about it, will you? I’m not one for lingering in doctors’ offices.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Dawnetta. I'll be as efficient as possible. Okay. I’m listening to your abdomen now. It sounds a little quiet, which isn’t necessarily alarming, but we’ll keep that in mind. Your abdomen is soft, but there's a little tenderness when I press here on the left side. I’m also going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Just standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh, lovely. Tenderness, is it? Probably just gas. I get gas something awful. Harold says it's the cabbage. He makes a lovely cabbage soup, too, but… well. As long as you’re not going to poke around too much. I don’t like being poked. And don’t tell me my blood pressure is high, I already know that. Harold checks it all the time. Honestly, doctors these days... Always finding something wrong. Just get on with it, will you? The roast… the roast is getting cold.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Dawnetta. I assure you I'll be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/88, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 72 and your temperature is normal. Given your history of long-term Ibuprofen use, the black stool, and the tenderness in your abdomen, I want to order a couple of tests just to be on the safe side. It could be something simple, but we need to rule out anything serious. Would you be willing to do a stool test to check for blood and a complete blood count to check your red blood cell levels?
PATIENT: Oh, tests now? Honestly. I knew it. Always something. Well, I suppose if you insist. Harold will be furious if I don't. He always says, "You must listen to the doctor, Dawnetta." He’s very particular about that. A stool test… fine. And a blood count, whatever that is. Just… tell me how to do them. I don’t want to have to come back here again anytime soon. This has already taken too long. And make sure they don’t take a lot of blood. I faint easily, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Dawnetta. We'll take it slow and make sure you're comfortable. For the stool test, the nurse will give you a container and instructions on how to collect a small sample. It’s a little inconvenient, but not painful. For the blood count, we’ll just take a small vial of blood from your arm. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and it shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. We’ll have you sit or lie down to prevent any dizziness. And we’ll monitor you closely. The nurse will be in shortly to explain everything in more detail and get the tests ordered. In the meantime, I'm going to write a note recommending you temporarily stop taking Ibuprofen until we have the results. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Stop taking the pills? Oh, goodness. Harold will have a fit! My knees will be agony. But… I suppose if you say so. Just… how long do I have to go without them? A day? Two? A week? Honestly, I don’t know what I’ll do. He’s got a whole system for them, you see. Reminders and everything. Well, alright. No pills. But if I'm in terrible pain, I’m calling you. And you’d better have a good answer. Now, can I go? The roast, you know. It’s probably ruined by now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Dawnetta. We'll try to minimize the discomfort as much as possible. Let’s start with stopping the Ibuprofen for just 48 hours, until we have the results of the tests. If the pain becomes unbearable, please call the office immediately, and we can discuss alternative pain management options. The nurse will provide you with instructions on how to contact us and what to do if you experience any problems. Alright. I think we’ve covered everything for now. The nurse will be right with you. You can go ahead and change and head home. I hope you have a lovely rest of your day, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope your roast isn't too ruined!
PATIENT: Hmph. Lovely. As if that’s likely. Fine. Goodbye. And tell the nurse to be quick about it. My Harold doesn’t appreciate delays.
