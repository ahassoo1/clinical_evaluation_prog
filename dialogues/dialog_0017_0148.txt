DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepbro. I am Dr. Blim. Please, have a seat. Now, to be efficient, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Blim. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been having some pain… down there. In my… testicular area, you said on the phone? It's not constant, but it’s been worrying me. I apologize for being vague; my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Testicular pain in a female patient… yes, quite. While I appreciate your candor, Ms. Stepbro, it’s important to be precise. Women do not have testicles. Are you experiencing pain in the pelvic region, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear. You are absolutely right. My apologies, Doctor. It is the pelvic region. I get things… mixed up sometimes. It’s just a dull ache, mostly, but it flares up occasionally. I thought… well, I just assumed… I don’t know what I assumed. It’s been going on for a few weeks, I believe. Is that… is that normal?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a subjective term, Ms. Stepbro. Let's access your EHR to get a clearer picture of your medical history. I see you've had routine pap smears and a mammogram last year – good. Any prior pelvic exams documented?
PATIENT: I… I’m not certain, Doctor. I’ve moved around quite a bit over the years, and I’ve seen many different doctors. I try to keep up with things, but keeping track of all the appointments and tests… it’s difficult. I wouldn’t be surprised if something is documented somewhere, but I couldn’t tell you for sure. Would my insurance company have that information, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Relying on insurance records is… unreliable, Ms. Stepbro. We need to establish your history, not reconstruct it from third parties. Now, let’s focus. This pelvic pain – can you describe the location more specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. You’re right. I should try to be more helpful. It’s… it’s low down, mostly on the left side. It feels… deep inside, not really on the surface. Sometimes it radiates a bit towards my lower back, but it’s not sharp. More of a… persistent ache, like a heavy feeling. And it seems to be worse after I’ve been standing for a long time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: "Heavy feeling"… vague, but noted. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in my… oh. Well, yes, actually. I hadn’t really connected the two things, but now that you mention it, I have been a bit… constipated, lately. It’s not severe, but definitely not as regular as it used to be. I thought it was just something I was eating, perhaps. Is that… connected to the pain, do you think?
DOCTOR: Everything is connected, Ms. Stepbro. The human body is a system, not isolated parts. Do you have any nausea, vomiting, or fever?
PATIENT: No, no nausea or vomiting, thankfully. And no fever, either. I feel… generally well, apart from this ache and the… difficulty with my bowels. I have been a bit more tired than usual, perhaps, but I attributed that to just getting older. Is it possible it’s something… gynecological? I apologize for asking such a silly question, Doctor. I just… I don’t want to bother you with things that aren’t important.
DOCTOR: “Silly questions” are a waste of my time, Ms. Stepbro. We'll proceed systematically. Have you noticed any unusual vaginal discharge or bleeding?
PATIENT: Oh dear… No, no unusual discharge or bleeding. Everything… seems normal in that regard. It's really just this ache, and the constipation, as I mentioned. It's just… unsettling. I don't know what it could be, and I don’t want it to be something serious. I apologize for rambling, Doctor. I'm just a bit anxious. Would it be alright if I just sat here for a moment and collected my thoughts?
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepbro, we have limited time. Anxiety will not expedite a diagnosis. Let’s move to a physical exam. Please lie on the examination table. I need to assess your abdomen and perform a pelvic examination. I must advise you that this will involve some discomfort.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A physical exam. Yes, of course, Doctor. I… I understand. Discomfort is to be expected, I suppose. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do… or anything I should expect. And please, don’t hesitate to tell me if I’m being uncooperative. My memory… it sometimes makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: Simply lie down, Ms. Stepbro. I will begin with abdominal palpation. Please inform me of any tenderness you experience. Now, take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Taking a deep breath now… I’m a bit nervous, if you don't mind me saying. It's just… I haven't had a proper exam in quite some time.
DOCTOR: There is mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. Adipose tissue present. No palpable masses. Now, I will perform a pelvic examination. Please let me know if you experience any significant discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just… let me know what you’re doing, if you don't mind. It will help me relax… I think. It’s a bit… difficult to breathe, actually. I’m trying to stay calm, but it’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Cervix appears normal. No obvious lesions or discharge noted. Vaginal walls appear normal. Uterine size is within normal limits. Now, I will perform a bimanual examination to assess the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Left ovary is slightly enlarged and tender to palpation. Right ovary is normal in size and consistency. No adnexal masses detected. Now, please sit up. We will discuss the findings.
PATIENT: Slightly enlarged… and tender? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? I’m sorry to keep asking, but my anxiety is getting the better of me. Is it… cancer? I know it’s a silly question, but… please, just tell me the truth.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepbro, jumping to conclusions will not assist us. A slightly enlarged and tender ovary can be caused by numerous factors, most of which are not cancerous. It could be a functional cyst, which often resolves on its own. However, given your symptoms – the pelvic pain and constipation – and the finding on examination, further investigation is warranted. I recommend a pelvic ultrasound to visualize the ovary and rule out any abnormalities. We will also obtain a CA-125 blood test, a marker that can sometimes be elevated in ovarian cancer, although it is not definitive. I will schedule these tests for you immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… and a blood test. Yes, that makes sense. A bit frightening, but… I understand. So, it’s not necessarily cancer? That’s… reassuring, to some extent. Will the ultrasound… will it be uncomfortable? And the blood test… is it a lot of blood? I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor. I just… I don’t like surprises. And I tend to worry about things. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any precautions I should take? Perhaps avoiding strenuous activity?
DOCTOR: The ultrasound is non-invasive, Ms. Stepbro. It involves a gel and a probe, no discomfort beyond mild pressure. The blood test is a standard venipuncture, a small amount of blood will be drawn. As for precautions, avoid strenuous activity until we have the results of the ultrasound and blood test. And frankly, Ms. Stepbro, try to manage your anxiety. Excessive worry will not improve your condition. I’m scheduling these tests for you now. You will receive a call with the appointment details. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you for… explaining everything so clearly. And for being so patient with my… anxieties. I appreciate it. I will try to… remain calm, as you suggested. Thank you again, Doctor Blim. I will await the call regarding the appointments. .
