DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Cassimatis, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Carla Cassimatis. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Dechêne, right? I hope I'm saying that right.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dechêne is fine. Though frankly, I have a rather full schedule, so let's try to be concise. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, alright. It's this itching. It's been driving me a little crazy, honestly. It's all over… well, pretty much everywhere. Not constantly itchy, but it flares up, and it's really bothersome when it does. I haven't changed anything – soaps, lotions, nothing. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Everywhere, you say. And how long has this “itching” been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been maybe… three weeks now? Something like that. It started gradually, just a little bit here and there. I didn't think much of it at first, figured it was just dry skin. But then it got worse, and now it’s… well, you know. Itchy! I can't really pinpoint a specific day it started, just that it's been building up for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Three weeks. And is it worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. It seems to be worse in the evenings, when I’m trying to relax. It’s really annoying when I’m trying to read or watch TV. It makes it hard to settle down. Sometimes it wakes me up a little, too, if I scratch too much. It’s not terrible at night, but definitely more noticeable.
DOCTOR: Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not really, not that I’m aware of. I used to have hay fever when I was a kid, but I haven’t had problems with that in years. No food allergies, no reactions to medications… nothing like that. I don’t really break out in rashes or anything, usually. I haven't noticed anything new that I've been exposed to, either.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let’s see… just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. It's ibuprofen, just when it flares up. Nothing regularly, though. Maybe a couple of times a month. And occasionally, an antacid if I eat something spicy. Other than that, no. I try to avoid taking pills whenever I can. I prefer just… toughing things out, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at your skin. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Sure. Let me know if you need me to move anything. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, so I’m a little rusty with all this.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There's some excoriation, consistent with scratching. And… a diffuse, slightly raised rash. Nothing particularly alarming, but… not ideal. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms – fatigue, fever, weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good. No, no fever or weight loss, thank goodness. I have been a little more tired lately, but I figured that was just getting older. You know, things just start to… slow down. But no, nothing major. I haven’t felt sick, or anything like that. Just the itching, and the tiredness. Is this something serious, Doctor? I worry about these things, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be “serious” in the catastrophic sense, but it is bothersome, and persistent. Given your age and the duration of the symptoms, and the lack of improvement, I'm going to order a complete blood count and a liver function test. Just to rule things out. And I'll write you a prescription for a topical corticosteroid. Apply it thinly to the affected areas twice daily.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… sensible. A blood test and some cream. I can do that. Is the blood test going to be a big one? I'm not a huge fan of needles, to be honest. And where would I get the cream filled? I don’t usually go to the pharmacy much either, so I'm not sure about the best place around here.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard CBC and liver function panel. A few vials of blood, nothing excessive. And you can have it filled at any pharmacy, really. There’s a CVS just down the street, if that's convenient. The results will take a few days. We'll discuss them at your follow-up appointment. I’m scheduling that now, two weeks from today. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. CVS is fine, I can walk there. Okay, so blood test, cream, and a follow-up. Hmm… let me think. Will the cream make my skin thin, or anything? I’ve heard that sometimes happens with those kinds of things. And is there anything I should avoid while I'm using it? Like, certain soaps, or lotions? I want to make sure I do this right. I don’t want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Topical corticosteroids, used as directed for a short period, rarely cause significant skin thinning. Avoid prolonged use on the face or in skin folds. And yes, avoid harsh soaps and heavily fragranced lotions. Something mild and hypoallergenic is best. Here are your orders. The lab is also down the street. Now, if there's nothing else… I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay, so mild soap, no harsh lotions, blood test, cream… I think that covers it. Thank you, Doctor Dechêne. I appreciate you taking the time. Sorry to take up so much of your afternoon. I’ll see you in two weeks, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
