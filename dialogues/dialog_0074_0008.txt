DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Right. What brings me in… it's my ears, I think. They feel… full. Like something's blocked them. It's been going on for… a while now, honestly. I don't really keep track of these things. Just… full. And a bit annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A feeling of fullness in your ears, and it's been going on for some time. That can certainly be bothersome. When you say “a while”, could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… hmm. Maybe… a couple of months? Possibly longer. It sort of crept up on me, you see. Didn’t notice it at first, just gradually got worse. It's hard to say exactly. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy these days, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it developed gradually over a couple of months, perhaps longer. And you've described it as a feeling of fullness. Are you experiencing any pain with it?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable. Like when you’re on an airplane, you know? That pressure. But it doesn’t go away. Just a constant… stuffiness. And it makes it hard to hear sometimes. Not completely deaf, but… muffled.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, just a feeling of fullness and some muffled hearing. Has anything specifically made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. I don’t think so… not that I’ve noticed. Maybe when it's really windy, it feels a bit worse. But that could just be the wind itself, you know? I work outside a lot… inspecting fields and such. So there's always wind. I haven’t tried anything to make it better, really. I just… live with it. It’s not… life-threatening, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound like an immediately life-threatening situation, but it's good you're bringing it to my attention. We want to figure out what’s going on and see if we can improve it. You mentioned you work outdoors. Do you regularly use any ear protection when you’re inspecting fields?
PATIENT: Ear protection? No, not really. It's… mostly just talking to farmers, checking crops. Not a lot of loud noises. Occasionally a tractor, but I usually move away when those things start up. I never thought about needing ear protection, to be honest. Is that something I should be doing? It's all a bit new to me, this… thinking about my ears.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking those questions. Prolonged exposure to even moderate noise levels can sometimes contribute to hearing issues, so it’s worth considering ear protection. We can discuss that further. Now, let’s get a little more information about your overall health. Have you had any recent colds, sinus infections, or allergies?
PATIENT: Recent… colds? Hmm. I think I had something a few months back. A bit of a sniffle, a cough. Nothing major, just the usual. Didn't keep me in bed or anything. Allergies… I don’t think so. I mean, I get a bit sneezy sometimes in the spring, but I always put that down to the pollen. I don’t take anything for it. Just… live with it. Like everything else, I suppose. It’s been a while since I've been really sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. So, a mild cold a few months ago, and some seasonal allergy-like symptoms, but nothing significant. Have you ever had any problems with your ears before – infections, ringing in your ears, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Ringing… Now that you mention it… yes, maybe. Very faintly. A sort of… high-pitched whine, sometimes. It doesn’t happen often. It's barely noticeable, really. I always thought it was just the silence. I live a pretty quiet life, you see. Never really bothered me enough to mention it to anyone. Infections… no, I don't think so. Not as an adult, anyway. Maybe when I was a child? I have trouble remembering things, you see. It's all a bit… blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, a faint ringing in your ears occasionally and possibly some ear infections as a child. Let's talk about your medical history a bit more broadly. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a… complicated question. My wife… she always handled all that. Doctors, medications, appointments… I wasn't really involved. She passed away a few years ago, you see. And I… well, I haven’t really kept up with it. I think the doctor told me I had slightly high cholesterol, maybe? But I can’t be sure. I don’t take any regular medications, if that helps. It's all a bit of a mess, honestly. I'm sorry, I’m not very helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s understandable that things can be a bit unclear after such a loss. We’ll do our best to sort through it. I do have access to your EHR here; let me take a quick look to see what information is available. …Okay, I see here a note from three years ago indicating slightly elevated cholesterol, as you mentioned. No other significant medical history documented. Do you have any known allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I eat pretty much everything. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. My wife did all the checking for things like that, you see. She was very careful. I just… ate what she gave me. I’m sorry, I really wish I could be more helpful. It's all a bit… hazy. Is this information important? Perhaps we should just get on with looking at my ears? I just want to get this sorted, if possible.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. We’ll get there. Your overall health is important, but let’s focus on your ears for now. I’m going to perform a quick physical exam of your ears, nose, and throat. This will help me assess the situation and determine the next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… try not to poke too hard, if you don’t mind. And please, don't tell me everything that’s wrong at once. Just… slowly, if possible. I get a bit flustered easily, you see. Just get on with it, please. I want to get this sorted.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll be as gentle as possible. I'm going to start with your ears. I’ll just look inside and assess the ear canal and eardrum. Okay… I see some cerumen – that’s earwax – present in the ear canal. The ear canal itself appears clear. The eardrum is… slightly dull and retracted. There’s no obvious sign of infection or perforation. And the left ear is similar – some cerumen present, the ear canal appears clear, and the eardrum is also slightly dull and retracted. I’m going to gently inflate your ears with a small puff of air – this is called tympanometry – to assess the movement of your eardrums. It might feel a little strange. Okay… the results of the tympanometry show decreased mobility in both eardrums. Based on the physical exam, it appears you have some wax buildup in both ears, and your eardrums aren’t moving as freely as they should. This could be contributing to the feeling of fullness and muffled hearing.
PATIENT: That's… a bit strange, yes. Dull eardrums? Decreased mobility? Is that… bad? Does that mean I need surgery? I really don't like the sound of that. Wax buildup… well, that makes sense, I suppose. I do work outside a lot. Can you just… take the wax out? Is that all it is? Please tell me it’s just the wax. I just want this sorted. This is all very stressful, you see.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't necessarily mean you need surgery, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s good news that we’ve identified a likely cause for your symptoms. The decreased mobility and dull appearance of your eardrums are often associated with wax buildup and can sometimes be caused by fluid in the middle ear, but given your history, wax is the more probable cause. Removing the wax is a good first step and often resolves the issue. It’s a relatively quick and painless procedure. We can perform a wax removal today. Would you like to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Wax removal… yes, please. Anything to get rid of this feeling. Quick and painless, you say? That sounds wonderful. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I was getting quite worried there for a moment. Yes, let’s remove the wax. The sooner the better, if you don’t mind. Just… get on with it, please. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. I'll use a cerumen spoon and gentle irrigation to remove the wax. I’ll warm the irrigation solution to body temperature to minimize discomfort. It might feel a little cool or strange, but it shouldn't be painful. I’ll explain each step as I go. I’m gently loosening the wax with the cerumen spoon now… and then I’ll start the irrigation. Okay… I’ve removed a significant amount of wax from your right ear. Let me take a look… Much better! The ear canal looks clearer now, and the eardrum appears more mobile. Now let’s do the same to your left ear. …Okay, left ear is done as well. Let me examine it… Excellent. Both ear canals are now clear, and both eardrums appear more mobile. I’ll recheck your hearing briefly to see if there’s any improvement. Okay… Your hearing appears to be improved after wax removal. It’s not perfect, but it’s certainly better than it was before. There you go. Wax removal is complete. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: That’s… better. Definitely better. It’s not completely gone, the muffled feeling, but it’s much less noticeable. I can hear you much clearer now. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. I feel a lot less stressed. It was just the wax, you said? Nothing more serious? That’s a huge weight off my mind. What do I do to prevent this from happening again? Should I come back regularly for checkups?
DOCTOR: Yes, it appears it was primarily wax buildup causing your symptoms. While it's always a good idea to be mindful of your ear health, you likely don’t need frequent checkups specifically for wax removal unless you notice your symptoms returning. To prevent wax buildup, I recommend avoiding using cotton swabs inside your ear canal, as they can actually push the wax further in and cause impaction. You can use over-the-counter earwax softening drops a few times a year if you’re prone to buildup, but be sure to follow the instructions carefully. I’ll give you a handout with instructions on ear care and signs to look out for that would warrant a follow-up visit. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. That handout is very helpful, thank you. You've been very patient with me, Doctor. I apologize for being so… vague. It’s just… a lot has happened in the past few years. I really appreciate you sorting this out for me. I feel much better now. Thank you again. I think I’ll just… be on my way. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It was my pleasure to help. And please don't apologize for being vague – it’s perfectly understandable. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you experience any further issues. Have a good day as well. .
