DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Uh… right. My ears. They feel… full. Like something’s blocking them, you know? It’s been… a while now, I think. Honestly, the days blur together a bit. It’s just… annoying. I just want it to go away, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Fullness” in the ears… and for how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a tricky question. Months, I suppose? Maybe longer? I really can’t put a finger on it. It wasn't sudden, that’s for sure. It just sort of… gradually got worse. Does that help? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: It's… acceptable. Gradual onset is often more difficult to pinpoint. Has this been affecting your hearing at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, I think so. People seem… muffled sometimes. I find myself asking them to repeat things more often, especially my… well, never mind. But yes, definitely harder to hear. I mostly work outside, though, so I figured it was just the wind, or the machines.
DOCTOR: "Mostly work outside," you say. What sort of work do you do, Mr. GuerreroloLopez?
PATIENT: Agricultural inspections. I… check on farms, make sure things are up to code. It's… a lot of walking, and a lot of noise, to be honest. Tractors, combines… it all adds up, I suppose. Though, like I said, I figured it was just that.
DOCTOR: And have you been using any hearing protection while doing this work?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. No. Not regularly, no. I have some… earplugs somewhere, I think. But… I don’t always remember to use them. It’s… a bad habit, I know.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that certainly could be contributing to the problem. Let's move on. Have you experienced any pain in your ears, any dizziness, or any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: No pain, thankfully. And no dizziness. Ringing… now that you mention it, sometimes. A faint ringing. Like a… high-pitched whine. It’s not constant, though. Comes and goes. I always figured it was just… the quiet getting to me sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. A faint, intermittent ringing. Have you noticed any discharge from your ears, or any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: No discharge. And my balance… well, I'm not as steady as I used to be, but I figured that was just… getting older. I haven’t fallen or anything, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to take a look. I’m going to perform a brief otoscopic examination, just to see what’s going on in your ear canals. I'll also do a quick hearing test. It’s a standard procedure. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: No, no objections at all. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… please be quick, if you wouldn't mind. I have… things to get back to.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit forward. Hmm. There appears to be some cerumen buildup… wax, essentially. Not excessive, but present. And the same on this side. No visible signs of infection or foreign bodies. Now, I’ll perform a quick audiometric screening. I’m going to have you wear these headphones and indicate when you hear a tone. It’s very simple.
PATIENT: Okay. Headphones. Sounds… manageable. Just let me know what I need to do. And… how long will this take? I really am short on time.
DOCTOR: It won’t be long, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. This is a rather basic screening. Now, when you hear a tone in either ear, please press the button. It will start softly and gradually increase in volume. It’s important to be honest, even if the sound is very faint.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Button. I understand. There. Did I do it right? It was… very quiet.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are doing fine. Alright. The results indicate some mild to moderate hearing loss in the higher frequencies, which isn’t entirely surprising given your occupation and lack of hearing protection. The wax buildup is likely contributing to the problem as well. It's a common issue for those exposed to prolonged noise without adequate protection.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That’s… not good, is it? I figured as much, honestly. So… what do I do about it? Just… more earplugs?
DOCTOR: “Just more earplugs” is… a simplification. We need to remove the wax buildup first. I can perform a cerumen removal procedure in the office. It's a quick and relatively painless process. Afterwards, and more importantly, you need to be diligent about wearing appropriate hearing protection whenever you are exposed to loud noises. Foam earplugs are a start, but custom-fitted ear molds offer significantly better protection. And frankly, given your level of exposure, I strongly advise considering a change in occupation. Continued exposure will only worsen the hearing loss.
PATIENT: Change my occupation? Oh, goodness. That’s… a bit much, isn’t it? I’ve been doing this for… a long time. The wax removal… that sounds alright. Less drastic. How long will that take?
DOCTOR: It is, perhaps, a difficult suggestion. But I am obligated to inform you of the potential consequences. The cerumen removal will be quite quick—perhaps ten minutes. I’ll use a gentle irrigation technique. I'll also give you a prescription for some ear drops to help soften the wax and prevent future buildup. However, the removal is merely a temporary solution if you do not address the underlying issue of noise exposure. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Noise exposure. And the drops. Okay. Let’s just… do the removal. And the drops. For now. I'll… think about the other thing. How much will all this cost?
DOCTOR: Very well. The cerumen removal is approximately $150, and the ear drops will be around $30. Insurance should cover a portion of the cost, but I cannot guarantee the exact amount. We'll submit a claim for you. Please recline back, and I'll begin the procedure. I'll explain each step as I go, although it is quite straightforward. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… quickly, if you could. I really do need to get going. Let’s just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: As you wish. I’m using a warm saline solution. You may feel some slight pressure or discomfort, but it shouldn't be painful. Let me know if you experience any sharp pain. There. That appears to be the bulk of it. Now, the other ear. There. Both canals are clear now. You should notice a significant improvement in your hearing. I’ll write you a prescription for the ear drops. Use them as directed. I trust you will seriously consider my earlier advice regarding hearing protection. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… the prescription. Thank you, Doctor. I think that’s everything. I really must be going now.
DOCTOR: Very well. The prescription has been sent to your pharmacy. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to assess your hearing. And, again, I strongly urge you to be proactive about protecting your hearing. Have a… good day, Mr. GuerreroloLopez.
