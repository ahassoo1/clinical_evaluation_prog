DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning. Just… chest. Hurts. And… fast beat. Doctor said check blood, now I here. Quick, please. I no have all day.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Sobkowicz. We’ll get to it as quickly as we can. “Chest hurts” and a “fast beat,” alright. Can you tell me a little more about this chest pain?
PATIENT: More? What more is there? It hurts! Like… squeezed. Sometimes. Not always. And… when I walk up stairs. It gets worse. You know, stairs. People use them. It’s a normal thing. Don't need long talk about stairs. Just… hurts when I go up.
DOCTOR: Yes, stairs, I understand perfectly. You're right, no need to elaborate on stairs. It sounds like the pain is brought on by exertion, specifically walking up stairs, and feels like a squeezing sensation. Is this pain radiating anywhere – perhaps to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Radiating? What you mean? Like… sunshine? No sunshine. It just… here. Maybe… a little in left arm. But just sometimes. Not much. Old man problems. Probably nothing. You young doctors, always worry too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, so the pain is primarily in your chest, with occasional, mild radiation into your left arm. And you feel it's likely just part of getting older. I appreciate your perspective, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I certainly don't want to unnecessarily worry you. However, chest pain, even if you believe it's “just an old man problem,” needs to be thoroughly evaluated. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me if anything relieves the pain?
PATIENT: Relieves? Hmph. Sitting. Mostly. I sit down, it go away. And… quiet. When I no do nothing. No walk. No stairs. No… excitement. Just quiet. Like now. Almost good. Except… waiting. I no like waiting.
DOCTOR: So, rest and quiet seem to help. That’s good to know. And I apologize for the wait, Mr. Sobkowicz. We'll try to keep things moving as quickly as possible. Now, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High blood pressure. Yes. Doctor always say. Take pills. And… maybe cholesterol. I forget. Many pills. Always pills. My wife, she manage. I no remember all. She say good diet. No fried things. But I like fried things. She yell. It's… complicated.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Sobkowicz, it sounds like you have a lot on your plate. It's good you're taking medication for your blood pressure, and that you're trying to maintain a good diet. We can always review your medications more thoroughly later. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had. I eat everything. Sometimes wife say no eat too much, but I do. No allergies. Simple. You young doctors ask too many questions. Old man, I live long time. Would know if I allergic.
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, Mr. Sobkowicz. It's good to know you haven’t had any allergic reactions. Just covering all the bases. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than routine check-ups?
PATIENT: Hospital? Long time ago. When I was young. Appendicitis. But that was… Korea. Very long time ago. No other. No surgeries. Just… aches and pains. Old man stuff. .
DOCTOR: Alright, appendicitis many years ago. And just general aches and pains. Thank you. Do you have a family history of any medical conditions like heart disease, stroke, or diabetes?
