DOCTOR: Hi Marialena, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Hernandez. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some…pressure in my bladder, and it’s been a little concerning, so I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. I understand. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, I believe, around the beginning of July. So, roughly a month now. It hasn’t been constant, but it’s frequent enough to be disruptive.
DOCTOR: Alright, about a month. Disruptive how?
PATIENT: Well, I find myself needing to go to the restroom quite often, even if I haven’t had much to drink. And sometimes, when I do need to go, it’s… difficult to start, if that makes sense. It’s not painful, exactly, just… a struggle. It’s making it a little hard to concentrate at work, and I worry about it when I’m out and about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency and difficulty initiating the stream. No pain with urination, just a struggle. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, fever, chills, or any lower back pain along with this?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no blood at all. No fever or chills, either. And my back has been alright—no pain there. It’s really just the pressure and the difficulty starting, like I said. I did notice I’ve been feeling a little more tired lately, but I assumed that was just from work.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No fever, chills, or back pain. Tiredness aside, that's all helpful. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you had any urinary tract infections before?
PATIENT: Yes, actually, I have. I had one when I was in college – maybe eight or nine years ago? It was quite unpleasant, and I remember it being very painful, but I haven't had one since. I was treated with antibiotics, and it cleared up quickly. Aside from that, I don’t really have any significant medical history. I'm generally quite healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a UTI about eight or nine years ago, treated with antibiotics, and otherwise healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries or hospital stays. I've been very fortunate in that regard. I have my annual check-ups, and everything is usually perfectly normal. It’s precisely because I usually feel so well that this bladder pressure is concerning me.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. What about your family?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, and my grandmother on my father's side had diabetes, but neither of them had any issues with their bladder or kidneys that I'm aware of. Honestly, we don’t talk about medical history much in my family. It’s… a bit of a taboo subject, if I’m being truthful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so family history is somewhat limited, but no bladder or kidney issues on either side that you know of. Now, let’s quickly go over social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. I've always been a very healthy eater and have always tried to stay active as well. My husband and I enjoy hiking on weekends when we have time.
DOCTOR: Great. Any alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Occasionally. We might have a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week, perhaps. Nothing excessive at all. My husband is the bigger wine drinker of the two of us, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, minimal alcohol. And what about medications?
PATIENT: I only take a daily multivitamin. And, of course, when I need them, over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches. Otherwise, I don’t take any prescription medications regularly. I’m very careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional pain relievers. And just to be thorough, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies whatsoever, thankfully. No food allergies, no reactions to medications…nothing. I’ve always considered myself quite lucky in that regard. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, fantastic. No allergies, no regular medications. Let me just quickly pull up your EHR information to review everything. And then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just involve listening to your abdomen and a quick check of your reflexes.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed when you’re ready. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I want to get to the bottom of this and feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Marialena, if you don't mind, could you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Here we go. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax and take some deep breaths. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen, feeling for any tenderness. Any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. It doesn’t feel uncomfortable or painful. A little…sensitive, perhaps, just below my belly button, but not in an unpleasant way. Just…awareness. Is that making sense? It’s hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. “Awareness” is a good way to put it. Alright, now I’m just going to check your reflexes. I’m going to lightly tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. Just relax your legs.
PATIENT: Okay. Everything feels normal so far. I haven't had any problems with my reflexes as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Good. Both reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Everything checks out physically, which is reassuring. Given your history – the increased frequency, difficulty initiating the stream, no pain, normal physical exam, and the past UTI – it could be a few things. It could be a mild urinary tract infection that hasn’t fully developed yet, some irritation of the bladder, or even just a bit of muscle weakness. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for bacteria, and a urine culture to identify any specific bacteria if present. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Dr. Hernandez. A urinalysis and a urine culture seem like a prudent next step. I completely trust your judgment. If you think it's best, I'm happy to proceed. I just want to feel better, and I appreciate you being so thorough.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab. The lab technician will come in shortly to collect a sample. They’ll give you instructions on how to do that properly. It’s important to collect a “clean catch” sample – that means cleaning the area first to avoid contamination. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I remember having to do that once before with the previous UTI, so I’m familiar with the process. Wipe front to back, collect the middle part of the stream… Is that correct? I want to make sure I do it properly this time. I’ve heard contamination can skew the results.
DOCTOR: Exactly right! Wipe front to back, discard the first portion, and collect the middle stream. You've got it. Contamination can affect the results, so a clean catch is essential. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d recommend drinking plenty of fluids – water is best – to help flush out your system. And try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. We’ll get the results back within a couple of days. Once we have those, we can discuss the best course of action. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a perfect plan, Dr. Hernandez. More water, less caffeine and alcohol… very doable. I appreciate your clear explanation and your careful approach. I'll follow those recommendations and await the results. Thank you for your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I’m glad I could help. If you experience any fever, chills, or severe back pain before the results come back, please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Otherwise, we’ll talk soon. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
