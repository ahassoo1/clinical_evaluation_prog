DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Don’t bother with the ‘Ms.’, Dawnetta is fine. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's just get this over with. It's my… well, it's my stool. It's black. And I take those pain pills, the red ones, all the time, you know, for my arthritis. Been taking them for years. Is that what this is about? Because I read things online, and sometimes they say it’s nothing, sometimes they say it’s… bad.
DOCTOR: Very well, Dawnetta. I understand your concern, and we will certainly address it. Black stools can be concerning, as you’ve rightly noted. It's good you're bringing this to my attention. Just to clarify, when you say you’ve been taking these “red pills” for years, could you tell me the name of the medication and the dosage you typically take?
PATIENT: Honestly? I have no idea what they’re called. The doctor just keeps writing the same prescription, and the pharmacy fills it. They're little red capsules. Two of them, three times a day, usually. Sometimes four if my knees are really acting up. Honestly, I don't bother with names, just as long as they work. You’d think after all these years they’d just send them automatically, wouldn’t you? It's not like I’m a complicated case. Is it the pills, or what? I’m just trying to figure out if I need to worry about something serious here.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration with remembering medication names, Dawnetta. However, knowing the specific medication is crucial for determining the cause of your black stools. Let me access your electronic health record here… Ah, yes. It appears you’ve been prescribed naproxen 500mg three times daily as needed for osteoarthritis. It is quite common for naproxen, and other NSAIDs, to cause gastrointestinal upset, including black stools, which indicates bleeding in the upper digestive tract. However, we need to determine the source of the bleeding before we assume it’s solely the medication. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the black stools?
PATIENT: Naproxen, you say? That sounds about right, yes. Look, bleeding? Goodness. Well, no, I haven’t been… actively bleeding, if that’s what you mean. No blood in the toilet, or anything. But I do get a bit of heartburn sometimes, especially if I lie down too soon after taking the pills. And my stomach feels… unsettled, sort of. Like a dull ache, you know? It's not terrible, I just figured it was the pills. My Harold used to say I had a cast-iron stomach, but that was before all this. Is this serious? I’m not keen on ending up in the hospital. I’ve seen what they do in there.
DOCTOR: Heartburn and a dull stomach ache alongside the black stools are certainly relevant. While it's possible this is simply a side effect of the naproxen, we must rule out more serious causes. Black stools always warrant investigation. I'm going to perform a brief physical examination, Dawnetta, and then I'd like to order a few laboratory tests to assess your overall health and determine the source of the bleeding. We'll start with a complete blood count to check for anemia, and a stool test to confirm the presence of blood and rule out other potential causes. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, tests. Just what I needed. Harold always said doctors just like to order tests. Fine, fine. Do what you have to do. Just… try not to poke too much. And can you hurry? I have a garden to tend to, you know. Those tomatoes won’t pick themselves. And honestly, all this talk of bleeding is making me quite nervous. Is it going to hurt? Will I need… a transfusion? I read about those online too, and they don't sound pleasant. Just tell me what you’re doing before you do it, alright? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Dawnetta. We will proceed as efficiently and comfortably as possible. The physical exam will be quite straightforward. I will listen to your abdomen with a stethoscope, and gently palpate your stomach to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It shouldn’t be painful. As for the blood tests, they are standard procedures and typically cause minimal discomfort. We are not at the point of discussing transfusions yet. We first need to determine the extent of any blood loss, if any, through the laboratory results. I will explain each step before I perform it. Let’s begin with the abdominal exam, then. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. I’m going to start by listening to your bowel sounds.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Honestly, doctors these days… Just don’t poke too hard, alright? And if it’s going to be cold, warn me. My skin is sensitive these days. Go on then, listen to your… bowel sounds. It’s not like I’ve got anything better to do, I suppose. Except for the tomatoes. They really need picking.
DOCTOR: Your bowel sounds are present, though slightly diminished. That could be due to a number of factors. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know immediately if you feel any pain. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a bit… tender, actually. Right there. Just a little bit. Not awful, but noticeable. It feels… like a dull ache, you know? Like when you've eaten too much. And it's a bit… bloated, perhaps? I haven’t been regular, if that makes any difference. Honestly, with all these tests and poking, I'm starting to feel quite unwell. Can we just get a prescription for something to settle my stomach? Maybe that’s all I need. It's probably just indigestion. I had a pickle with lunch. Pickles can do that to you.
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the lower quadrants, along with bloating and irregularity, is relevant information. However, we cannot dismiss the possibility of a more serious underlying cause given the black stools. While indigestion is possible, we need to rule out other potential issues before attributing it to the pickle. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a stool test for occult blood, as previously mentioned. I will also order a test to check for Helicobacter pylori, a bacteria that can cause stomach ulcers and bleeding. These tests will help us determine the source of your symptoms and guide our treatment plan. In the meantime, I can prescribe a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acid production and potentially alleviate your discomfort. But this is only a temporary measure until we have the results of the tests. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, more tests. Honestly! A bacteria, you say? Like something you get from… bad food? I don’t eat anything bad, I assure you. Harold always said I was a good housekeeper. And a proton pump… what did you call it? Will it make me sleepy? Because I have gardening to do, you know. And will it interfere with my… other medications? I take a pill for my blood pressure, and something for my arthritis, and… oh, and a vitamin D supplement. You really need to ask before you prescribe anything, you know. I don’t want any nasty side effects. Just… can’t you just give me something for the heartburn? Something simple? Please? I really don’t want any more poking and prodding. And all those tests sound expensive. Medicare only covers so much, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns regarding the tests and potential medication side effects, Dawnetta. It's prudent to be cautious. The Helicobacter pylori test determines if you have an infection, not necessarily from bad food, but it's a common cause of stomach inflammation. I will prescribe a proton pump inhibitor, specifically omeprazole 20mg daily. It generally has minimal side effects, although drowsiness can occur in some individuals. We will start with a low dose and monitor your response. It is unlikely to interfere with your other medications, but I will double-check all interactions in the electronic health record before finalizing the prescription. I’m also aware of Medicare coverage, and I will ensure that all necessary tests are pre-authorized. The initial tests are essential for determining the cause of your symptoms and guiding the appropriate treatment. Before proceeding, could you please confirm the names and dosages of all the medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Omeprazole, you say? As long as it doesn’t make me sleepy. And you’re checking for interactions, good. Harold always said a doctor should check for interactions. Let me think… I take Lisinopril, I think, for my blood pressure. 10 milligrams, once a day. And Naproxen, 500 milligrams, three times a day, as we discussed. And the vitamin D… oh dear, I have no idea. It's just a little white pill. I get it from the pharmacy, and I take one every morning. It's for my bones, you know. Doctor said I needed more vitamin D. I used to spend more time in the sun, but… well, never mind. Honestly, I can’t keep track of everything. I just want to feel better. Is that too much to ask? Can we just get this prescription and be done with it? My tomatoes are waiting.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 10mg daily, Naproxen 500mg three times a day, and a vitamin D supplement… noted. The vitamin D dosage is difficult to determine without knowing the specific product. However, it is unlikely to cause any significant interactions with the other medications. I will write a prescription for omeprazole 20mg daily. I’m also ordering the complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and stool tests for occult blood and Helicobacter pylori. The laboratory will contact you to schedule an appointment for the blood draw and stool collection. In the meantime, continue taking your current medications as prescribed. If your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or bloody stools, please contact my office immediately. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results of the tests and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Does this sound acceptable to you, Dawnetta?
PATIENT: One week? Honestly. Well, alright. It’s better than nothing, I suppose. Just… make sure they don't poke too much. And I really hope this omeprazole works. My tomatoes are counting on me. Very well. I suppose that's everything. You can send the prescription to my usual pharmacy, the one on Main Street. I’ll go schedule those tests… and try not to worry too much. Thank you, Doctor Pipkorn. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have gardening to do. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Dawnetta. I will send the prescription to your pharmacy immediately. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. And do enjoy your gardening. I trust we will have positive results from the tests. Have a good day. .
