DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Glowka, you say? A pretty name. Um… what did bring me in… now let me see. It was something about… blood. Yes! My daughter, she said I should find out… my blood type. Something about needing to know, just in case. Old age, you know. Things slip your mind. I don’t rightly remember why exactly, but it felt important. Is that… is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Nini. It's very sensible of you and your daughter to be proactive about this. Knowing your blood type is important for several reasons, and it's always good to be prepared. So, to clarify, your daughter recommended you come in specifically to determine your blood type, and you don't have any particular symptoms or concerns that prompted this besides that recommendation?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms at all. Just… feeling a bit foggy, if you know what I mean? Not the bad kind, just… old age, probably. My daughter, Elena, she worries so. A good girl, but she fusses. She said something about… transfusions. Maybe? Or something about… matching? Honestly, dear, it all goes in one ear and out the other. I just want to be sure I'm… alright, you know? If knowing my blood type helps with that, then that's good. I don’t think I've ever needed a transfusion before, though. Not that I recall, anyway.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Nini. It's easy to feel overwhelmed with medical information. Knowing your blood type is important in case you did ever require a transfusion, as it ensures you receive compatible blood. It also helps with emergency preparedness. Just to be thorough, and since you mentioned feeling "foggy," have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… changes… let me think. Well, I tire more easily, of course. Everything feels a bit heavier these days. And I… sometimes I have trouble remembering names. Not Elena's, never hers, but… people I haven't seen in a while. It's mostly little things, really. And my hands… they ache sometimes. But I’ve always had a bit of arthritis, so that’s not new. Oh! And I get… well, a bit dizzy when I stand up too quickly. But that's happened on and off for years, too. It's hard to say what's new and what's just… me getting older. Do you need me to be more specific? I'm sorry if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Nini. You’re not rambling, and this is all very helpful information. It's good you mentioned the tiredness, the occasional dizziness when standing, and the hand aches. It's good we’re covering all the bases. Let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Let me see… I had a bad bout of pneumonia years ago, when I was… oh, probably in my fifties. Had to be hospitalized. And I think… I think I had my gallbladder removed at some point. Elena would know better, truthfully. She keeps all my records. I’ve had the usual things, I suppose – the flu, a few bad colds. And, of course, my arthritis. It's in my hands, mostly. But I haven't been to the doctor in… well, quite a while. Not unless it was something really serious. I try to stay healthy, you know? Fresh air, good food… that sort of thing. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? It’s difficult to remember everything from so long ago.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Nini. It's very helpful to know about the pneumonia, the gallbladder removal, and the arthritis. It’s good you have Elena to help with records as well. And how about any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries… let me see. I think… I had a small mole removed from my back a long time ago. When I was younger, I spent a lot of time in the sun, working in the vineyards with my husband. It was just a small thing, though, a quick little procedure. And… I don’t think that's it. Honestly, I can’t recall anything else. I wasn’t one for going to the doctor unless I absolutely had to. My husband, Ricardo, he used to say I was too stubborn for my own good. Is that important? Should I be remembering something else? I’m sorry, dear, my mind isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Ms. Nini. It’s perfectly fine, and very common, not to recall every detail. Knowing about the mole removal is helpful. Now, let's talk about your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a tough one. Ricardo’s side… his father had something with his heart, I think. He passed away young, suddenly. And his mother, she had… I think it was diabetes, yes. She was always tired. On my side… my mother lived a long life, thankfully. She died in her nineties, peaceful-like. But she had… well, she had a lot of aches and pains, like me. I don't recall anyone having cancer, thankfully. My sister, she was healthy as a horse until the very end. And Elena… she's very healthy too, thank goodness. I suppose we're a generally healthy family, all things considered. But I’m not very good at remembering details. Elena would probably know more. She always asks a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Nini. It's good to know about the heart issues on your husband's side and the aches and pains on yours. It sounds like you come from a resilient family. And how about social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. What does that even mean? Am I supposed to be telling you about my friends? I don’t… I don’t see many people anymore, not since Ricardo passed. I used to be very active, always visiting with neighbors, going to festivals… But now I mostly stay home, tending to my garden. I used to drink a little bit of wine with dinner, but not much anymore. My doctor years ago told me to cut back. And I never smoked. Ricardo smoked a little bit, when he was younger, but he quit years ago. Is… is that what you want to know? I’m sorry, I’m probably not making any sense.
DOCTOR: No, you're making perfect sense, Ms. Nini. Social history just refers to lifestyle factors. Knowing you were active and enjoyed visiting with neighbors is helpful. And knowing you don’t smoke and only drink wine occasionally is good. It’s also important to know you've cut back on alcohol as recommended. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. I take a little something for my arthritis, a pill. Elena gets it for me. And… sometimes I take something for my aches, if they get really bad. But I don’t think I'm allergic to anything. I can eat anything, thankfully. I love to cook, and I try to use fresh ingredients from my garden. No, I don't think I have any allergies. Unless… I get a bit itchy when I’m around cats, but that’s just a mild irritation. Is that important? Oh, and I used to get hay fever when I was younger, but that hasn’t bothered me in years. Is that what you’re asking about? I’m sorry, dear, I just want to be sure I’m answering your questions properly.
DOCTOR: You’re answering perfectly, Ms. Nini. No need to apologize at all. Knowing you have no known drug allergies, and only mild irritation with cats is good information. Okay, Ms. Nini, I’ve got a good sense of your history now. Let’s do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your hands to assess the arthritis. And then we can order some bloodwork to determine your blood type and check a few other things. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… fine, dear. I suppose that's what doctors do, isn't it? Check things and poke around. It’s just… I don't like needles. Elena always has to come with me when I get bloodwork done. But, if that’s what needs to be done, then I’ll try my best. Just be gentle, please? And… tell me if anything feels strange. I trust you, of course, I just… I don’t like needles. Alright. Let’s get it over with, then. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Nini. We'll take it slow, and I'll be as gentle as possible. You're right to tell me about your dislike of needles, and Elena is welcome to join us at any point. We can do the blood pressure first, which doesn't involve any needles at all. Then we'll listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. If you could just sit up here for me, that would be wonderful. Okay, I’m just wrapping this cuff around your arm. I'll inflate it and then let it down slowly. Just relax your arm, and try to take some deep breaths. Your blood pressure is 135/85. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. We can keep an eye on it.
PATIENT: Oh, that doesn't sound too bad, does it? A little elevated… is that something I should be worried about? My mother always had good blood pressure, or so she said. I always try to stay calm, you know? I don't like to get agitated. What's next? I suppose the listening thing? Is that cold? I always get chilled so easily these days. And… will it hurt? I trust you, dear, I just… I’m a bit of a worrier, I suppose. Old habits, you know? My husband used to say I worried too much. He was a good man, Ricardo. Always so patient with me. Oh dear… I’m rambling again, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Ms. Nini. It's perfectly alright to be a bit anxious, and I’m glad you told me you worry easily. 135/85 is slightly elevated, and we'll want to monitor it, but it's not an immediate cause for concern. I’m just listening to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, and I’m not hearing any unusual sounds. Your lungs are clear, but I will have you take a deep breath for me. Good. Still clear. Now, let's take a look at your hands. I notice some swelling and redness in your knuckles, which is consistent with arthritis. Can you make a fist for me, and then open your hand?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… uncomfortable, dear. It always is. My hands are just… stiff. They haven’t been the same since… well, since I was younger. I used to be able to do so much with my hands – gardening, cooking, knitting… now it’s just difficult. They ache all the time, especially in the cold weather. There. Do you see? It's just… arthritis, I suppose. Elena says I should see a specialist, but I don’t like going to lots of doctors. Is this bad? Should I be worried? I just want to know if I need to change something, or if this is just… how it is. I trust you, dear, you seem very kind. Just tell me honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the swelling and redness, Ms. Nini. It's clear you have some arthritis. It's good that Elena is suggesting a specialist. Seeing a rheumatologist—an arthritis specialist—would be beneficial. They can determine the type of arthritis you have and recommend the best treatment plan. This isn't an emergency, and it doesn't mean anything serious is happening right now, but unmanaged arthritis can lead to joint damage and pain over time. So, addressing it is important. Before we discuss that further, I'd like to order some bloodwork. This will confirm your blood type, check your overall health, and help rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A specialist… oh dear. Another doctor. Elena will be pleased, I suppose. She always wants me to get everything checked. Bloodwork… well, I suppose it has to be done, doesn't it? If it's the only way to know for sure. But… promise me you’ll be gentle? And… can Elena come with me when I get it done? I don't like needles, you know. They make me… faint sometimes. Just… please be patient with me. I’m a bit of a mess when it comes to medical things. I trust you, dear. But I still get nervous. Will it take long? I have a little garden to tend to this afternoon. It's just… I don’t want to be stuck here all day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Nini. I promise to be as gentle as possible. And yes, Elena is more than welcome to join you when you get the bloodwork done. Having a familiar face with you is a wonderful idea. The bloodwork shouldn't take long—maybe 15-20 minutes. We’ll just need a small sample of blood, and the phlebotomist—the person who draws the blood—is very experienced. They'll make sure you're comfortable. We can schedule the bloodwork for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. That will give Elena time to come with you. And I’ll make a note in your chart about your anxiety with needles, so the phlebotomist is aware. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that would be good. Elena should be free then. And… making a note about the needles… that's very thoughtful of you, dear. You're very kind. Alright. Tomorrow morning it is. And… thank you. For being patient with me. And for listening. It's just… getting old is hard, you know? Everything aches, everything slips your mind… and needles… oh dear. But you've been very reassuring. And I trust you. Is there anything else I need to know? Or anything else you need from me? Before tomorrow, I mean. I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Nini, you’ve told me everything I need for now. Just rest well tonight, and try not to worry too much. Remember, Elena will be with you tomorrow, and we’ll take things slowly. I will call you tomorrow morning to confirm the appointment time. And if you have any questions or concerns before then, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. I think that’s all for today. Thank you for coming in, Ms. Nini. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
