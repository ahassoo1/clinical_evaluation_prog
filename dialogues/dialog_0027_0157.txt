DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the nurse said. Honestly, I don't even know why I'm here. My husband made the appointment. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. High blood pressure… the nurse did mention that during your intake. It’s good your husband is looking out for you. Even if it’s just to be sure. Sometimes it’s good to have someone else point these things out. So, can you tell me a little more about what led the nurse to check your blood pressure today?
PATIENT: It was during my annual physical. They always take it, I guess. I didn't feel anything was wrong. I’m perfectly healthy, as far as I know. I work outside a lot, you know, surveying. It’s physical work. Shouldn't help my blood pressure, if anything.
DOCTOR: Right, surveying… physical work. That’s good information. And it was during a routine check at your annual physical. I see. Do you know what the reading was, roughly?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Numbers aren't really my thing. The nurse just looked… concerned. Kept saying it was a little high, and that's why she wanted me to see you. She was very… persistent. It was irritating, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It’s easy to get annoyed when someone is pushing for something you don't feel you need. But sometimes, even if we feel fine, things can be going on under the surface. Okay. Well, let's do a quick check ourselves, just to confirm. And then we can talk about what it might mean, and what, if anything, we should do about it. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry it up. I have things to do. This is taking up my whole morning already.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as efficient as possible. We’ll just wrap this around your arm… comfortably snug, not too tight. And I'll need you to relax for a few minutes while I take the reading. Deep breaths. Okay… just a moment. … Alright. 148 over 92. It is a little elevated. Now let's take it again to be sure. 150 over 90. Definitely higher than we’d like. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just a standard part of the check-up.
PATIENT: Wonderful. See? All perfectly normal, as I said. My heart is strong from all the walking. What does this even mean, though? I feel fine. Are you going to give me pills or something? Because I really don’t want pills.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds strong, yes, and your lungs are clear. That's good. But a slightly elevated blood pressure reading doesn’t always mean something is wrong with your heart or lungs right now. It's more about the long-term risk. Now, to get a better idea of what's going on, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your medical history, just to rule out anything obvious. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. Never. This is all very… new. And honestly, a little insulting. I take care of myself. I eat reasonably well. I work hard. It’s not like I’m sitting around all day eating junk food. What else do you want to know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. I'm not trying to imply you don't take care of yourself. It’s just that high blood pressure can sometimes develop without any obvious cause. Okay, so, any family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had something… with her heart. She was old, though. Very old. And she lived a hard life. Not like me. She didn’t have good food or doctors. She just… passed away in her sleep. I don’t see how that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, grandmother with heart issues… that is relevant, actually. It doesn't mean you'll definitely develop the same problem, but it increases the risk. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. None. And I’m telling you, I don’t need any medications. I feel perfectly healthy. This is wasting my time. Are you sure you can't just… say I'm fine and send me on my way?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your reluctance, and I want to assure you that I’m not trying to rush into prescribing anything. However, ignoring high blood pressure can lead to serious problems down the road – heart attack, stroke, kidney failure. It’s better to be cautious. Right now, I'd like to get a clearer picture before making any decisions. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I would never. And my husband doesn't either. We're very healthy people. This is ridiculous. I really don't see the point of this whole exercise. Just… is my blood pressure dangerously high right now? Is it going to kill me if I walk home? That's all I want to know.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Dudney, your blood pressure is not dangerously high right now to the point where you’re at immediate risk. You are safe to walk home. However, it is elevated, and consistently elevated blood pressure over time can cause problems. Here's what I recommend. Before we start thinking about medications, let's try some lifestyle changes. Increased exercise—which you already do, which is great—and a low-sodium diet. I also want to repeat the blood pressure check in one week. And maybe do some at-home monitoring. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Home monitoring? More work. Fine. Whatever. Just… tell me exactly what I need to do. Keep it simple. I don’t want a lecture about fancy diets or anything. And I don't want to come back here unless absolutely necessary. Is there a machine I need to buy, or…?
DOCTOR: Okay, simple. You can purchase a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Look for one that goes around your upper arm, not your wrist—they're more accurate. Take your blood pressure twice a day—morning and evening—before you eat or take any medication. Write down the readings. Then, in one week, bring those readings with you, and we'll discuss them. We'll also talk about reducing sodium intake - that just means being mindful of salt in your food. I can give you a handout with some tips, if you'd like. No fancy diets, I promise. Here's a referral to a local pharmacy that carries good monitors, and the handout. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. That’s… enough questions for one day. I’m going to go. I have things to do. Thank you, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re very welcome, Ms. Dudney. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, the goal is to get a clearer picture, and we'll take it one step at a time. Have a good day. .
