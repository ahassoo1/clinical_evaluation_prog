DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you here?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Emiliano. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well… my foot. It’s been… troubling me. A sore, you see. A bad sore that won't get better. It hurts to walk, even a little bit.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Emiliano. I understand. A sore on your foot that’s causing you pain with walking. That certainly sounds troublesome. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this sore?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It started small, like a little cut, maybe from a shoe. But it just… got bigger. Now it’s red and… kind of deep. It’s been like this for… oh, I don’t know… a few months, maybe? Longer? Time… it gets away from me these days. It also smells a little bit, if I’m honest. Not good.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it started as a small cut on the bottom of your foot, near your toes, and has gradually gotten larger over several months. You’ve also noticed redness and a bit of an odor. Thank you for being so open with me, Emiliano. That's important information. Could you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… the pain. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. When I walk, it’s sharper, like something is pressing on it. Even when I’m just sitting, it’s there, a little bit. And sometimes, at night, it throbs. It doesn’t keep me awake every night, but… it’s not comfortable, you see? It’s a constant thing now.
DOCTOR: I see. A dull ache that sharpens with walking, and a throbbing sensation at night. It sounds like it’s becoming quite bothersome. Now, have you noticed any drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Let me think… yes. A little bit. It’s… not a lot, but sometimes when I change my bandage, there’s some… stuff. It's clear-ish, but sometimes a little bit… yellow. I try to keep it clean, but… it just seems to keep happening. It’s not like a lot of blood, if that's what you’re thinking. More like… water, but not clear. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Emiliano. So, some clear to yellowish drainage with bandage changes. Thank you for clarifying. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes or problems with circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The doctor… my old doctor, he told me I have the sugar sickness. Diabetes, he called it. And he said something about my blood… not flowing so good. Circulation, was it? I take pills for the sugar, every day. Been taking them for… a long time now. I can’t remember the name of the pill, I'm sorry. Old age, you know. And I think he said something about my feet… being more careful with my feet. I try to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. You have a history of diabetes and some circulation issues, and you take medication for the diabetes. It's perfectly alright that you don't recall the name of the medication; we can look that up in your records. And you were advised to be particularly careful with your feet. Let me take a look at your electronic health record now. Okay, I see here you are on Metformin 500mg twice daily. Good. And your diabetes is generally well-controlled, although your A1C was slightly elevated at your last visit six months ago. Now, I'd like to take a look at your foot, if that's alright with you. I'll need to perform a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Okay, Metformin… that’s right, that sounds familiar. And yes, I think I am allergic to latex. Makes my skin itchy and bumpy. I had a bad reaction once to a balloon. A long time ago, but… I remember it well. Balloons are trouble for me. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know about the latex allergy, Emiliano. We'll be sure to use latex-free gloves during the exam. Now, if you could please sit back and rest your foot on the exam table, that would be great. I'm just going to take a look at the sore, and I’ll gently feel around the area to assess it. Alright. The sore is located on the plantar aspect of your foot, near the base of your fifth toe, as you described. It's approximately 1.5 centimeters in diameter and does appear quite deep. There is some surrounding redness and a small amount of purulent drainage. I can feel a bit of warmth to the touch, and there’s tenderness upon palpation. Your pulses in both feet are present, though slightly diminished. Your skin is generally dry and there is some loss of protective sensation.
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… not good. Diminished pulses? Loss of sensation? Is it… serious, Doctor? I just want to be able to walk again without pain. I used to walk every morning, down by the beach. Now… it’s too hard. And the beach is so lovely in the morning. I don’t want to lose that. What does this all mean?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Emiliano. You're right to be worried, and it's good that you're asking these questions. The diminished pulses and loss of protective sensation are concerning, as they can indicate poor circulation, which is common in patients with diabetes. This makes it harder for wounds to heal and increases the risk of infection. Based on my examination, the sore appears to be infected, and there is a potential for it to worsen. It is serious, but we can take steps to address it. To determine the extent of the infection, and to rule out any deeper involvement, I recommend we perform a few tests. We'll need to get a culture of the wound to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. We’ll also need blood work to check your white blood cell count and assess your overall health. And finally, I think it would be wise to get an X-ray of your foot to make sure there’s no underlying bone infection. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, I suppose so. If it will help. I don’t like the sound of bone infection, though. That sounds… very bad. But if it will help me walk again… then yes, do the tests. The culture, the blood work, the X-ray. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… please help me get back to the beach. That’s all I really want. Can I still walk on it at all? Even a little? Before we do all these tests? Just to get to the car? I don’t want to sit here all day.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. Your desire to get back to the beach is very clear, and I assure you, we'll do everything we can to help you achieve that. Regarding walking on it before the tests… given the diminished pulses and potential for infection, I strongly advise against it. Even a little bit of walking could worsen the infection and delay healing. I understand you don't want to sit here all day, and I apologize for any inconvenience this causes. We'll try to move as quickly as possible, but it’s important to prioritize protecting your foot at this stage. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology department immediately. The lab tests should only take a few minutes, and the X-ray shouldn’t be too long either. A nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, I’m going to apply a sterile dressing to the wound to keep it protected and clean. And I will prescribe you an oral antibiotic to start fighting the infection right away, pending the results of the wound culture. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… yes, that sounds good. Anything to help. Sterile dressing, too. Protect it. Clean it. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please hurry. And thank you. For listening. For caring. It’s… nice to have someone who understands. And hurry. About the beach. It’s especially lovely this time of year.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. I assure you, we will move as quickly as possible. And you are very welcome. It’s my job to listen and care, and I’m happy to do so. Now, I'm going to write a prescription for Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg twice daily for 10 days. This will help address the infection while we await the culture results. The nurse will give you instructions on how to take it. She'll also provide you with detailed wound care instructions – how often to change the dressing, signs of worsening infection to watch out for, and when to contact us. Once the lab results are back, we'll discuss them with you and determine the best course of treatment. If the infection is severe or doesn’t respond to oral antibiotics, you may require intravenous antibiotics in the hospital. But let’s focus on the positive and hope for the best. Do you have any questions for me at this time, before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: Intravenous… hospital? Oh dear. Let’s not talk about that right now. No, no hospital. Thank you. I think… I think that’s all the questions I have. Just… the beach. Please remember the beach. And thank you again, Doctor. You’re very kind. I’m a little scared, but… I feel a little bit better now. Just the beach. Is that okay? .
DOCTOR: Yes, Emiliano. I remember the beach. And we will do everything we can to get you back there. That’s our goal. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood and get you started on the antibiotics. Please don’t hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small they may seem. Thank you for trusting me with your care.
