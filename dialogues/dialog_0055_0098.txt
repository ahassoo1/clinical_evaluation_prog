DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, to be honest… I just been curious. I ain’t really sick sick. Just figured I should probably get a check-up, you know? Been a while.
DOCTOR: I see. A preventative check-up is always… advisable. Though, frankly, I find many patients waste valuable resources on such… unnecessary procedures. Nevertheless. Has anything specifically prompted this visit, even if you don’t consider it a serious illness?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I can think of. Maybe… I been a little tired lately. But I work on the boats, so that’s kinda normal, right? Long hours and all. It ain’t like, can’t-get-out-of-bed tired, just… more tired than usual, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “More tired than usual” is… vague, Mr. Heindel. Could you elaborate?
PATIENT: Yeah, I get that. Vague ain't helpful, huh? Okay, so… usually, I can get through a shift, then maybe chill with a little TV, then sleep alright. Now, I’m still getting through the shifts, but after work, I just wanna… lie down. And sometimes I wake up feeling like I didn’t sleep enough, even if I got eight hours. It’s been going on for… a couple of months, maybe? I dunno exactly. Not a big deal, probably. Just… different.
DOCTOR: Different is… a start. And several months of “different” warrants some… investigation. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside this fatigue?
PATIENT: Let me think… Uh… not really. No fever, no cough, no aches. I guess… maybe I’ve been a little… clumsy lately? Dropped my tools a few times. Usually pretty steady on my feet. But that could just be from being tired, right? Honestly, Doctor, I feel fine other than that. Maybe I'm just getting old!
DOCTOR: “Getting old” at your age is… unlikely. Clumsiness can be a symptom of various things, though I suspect it is simply a result of… inattention. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Nah, appetite's the same. Still eat a good amount, always hungry after a shift on the boat. And my weight... I think it's about the same. Haven’t stepped on a scale in a while, but my clothes fit like they always have. I wouldn't say I've gained or lost anything.
DOCTOR: Very well. And any changes in your bowel habits, Mr. Heindel?
PATIENT: Uh… wow, straight to the point, huh? Everything’s… normal down there, Doctor. Regular as clockwork, you could say. No problems. Sorry if that’s too much information!
DOCTOR: Such matters are… unavoidable in a proper medical examination. I assure you, I am not easily… disturbed. Now, let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I don’t take any medications regularly either. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes if I pull a muscle on the boat, but that’s about it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandma on my mom’s side… she had something with her heart, I think she needed surgery when she was older. But that’s about all I know, really. Nobody really talked about health stuff much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: A lack of information is… problematic. Very well. And what about your social habits, Mr. Heindel?
PATIENT: Social habits? You mean like… what do I do for fun? Well, I don't really go out much. Mostly just hang around, watch TV, maybe call a friend. Since the divorce, haven’t been much for going out. I don’t drink a lot, maybe a beer sometimes with dinner. And I definitely don’t do any… drugs. Never have. Just a pretty quiet life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I see. And before your… recent life changes, what was your typical daily routine like?
PATIENT: Well, when I was married… we used to do a lot more stuff. Go to the movies, have dinner with friends, take weekend trips. But now… it's mostly work, come home, eat, sleep, repeat. Before work I'd wake up, have some coffee, get ready. On my days off I mostly just tried to relax. It’s… less hectic now, that’s for sure. But not always in a good way, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Heindel, given your symptoms and your… lifestyle changes, I believe some basic bloodwork is warranted. We'll check your complete blood count, your thyroid function, and your vitamin D levels. It's likely just a vitamin deficiency, or perhaps some mild anemia, but we need to rule out anything more serious. I'll also have a urine sample taken. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Sounds like a plan. Bloodwork and… pee test. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just wanna make sure I ain't gettin' seriously sick or anything. Yeah, let's do it. Where do I go for that?
DOCTOR: The phlebotomist is down the hall, first door on the right. She will draw your blood. Then, there’s a small restroom just past her station for the urine sample. I'll have the results sent to me, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound suitable, Mr. Heindel?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… perfect. Easy enough. First door on the right, then the restroom. Okay, got it. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen. I’ll go get that done now.
DOCTOR: Very well. Try not to overexert yourself before the tests. It could… complicate the results. And Mr. Heindel?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Try to maintain a… semblance of positivity. It can have a surprisingly… significant impact on one’s health. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients awaiting my attention.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay… yeah, sure. I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor. Have a good day. .
