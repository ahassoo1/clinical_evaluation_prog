DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kinjerski. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been persistent enough that I thought it best to have it checked out. It’s primarily in my right leg, though sometimes it feels…distant in the left as well.
DOCTOR: Alright. Numbness, you say. And it's predominantly in the right leg, with some occasional sensation in the left. Can you describe this numbness for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not a complete loss of feeling, Doctor, more like…a lessening. Like when your foot falls asleep, but it doesn't quite go away completely, even after you move it around. And it isn’t painful, not exactly. Just…absent. Sometimes it feels cold, even when the room is warm. I suppose a tingling sensation accompanies it, as well, though it’s not consistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lessening of sensation, like a foot falling asleep but not resolving completely. No pain, but coldness and intermittent tingling. And you said this has been going on for how long now?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It began… approximately three weeks ago, I believe. It was very mild at first, easily dismissed. I attributed it to sitting for long periods while working, but it hasn't improved with changes in posture or regular movement. It’s become more noticeable over the past week, to the point where it’s slightly impacting my ability to walk comfortably for extended periods. I work as a special effects artist and animator, so I spend quite a bit of time at my workstation. Perhaps that is relevant.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is relevant. Prolonged sitting can certainly contribute to these types of symptoms. Do you notice anything specifically triggers the numbness?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. I’ve been paying attention to that. It seems to worsen with… prolonged stillness, naturally. But even when I’m moving around, it can flare up if I’ve been sitting for a while. And, oddly enough, sometimes when I’m concentrating intensely on my work, I don’t notice it at all, then suddenly it’s quite pronounced when I look up. It doesn't seem linked to any specific activity beyond that.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it’s worsened by stillness, but doesn't necessarily require movement to be alleviated, and sometimes seems to be masked by intense concentration. Have you experienced any weakness in your leg, or any changes in your reflexes?
PATIENT: Weakness… no, I don't believe so. I've consciously tested it a few times, attempting to lift objects and walk as usual, and haven't detected any discernible difference. My reflexes… that’s harder to assess myself, honestly. I haven't noticed anything off, but I wouldn't be able to provide a reliable answer. I'm afraid my self-diagnosis skills are rather limited in that regard. Perhaps a physical exam would be the best way to determine that?
DOCTOR: Yes, a physical exam would be helpful. Let's start with that. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to do. I’m happy to comply.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kinjerski. I'm going to assess your reflexes, sensation, and strength in both legs. I'll start with your reflexes. This might feel like a little tap. Relax your leg, and let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: That was… unremarkable, Doctor. No pain, just the expected sensation of the tap.
DOCTOR: Good. And now the Achilles tendon. Again, just relax your foot. Now, let’s check the left side.
PATIENT: Both sides felt…similar, Doctor. I didn’t perceive any noticeable difference in the responses between my right and left legs.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s test your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch different areas of your legs with this, and I want you to tell me when you feel it. Just say "yes" when you feel the touch. Please keep your eyes closed.
PATIENT: Yes. Yes. Yes... Yes. No…No. Yes. Yes. No…No. Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: I am squeezing as tightly as I am able, Doctor. Please let me know if you require more force.
DOCTOR: Good strength. Now, can you resist me as I try to push your legs down?
PATIENT: I will do my best to resist, Doctor. Please proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Good resistance on both sides. Okay, let’s sit up now. Alright, Mr. Kinjerski. Based on this exam, your reflexes and strength are intact bilaterally. Your sensation is slightly diminished in your right leg compared to your left, but it's not a complete loss of sensation. The exam doesn't suggest any major neurological deficits. It could be related to a nerve compression somewhere, possibly from prolonged sitting, or even something like early peripheral neuropathy, though that is less likely given your age. Do you have any history of diabetes or other medical conditions?
PATIENT: That is…reassuring to hear, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to perform such a thorough assessment. As for medical history… no, I do not have any history of diabetes. My overall health is quite good, to the best of my knowledge. I do not have any chronic conditions, and I haven't experienced any significant illnesses in recent years. I occasionally experience mild seasonal allergies, but that is the extent of my medical concerns.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications on a regular basis. I haven’t required any prescription or over-the-counter drugs for an extended period. I occasionally use a topical cream for minor skin irritations, but that’s infrequent and hardly constitutes a regular medication.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of neuropathy, nerve disorders, or conditions like multiple sclerosis?
PATIENT: That’s a thoughtful question, Doctor. Let me think… my maternal grandmother experienced some difficulty with balance in her later years, and was eventually diagnosed with a mild form of peripheral neuropathy, I believe. It developed quite late in life, though. Beyond that… no, I don’t recall any other significant history of neurological disorders within my family. My parents are both in good health, and my siblings haven’t experienced any related issues.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your age, good overall health, the mild sensory deficit, and your grandmother's history, a few things seem plausible. It could be a mild nerve entrapment, like what people experience with sciatica, but in your leg instead of your back, or early peripheral neuropathy. I'd like to order a Vitamin B12 level, a CBC to rule out any underlying issues, and an EMG/NCS, which is a nerve conduction study. That will help us determine if there's any nerve damage and where it's located. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding prolonged sitting when possible, stretching your legs regularly, and if you do sit for long periods, getting up and walking around every 30-60 minutes. Would you like a referral to a neurologist for the EMG/NCS?
PATIENT: That sounds like a sensible plan, Doctor. I appreciate you outlining the potential causes and proposing a course of action. A referral to a neurologist for the EMG/NCS would be greatly appreciated, yes. I trust their expertise in assessing nerve function would be beneficial in reaching a definitive diagnosis. I am happy to follow your recommendations regarding stretching and avoiding prolonged sitting; I’ll make that a priority.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write the referral order now, and the lab requisition for the Vitamin B12 and CBC. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to draw both tests at the same time. Here are your orders. The neurologist’s office will call you to schedule an appointment. They may request your medical records from my office. I’ll also send a summary of today’s consultation to them. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This has been very informative and I feel considerably more at ease knowing we have a plan in place. One question, if you don't mind. Is there anything specific I should be looking for, any worsening symptoms I should report immediately to either you or the neurologist?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. Yes. If you experience any weakness in your leg, particularly if it’s sudden onset, any changes in your bowel or bladder control, or if the numbness becomes severe or spreads rapidly, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Also, if you develop any pain that doesn't resolve with rest, report that as well. Otherwise, just follow up with the neurologist as scheduled, and let me know if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I will also check the results of your lab work when they become available. Here is a print out of today's notes and the orders for your records. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: That is very helpful, Doctor. I appreciate you outlining those specific warning signs. I will be sure to monitor closely for those and will not hesitate to seek immediate medical attention if they arise. I believe that covers all of my questions for now. Thank you again for your thorough assessment and clear explanations.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kinjerski. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
