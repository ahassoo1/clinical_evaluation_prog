DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have limited time, so if you could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it’s been a bit tricky going to the bathroom lately. It just… takes a long time to start, and then it's not a strong stream, you know? It’s been going on for maybe a month now, I’d say. Not getting worse quickly, but definitely not getting better either.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Started around the beginning of July, I think. July 4th was fine, but a few days after that I noticed it was…slower, to put it nicely. I remember because we had guests over for the holiday, and I was mindful of not wanting to bother them.
DOCTOR: And this difficulty…is it constant, or intermittent?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not every time, Doctor. Some times it’s perfectly normal, just like it used to be. But more and more often, it takes me a minute or two to get things going, and then it’s weak. It’s frustrating, to be honest. Especially when I have to go somewhere! You know, traveling… it makes me worry.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you experiencing any discomfort before, during, or after urination?
PATIENT: Hmm… discomfort. Not pain, exactly. But sometimes I feel like… like I still need to go, even after I’ve just been. A little bit of a nagging feeling, you know? And before… sometimes a little pressure, low down. It's not sharp, nothing terrible. Just… noticeable. Not every time, though. Like everything else, it comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Now that you mention it… I think it's been a little darker than usual, yes. Not a bright orange or anything, but not the pale yellow it normally is. More… a sort of straw color, maybe? I hadn’t really paid much attention before, to be honest. I drink plenty of water, usually. Though it has been hot lately. I suppose that could be it.
DOCTOR: And any fever, chills, nausea, or lower back pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, thank goodness. And I haven't been sick to my stomach. Lower back… sometimes a little ache, but I have arthritis, Doctor, so that’s pretty normal for me. I wouldn’t say it’s worse than usual, if that makes sense. Just the regular ache. I take something for it, usually helps.
DOCTOR: Have you experienced any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no blood, thank goodness. Definitely not. I would have noticed that, I think. That would be… quite alarming. No, just the darker color, that's all. I'm glad it's not blood. That would really worry me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. Given your age and these symptoms—the difficulty initiating urination, the weak stream, the lingering sensation, and the darker urine—we need to rule out a few possibilities. I will need to perform a physical examination, and I'll order a urinalysis and a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out infection. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that makes sense, Doctor. I understand. Allergies… hmm. I’m a little sensitive to penicillin, makes me itch. And I get a rash with poison ivy, but that’s just common sense, I suppose. Otherwise, no, not really. I can take most medications fine. Itching with penicillin is the only thing I know of. And I’m a little afraid of needles, but who isn’t?
DOCTOR: Very well. Penicillin allergy noted. We will avoid that. As for the needle… we will be as quick as possible. Now, if you would please follow me. We will start with a simple abdominal exam, and then I'll need to check your prostate, if you don't mind. It's a standard procedure for men with these symptoms. It may be uncomfortable, but it should be brief.
PATIENT: Oh. A prostate check? But… I’m a woman, Doctor. Are you sure? I mean, I understand you're busy and all, but… women don’t have prostates, do they? I’m a little confused. Perhaps there's been a mistake?
DOCTOR: …My apologies, Ms. Yadao. You are absolutely correct. A regrettable error on my part. Please disregard that previous statement. We will, of course, be performing a pelvic exam, not a prostate check. I… apologize again for the confusion. It’s been a long morning. Let’s proceed with the pelvic exam, then.
PATIENT: Oh! Well, that's… a relief, Doctor. A pelvic exam makes much more sense. Mistakes happen, I suppose. Don't worry about it too much. Though… perhaps a quick double-check of the chart before mentioning things like… prostates? Just a thought. Yes, let’s do the pelvic exam, then. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you would please lie on the examination table, and we'll get started. I will need you to… gently relax. I will explain each step as we go. And again, my sincere apologies for the earlier… misunderstanding. Now, if you could just… position yourself comfortably.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. No worries, truly. I'll just lie down, then. Hopefully, it won't be too… unpleasant. And please, don't worry about apologizing so much. It's a little embarrassing for both of us, I think. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’ll try to relax. Here goes…
DOCTOR: Now, breathing deeply, please. Good. I’m palpating your abdomen. No tenderness noted. Now, I’m performing a speculum exam. This may cause some pressure… Okay. Cervix appears normal. No obvious lesions. Now I’m performing a bimanual exam. Assessing the size and shape of your uterus and ovaries. No masses palpated. Uterus is normal in size. Ovaries are… somewhat enlarged. Not alarmingly so, but we will need to investigate further. Alright, Ms. Yadao. That concludes the physical exam. Now, we will wait for the urinalysis results.
PATIENT: Oh. Enlarged ovaries… That doesn’t sound good, does it? What does that mean, exactly? Is it…serious? I suppose it’s good you’re investigating, but… it’s a bit worrying to hear. How long will the urinalysis take? And what happens next if… if something is wrong? I’m starting to feel a little anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Somewhat enlarged” is not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, Ms. Yadao. Many factors can contribute to ovarian size. It could be a cyst, which are often benign and resolve on their own. However, to rule out any potential malignancy, we will need to order a transvaginal ultrasound. The urinalysis should be back within the hour. Once we have the ultrasound results, we can determine the next course of action. If there are any concerning findings, we will refer you to a gynecologist for further evaluation, possibly a CA-125 blood test and a biopsy. Do you have any family history of ovarian cancer?
PATIENT: Ovarian cancer… Oh dear. That’s… a little frightening to think about. No, no family history that I know of. My mother had arthritis, like me, and my sister has high blood pressure, but no cancer. I don’t think. We didn’t talk about it much, to be honest. She died a long time ago. So, an ultrasound… that sounds reasonable. Will it be painful? I’m really not good with… procedures, if you know what I mean. And a biopsy? Oh, that sounds awful. Is that definitely necessary? Perhaps we can wait and see if the ultrasound shows anything before resorting to such things? I’m starting to worry a lot, Doctor.
DOCTOR: An ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging test, Ms. Yadao. It should not be painful, though you may experience some mild discomfort from the probe. A biopsy is not definitely necessary at this stage. We will only consider it if the ultrasound reveals any suspicious masses. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you we will proceed cautiously and only perform necessary tests. We need to gather more information before making any definitive decisions. Now, let me review your chart one more time… Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I've never smoked. Never even tried it. My mother didn't approve, and frankly, I never had the urge. Always thought it was a terrible habit. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Not a heavy drinker, not at all. Mostly water, really. Especially with all this worry about my kidneys! I’m hoping it’s just a little cyst, like you said. That would be the best outcome, wouldn’t it? This waiting is just… awful. Is there anything I can do to help myself in the meantime? Drink more water, perhaps? Or something else?
DOCTOR: Increasing your water intake is always a good idea, Ms. Yadao. And avoiding excessive alcohol consumption is prudent. For now, there is little else you can do except wait for the ultrasound results. I understand your anxiety, but premature worry will only exacerbate the situation. The nurse will contact you when the results are available, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Just… thank you for your time. And for being… thorough, I suppose. It’s just a lot to take in, all at once. I’ll try not to worry too much, as you said. Easier said than done, of course. Yes, well. I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurse to call. Thank you again, Doctor Mutnick. .
DOCTOR: Very well. If you experience any sudden abdominal pain, or fever, contact the office immediately. Have a good day, Ms. Yadao.
