DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, if you could tell me in your own words what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s… unpleasant. A bit embarrassing, frankly. There’s something… white in my mouth. It’s not painful, precisely, but it’s… there. I haven’t the time for this, you understand. I’m a faller, a professional. Time is money.
DOCTOR: A “faller”?
PATIENT: Yes. A faller. As in, I fell trees. For a living. It's… skilled labor. Do you need a detailed explanation of forestry? Because I assure you, it’s quite demanding, and I haven’t got all day to explain the nuances of timber harvesting. The point is, I'm a working man, and this… thing in my mouth is interfering with my work.
DOCTOR: Right. A professional faller. And this… “thing” – when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know. A week, maybe? Ten days? Honestly, I wasn’t paying much attention until it started… spreading. It’s mostly on my tongue, I think. And it makes it difficult to… well, to taste things properly. Which is a problem, as you can imagine. A good meal is important after a long day.
DOCTOR: And has anything, to your knowledge, changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, “changed”? I cut trees. Every day. Same trees, different location, same principle. Unless you're suggesting the trees themselves are causing this, I don’t know what you mean. My wife makes the same dinner every Tuesday, so no, nothing's changed on that front either. It's certainly not a social life change, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Any new foods?
PATIENT: New foods? Doctor, I eat what is put in front of me. My wife decides the menu. She’s a very capable woman, but adventurous cuisine isn’t her forte. It’s generally… meat and potatoes. Sometimes rice. Definitely no… exotic fruits or anything of that nature. Are you implying my diet is somehow to blame? Because I assure you, I maintain a perfectly adequate physique for my profession.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Do I look like the type? I work outdoors, Doctor. Fresh air is essential. Besides, it's bad for your lungs. A faller needs his lungs. It's rather simple, really. A sensible man avoids such things.
DOCTOR: Any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: A slight cold, perhaps, a few months back. Nothing serious. I powered through it. A faller doesn't have time for being ill. It's lost wages, you see. And my wife makes a very strong tea. That usually does the trick. Honestly, I'm starting to feel rather foolish answering these… elementary questions. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I need a complete medical history to properly assess your condition. Let’s try this. Any fever, chills, or night sweats in the past few weeks?
PATIENT: Fever? Doctor, I work outside all day! I sweat, naturally. It’s called exertion. I hardly think that qualifies as a medical symptom. And no, I haven't been shivering in my sleep. I have perfectly good blankets. Look, I appreciate your concern, but frankly, I’m wasting valuable time here. Can we just… address the white stuff in my mouth? That’s what I came for. This interrogation is quite unnecessary. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Let me examine your mouth, then. Please open wide. And try to remain still.
