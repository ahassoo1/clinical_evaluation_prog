DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Or, is it Lacreasha?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, Lacreasha is fine. Just...Lacreasha. It's the name on my card, right? Everything okay with the computer? Looks kinda busy.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, Lacreasha is perfect. And, apologies, just a bit of…system updating. Nothing to concern you with. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s my nails. They just…changed. I don’t know how they changed, exactly. They just…do. They look…funny. Not good funny. More like…old lady funny. I noticed it last week, I think. Or maybe it was before that. Time gets away from ya, you know?
DOCTOR: Changed how, exactly?
PATIENT: Well…they're kinda thick. And yellow-ish. Not bright yellow, just…dull. And they feel…hard. Like, not soft like they should be. I used to get manicures, but I stopped. Waste of money, really. A girl should be able to take care of her own nails, but…I don't know what's happening to them. Are you sure this computer is okay? It’s makin’ noises.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, just a bit slow. Now, let's focus on your nails. You said they've been changing for about a week or so?
PATIENT: Uh…a week? Maybe longer. Honestly, I can’t really say. Things just…blend together. I do a lot, you know? It’s not like I’m just sittin’ around lookin’ at my nails all day. I'm an audiologist! People need their ears checked. Important work. But…I guess, yeah, a week sounds about right. They haven’t gotten worse worse, if that makes sense. Just…different. Old lady different.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. So, changes in nail thickness, color, and texture…and you haven't noticed any pain or discomfort with them?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not at all. Just…unattractive. It’s kinda embarrassing, really. A professional woman should have nice hands. You see people's hands all the time. It's the first thing you notice! And now…these. Like, if I was checkin’ someone’s ears and they saw these…oh, it would be terrible. Do you think it's a fungus? My neighbor had a fungus, and her nails looked…bad. Real bad. Is that what this is?
DOCTOR: It could be a fungal infection, yes. That's certainly a possibility, but there are other things that can cause changes in nails as well. We should take a closer look. Would you mind if I examined your hands and nails?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. Just…be gentle, alright? I gotta get back to work later. Lots of appointments. People can’t hear, you know? It’s a serious problem. But, yeah, look at ‘em. See what you think. Just don’t take too long. My hands aren’t that bad. Are you sure that computer is okay? It's blinking a lot now.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's have a look. I'll be as quick as possible. Hmm. They are thicker than average, and there is some discoloration. No pitting that I can see, and the nail beds appear intact. I don’t see any signs of active infection at the moment, but it’s difficult to say definitively without further testing. It could be onychomycosis—a fungal infection—or it could be something else, like psoriasis or even just age-related changes. Do you have any history of psoriasis?
PATIENT: Psoria-what? No. Never had that. I just…get dry skin sometimes. Especially in the winter. And I used to bite my nails when I was younger. Bad habit, I know. But I stopped. Years ago. Honestly, I think it's just…old age. I'm forty, you know? Things start fallin’ apart. I just wish my nails didn't look so…unprofessional. Is there a cream I can put on it? Something fast? I don't have time for a long treatment. People are dependin' on me to fix their ears! What’s blinkin’ on the screen now? It’s kinda distractin’.
DOCTOR: The computer is…being difficult. Let’s focus on your nails. There are topical treatments for fungal infections, yes, but they often take several months to show results, and they don’t always work. We could do a nail clipping to send to the lab for a culture to confirm if it's a fungus, and that would help us determine the best course of action. It's the most accurate way to know for sure. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, a clipping? Like, cut off a piece of my nail? That sounds…unpleasant. But…okay, if you think it’s necessary. Just be quick about it. And don’t make a mess. I have a lunch appointment later. Medical conditions? Uh…not really. I get headaches sometimes. Stress, you know? Runnin’ a practice is stressful. And my back gets sore from bendin’ over people’s ears all day. But that’s it. Nothing serious. Are you sure that computer is okay? It's makin’ a whirrin’ noise now. It sounds like it’s gonna explode!
DOCTOR: Alright, just a small clipping, Ms. Thut. It shouldn’t be painful. And we’ll be very careful. There. Now, we'll send this off to the lab. It usually takes about a week or so to get the results. In the meantime, keep your nails trimmed and dry, and avoid wearing nail polish. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Okay, done. That wasn’t so bad. Keep ‘em trimmed, huh? Like a little garden. Alright. No polish, got it. I used to like red polish. But…professional, right? No polish. Medications…uh…just some ibuprofen for my headaches sometimes. And a multivitamin. That’s it. Nothing fancy. Honestly, I try to stay healthy. Gotta be healthy for my patients! This computer is makin’ really weird noises now. I think it's gonna…
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed and a multivitamin. That's good. So, to summarize, we've taken a nail clipping for fungal culture. We'll get the results in about a week. In the meantime, keep your nails trimmed and dry, and avoid polish. We’ll discuss treatment options once we have the results. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get hay fever when I was a kid, but I grew out of it. And I get itchy sometimes if I wear cheap jewelry. But that’s it. Nothing serious enough to worry about. Honestly, I think this computer is about to explode. It's shakin' now! Are you sure it’s okay? Maybe we should just…wait on the results? I really need to get back to work. People are dependin’ on me! It’s kinda urgent, you know? Ears! They're important!
DOCTOR: You are right, Ms. Thut. This computer is clearly malfunctioning. I apologize for the distraction. Let's just finish up. We've taken a nail clipping for culture. I'll have the results sent to you as soon as they’re available. We'll discuss treatment options at that time. If you experience any pain or significant changes in your nails before then, please call the office. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just…try to get that computer fixed, alright? It’s kinda scary. And, yeah, send me the results. Fast. People are waitin’. Ears! They need fixin’! I think I’m good. Unless… will the results be expensive? Medicare covers ears, right? But does it cover nails? Oh, this is a mess. Can we just forget about the nails? I gotta go. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Yes, let's just focus on getting you back to your patients. Medicare should cover the nail culture, but we'll verify that for you. And if it doesn't, we can certainly discuss options. Here's my card. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I apologize again for the computer issues. Have a good day, Ms. Thut. And thank you for coming in.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. You too. And please, fix that computer! It’s a menace!
