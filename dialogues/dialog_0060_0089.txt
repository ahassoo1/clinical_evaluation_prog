DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, thank you, Doctor… Nooruddin, is it? It’s about… well, the pain. Lower down, you see. It comes and goes, but it’s been… troublesome lately. It’s hard to explain, everything feels a bit foggy these days. I believe it has something to do with… the lupus, perhaps? I was diagnosed some time ago, though the details escape me.
DOCTOR: Lupus, right. Yes, I see here you were diagnosed a number of years ago. And this pain… you say it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Not constant, thankfully. But when it does come… it’s quite severe. A cramping, deep ache, mostly. It feels… different than other aches I’ve had, if that makes sense. It’s hard to pinpoint, truly. It tends to flare up without much warning, and then subside just as suddenly. I haven’t been keeping a close log, I’m afraid. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where exactly is this pain located?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a tricky one. It’s… down here, mostly. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… spreading ache throughout the lower part of my tummy. Sometimes it feels more on the left side, sometimes more in the middle. It’s not always in the same spot, which is why it's so confusing. I wish I could be more specific, Doctor. It just… is. Is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: “Helpful is… relative. We need something to work with, Ms. Glymph. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don’t think so, not really. Or perhaps… stress? I've been rather preoccupied lately with… well, everything, truthfully. Though, truthfully, I'm always a bit preoccupied. I don’t recall any specific foods or activities triggering it, no. It just… happens. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. I wish I could identify a pattern, but it’s proving elusive. Perhaps it's just a part of the lupus?
DOCTOR: Lupus can present in many ways, yes. But we can't just assume it's always the lupus. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh… my bowel habits? Well… not that I’ve noticed, specifically. Perhaps a little… irregular, at times. But nothing drastic, no. I tend not to pay a great deal of attention to such things, if I'm honest. Is that… relevant, Doctor? I apologize if I'm not being very helpful. I truly am trying to recall anything unusual, but my mind feels… clouded.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to ask a few more personal questions. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear… No, Doctor, I haven’t. Not that I’ve seen, at least. It’s… difficult to say with certainty, I suppose. I don’t examine such things very closely, and as I mentioned, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I wouldn’t recall if I had noticed something… subtle. Is this… a common symptom? I apologize for my lack of clarity. I feel rather… flustered. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, with all due respect, it's important to be precise when discussing medical concerns. We're trying to determine the cause of your pain. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or weight loss recently?
