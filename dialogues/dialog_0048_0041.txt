DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Dorman Astore, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Dorman Astore. It is good to meet you, Doctor… Sink, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, Sink will do. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Sink, it’s… hard to explain exactly. My legs, they just… don’t work like they used to. Getting weaker, you see. It’s been happening for a little while now, slow like, but it’s getting harder to do things. Walking, mostly. It worries my wife.
DOCTOR: Weakness… how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It’s… not easy to say exactly. Maybe six months, maybe a little longer? It started so small, I didn't think much of it at first. Just a little tiredness, you know? But it's… more now. It’s definitely more.
DOCTOR: "Slowly" isn’t a timeframe, Mr. Astore. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, mostly. Some days are a little better than others, but it’s… always there. A heaviness, you see? And getting harder to lift my feet when I walk. It's not a sharp pain, just… tiring. Does that make sense, Doctor? I'm not good with… with saying things proper like.
DOCTOR: It's… sufficient. Any numbness or tingling?
PATIENT: Sometimes. In my feet, mostly. Like when they're falling asleep, but not all the way. Just a little… pins and needles, you know? It comes and goes, like the tiredness. Not always there, but it happens. My wife says I stumble a little more these days too. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: And are you diabetic, Mr. Astore?
PATIENT: Diabetic? Oh, no, no. Never been diabetic. Doctor checked me for that a few years back, said I was fine. I eat pretty good, mostly fish and fruits. My wife, she makes sure of that. I don’t drink much soda, you know? Only sometimes with a nice meal. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had any recent falls?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A small one, maybe a month ago. I was walking in the garden, and my legs just… gave way. Nothing broken, thankfully. My wife helped me up right away. It scared her something awful, though. It’s why we came to see you, Doctor. I don’t want to keep falling.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I have a bad back, always have. Old football injury. Doesn’t bother me too much most days, just a little stiff. And my knees ache sometimes, with the weather. But nothing serious, Doctor. I take some things for the aches, but… nothing major. Oh, and I have Medicare. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Medicare is… noted. Now, any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Yes. A long time ago, when I was a young man. Appendicitis. Had it taken out. And… a little work on my shoulder, from football again. A tear, you see. But that was many years ago. Everything should be healed up proper now. Doctor checked it when I hurt it bad. A long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your family… any history of similar problems?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Hmm... my mother, she had some trouble walking when she got old, real old. I don't know exactly what it was, she didn't talk much about it. And my brother... he had some nerve problems in his hands. Not legs, though. Just hands. It was a long time ago, I don’t remember exactly. Everything was so long ago. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Marginally. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. For my back, mostly. A little pill for the pain. And sometimes, when my knees are real bad, I take something for that too. My wife helps me keep track of it all. I'm not good at remembering names, you see. I think the back one is… naproxen? Something like that. She'll know for sure.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Please stand up and walk for me, if you can. And try not to hold onto anything.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will try. It might be a little wobbly, you see. My legs… they feel a little weak today. Here goes. It’s harder than it looks, you know?
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Gait is slightly unsteady, with a tendency to drift to the right. Reduced stride length on the left side. Mild weakness noted in dorsiflexion of the left foot. Balance is… suboptimal. Please sit back down. Now, can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can feel that. It's… a little cold. Is something wrong? I feel… a little nervous now. It feels different than the cold from the air, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes are… diminished in the lower extremities. Sensory function appears intact, but slightly reduced in the feet. Now, let me check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you need. My wife always says I get nervous at the doctor. I don't like feeling poked and prodded, you know? Is everything alright? I feel… a little lightheaded, maybe.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… acceptable. However, given your symptoms and exam findings, I suspect peripheral neuropathy, possibly exacerbated by vascular insufficiency. We need to rule out other causes, of course. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a Vitamin B12 level, and a nerve conduction study. We’ll also need to consider imaging to evaluate for spinal stenosis. This will take some time. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Neu… what now, Doctor? And imaging? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. I don’t understand half of those words, you see. What does that mean? Is it… bad? My wife will be so worried. Can you explain it to me, slow like? In plain English, please. I just want to be able to walk again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. In simple terms, your nerves—the wires that send messages from your brain to your legs—may be damaged. This can cause weakness, tingling, and pain. The tests will help us figure out why they’re damaged, and if there’s something we can do about it. Imaging – an X-ray or scan – will show us if there's something pressing on your spine. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything bad, but we need to investigate. I'm referring you to a neurologist for further evaluation. They're the specialists in nerve problems. I will also prescribe you a walking aid, a cane, to help stabilize you. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh dear. That sounds… serious, Doctor. And a cane? I don’t want a cane. I want to be able to walk on my own. Is this… is this what my mother had? Is it… getting worse? Will I end up in a wheelchair? My wife… she’s going to be so scared. I don’t understand all of this. Can you explain it one more time, slow like? And… what happens next? Will these tests hurt?
DOCTOR: Mr. Astore, I understand you're anxious, but I have other patients waiting. The tests are relatively painless – a simple blood draw and a nerve conduction study involves small electrical impulses. The neurologist will explain the results and discuss treatment options. I’m not clairvoyant, I cannot predict the future. It may not be as bad as you fear. This pamphlet contains more information. I'm also prescribing you Gabapentin to help manage the nerve pain. Schedule an appointment with the neurologist as soon as possible. I've completed the referral and prescription. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Gab… what now? More pills? Oh dear. I don't want to take a lot of pills. I just want to know… will I still be able to dance at my grandson’s wedding? He's getting married next year. It's important to me, you see. And… will these pills make me sleepy? My wife likes to watch television with me. I just want to be able to live my life, you know? Can you just… tell me if it’s going to be alright? I’m just an old man, Doctor. I don’t understand all these fancy words.
