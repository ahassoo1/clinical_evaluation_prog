DOCTOR: Hi Gerhard, welcome. I'm Dr. Rosanova. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Rosanova. It is good to meet you as well. I am here... because of my ear. It is... leaking something. A fluid, you understand? It started maybe three days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, leaking fluid from your ear for about three days now. That's good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about the fluid?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little bit yellow, but not much. And it does not… smell bad, if that is important. It just… comes out. Mostly when I lie down on that side. It makes a small wet spot on my pillow.
DOCTOR: It's clear mostly, sometimes a little yellow, no odor, and it comes out when you lie on that side... okay. Has this happened before, Gerhard?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, not like this. I had… an ear ache, many years ago, when I was a young man. But it was pain, you understand? Not… leaking. This is new. Completely new. I have never had fluid come from my ear before this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a completely new symptom for you. And it's only been happening for three days. Have you noticed any pain with it?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. That is… strange, yes? It is just… wet. And a little bit… worrying. I cannot hear any less than before, I think. But it feels… different. A fullness, perhaps. Not a bad feeling, but… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Fullness, noticeable, but no pain or change in hearing... alright. Have you had any fever, cold symptoms, or any recent illness at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I feel… perfectly healthy, otherwise. No cough, no cold. No sickness at all. I have been eating well, sleeping well. This ear… it is the only problem. It is very strange, you are right?
DOCTOR: It is unusual, yes. And it’s good that you’re otherwise feeling well. Let's take a look at your ear. I'm going to use an otoscope to see what's going on. It doesn't hurt, just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: An otoscope? Is that… a light? Will it be very cold? I do not like cold things in my ear. But if you think it is best… then yes, please. I will try to be still. Just… be gentle, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's a light with a magnifying lens, and a small speculum – a little cone – that goes just into the ear canal. It shouldn't be cold, but if it feels that way, tell me immediately. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay. I see some fluid behind your eardrum, and the eardrum itself looks a little bit… bulging. No visible signs of infection right now, but the fluid is concerning. It looks like you may have a small perforation, or hole, in your eardrum.
PATIENT: A… perforation? A hole? In my ear drum? Is that… bad? Will I not be able to hear? And… fluid behind it? It sounds… serious, Doctor. What does this mean? What must we do?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s not panic. A small perforation isn't always serious, but it does need to be addressed. It explains the fluid you’re experiencing. It’s like a tiny leak in a tire. As for your hearing, it’s possible it could be affected, but right now, you said you haven’t noticed a change, which is good. We’ll need to rule out an infection, even though it doesn't look infected right now. I'm going to order a tympanometry test – that measures how your eardrum is moving – and possibly a culture of the fluid to check for bacteria. Do you have any allergies to medications, Gerhard?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to any medicine, that I know of. I have taken… many pills in my life, for different things. But never a problem. No, no allergies. Is the tympanometry… painful? Will it involve putting things in my ear again?
DOCTOR: No, the tympanometry isn’t painful at all. It involves a small probe being placed in your ear canal, and it measures how your eardrum responds to changes in air pressure. It doesn’t go in the ear canal very far, and it doesn’t involve any fluids or injections. It's quick and painless, really. While we wait for the results, I recommend keeping your ear dry. No swimming, showering with your ear submerged, or using cotton swabs in your ear. Also, avoid blowing your nose forcefully, as that can push fluid into the middle ear. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Keep it dry… no swimming. No putting water in my ear. And… no blowing my nose too hard. No cotton swabs. Yes, Doctor. I understand. It is… a lot to remember. Will I be able to… work? I am a teacher, you understand. I must speak clearly.
DOCTOR: Alright, keeping your ear dry is the most important thing. As for work, speaking shouldn’t be a problem, but avoid shouting or straining your voice. We’ll know more after the tympanometry and culture results come back. If you experience any pain, fever, or significant hearing loss, please contact the clinic immediately. I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever, just in case. And I'll have the nurse schedule you for the tympanometry test tomorrow morning. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that is good. A pain reliever… just in case. I do not like taking pills, but… it is good to be prepared. Thank you, Doctor. You have explained everything very clearly. I will try to remember all of these things. Keep it dry. No loud noises. And contact you if it gets worse. Is there anything else I must do? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Gerhard. You've been a very good patient, asking all the right questions. No, I don't think there's anything else for now. Just focus on keeping your ear dry and monitor for any changes in your symptoms. Here's the prescription, and the nurse will come in shortly to schedule your tympanometry test. If you have any questions at all after you leave, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. I'll see you tomorrow morning. Do you have any trouble walking or need assistance getting to the door?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I can walk perfectly well. I appreciate your kindness and your patience. I will see you tomorrow then. Thank you again, Doctor Rosanova. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Gerhard. Get home safely. .
