DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look here, I ain't got all day. It’s about… well, it's about how I look. I used to be a strong man, you understand? Pile driver operator, best in the business. Now… now things are… sagging. Need somethin' done about it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Sagging, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sagging. You think I come here for a friendly chat? I got skin, Doctor, that wasn't made to hang like old curtains. And it’s embarrassing, you know. Used to command respect. Now people look at me, not to me. Is that clear enough? I want it fixed, and I want to know how much it will cost. Don't need a lecture.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, a proper medical evaluation is necessary before discussing costs or procedures. Simply stating “sagging” doesn’t give me enough information. Are we talking about skin laxity… everywhere, or are you concerned about a specific area?
PATIENT: Everywhere! Look, I ain't no doctor, alright? It’s all… loose. Arms, belly, even my… you know. Everything! What kind of question is that? I want it all tightened up. Like it used to be. I don't need a geography lesson on my body. Just tell me what you can do about it. And how much it costs. Simple.
DOCTOR: Very well. While I understand your… frustration, Mr. Trendler, a full body “tightening” isn’t a single procedure. It would involve multiple possibilities – and risks – depending on the extent of the laxity. Before we even consider that, I need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this. Have you experienced any significant weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! I eat good. Always have. Steak, rice and peas… proper food. I just… got older. That's all. Don't go talkin' about medical conditions now. I ain't sick. Just… worn out. Is there a way to just… pull it all back together? Like stretchin' elastic? I don’t have time for tests.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, skin elasticity diminishes with age, yes, but significant changes like you describe usually warrant investigation. I need to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No! Never. Good blood sugar, always. My wife, bless her soul, she was the one watchin' all that. I just know I feel… old. And I want to look less so. Is that so hard to understand? Look, I ain’t here to relive my entire life story. You fix skin, I pay money. Simple transaction. Now, are you going to do it or not?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I am a physician, not a cosmetic technician. I have a responsibility to ensure any procedure is safe and appropriate for you. Ignoring potential underlying causes could be detrimental to your health. However, to even begin discussing cosmetic options, I need a basic understanding of your overall health. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No! I take… took… pain pills when my back was bad. That’s it! Look, I'm a strong man, been through worse than a few questions. I don’t need a medical exam to tell me I'm gettin' old. I need results. Are you going to waste my time or are you going to tell me what I need to do to look younger? I'm payin' you good money, Doctor. Don’t treat me like a child.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, your… impatience is not conducive to proper medical care. I understand your frustration, but I will not proceed without gathering a basic medical history. It’s not about wasting your time; it's about ensuring your safety. Let’s start with this: do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones, regularly?
PATIENT: Regular? No. Just… a little something for my joints when it rains. That's all. Old age, you understand. But it ain’t regular. Every now and then. Look, are you going to ask me about every little ache and pain from the past eighty years, or are you going to tell me if you can fix this or not? I'm wastin' daylight here. Don't you have other patients? Younger patients?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I assure you, I treat all my patients with the same level of care. However, proceeding with any cosmetic procedure without a reasonable understanding of your health would be irresponsible. Let's try this. I'm going to need to examine you. And I will need to order some basic blood work to rule out underlying causes for these changes you're experiencing. If you're unwilling to allow that, then frankly, I don't think I can help you. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood work? Examine me? What kinda doctor are you? I come here to fix how I look, not get poked and prodded like some… some experiment! You know what? Forget it! I'll find someone else. Someone who understands what payin' customers want. Waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: I wish you well, sir. And I strongly advise you to reconsider seeking proper medical evaluation. .
