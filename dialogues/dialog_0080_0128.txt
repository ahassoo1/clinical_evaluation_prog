DOCTOR: Hi Lilliana, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, my joints. They’re just… stiff in the mornings, mostly. It’s been going on… a while now, I think. Not a big problem, just annoying, you know? Hard to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiff joints in the mornings, that’s a pretty common complaint. "A while now" is helpful, but could you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Detail…? Oh dear. Let me think… It’s… longer than a few weeks, definitely. Maybe… six months? A year? It's hard to say, honestly. Things get… mixed up sometimes. It's mostly my hands and knees, I think. And my back. But it could be my elbows too? It all feels a bit the same, really. It’s worse when it’s cold, though. Definitely worse in the cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months to a year, mostly hands, knees and back, potentially elbows, and definitely worse with cold weather. That gives me a good starting point. When you say "stiff", can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm... Like... when you try to bend them, it doesn't flow, you know? It's not sharp pain, not usually. It's more like… resistance. Like something is stuck. And it takes a little while to… loosen up. I have to kinda work it out. It's not terrible, but it makes getting dressed in the morning a pain. And doing… things. I don't know. Just normal things.
DOCTOR: Okay, resistance, not sharp pain, needs working out, impacts daily activities. Good. And is this stiffness the same every day, or does it vary?
PATIENT: Oh, it varies, yes. Some days it's hardly noticeable. Other days… well, other days I really have to take my time. Rainy days are the worst, definitely. And… I think when I’ve been sitting for a long time? It's worse then. But sometimes it's just… random. It doesn't always follow a pattern, if that makes sense. It's a bit frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and frustration is completely understandable. Okay, so it varies in intensity, worse with rain and prolonged sitting. Have you noticed any swelling in those joints – hands, knees, back – at any time?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. I… I don't think so. Not that I've noticed, anyway. My hands feel a bit bigger sometimes, maybe? But I put that down to… well, I don't know. Maybe just age? I don't really pay that much attention, to be honest. I just try to ignore it and get on with things. I’m not sure I'd know what swelling looks like, really. Is it red?
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, and it's good you're asking. Swelling can be redness, warmth, and a visible puffiness around the joint. But it doesn't always have redness or warmth. Okay, so no noticeable swelling that you’ve seen. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, I think. The doctor put me on something for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. It felt… unnecessary, you know? And… my knees, they bother me sometimes, not just the stiffness. They ache, especially when I walk a lot. But… that's just old age, I figure. My husband… he had a bad heart, but… well, he's gone now. I don’t think I have anything serious right now. Nothing that I'm aware of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, past blood pressure issues, some knee pain, and sadly, I’m sorry to hear about your husband. Let’s just quickly run through family history. Did any of your close relatives – parents, siblings – have arthritis, or any joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a tricky one. My mother… she had a lot of aches and pains, always complaining about her hands. But I don’t know if it was arthritis or just… old age. And my father… he worked really hard, with his hands, all his life. He had gnarled fingers, I remember. But again, I don’t know if that was arthritis. My sister… she's still alive, but we don't talk much. I couldn’t tell you what she’s got. Sorry, I’m not much help, am I? I never really paid attention to those things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilliana. It's helpful to know even if you don't have specific details. Okay, so some family history of aches and pains, but nothing definitive. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Not a smoker. My husband used to, but he quit years ago. It's a terrible habit. I always told him that. I do enjoy a little bit of wine with my dinner sometimes, though. Just a glass, nothing more. Helps me relax. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That does count, thank you. Just one glass with dinner. And how about your activity level?
PATIENT: Oh, not much, I’m afraid. I used to walk a lot, when my husband was still here. We'd go for long walks every day. But… since he’s gone, I mostly stay at home. I do a bit of gardening, pottering around in the backyard. And I do a little bit of cleaning, of course. But nothing strenuous. Mostly just… keeping busy. I don't really do much these days, to be honest. It’s… lonely, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Gardening and light housework, some previous walking. Now, just to finish up the history, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No, not that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything, ever. I used to get stung by bees when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. I don't go near them anymore! No, I think I'm pretty clear. I’m not much of an allergy person, thankfully. I think that's everything, isn't it? You asked a lot of questions!
DOCTOR: Yes, that is everything for the history. Thank you for being so patient. Okay, Lilliana. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you’ve been dealing with some stiffness and aches, particularly in your hands, knees, and back, that's been worsening over the past six months to a year, and it's worse with cold weather and sitting. Given your age and the pattern of symptoms, it could be osteoarthritis. Now, to get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Osteo…arthritis? Oh dear. Is that serious? And a physical exam…? Well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I’m not a fan of doctors, to be honest, but… I trust you. Just be gentle, alright? My joints are a bit sensitive today. What will you do?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel apprehensive, and I will definitely be gentle. Osteoarthritis is a common condition, especially as we get older. It’s basically wear and tear on the joints, and it can cause pain and stiffness. It’s usually manageable with treatment. I’m going to start by just looking at your joints, seeing if there’s any swelling or redness. Then I’ll gently feel them to see if there’s any tenderness. And finally, I’ll ask you to move them through their range of motion, so I can see how easily they bend and straighten. It won't take long, and I’ll stop if you feel any pain. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Alright, that… doesn’t sound too bad. Looking and feeling, that’s alright. Moving them… well, I hope it doesn't hurt. But yes, let's get it over with. I suppose it’s better to know what’s going on. Please be gentle, though. I really do mean that. And… if it hurts, please stop, alright? I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle, and I will stop immediately if you feel any pain. Let's start with your hands. Okay, a little tenderness there, around a 3 out of 10. Now, let's move on to your knees. A little tenderness there as well, maybe a 2 or 3 out of 10. Now, can you bend your knees as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a bit awkward. It’s… tight. Like they’re rusty. And it makes a bit of a cracking sound, you know? Not painful, exactly, but… uncomfortable. Like something is catching. Is that normal? It's worse when I bend them a lot. That's probably as far as I can go comfortably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Some limited range of motion and crepitus, but no swelling. Now, can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: There we go… Oh, it's a bit wobbly. My knees feel… weak. Not painful, exactly, but… unstable.
DOCTOR: Okay, and if you feel comfortable, could you try to squat down a few inches for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… difficult. My knees won’t let me. It feels like they're going to give way. And my back… it’s not happy about that either. I can’t do that properly, I’m afraid. It's too… unstable.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That's very helpful. Based on what you've told me, and what I've observed during the exam, it does sound like you have osteoarthritis, particularly in your hands and knees. Your back discomfort could also be related, but we'll need to investigate that further if it doesn't improve with treatment for the arthritis. Now, to confirm the diagnosis, we can order some X-rays of your hands and knees. This will allow us to see the extent of the joint damage. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: X-rays…? Oh dear. Is that… necessary? I don’t really like being exposed to… whatever those rays are. But… if you think it’s important, alright. I trust your judgement. But please, don't keep me waiting too long. And… will it hurt? I really don't want anything to hurt. I just want to know what’s going on. And… will it show anything? Is it definitely going to help?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilliana. X-rays use a very low dose of radiation, and the benefits of confirming the diagnosis far outweigh the risks. It won't hurt at all – you simply stand or sit while the machine takes a picture. It's quick and painless. And yes, it will definitely help. It will allow us to see the extent of the cartilage loss in your joints, which is a key indicator of osteoarthritis. This will help us determine the best course of treatment for you. It will also rule out other possible causes of your discomfort. I'll write you a referral for the X-rays now. They're usually done at the clinic across the street, and they can typically fit you in within a day or two. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options, which may include pain medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. If you think it's necessary, then let's do the X-rays. The clinic across the street… that's good, at least it's nearby. Pain medication… I don't really like taking pills, but… if it helps, I suppose I can try. Physical therapy… what does that involve? And lifestyle modifications… what does that mean? I'm not sure I can change my lifestyle much at my age. But yes, let's get it over with. I just want to feel better, you know? I just want to be able to move without pain.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Lilliana, and that’s exactly what we’re aiming for. Physical therapy involves exercises to strengthen the muscles around your joints, improve your range of motion, and reduce pain. It’s usually done with a trained therapist, and they will tailor the exercises to your specific needs. And lifestyle modifications… that doesn’t necessarily mean making drastic changes. It could be as simple as losing a little weight, wearing supportive shoes, or avoiding activities that aggravate your pain. We’ll discuss all of this in more detail once we have the X-ray results. Here's the referral. It has all the information you need. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you're comfortable with that. And I recommend avoiding activities that make your pain worse. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… I think I’ve tried that before, years ago. It didn’t really help much, if I remember correctly. But… alright, I can try it again, if you think it’s worth it. Avoiding activities… that's difficult, though. I like my gardening. But… alright, I'll try to take it easy. No, I think that’s everything for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening, and for trying to help. It's nice to have someone take me seriously, you know? I've been dismissed before. So thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. I'm glad I could help. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this together. And don't worry about dismissing your concerns - your pain is valid, and I take it very seriously. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again once we have the X-ray results.
