DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hainley, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hi Dr. Fourney. It’s… bruising. I’ve been getting bruises really easily lately, and they seem bigger than usual. I’m on a blood thinner, so I figured I should get it checked out, just to be safe. It’s kinda worrying me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Bruising easily, you say. And you’re already on a blood thinner… Alright. Let’s get some details. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe a month ago? At first it was just little ones, like I bumped into something. But the last couple of weeks they’ve been… noticeable. Like, I’ll just look at myself and boom, a new one. I don't remember hitting myself or anything, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A month ago, increasing over the last couple weeks… and appearing without any obvious injury. Right. And how large are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Some are… the size of my palm, easily. One on my leg is probably bigger. Like, really dark purple at first, now it’s more… brownish. It’s kinda scary looking, to be real with you. I haven’t fallen or anything.
DOCTOR: Palm-sized… darkening, now fading… Ms. Hainley, with bruising of that magnitude appearing spontaneously, and you being on a blood thinner… we need to rule some things out. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… lemme see. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, I guess? But I work pretty long hours, so I just figured it was that. Oh, and my gums bleed a little when I brush my teeth. It's not a lot, but more than they used to. Is that… related? I’m not a doctor, so I don’t really know.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, increased gum bleeding… Yes, those could be related. Now, you mentioned long hours at work. What kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I'm an Information Security Analyst. Basically, I work with computers, making sure everything's safe from hackers and stuff. It's a lot of sitting, a lot of thinking, and a lot of stress sometimes. I've been doing it for… oh, almost ten years now. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Ten years… sitting, stress… it matters in terms of your overall health picture. Alright. Now, let's go through some basics. Any family history of bleeding disorders, easy bruising, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm... my dad, he bruised pretty easily when he got older, now that I think about it. But he was kinda clumsy, always bumping into things. My mom… not really. She was pretty tough. Nothing major on either side that I know of, if that makes sense. We weren’t really a family that talked about health stuff much. It's not like we kept secrets, it's just... not a thing.
DOCTOR: A history of easy bruising in your father… Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just the blood thinner, which is… Warfarin. And I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. I don’t really like taking pills if I don't have to. I try to eat healthy, get enough sleep when I can. It's hard with work, though.
DOCTOR: Warfarin only… good. And you said you're uninsured?
PATIENT: Yep. Not insured. That's why I kinda hesitated coming in, to be honest. But I figured this was important. I just... don't want anything serious. You know? I can pay cash if I have to, but I'm not really sure what all this is gonna cost.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let's get a physical exam done, and then we’ll talk about options. I’m concerned about the spontaneous bruising with Warfarin, and we need to rule out some serious possibilities. Now, can you roll up your sleeves and pant legs, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Yeah, sure. I hope it’s nothing too bad. I really need to get back to work, to be honest. But I know I should get this checked out. It's just… time is money, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look… These are quite extensive, Ms. Hainley. And they appear in multiple locations, some with varying stages of healing… Your gums are slightly inflamed and do bleed easily with minimal pressure. Your lymph nodes feel normal at this time… Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to need to draw some blood for a complete blood count and coagulation studies to assess your Warfarin levels and check for any other underlying issues. This will help us determine the cause of the bruising and bleeding.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… thorough. Blood work, right? I’m okay with that. I guess I figured you'd want to do that. Just… try to be quick, if you can? I have a deadline looming. And I get kinda lightheaded when I have my blood drawn, so… maybe have me lie down? I don't want to make a mess.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll get you lying down, and I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is aware of your history of lightheadedness. It’s important to be thorough, and we want to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. Ms. Hainley, given the extent of your bruising and bleeding, and being on Warfarin, I want to be cautious. I'm going to consult with a hematologist to review your case and ensure we're on the right track. That is standard practice with this type of presentation, and it's always better to be safe. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A hematologist… okay. If you think it's necessary, then yeah, sure. I just… I really need to know what's going on. I can’t afford to be sick, you know? I have bills to pay. And a deadline. Is this gonna be expensive? I mean, a hematologist… that sounds pricey. I really wish I had insurance right now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Ms. Hainley. I will see what resources are available to help minimize the financial burden. We do have a financial counselor who can explore options with you. The hematologist consultation is necessary to rule out any underlying bleeding disorder or other serious condition. It’s a precautionary measure, and we want to get an accurate diagnosis as quickly as possible. In the meantime, avoid any activities that could cause injury, and let me know immediately if you experience any new symptoms, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your urine or stool. We need to be proactive in managing this. Now, the phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. Please let me know if you start to feel lightheaded at any point. We will monitor you closely.
PATIENT: Okay. Vitamin K… Avoid injury, new symptoms, let you know… and talk to the financial counselor. I guess… that's all I can do right now. Fine. Let's just get the blood drawn, and hopefully, we can figure this out soon. I really need to get back to work…
