DOCTOR: Hi Bradlee, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's… well, my wife actually set this up. Something about… getting ready for surgery? I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. It's about my weight, I think. She said it was a good idea.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It's common to feel a bit overwhelmed with appointments and details. So, surgery… and your wife suggested this visit related to your weight. That gives me a starting point. Do you recall why your wife thought it was a good idea to get checked out?
PATIENT: Hmm… she kept saying something about my health, and being able to… do more things? I get tired pretty easily, I guess. And it's hard to… well, bending over is tough. Things like that. She worries, you know? She's a good woman. I just… don't really follow all the medical stuff. Is this the bariatric surgery she mentioned? I keep hearing that word.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, difficulty with bending over… those are helpful things to know. And yes, the word “bariatric” is likely related to what we’re discussing. It refers to weight loss surgery, but we don’t need to jump to that conclusion just yet. It's important to understand why your weight might be impacting your health before considering any procedures. Just to clarify, Bradlee, has anyone specifically told you that you need surgery, or is your wife mostly concerned and wanting you to get checked out proactively?
PATIENT: No, no one told me I needed surgery. It was mostly her. She read something online, I think, about different options. She’s a big researcher. I just… agreed to come. I trust her judgment. I hadn't really thought about it much myself, until now. It's just… always been this way, you know? A little heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright, that makes sense. So, your wife is proactive and doing the research, and you're here to explore things. That's good. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Uh… general health. I guess… I get winded easily, like I said. And my knees sometimes ache. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, to be honest. I don’t really like going. Nothing major, though. No big illnesses or anything. I work at a retail store, mostly on my feet all day. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, knees aching, getting winded, working on your feet… all helpful information. It absolutely matters that you're on your feet a lot – that gives me a sense of your activity level. And it's good you haven’t had any major illnesses. Let’s try to go a little more specific. Bradlee, do you have any problems with things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High… what now? I honestly have no idea. I don't think so? Nobody's ever told me about any of those things. I just… go to work, come home, watch TV. I don’t really pay attention to medical stuff. Is that bad? My wife usually handles all that. She's always telling me to eat better, though. But I like my food.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright if you’re not sure about those things, Bradlee. That’s why we’re here. It's not bad at all. It's common to not be aware of those details, especially if you haven’t been to the doctor regularly. Let’s see if we can get a better sense. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… diagnosed… Let me see. When I was a kid, I had… the chickenpox, I think? And I broke my arm once, playing soccer. But nothing since… not that I remember, anyway. I’m pretty sure. My wife might know better. She remembers everything. I really don't think so. No serious illnesses, ever.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major diagnoses as an adult. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. I don’t like taking pills. I try to avoid them whenever possible. Just… nothing. I haven't needed anything, thankfully. My wife gives me vitamins sometimes, but that's about it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, though. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications currently. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, pretty much. My wife always asks, but I always tell her no allergies. I've never had to rush to the hospital or anything like that. So, no. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bradlee, that’s good to know. No allergies. Let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – who has problems with things like heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. I haven't really talked about medical stuff with my family much. My parents… my mom had some problems with her knees when she got older, I think. And my dad… he smoked a lot when he was younger. But I don’t know about heart disease or diabetes or anything. My wife would probably know more, she keeps in touch with everyone. I really don't remember. Sorry, I'm not much help on that one.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Bradlee. It's common for families not to discuss those things openly. So, some knee problems in your mother, smoking history in your father. We can try to get more specific later if needed. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Uh… I work at the retail store, like I said. Long hours on my feet. When I get home, I usually just relax. Watch TV, maybe eat dinner with my wife. I don't really… exercise much. I used to play soccer when I was younger, but not anymore. I guess I'm mostly a couch potato now. We don't really go out much. Not a very exciting lifestyle, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Bradlee. There's no judgment here. It's good to be honest. So, long hours at work, mostly relaxing at home. Okay, one last thing before we do a quick physical exam. Are you a smoker, or do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, definitely not a smoker. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don't drink alcohol either. Not really my thing. My wife doesn't drink much either, so we don't have any around the house. Never really appealed to me, to be honest. So, no to both.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bradlee, that’s very helpful. Thank you for being so open. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a few measurements. It shouldn't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. I guess… I'm a little nervous, but… okay. Just tell me if it's going to hurt or anything. Just… don't be too rough, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, Bradlee. It won’t hurt at all. It’s very gentle. Just a routine check. If you could just have a seat here on the table, that would be great. I'll explain everything as I go. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. It's just a cuff around your arm. Relax your arm for me… good. Okay, your blood pressure is 145 over 90. That's a little bit elevated. We'll keep an eye on that. Okay, your heart sounds are regular, but a little fast. And your lungs sound clear, but a little shallow. Alright, you are 5 foot 8 inches tall and weigh 205 pounds. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. Your reflexes are normal. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. It was quick, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that wasn't too bad. A little bit fast, maybe, but not terrible. 145 over 90… is that bad? You said it was elevated. What does that mean? And my lungs being shallow… is something wrong? This is starting to sound… serious.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re asking questions, Bradlee. 145 over 90 is a little bit higher than we'd like. It’s considered Stage 1 hypertension, or high blood pressure. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is immediately wrong, but it does mean we need to pay attention to it. Several things can cause it – stress, diet, lack of exercise, family history… we'll need to investigate further. And your lungs sounding a little shallow just means you’re not taking deep breaths. Again, it’s not an emergency, but it’s something we want to address. It could be related to your activity level, or it could be something else. Based on what you've told me, and the findings from the exam, it sounds like you could benefit from some lifestyle changes, and we'll need to run some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… and blood tests. That sounds… complicated. What kind of lifestyle changes? And what are the blood tests for? Are you saying something is wrong? I just wanted to get checked out before the surgery, I didn't think it would be… this much. My wife is going to be worried.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Bradlee. It’s not about saying something is wrong, it’s about being thorough and making sure we have all the information. The lifestyle changes we're talking about are things like eating a healthier diet, getting regular exercise, and managing stress. Even small changes can make a big difference. The blood tests will help us check things like your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and thyroid levels. It will help us identify if there's an underlying reason for the high blood pressure, or if it’s just related to lifestyle factors. We'll also check your complete blood count to make sure everything looks normal. I’m going to order a basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel, a complete blood count, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We can also add a vitamin D level, if you'd like. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A basic… what now? And a lipid… panel? It sounds like a lot of complicated things. Okay, fine. Whatever you think is best. Just… tell me what it means afterwards, okay? I don't understand any of this medical stuff. And my wife… she's the one who's good with all this. Maybe I should just let her come to the next appointment? This is all a little much for me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Bradlee. That's perfectly alright. I'll explain everything as clearly as possible. And it’s perfectly fine if your wife joins you for the next appointment – in fact, I encourage it. Having someone there for support and to help with questions is a great idea. I’ll write down the names of the tests and what they’re for. I'll also give you a lab order, and instructions on how to prepare for the tests. You'll need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw, so you can’t eat or drink anything except water. Once we have the results, we'll schedule another appointment to discuss them and create a plan. This plan may include lifestyle changes, and potentially medication, if needed. For now, don't worry too much. We're just gathering information. And remember, I'm here to help. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Fast for 12 hours… okay. I can do that, I guess. And… lifestyle changes. I don't even know where to start with that. I just… eat what my wife makes, and watch TV. No, I don't think so. I think that's all. You explained everything pretty well, even if I don't understand half of it. Just… please let my wife come to the next appointment. She'll know what to ask. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I'll see you later.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bradlee. Absolutely, your wife is more than welcome at the next appointment. We’ll schedule that before you leave. Just let the receptionist know you’re ready to check out, and they'll help you with that. Take care of yourself, Bradlee, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then.
