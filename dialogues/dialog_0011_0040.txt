DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain… in my side, mostly. And the water infections, they keep coming back. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s getting a bit tiresome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pain in your side and recurring water infections. That does sound tiresome, and we certainly want to get to the bottom of it. Let’s start with the pain in your side. Can you tell me more about it?
PATIENT: Right. It’s… hard to describe exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, not usually. More of a dull ache, low down on my side, mostly the left side, I think. Sometimes it feels like a pressure, you know? And it comes and goes. Some days it’s barely noticeable, other days… well, other days it’s harder to get around. It doesn’t shoot through or anything. Just… there.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, primarily on the left side, sometimes feeling like pressure, and fluctuating in intensity. That’s helpful. Does anything specific seem to trigger the pain, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, no. I mean, bending over can sometimes make it a bit worse, but not always. And if I drink a lot of fluids, it doesn’t seem to make a difference, either. Honestly, it just… happens. It doesn’t seem to follow a pattern. Maybe when I’m a bit stressed, but I’m not sure if that’s just me noticing it more when I’m stressed, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand – it’s often difficult to pinpoint a direct cause. It sounds like it’s not consistently related to activity or fluid intake, and the connection to stress may be a matter of increased awareness. Now, regarding these recurring water infections, how often would you say you’re experiencing them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It used to be every couple of months, maybe three or four times a year. But lately… it feels like more often. Maybe every six weeks or so? I have to go to the doctor, get the medication, feel better for a bit… then it comes back. It’s quite disruptive, really. And uncomfortable, of course.
DOCTOR: Every six weeks is certainly more frequent than ideal, and I understand how disruptive and uncomfortable that must be. Have you noticed any specific symptoms accompanying these infections – burning during urination, frequent urge to urinate, cloudy or bloody urine, or any pain in your lower back or abdomen?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, you’re right on the mark. The burning… that’s always the first thing I notice. And then I’m running to the toilet every few minutes, even if there’s not much to go. The urine… sometimes it’s cloudy, yes. I haven’t noticed any blood, thankfully. And my back… sometimes a bit achy, but I put that down to my age, to be honest. It's hard to tell what’s what, you know?
DOCTOR: It is difficult to separate what’s related and what’s simply part of aging. Burning with urination, frequent urgency, and cloudy urine are all consistent with a urinary tract infection. Now, I'd like to ask a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, a few years back – maybe ten years ago now – I found out I have… something with my kidneys. Polycystic kidney disease, that's what they called it. I don’t really understand it, to be honest. They said I have cysts on my kidneys. I see a specialist for it, but mostly they just monitor it. I take medication for my blood pressure, too, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… Yes, I see that in your record, and I note you are followed by a nephrologist. That’s important information. And you mentioned medication for blood pressure – can you tell me the name of that medication and the dosage you take?
PATIENT: Let me see… It’s Amlodipine, I think. Yes, Amlodipine. And the dosage… hmm. Let me check my pills. Just a moment. It's 5 milligrams, once a day.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a long, long time ago. And I’ve been in hospital a couple of times for tests, but nothing major. Nothing that required any… cutting, you know? Just scans and things. Nothing memorable, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just the Amlodipine, I think. Oh, and sometimes I take Panadol for aches and pains, but that’s not very often. And I take a multivitamin, just a general one, every morning. That's it, I believe. I don't really like taking too many pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I've always been pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose. No allergies to food or anything like that, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Thank you for providing me with that information. It gives me a much clearer picture of your medical history. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and check your vital signs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Go ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I've been meaning to get this checked out for a while now, so I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie back on the examination table, and I'll begin with listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain. Do you feel any discomfort here, on your left side?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, actually. A little bit. Not sharp pain, but… pressure, really. It’s the same kind of feeling I get normally, just… a bit more noticeable when you press there. It’s not too bad, but I can definitely feel something.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. I’m also noting some mild tenderness in your left flank. Your abdomen is otherwise soft, and I don’t feel any masses. Your vital signs are within normal limits: blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72, temperature is 98.6, and your respiratory rate is 16. Based on your history and the physical exam findings, it's possible the recurrent urinary infections are related to your Polycystic Kidney Disease. The cysts can sometimes interfere with urinary drainage, increasing the risk of infection. The tenderness in your flank could also be associated with it. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I would like to order a urine analysis and a complete blood count to start. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Anything to get to the bottom of it. A urine analysis and a blood test… absolutely, go ahead. I trust your judgement. Hopefully, it will give us some answers.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve ordered those tests for you. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood, and you can provide a urine sample in the restroom. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience a fever, chills, back pain, or nausea, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your time and explanation. You've put my mind at ease a little, knowing we’re getting it checked out properly. I’ll go and see the nurse when she’s ready, and get those tests done. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if any concerns arise before your follow-up appointment. I’ll see you then.
