DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. My name is Dr. Reisig, and it's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the foggiest idea why I'm here. My wife insisted. Something about my skin…and feeling tired, I suppose. It's all rather bothersome, and frankly, a waste of my time. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be frustrating to come in when you're not entirely sure what's going on, Mr. Drahota. It’s good of your wife to encourage you to get checked out, though. We can certainly try to figure things out. When you say your skin…could you describe what’s been bothering you about it?
PATIENT: It’s…darker, I believe. A sort of…dullness. Not like a tan, mind you. A sickly shade. And it seems to coincide with this perpetual exhaustion. I used to be able to work all day, but now…well, now I require a nap after simply thinking about work. Is that clear enough? Honestly, I don't pay attention to such trivialities.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. So, a darkening and dullness of the skin, accompanied by increased fatigue. And this has been happening over what period of time, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Weeks, perhaps? Months? Time…it all blurs together when one is a productive member of society. It’s not a precise recollection, Doctor. I simply noticed it one day and my wife…nagged. Let's just say it's been long enough to become annoying. Is there a quicker way to determine if it's something serious or not? I have girders waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your time, Mr. Drahota. We'll certainly try to be efficient. To get a better understanding, let's start with a little more detail about your fatigue. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Utterly and thoroughly constant. It’s not a fleeting weakness, Doctor. It’s a pervasive…lassitude. A draining of one’s very life force! Though, I suppose you doctors have a simpler term for it. And really, I don't see how this is relevant to my work. Are we getting anywhere, or am I wasting my valuable time?
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Mr. Drahota. And I assure you, all of this is relevant. Constant fatigue can be a symptom of many things, and we need to explore the possibilities. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the fatigue and skin changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Goodness, where would I even begin? My joints ache, of course. A small price to pay for a lifetime of honest labor. And I've been…less regular, shall we say, with my digestion. But honestly, Doctor, are we seriously discussing my bowel movements? This is preposterous. I’m a man who builds things, not one who…analyzes them. Perhaps a blood test will suffice? Quickly done, I hope.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, and I assure you, these details are important. We’re trying to build a complete picture here. I do think a blood test is a good idea. It will give us a lot more information. Before we order that, let’s briefly touch on your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been far too busy living to bother with doctors. A few aches and pains, a minor injury here and there…standard wear and tear. I’ve never been one to complain. I suppose I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, but those were ages ago. No serious conditions, mind you. And I assure you, I've never been one for hypochondria. Now, can we please proceed with the blood test? This is becoming quite tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. No significant past medical history. That's helpful. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Absolutely not. I have strong hands, Doctor, I build things. I don’t need things built on me! A few stitches here and there, perhaps, but nothing…invasive. Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather insulting. Are you implying I'm frail? I assure you, I am a robust individual. Let’s simply take the blood test, and be done with this. I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: No, sir, not at all. I'm simply gathering information to help understand what might be going on. No significant surgeries reported. Now, thinking about your family...are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? Honestly, Doctor, my family is…complicated. Distant relatives, mostly. I haven't spoken to most of them in decades. I vaguely recall my grandfather having…something with his stomach, but I don't recall the specifics. It was ages ago, and quite frankly, not something I paid much attention to. A bit of indigestion, perhaps? Honestly, this is a fruitless endeavor. I doubt my family history holds any pertinent information. Let’s get on with the blood test, shall we? I’m growing increasingly impatient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I understand. A vague family history of a possible stomach issue. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can proceed with the blood test. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Absolutely not. I pride myself on my natural constitution. I’ve never needed anything stronger than a cup of tea. Perhaps a pain reliever on occasion for a particularly stubborn ache, but nothing…regular. I don’t believe in relying on artificial substances. Honestly, Doctor, I'm surprised you even ask. A man who builds with his own two hands doesn't need pills and potions. Now, can we please get this over with? I have important work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. And, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’ve eaten everything imaginable in my lifetime, from street food in Hong Kong to…well, never mind. I’m a robust individual, Doctor. I don’t succumb to frivolous sensitivities. A bit of a sniffle now and then, perhaps, but nothing worthy of mentioning. Honestly, this is becoming quite absurd. Are you quite finished? I believe I've answered all your…probing questions. Let’s get the blood test done, and I can finally be on my way. I have girders waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. No known allergies. Thank you for your patience. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, take a look in your ears, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Honestly, Doctor, must you? I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. But…fine. Get it over with. Quickly, please. I have no desire to linger here any longer than necessary. I trust you'll be gentle. And for goodness sake, don't poke too hard. I have work to do, you know. Girders don't build themselves.
DOCTOR: Of course, sir. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Your heart sounds regular, but the rhythm is a bit quiet. Your lungs sound clear. Your ears look normal. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some tenderness when I press here, in your upper left quadrant. Does this area bother you at all?
PATIENT: Tenderness? Well, yes, now that you mention it. A dull ache, occasionally. I assumed it was just…wear and tear. A lifetime of lifting heavy objects, you know. It comes and goes, really. Not something I’ve bothered to pay much attention to. Is it…serious? Honestly, I’m starting to regret agreeing to this examination. I had girders waiting. Are we finally finished?
DOCTOR: I understand. The tenderness in your upper left quadrant, combined with your fatigue and the darkening of your skin, warrants further investigation. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. These tests will give us a better understanding of what's going on. I’ll also order a test to check for iron deficiency. Would you prefer I have these tests done here in the clinic, or would you prefer to go to an outside lab?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the slightest preference. Just get it over with. The quicker, the better. I suppose here is fine, if it’s convenient. I’d rather not waste any more of my valuable time traveling to some outside facility. And for goodness sake, let’s hope they don't require a lengthy appointment. Girders don't build themselves, you know. I trust your staff is efficient? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, our staff is very efficient. We can draw the blood right here in the clinic. It will only take a few minutes. Maria, could you please prepare Mr. Drahota for a blood draw?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. And please, be gentle. I have work to do, you know. Important work. Girders don't build themselves. I trust you'll inform me of the results as soon as they’re available? I haven’t got all day to wait. Honestly, this is rather inconvenient. Is there nothing else? Can I finally leave now?
DOCTOR: Yes, sir. Maria will let you know when she's ready. Once the lab results are back – usually within a few business days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or any signs of bleeding – please contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, there is nothing else. Just…get on with it. I trust your staff is competent. And please, let me know as soon as the results are available. I have work to do. Girders, you understand. Girders don't build themselves. I believe that is all. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Drahota. Maria will be with you shortly. Thank you for coming in today. .
