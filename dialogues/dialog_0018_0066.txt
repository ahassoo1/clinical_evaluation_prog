DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mastrantonio. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Stilaire. The pleasure is all mine. Thank you for having me. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing a… a popping, or clicking sensation in my back. It’s not constant, but it happens quite often, especially when I’m, well, moving around during work. I’m an electrical and electronics installer, so I’m constantly bending and reaching, working on transportation equipment… buses, trains, that sort of thing. It doesn’t cause any pain, exactly, but it’s definitely noticeable, and I'd like to get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Mr. Mastrantonio. A popping or clicking sensation in your back with movement, particularly related to your work as an electrical and electronics installer… that gives me a good starting point. To help me understand this better, could you describe the location of the clicking?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It seems to be centered… right around my lower back, perhaps a little to the left side. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, but if I had to be specific, I’d say it’s the area just above my tailbone. Sometimes I feel it a bit higher up, but it usually starts there. It’s not radiating down my legs or anything, thankfully. Just… localized to that lower back region. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mr. Mastrantonio. Localized to the lower back, slightly to the left, above the tailbone, and not radiating down the legs… that narrows things down considerably. Now, regarding the sensation itself – is it accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. As I mentioned, there's no pain. No numbness, tingling, or weakness in my legs or feet. No stiffness, really, just the… pop. Sometimes, if I’ve been doing a lot of bending, I feel a slight bit of soreness the next day, but that goes away pretty quickly with a warm shower and some stretching. It’s mostly just… disconcerting, you know? Having something click in your back isn’t exactly reassuring. I suppose that’s why I wanted to have it checked out, even without significant discomfort.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Mastrantonio. It’s always wise to investigate something new and disconcerting, even without significant pain. It’s good you’re being proactive. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. I’ve never had any major illnesses or surgeries. I did twist my back a little bit when I was younger, maybe around 20 years old, lifting some heavy equipment, but it wasn't too bad and recovered quickly with rest and physical therapy. Other than that, just the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant. And I’m married, if you need to contact anyone. As for allergies, I don’t have any known drug or food allergies. I take a daily multivitamin, but that’s it. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Thank you for that thorough overview, Mr. Mastrantonio. No major illnesses or surgeries, a minor back strain in the past that resolved with physical therapy, no known allergies, and only a daily multivitamin… that’s all very helpful. Now, let's talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any back problems, arthritis, or other musculoskeletal conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. My parents were both fairly healthy, and lived to a good age. My mother did have some arthritis in her hands later in life, but nothing in her back. My father had some issues with his knees, but again, not a back problem. As far as I know, there aren't any other significant musculoskeletal conditions that run in the family. My grandparents… well, I didn’t know them very well, so it’s difficult to say. But to the best of my knowledge, no, there aren’t any inherited back problems. Should I ask my wife? She might remember something I’ve overlooked.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Mastrantonio. No known family history of back problems is certainly reassuring. And it's perfectly fine if you'd like to check with your wife – sometimes another perspective can be helpful. Now, regarding your lifestyle, could you tell me a little bit about your work environment and daily activities?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As I mentioned, I’m an electrical and electronics installer, primarily working on transportation equipment – buses and trains mostly. That involves a lot of bending, reaching, lifting, crouching, and working in tight spaces. I’m on my feet for most of the day. It can be quite physically demanding. Outside of work, I try to stay active. I enjoy walking, and I sometimes go fishing with friends. I don't smoke, and I only drink alcohol socially – a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I don’t do a lot of heavy lifting outside of work. I try to maintain a healthy weight, which I believe I’ve mostly achieved, at around 129 pounds and 170 centimeters. I sit for maybe an hour or two each evening watching television, but otherwise, I'm quite active. Does that give you a good idea?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Mastrantonio. A physically demanding job involving repetitive movements and prolonged standing, combined with regular walking and a healthy lifestyle… that paints a clearer picture. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need to help figure out what’s going on. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Mr. Mastrantonio, I’m going to start by observing your posture and range of motion. Could you please bend forward and touch your toes, if you're able?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There you go. It’s a little stiff, but I can manage.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And now, could you bend backward gently, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: There you go. A little tighter going this way, I suppose. It’s not painful, just… a bit restricted.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Now, let’s try some side bends. Could you gently bend to the right, and then to the left?
PATIENT: There you go. Not a lot of discomfort, just the same stiffness I’ve been describing. I'm trying to be careful not to overdo it.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Mastrantonio. Now, I’m going to palpate your spine to assess for tenderness or muscle spasm. I'll start at the base of your spine and work my way up. Please let me know if anything feels particularly sensitive. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, right there. That’s a little tender. Not painful, but definitely sensitive. The rest feels okay, mostly just the general stiffness I’ve been describing. It’s good you found that spot, though. I hadn’t realized it was quite so localized.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Please lie down on your back. Now, I’m going to gently tap on your knees with this reflex hammer. This is to check your nerve function. Your reflexes are… normal and equal bilaterally. Now, I'm going to ask you to resist against my hand as I try to push your legs apart. Please push back as hard as you can. Strength is also… normal and equal bilaterally. Based on this brief examination, I don’t find any signs of nerve compression or significant muscle weakness. The tenderness you described is localized, and your reflexes and strength are intact. This suggests a possible… muscle strain or minor ligament sprain. It doesn't sound like anything serious, but to be certain, I would like to order an X-ray of your lower back to rule out any underlying structural issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. An X-ray to rule things out seems like a good idea. I’d be happy to get one. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me and explain everything so clearly. It’s reassuring to hear it doesn’t sound like anything too serious. Yes, please, let’s go ahead with the X-ray. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for it?
DOCTOR: Excellent. No, there’s nothing specific you need to do to prepare for the X-ray, Mr. Mastrantonio. Just wear comfortable clothing, and remove any metal objects that might interfere with the image, like belts or jewelry. The radiology technician will give you specific instructions when you arrive. While we wait for the X-ray results, I recommend continuing to stretch gently and avoiding any strenuous activities that aggravate your symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help manage any discomfort. And I'll give you a written handout with some basic stretching exercises. Now, do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. The stretching handout sounds great. And thank you again for your patience and clear explanations. I feel much better knowing what’s going on, and I appreciate you taking the time to address my concerns. I’ll wait for the X-ray results and follow your instructions. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mastrantonio. I’m glad I could help. Please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen while we wait for the results. I'll see you back here once the X-ray results are available. Have a good day.
