DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Dr… Glowka, was it? Yes, well, I don’t exactly need anything. My daughter just thought… she thought I should get “checked out.” You know how they are. Always worrying. I feel perfectly fine, mostly. Just… curious, I suppose. It's a lovely office, by the way. Very modern.
DOCTOR: It’s lovely to meet you as well, Ms. Calvery. It’s always good when family encourages preventative care, even if it's just out of worry! And thank you, we do try to keep things comfortable. While you feel "perfectly fine" overall, are there any specific concerns that prompted your daughter's suggestion?
PATIENT: Specific concerns… hmm. Honestly, I can’t really recall. She mentioned something about my memory, I think? Said I ask the same questions twice. But everyone does that sometimes, don't they? I used to have a very sharp mind, you know. Worked in the operating room for forty years. Surgical Tech. Needed to be on top of everything. It's just… things slip these days. It’s probably just old age. Is that what she said? Something like that. Though, I don't remember exactly what she told me. Ugh. This is frustrating.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that things can feel frustrating when memory seems a bit unreliable, Ms. Calvery. It's very common with age, and you’re right, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. However, since your daughter raised the concern, and you’ve noticed it yourself, it’s good we’re discussing it. To get a better understanding, could you describe a recent situation where you felt you repeated a question or had difficulty recalling something?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… just yesterday, I was making dinner. Salmon, I believe. And I distinctly remember asking my grandson, Leo, if I’d already seasoned it. And then, maybe ten minutes later, asked him the exact same thing. He just looked at me funny. A polite boy, Leo, but you could tell he was trying not to laugh. And then, this morning… I can’t even remember what I was talking about! Something about the mail… or the garden… Oh dear. It’s all a bit muddled, isn’t it? I used to be so organized. I kept everything in files, meticulously labeled. Now… well, now it’s just a mess. A lovely mess, but a mess nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing those examples with me, Ms. Calvery. That gives me a clearer picture. It sounds like these instances are relatively recent and causing you some concern, which is perfectly valid. To help me assess what might be going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. This will be a general review to get a better understanding of your overall health. First, have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or focus?
PATIENT: Oh, concentrate… well, I do find myself getting distracted easily. Watching television, for example. I used to follow every plot twist, every character's motivation. Now… I’ll start a show, and then suddenly realize I haven’t been paying attention for the last fifteen minutes. Or reading. I used to devour books, couldn't put them down. Now, I have to reread paragraphs just to understand what I’ve read. It's… annoying, to be honest. I used to be so sharp. And it’s not like I’m not trying to pay attention. I really am! It just… slips away. Like trying to hold water in your hands. It’s frustrating. Is that what you’re asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I’m asking, Ms. Calvery, and you’re describing it perfectly. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with sustained attention and concentration. Now, have you noticed any changes in your ability to find the right words when you're speaking, or any difficulty understanding what others are saying?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes. Not all the time, but… yes. I'll be talking to someone, and the word will just… escape me. It’s right there, on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t quite grasp it. It’s especially bad with names. I'll be talking about someone I see all the time, and I'll struggle to remember their name. It’s embarrassing, to be honest. And sometimes, when people talk quickly… I have to ask them to repeat themselves. Not because I can’t hear them, necessarily, but because… it takes me a moment to process what they’ve said. It's all very subtle, though. I don’t want to make a fuss. My daughter is the one who worries too much anyway. She always has. But… yes, I suppose I have noticed those things. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "bad," Ms. Calvery, but it's helpful information, and I appreciate you sharing it with me so openly. These things can happen as we age, and there are many possible explanations. It's good that we're discussing it so we can figure out what's going on. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, my doctor, Dr. Lee, he always said my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on a pill for it, years ago. Still take it, every morning. And… I had a bit of trouble with my sugar a while back, but it went away on its own, I think. Mostly just watched my diet. Dr. Lee said it was “pre-diabetes,” I believe. And… oh, and my heart! I had palpitations a few years ago, very frightening. They did some tests, and they said it was just a little flutter, nothing to worry about. Mostly just told me to reduce my stress. Easier said than done, of course. But that's about it, I think. Nothing major. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Though, I do get the occasional headache. Just a little one. Nothing to write home about. My daughter, she always tells me to see a doctor about everything. But honestly, I’m not one for complaining. It all passes eventually.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. That's helpful. Just to clarify, what is the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking something I don’t know! It's a little white pill. Small one. I’ve been taking it for so long, I just… take it. I don’t even look at the label anymore. My daughter, she’s the one who fills my prescriptions. She keeps everything organized. I should probably pay more attention. But honestly, I just trust her to take care of it. She means well. I’ll have to ask her when I get home. Is that alright? I feel terrible not knowing something so basic. It’s just… I have so many pills these days. It all gets a little muddled.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s very common to not remember the names of medications, especially if you’ve been taking them for a long time and someone else manages your refills. We can easily look it up in the system. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Yes, actually. A long time ago, when I was still working in the operating room. I had my gallbladder removed. And… oh, and I had a hysterectomy, years and years ago. Before I even met my husband, I think. And… I had a knee replacement a few years back. Very painful recovery, that was. But it’s much better now. I can walk without any trouble, thankfully. Though, it still aches a bit in the cold weather. And… oh, and I had my appendix out when I was a child. A very scary experience, I remember that vividly. That's about it, I think. Nothing else major. I’ve been very lucky, all things considered. Though, I do get the occasional ache and pain. But who doesn't, at my age?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. That's very helpful. Now, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my mother, she lived to be 95, very healthy for her age. But she did have… what was it? Arthritis, I think. Badly affected her hands. And my father, he had… heart trouble, I believe. He passed away when he was in his 70s. My brother, he’s still alive, thankfully. He’s a bit forgetful, actually. Always misplacing things. It runs in the family, I think. And… oh, my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had… dementia, I believe. Very sad, that was. She didn’t even remember her own children towards the end. It’s frightening to think about. I try not to dwell on it. But honestly, I don't know much beyond that. My family wasn’t one for talking about medical things. It was considered… impolite, I think. Is that alright? I’m not very good at this, am I? It all feels a bit… invasive.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s completely understandable that you don’t know all the details of your family history, and it’s not impolite at all to feel uncomfortable discussing it. You've provided valuable information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, he tried it once, when he was in the army. Hated it. Made him sick. We both always believed in taking care of our health. Good food, plenty of exercise… well, as much exercise as we could manage. I still try to walk every day, when the weather permits. Though, it’s been a bit too hot lately. And… oh, I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just one, though. For relaxation. Is that alright? My daughter worries about everything, you know. She always says I should be more careful. But honestly, what’s the point of living if you can’t enjoy a little bit of pleasure?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. A glass of wine with dinner is perfectly reasonable. And it's wonderful that you prioritize staying active. Now, let's talk about alcohol consumption a little more specifically. On average, how many days a week do you have that glass of wine, and how many glasses do you typically have each time?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking specifics! Let me think… most evenings, really. Almost every night. Just one glass, though. Sometimes two, if I’m feeling particularly stressed. Or if my daughter calls with bad news. She means well, but she does worry a lot. It's usually a small glass, mind you. Not a large one. Just enough to relax me. I don’t get drunk or anything. I just… enjoy the taste. And it helps me sleep sometimes. Is that alright? I feel terrible not knowing these details. My daughter keeps track of everything. I should probably pay more attention. But honestly, it all feels so… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Calvery. It's helpful to have a better understanding, and you're doing great. Now, one final question about your lifestyle. How would you describe your overall stress levels?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Stress… well, it comes and goes, doesn't it? Lately, it's been a bit higher than usual. My daughter, she's been very worried about me, as you know. Always asking if I’m alright, if I’ve taken my pills, if I’m remembering things correctly. It's very kind of her, but it does add to the stress. And… oh, the news! It's so depressing these days. Everything is going wrong. And… well, just getting older, I suppose. It’s stressful worrying about your health, about falling, about not being able to take care of yourself. But I try not to dwell on it. I try to stay positive. I have my grandson, Leo, he's a wonderful boy. He keeps me young. And I enjoy my garden, when the weather permits. But honestly, it's been hard lately. I feel like I'm losing my grip, a little bit. Does that make sense? I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. That's my biggest fear.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot right now, and it’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. You’re not alone in those feelings. Alright, Ms. Calvery, we’ve covered a lot of ground today. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment – checking your reflexes and balance. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's necessary. I suppose I should cooperate. I haven't had a proper check-up in… well, I don't even remember. It’s probably a good idea. Though, I’m not very good with doctors. Always poking and prodding. But… alright. Do what you need to do. Just… be gentle, please? And… tell me if anything is wrong. I don't want any surprises. It’s just… I get nervous easily. But alright. Let’s get it over with. Where do I start?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. I will be as gentle as possible, and I will explain everything as we go along. We’ll start with your blood pressure. If you could just sit here and relax your arm for me, that would be great. Just breathe normally. This cuff will inflate for a moment. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. It might feel a little cool. Take deep breaths in and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the edge of the table?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Reflexes, you say? I always had good reflexes, back in the operating room. Needed them to be quick on my feet. Though, I’m not so sure about now. Getting old does things to you, you know. It slows you down. Just… be careful, please? I don’t want to fall. My daughter would have a fit. Alright. Do what you need to do. I’m ready… I think. Though, I’m a bit nervous. What are you looking for, exactly? Is something wrong? I get anxious easily, you know. Just tell me straight. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Just relax your leg, Ms. Calvery. I’m just checking your reflexes. Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. It's not unusual to see some slowing down with age. Now, could you please stand with your feet together and close your eyes for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Close my eyes, you say? That makes me nervous. I always feel unsteady when I close my eyes. It's like I'm going to fall. But… alright. I'll try. Just… hold my arm, please? Just in case. Oh dear… I don't feel very steady. I think I'm going to fall… Just hold me, please? I'm a bit scared. It's like the room is spinning… Is this normal? I don't like this… I want to sit down… Just let me sit down, please… I'm getting dizzy…
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Calvery, that’s alright. Sit down, please. You experienced a bit of unsteadiness, and some dizziness. That could be due to a number of things. It’s good we checked that. Okay, Ms. Calvery, based on my examination and what you’ve told me, I'd like to discuss some possible next steps. Before I do, do you have any questions for me about the exam?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I’m still a bit dizzy. I don’t like feeling like this. Questions? Hmm… well, is something wrong? Is it serious? Is it my brain? My aunt, she had… dementia, you know. I don’t want to end up like her. Is it something I should be worried about? Is it going to get worse? I’m scared, doctor. Just tell me straight. I don’t like being kept in the dark. What’s going on with me? And… what are we going to do about it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, it’s completely understandable that you’re worried, and I want to assure you that I’m here to help. Based on my examination, I don’t believe you are experiencing dementia at this time. Your symptoms – the memory lapses, the difficulty concentrating, the occasional dizziness – could be due to a variety of factors, and it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. However, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate further. The dizziness could be related to low blood pressure, dehydration, or an inner ear problem. The memory issues and concentration difficulties could be related to stress, anxiety, medication side effects, or early cognitive changes. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a basic cognitive assessment – a simple set of questions to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. And to investigate the dizziness, I would like you to have an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… blood tests, cognitive assessment, EKG… It sounds… complicated. And a bit frightening, to be honest. I don’t like needles. And I’m not very good at tests. I always get nervous and forget everything. Is it really necessary, doctor? I mean, couldn’t it just be… old age? I’m 64 years old, after all. Things are bound to slow down eventually. I don’t want to go through all this trouble if it’s just… normal aging. Could we just… wait and see? I’ll try to relax more, and maybe get a little more sleep. And I’ll ask my daughter to keep track of my pills. Would that be enough? I just don’t want to go through all these tests if it’s not really necessary. It's all very overwhelming, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I completely understand your concerns, and you’re right, it’s overwhelming. I wouldn’t recommend these tests if I didn’t think they were important. While it’s true that some changes are normal with age, it’s also important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Think of it this way: these tests will give us a baseline, a starting point. If everything comes back normal, then we can confidently say that your symptoms are likely due to stress, anxiety, or normal aging, and we can focus on managing those things. But if we find something, we can address it early and potentially prevent it from getting worse. The blood tests are relatively simple and quick. The cognitive assessment is just a series of questions, and it won’t be graded. And the EKG is a painless procedure that checks your heart rhythm. I also want to assure you that I will be with you every step of the way. I will explain everything, answer your questions, and support you throughout the process. Would you be willing to consider these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear… you make it sound… reasonable, I suppose. And I do appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. You seem like a very nice doctor. And I do want to know what’s going on with me, even if it’s just to put my mind at ease. Alright. I’ll do the tests. But… can we take it slow? I don’t want to do everything at once. And… can my daughter come with me? She’s very organized, and she always knows what to ask. And… can you explain everything to her too? She worries about me a lot. And… can you promise me you’ll tell me straight? No sugarcoating. I want to know the truth, even if it’s not what I want to hear. Just… please be honest with me, doctor. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. We will absolutely take it slow. We can schedule the blood tests first, and then we can decide when to schedule the cognitive assessment and EKG. Your daughter is more than welcome to come with you to all your appointments, and I will be happy to explain everything to her as well. And I promise you, I will always be honest with you, even if it’s not what you want to hear. My goal is to help you understand what’s going on and make the best decisions for your health. Let’s start by getting you scheduled for those blood tests. I'll have my nurse come in and draw some blood, and we'll get those results back to you as soon as possible. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Blood tests first. Alright. Just… please tell the nurse I don’t like needles. And… can I have a little something to eat afterwards? I always feel faint after giving blood. Alright. Let’s get it over with. Just… let me know when you’re ready. And… thank you, doctor. For being so patient with me. And for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I’ll let the nurse know about your aversion to needles, and we'll make sure you have something to eat and drink afterwards. I’ll be right back to discuss the next steps. And Ms. Calvery, remember, you’re not alone in this. We’ll get through this together.
