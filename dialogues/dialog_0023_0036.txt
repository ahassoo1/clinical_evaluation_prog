DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I am here for… the check-up before the insurance starts. Medicare sent me. It is… required, yes? I do not like wasting time, but… it must be done.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare does have a new patient welcome visit requirement. Efficient, I suppose. Though usually they give a bit more notice. Alright, well, let's get this done efficiently then. First, let's confirm some basic information. You're Kiwane Barban, 28 years old, and your height is 188 centimeters and weight 90 kilograms, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Six foot two, nearly. And 90… kilograms. It is a good weight, no? I exercise. Not much, but… enough. I do not understand why they need to know everything. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: It is normal, Mr. Barban. A thorough medical history helps us establish a baseline for your health, identify potential risk factors, and ensures we can provide the best possible care. It’s not about needing to know everything, it’s about being prepared. Now, let’s start with the History of Present Illness – are you currently experiencing any specific health problems or symptoms that brought you in besides the insurance requirement?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Nothing… major. Sometimes my back is… sore. From work, I think. Lifting things. But it goes away. It is not a problem that needs a doctor, no? I am a strong man. I do not… complain easily. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re generally healthy, Mr. Barban. But even minor discomfort warrants investigation. When you say "sore," can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Investigation? It is just… muscles. After a long day. I lift boxes. Heavy boxes. It is… a pulling feeling. Lower back. Not sharp. Dull. It happens maybe two times a week. I take… something. For the pain. From the store. It works. I do not need… a lot of attention for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what exactly is this "something" you take from the store?
PATIENT: It is… Ibuprofen, I think. The white tablets. I do not remember the exact name. It is for headaches also. My neighbor told me to take it. It stops the pain. Very simple. I do not see the need to discuss every little thing. Is this usual?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know what medications you’re taking, even over-the-counter ones, Mr. Barban. It prevents potential interactions. How much Ibuprofen do you typically take, and how often?
PATIENT: Two tablets, usually. When it hurts. Maybe… four if it is very bad. Not often, I assure you. Perhaps once or twice a week, maximum. I do not like taking pills, you understand. It is… not a habit. My mother always said… too much medicine is bad for the body.
DOCTOR: Four tablets of Ibuprofen at a time is… a significant dose, Mr. Barban. Prolonged use, or high doses, can have side effects. Let's move on to other things, then. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Everything! Yemeni food… very spicy. Sometimes it makes me sweat, but… it is good. No rashes, no… swelling. Nothing. I do not have the… delicate constitution of some people. My father was a desert man, very strong. I am like him.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No. Nothing serious. When I was a small boy, I had… the fever. Everyone gets the fever. And I broke my arm once, falling from a tree. But it healed quickly. My mother put a cast on it. No hospital. It was… a local healer. Very good. I do not trust hospitals. Too many… germs.
DOCTOR: Let's talk about your family history, then. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: My family? My father… he was strong, as I said. He lived a long life, working in the desert. He died… old age. My mother… she had the… aches. Like arthritis, I think. Her hands were stiff. My brother is healthy. He works in the city. No… no other problems that I know of. We do not talk much about these things. It is… bad luck to speak of illness.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. Finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Disgusting habit. My father forbade it. Alcohol… sometimes. With friends. A small glass of wine, maybe. Very rarely. And… recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I am a Muslim man. Such things are forbidden. I live a… respectable life. I do not cause trouble. Is that what you are asking?
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Mr. Barban. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your back. It will be relatively brief. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable, yes. But please, be quick. I have… things to do. And… do not poke too much. I do not like being touched unnecessarily. Just… do what you must and finish quickly.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the table, face up. I’ll start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again. Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. A little elevated, but not concerning at this time. Now, let’s examine your back. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little. Here. When you press. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. It is always like this after work. Lifting. Heavy boxes. Do not press too hard, please. It is not broken, I assure you. Just… sore muscles.
DOCTOR: There’s some muscle tenderness present, as you mentioned. No signs of acute injury, no spinal abnormalities. Range of motion appears normal, although you may experience some discomfort with certain movements. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief examination, it appears you’re experiencing muscle strain in your lower back, likely related to your work. It’s not a serious condition, but it's important to manage it properly. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like Ibuprofen, but strictly adhering to the recommended dosage. And I strongly suggest you avoid lifting heavy objects whenever possible, and utilize proper lifting techniques when you must. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I understand. Ibuprofen. Not to lift heavy things. As if that is possible. I have been lifting heavy things for years. It is my job. Is that all? Can I leave now? I have wasted enough time already. This… insurance check-up is a foolishness.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, that is all for today. However, I strongly advise you to limit strenuous activity and if the pain worsens, or you experience any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs, you need to seek medical attention immediately. I will document these recommendations in your chart. Here is a handout with proper lifting techniques and information on managing muscle strain. I’ll also send the insurance company the necessary documentation for your welcome visit. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Have a good day, Mr. Barban. .
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Fine. Thank you. I suppose.
