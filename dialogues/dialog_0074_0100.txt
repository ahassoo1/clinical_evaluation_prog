DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, I think it's for a... a check? Something about making sure I'm alright. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. It was something the office called about, a test or something? I’m not entirely sure, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. We sent out a routine notice for a cognitive assessment, given your age. It's a standard check-up to evaluate memory and thinking skills. No need to worry; it’s quite common. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what you've been experiencing that made you consider coming in today, or what prompted the office to reach out?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, like I said, the memory is... patchy. I forget where I put things, sometimes even what I had for breakfast. It’s mostly little things, I guess. My late husband used to tease me about it, said I was always misplacing his slippers. He’s… gone now, though. Been a few years. I mostly just try to keep busy with work, you know? It helps.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly normal to experience some memory lapses, especially as we get older, and loss can certainly contribute to those feelings. And keeping busy is a wonderful way to stay engaged. Just to get a clearer picture, has this been a gradual change, or did you notice a more sudden onset of these memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… gradual, mostly. It’s been happening for a while, but maybe getting a little worse lately? It's hard to say, really. I just... brush it off, usually. Didn’t think much of it until the office called. Do I need to… worry about it?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Ms. Hughston, and it's good you brought it up. It’s always best to investigate changes in memory, even if they seem small. We want to rule out anything serious and ensure your overall well-being. To help me understand a bit more, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Oh, well… let’s see. I wake up pretty early, around 5:30. Gotta get going, you know? I’m a… equipment operator. For paving, mostly. Big machines! It’s… physical work. I usually work out on a site until late afternoon. Then I come home, make myself dinner… usually something simple. Sometimes I watch TV. And then… well, then it’s bedtime. It’s pretty routine, really. Not much excitement.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a demanding job, Ms. Hughston. Staying active with physical work is excellent. Do you notice any difficulties with your work due to your memory – perhaps forgetting procedures, getting lost on the job site, or trouble remembering details about the equipment?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I have to ask people to repeat things, but I figured that was just because it’s noisy out there with all the machines. And… I wouldn't say getting lost, exactly. More like… taking a roundabout route sometimes? I always get there eventually. It’s hard to explain. Everyone makes mistakes, right? And I’m not as young as I used to be. It's probably just that. But, I did have a little trouble remembering how to calibrate the new roller last week. Had to ask young Ben to show me again.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. It's good you’re aware of these instances, and that you have colleagues like Ben who are able to assist you. Now, let’s talk a little bit about other areas of your health. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, sleep patterns, or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My sleep… isn’t always the best. I wake up a lot during the night. Mostly just… thinking. And my appetite… well, I eat when I’m hungry, I suppose. Nothing really changed there. I’ve been a little… down, sometimes, since my husband passed. It comes and goes, you know? It’s been a few years, but… it still feels empty sometimes. But I don’t go around moping, if that’s what you’re asking. I try to stay busy.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hughston. It’s perfectly normal to experience periods of sadness after a loss, and it sounds like you’re coping well by staying busy. Now, to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a bit of a blur, to be honest. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. Nothing serious. I went to the doctor regularly for check-ups, but I don't remember any major illnesses. I had the usual vaccines, I think. My husband always took care of the paperwork. He was very organized. I see Doctor Miller sometimes for blood pressure, but that’s mostly just routine. I think it’s okay, usually. But like I said, my memory… isn’t what it used to be. I probably forgot something important.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Hughston. We can take our time. I have access to your electronic health records here, and I see you’ve been followed by Dr. Miller for hypertension, as you mentioned. It looks like it's well-controlled with medication. I also see a history of seasonal allergies. Are you currently taking any medications for that or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! The allergies. They flare up in the spring, mostly. I take… something over the counter. Claritin, I think? It helps a little. And the blood pressure pills, of course. I take those every morning. A little white one. And… I think that's it. Nothing else that I can remember, anyway. I used to take something for my back, years ago, but I don’t anymore. My husband… he always kept track of everything. It’s just… hard to keep it all straight now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just confirm. You’re currently taking Claritin as needed for allergies, and a blood pressure medication – do you know the name of it?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t, I’m afraid. It’s a little white pill. I get it refilled every month. Maybe Dr. Miller has a record of it? I’m terrible with names. Always have been. I just know to take one every morning with breakfast. That’s all I really need to remember.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Ms. Hughston. I see here you’re taking Lisinopril 10mg daily for your blood pressure. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. My mother… she was a little forgetful towards the end, I think. But it was just old age, I assumed. She lived a long life, so… I don’t know if it was anything serious. My father was always very sharp, right up until the end. No, I don’t think anyone else… maybe an aunt, somewhere down the line? It’s hard to remember, honestly. My family isn’t very good at keeping track of these things. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. It sounds like there may be some family history of cognitive decline, but nothing definitive. Now, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. Never been much of a drinker. My husband used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I didn’t care for it. And no, definitely no smoking or drugs. Never touched them. I’m a pretty straight-laced person, if you ask me. I just like to work and keep busy. And try to stay out of trouble.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Hughston. And now, just to finish up with the basics, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Sometimes I get a little itchy when I’m around cats, but that’s just a mild allergy. Nothing serious. My husband used to say I was allergic to housework, but that was just his sense of humor. No, I don’t think I have any major allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston, thank you for answering all those questions. It gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination to assess your overall health and cognitive function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’ll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam, which includes checking your reflexes, coordination, and balance. Finally, I’ll do a short cognitive assessment to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. Your blood pressure is 135/85, which is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your reflexes are normal, and your coordination appears good. Now, I'm going to ask you to stand and walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Walking is no problem. I do a lot of it at work, you know. How’s that? A little wobbly, maybe. But I’m alright. It’s just… getting older.
DOCTOR: Yes, a little bit of unsteadiness, but not concerning at this time. Now, let’s move on to the cognitive assessment. I’m going to ask you a few questions to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. First, could you please tell me the current date?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. It’s… August… is it the 2nd? Yes, I think it’s August 2nd. 2025. Is that right? I'm terrible with dates.
DOCTOR: That’s correct, Ms. Hughston. August 2nd, 2025. Now, could you please tell me the name of the current President of the United States?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. That’s… that’s a hard one. Um… I want to say… Biden? Is it Biden? I think it's Biden. But I’m not very good with politics. I just try to stay out of all that. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. President Biden. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me, and I'll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them after me: apple, table, penny.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. I hope I can remember those. My memory is just… not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No worries, Ms. Hughston. We’ll see how you do. Now, I'm going to ask you a simple math question. Can you count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Counting backwards? By sevens? That's… difficult. Let me see… 100… 93… 86… Oh, I’m getting confused. 79… 72… is that right? This is harder than it looks. I’m sorry. My mind is just… blanking. I’m usually better with numbers, but… not right now.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Hughston. No need to apologize. That’s a challenging task, and many people find it difficult. Now, I’m going to ask you to recall the three words I asked you to remember earlier. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Oh dear… um… let me think. Apple… was one of them, I think? And… table? And… something shiny? Was it… penny? Yes, I think it was apple, table, and penny. But I’m not very sure. I hope I got them right.
DOCTOR: You remembered two out of three words, Ms. Hughston, which is good. Now, I’m going to ask a few more questions about your orientation to time and place. What year is it?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Let me think… is it… 2025? Yes, I think it’s 2025. But honestly, Doctor, the years just kind of… blur together these days.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Hughston. And finally, where are we right now?
PATIENT: Oh… well, we’re in a… a doctor’s office, aren’t we? Yes, in Doctor Reisig’s office. Is that right? I hope I’m not getting confused… It’s just… hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. Thank you for your patience. Based on this brief assessment, your cognitive function shows some mild impairment, particularly in areas of recall and executive function. However, this assessment is just a preliminary screen. I recommend further evaluation with a more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to determine the extent of the impairment and identify potential causes. We also need to consider other factors that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as medication side effects or underlying medical conditions. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. I also recommend a brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. MRI? Blood work? I… I don’t know. Is it something really bad, Doctor? I just wanted to make sure I was alright. I didn’t think it was anything this complicated. I suppose if you think it’s necessary… but I get anxious about hospitals and tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Hughston, and I want to assure you that we’re taking a cautious approach. These tests are not necessarily indicative of a serious problem, but they will help us to get a clearer picture of what’s going on and rule out any potential causes. It's important to remember that cognitive impairment can have many causes, some of which are reversible. For example, medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, or thyroid problems can sometimes cause memory issues. The MRI will help us to rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain. I’ll order the blood work and MRI, and then schedule a follow-up appointment with you in two weeks to discuss the results. We can also discuss a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation if necessary. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay active and engaged, and reaching out to your family and friends for support. Would you like me to provide you with some resources on cognitive health and support groups?
PATIENT: Resources… that would be nice, thank you. And maybe a list of the tests, so I know what to expect? I get very anxious about these things, as I said. Just knowing what’s going to happen helps. It’s just… a lot to take in. I thought I was just getting old and forgetful. I didn’t realize it could be something more serious. And a neurologist? Oh dear. But yes, I suppose if you think it’s necessary… I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please explain everything very carefully.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hughston. I will explain everything very carefully, and I'll make sure you understand each step of the process. Here are the details of the blood tests, and this brochure has some helpful information about cognitive health and support groups in the area. The MRI is a non-invasive imaging procedure that uses magnetic fields to create detailed images of the brain. It typically takes about 30-60 minutes, and you’ll be asked to lie still inside a large machine. I’ll also provide you with a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Chen, who is a highly respected specialist in cognitive disorders. We can discuss the results of the MRI and blood work with Dr. Chen at your follow-up appointment, and he can help us to determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. It’s a lot to process. I’ll… I’ll read the brochures and try to calm down. Thank you for explaining everything so carefully, Doctor. And thank you for not dismissing me when I said I was just getting old. I appreciate your patience. Is there anything I need to do before the tests? Like, should I avoid eating anything beforehand? Or… bring a list of my medications?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It's important to me that you feel heard and understood. Yes, there are a few things to keep in mind before the tests. For the blood work, you'll need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand, which means no food or drinks except water. Please also bring a list of all your medications, including the dosages, and any allergies you have. For the MRI, it's important to remove any metal objects, such as jewelry, watches, and dentures, before the procedure. You'll also be asked to fill out a safety questionnaire to ensure there are no contraindications. The technician will provide you with detailed instructions before the procedure. I'll also have my nurse, Sarah, call you tomorrow to schedule the blood work and MRI appointments. She can answer any questions you may have about the logistics. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you to Sarah, too. I appreciate your help. I… I feel a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect. I suppose I'll go home and try to relax. And maybe… try to remember where I parked the car. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It was my pleasure. Remember to take things one step at a time, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you. Take care, Ms. Hughston. And don’t worry about the parking spot – it’s easy to lose track of things sometimes. .
