DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. Welcome in. I'm Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so let's just get on with it. I woke up yesterday and I can't hear out of my left ear. And half my face feels... droopy. It’s quite obvious, really. I’m a radiologist, I notice these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, no problem at all. We'll get right to it. Yesterday morning you woke up and noticed hearing loss in your left ear and some drooping on the left side of your face?
PATIENT: Yes. Precisely. It wasn’t gradual, it was just… there. I mean, I deal with scans all day, I know what “sudden” looks like. Are you going to ask me a million questions about my medical history? Because frankly, it’s a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern and wanting to be efficient, Stephane. A few questions are important to help me figure out what might be going on, but I'll keep it focused. It's not about wasting time, it's about making sure we don't miss anything important. Let's start with this: have you had any fever, headache, or dizziness along with this?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. No fever, no headache, no dizziness. Perfectly normal otherwise, except for the… obvious problem with my ear and face. Honestly, I find it rather insulting you're asking such basic questions. I'm a doctor, remember? I know what symptoms usually accompany these things. It's probably something simple, I just need to know what you think it is.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, of course. My apologies. It’s just… standard procedure, really. It’s easy to get into habits. Okay. And have you experienced any pain in or around your ear or face?
PATIENT: No pain. None whatsoever. Look, are we going to do something or just continue this… interrogation? I have appointments to get back to, you know. People are relying on me to read their scans. This is incredibly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Stephane. Let's do an examination, then we can discuss what we're thinking. It will give me a better idea of what's going on. I'm going to take a look in your ear, and then test your hearing a little bit, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I suppose that’s the only way to actually do something. Be quick about it, please. I really don't have all day. And try not to poke around too much, alright? My ear is rather sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay. The ear canal looks clear, no signs of infection or blockage. The Weber test… lateralizes to the right ear. And with the Rinne test, bone conduction is greater than air conduction on the left side. Those findings are… concerning, Stephane. It suggests a possible issue with the facial nerve. It's not something I can definitively diagnose in the office, unfortunately.
PATIENT: Facial nerve? What does that mean? Is it serious? Don't tell me it's…Bell's palsy. I read about that once. Is that what you're thinking? Because frankly, that sounds dreadful. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. I can't go around with half my face paralyzed!
DOCTOR: It could be Bell's palsy, yes, that's a possibility. But there are other things it could be as well, and it’s important to rule those out. The facial nerve controls movement in your face, and also affects your hearing. The sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness is why we need to investigate further. I'm not going to downplay it – it can be concerning. But early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve your chances of a full recovery. Given your symptoms and the urgency, I’m going to recommend an MRI of your brain, with and without contrast, to rule out other potential causes. And I’d like to refer you to a neurologist for a formal evaluation. Would you be able to get that arranged?
PATIENT: An MRI? A neurologist? This is becoming quite the ordeal. Look, I don't even have insurance. Do you have any idea how much those things cost? And a neurologist… more appointments, more waiting, more bills. This is… unacceptable. Honestly, I should have just waited it out. It probably would have resolved on its own. What if… what if it is Bell’s palsy? What’s the treatment? Some sort of steroid? Can’t you just… prescribe something now? I really don’t have time for all this testing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and the time commitment, Stephane. It’s perfectly valid to be worried about those things. While steroids are often used in the treatment of Bell's palsy, we can't definitively diagnose it yet. Giving steroids without a confirmed diagnosis isn’t ideal. We need to rule out other, more serious causes of your symptoms first. Things like a tumor or stroke, although less likely, need to be excluded. I realize this isn’t what you want to hear, but it’s important to be thorough. I can help you explore options for affordable imaging and neurology consultation. There are often programs and financial assistance available. Would you like me to connect you with our clinic's patient advocate?
PATIENT: A patient advocate? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’m a doctor, not some… helpless patient. I understand the implications of these things. But fine. Yes, alright. Connect me with your… advocate. But don’t expect me to be grateful. This whole situation is profoundly inconvenient and frankly, quite insulting to my professional standing. Just get it done, please. I need to get back to work. And hurry.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Stephane. I completely understand your frustration. I'll have the patient advocate reach out to you directly. They can discuss financial assistance programs and help you schedule the MRI and neurology appointment. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a prescription for artificial tears to keep your eye moist on the affected side, as you may not be able to blink as effectively. And I want you to monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any worsening of the weakness, or develop any new symptoms like difficulty speaking or severe headache, go to the emergency room immediately. I know this isn't ideal, but we need to rule out other possibilities to ensure you receive the best possible care. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. That’s… sufficient. Just get me the advocate’s number. And frankly, I expect this all to be resolved quickly. I don’t have time for bureaucratic delays. I have patients who rely on me. And I’d appreciate it if you didn’t spend any more of my valuable time discussing my “emotional state.” I’m perfectly capable of handling this situation. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. I understand your need for a quick resolution, and I'll do my best to facilitate that. Thank you for coming in, Stephane. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. .
