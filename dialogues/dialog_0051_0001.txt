DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knock. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Well, to put it plainly, I’ve been smoking for… a very long time. Perhaps too long. And I’ve decided it’s time to try and finally stop. I understand you can help with that?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can definitely work on that together. It's wonderful you've decided to quit – that’s the biggest step. It’s never too late to improve your health. Now, to get a better understanding of things, could you tell me a bit more about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Where to begin… I started when I was fifteen, back in Lithuania. Everyone smoked then, it seemed. Gauloises, mostly. Then, after I came to this country, I switched to American cigarettes – Marlboro, for the longest time. Now, I mostly smoke… whatever is cheapest, to be honest. A pack a day, on average, for… oh, sixty years, give or take. Perhaps a little more. It’s difficult to recall precisely.
DOCTOR: Sixty years is… a significant amount of time. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you’ve been a smoker for most of your adult life. Do you recall if you’ve ever tried to quit before?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, several times. When my sister became ill, some years ago – lung trouble, unfortunately – I attempted to stop then. Lasted… perhaps a week. Then again, after my retirement, I thought I’d finally have the time and willpower. A month, maybe. Each time, the cravings would simply become too much. It's a foolish habit, I know, but it’s a difficult one to break. I tried those patches once, as well. Made me quite nauseous, they did.
DOCTOR: It's not foolish at all, Mr. Knock. Nicotine is a very addictive substance, and it’s very common to struggle when trying to quit. The patches don’t work for everyone, and it’s good to know what hasn’t been helpful in the past. Aside from the cravings, have you noticed any other health effects from your smoking?
PATIENT: Well, I do cough, quite a bit, especially in the mornings. A deep, rattling cough. My doctor – the one before this clinic opened – said it was “smoker’s cough.” Not very imaginative, but accurate enough, I suppose. I also find myself becoming breathless more easily. Walking up the stairs, for example. And I do get tired, quickly. I put it down to age, mostly, but I suspect the smoking doesn’t help. I haven’t been seriously ill, thankfully, but I do worry about what’s to come.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Knock. The cough, the shortness of breath, and fatigue are all common symptoms associated with long-term smoking. It's good that you haven't been seriously ill yet, but it's wise to address this now. To get a clearer picture of your overall health, would you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Please, ask whatever you need to know. I have little to hide. I’ve lived a simple life, and my health… well, it has been reasonably good, all things considered. Though, as I said, perhaps not as good as it could have been.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with any other medical conditions you might have. Have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems, for instance?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been diagnosed with any of those. I had a bout of pneumonia some twenty years ago, but I recovered fully. And I broke my wrist, falling off a ladder while repairing the roof. Aside from that… nothing significant. I’ve always been a strong man, thankfully. I used to work in the factory, you see. Heavy lifting. Kept me fit, for a time.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. No major medical issues aside from the pneumonia and the broken wrist. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. I avoided hospitals as much as possible, if I’m being truthful. Always seemed a bit… gloomy. And expensive, of course. I’ve always been careful, avoided risks. Except, of course, the smoking. A foolish contradiction, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It’s alright. Many people avoid hospitals when they can. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had any serious health problems like heart disease, lung cancer, or emphysema?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. My parents… they both died young, relatively speaking. My mother from an infection, I believe, when I was still a child. My father… a heart attack, I think. But it was a long time ago, and details are… hazy. My sister, she died last year, as I mentioned. Lung trouble, as well. Not lung cancer, specifically, but… something similar. She smoked, too, you see. A heavy smoker. As for grandparents… I didn’t know them well. They lived in Lithuania, and I emigrated when I was quite young. So, to answer your question precisely… I’m afraid I don’t have much information. It’s a sad thing, really. Family history… a lost treasure.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knock. It’s common to not have detailed family history, especially if you emigrated or lost family members young. We can still proceed without it. Now, let’s talk about your current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t take any medications. Not even aspirin, if I can avoid it. I have a slight sensitivity to dust, causes me to sneeze, but it’s not an allergy, not a serious one. Otherwise, I’m quite healthy, in that regard. I’ve always preferred natural remedies, if possible. A good night’s sleep, a healthy diet… though I confess, the smoking hasn’t helped with either of those lately.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No medications and only a minor dust sensitivity. Alright, Mr. Knock, before we discuss a plan to help you quit smoking, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. I understand the need for such things. Proceed whenever you’re ready. I have nothing to hide, as I said. Though, I warn you, I’m not the most flexible man anymore. Years of factory work, you see. Not kind to the joints.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Knock. We'll take things slowly. Okay, let's start by listening to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… I'm hearing some slight wheezing in your lungs, which is common in long-term smokers. It's not alarming at this stage, but something we'll want to monitor. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90. Again, not drastically high, but something we'll need to keep an eye on. Your heart sounds regular, but I can detect a slight murmur. It’s subtle, and could be unrelated, but we’ll note it down. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your pulse is regular and your reflexes are normal. Alright, Mr. Knock. Everything seems within reasonable limits, considering your smoking history. The slightly elevated blood pressure and murmur are things we’ll want to investigate further, but nothing that requires immediate attention. Now, let’s talk about a plan to help you quit smoking. Have you thought about any methods you'd like to try?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. To be honest, I’ve not given it much thought. I’ve tried the patches, as I mentioned, with little success. I’ve seen advertisements for those… vaping devices, but I’m wary of simply replacing one habit with another. Perhaps… medication? If you believe it would be beneficial. I’m willing to try anything, at this point, as long as it doesn’t involve too much discomfort. I’m a stubborn man, but I’m also… realistic. I know it won’t be easy.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be cautious about switching to vaping, Mr. Knock. It often simply prolongs nicotine addiction. And it's good you're realistic about the challenges ahead. There are several medications that can help with nicotine withdrawal and cravings. Bupropion and Varenicline are two common options. They both work differently, and have potential side effects, which we would discuss thoroughly before starting any treatment. Another option is nicotine replacement therapy – things like gum, lozenges, or nasal sprays – but given your experience with the patches, we might want to explore other avenues first. Given your age and slightly elevated blood pressure, I would recommend starting with a thorough evaluation of your cardiovascular health before starting any medication. A simple EKG and blood work would give us a clearer picture and help us choose the safest and most effective treatment plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. A cautious approach is always best, especially at my age. I appreciate your thoroughness. An EKG and blood work… yes, I’m happy to undergo whatever tests you deem necessary. I confess, I’m a little apprehensive about needles, but I’ll manage. So, tell me, Doctor, what does this entail? And how long will it take? I have a few appointments already scheduled for the coming weeks, and I’d like to avoid too much disruption.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry, Mr. Knock. The blood work is relatively quick and painless – just a few small tubes of blood. As for the EKG, it involves placing some sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It’s completely non-invasive and takes only a few minutes. My nurse, Sarah, will schedule you for both tests. They can usually be done on the same day, and the results should be back within a week. Once we have those results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the best treatment plan for you. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly manageable. Sarah, you say? I will look forward to meeting her. A week for the results… acceptable, quite acceptable. I’m grateful for your patience and guidance. It’s reassuring to know I’m in capable hands. So, shall we proceed with scheduling these appointments, then? I’m eager to finally rid myself of this… affliction.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Knock. I'm glad I could reassure you. It's going to be a process, but we'll tackle it together. Sarah, could you please come in and schedule Mr. Knock for an EKG and blood work?
PATIENT: Excellent. I am ready when Sarah is. And thank you once more, Doctor. I believe this… this could be the start of something good.
DOCTOR: I agree, Mr. Knock. I truly believe it can be. I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Now, let's get those appointments scheduled and take the first step toward a healthier you.
PATIENT: .
