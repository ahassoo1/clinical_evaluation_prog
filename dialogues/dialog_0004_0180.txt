DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. I'm tired. Really tired. And...well, it's embarrassing, but I keep wanting to eat dirt. Not like…on purpose, but I just…do. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Honestly, dates all blur together these days. It’s just…weird.
DOCTOR: Tired and…a craving for dirt?
PATIENT: Craving earth, thank you very much. And it's not something I want to do, okay? It just...happens. Like a need. It’s disgusting, I know. My husband…well, he never understood things like this. He just thought I was…difficult.
DOCTOR: Right. Earth. And you said this started a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: Weeks, yeah. Maybe a month? I don’t really keep track. Everything feels the same lately. Just…gray. And I sleep, but it doesn’t do anything. I still feel like I haven’t slept at all. Honestly, I just want to know what’s wrong with me. Is it…something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. You mentioned tiredness and this…urge. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…what kind of symptoms? I ache, everything aches. Mostly my bones. And I’ve been…well, more forgetful than usual, if that’s even possible. I keep losing things, forgetting what I was doing. It's like my head is full of cotton.
DOCTOR: Bone aches and increased forgetfulness…Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite, besides this…unusual craving?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I remember to, I guess. Mostly just…whatever's easy. Soup, sometimes. Toast. I don't have the energy to cook anything fancy. And everything tastes…bland. Like there’s no flavor to anything anymore.
DOCTOR: Bland taste…Okay. Have you experienced any difficulty swallowing, Ms. Cantoran?
PATIENT: Difficulty…swallowing? No. Not really. Why would I have trouble swallowing? Look, I work with computers, not…stomachs. I just want to know what's making me feel so awful. Is this…old age?
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions. We're gathering information. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel…what now? Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. You’re asking me about…poop? I came here because I’m tired and I want to eat dirt, not to give you a detailed report on my…digestion.
DOCTOR: It’s relevant, Ms. Cantoran. Changes in appetite, taste, and bowel habits can be indicative of underlying issues. But fine. Let’s move on. Have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Not that I remember. Maybe a little cold last winter? Everything runs together, I told you. It's been…a long few years. My husband passed…a while back. It's all just…blurry. I don’t really feel sick, just…weak. And tired. Always tired.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss can certainly contribute to feeling unwell. Now, have you been taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements recently?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't like taking pills. Too many side effects. He always said I was too sensitive. Vitamins…sometimes, if I remember. A multivitamin, I think. But not regularly. Honestly, I can't even recall the last time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you allergic to anything, Ms. Cantoran?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I mean, I get irritated sometimes, who doesn’t? Dust, maybe. Pollen. But nothing serious. Look, Doctor, is this going to take much longer? I have things to do. Or I would if I wasn't so exhausted.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Stand up? Ugh. Fine. But don’t expect miracles. I’m probably going to wobble. See? I told you.
DOCTOR: Very good. Let's check your blood pressure and pulse first. Blood pressure is 110/70, pulse is 72. That’s within normal limits. Now, can you open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I really don’t like doctors poking around. And I’m starting to feel lightheaded, honestly.
DOCTOR: Tongue and throat appear normal, no obvious signs of inflammation. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ugh. Ooh! A little…yes, right there. It’s…hard to explain. Not painful exactly, just…uncomfortable. Feels…tight. And…empty, somehow.
DOCTOR: Tight and empty… Alright. And do you have any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. I haven’t looked, honestly. I don't really…pay attention to things like that. Look, can we just get to the bottom of this? What’s wrong with me? I'm tired, I crave dirt, and my stomach feels weird. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. Based on your symptoms and the brief exam, I suspect we need to rule out a few possibilities. Your fatigue, unusual craving – known as pica – and abdominal discomfort are concerning. It could be related to a nutritional deficiency, such as iron deficiency anemia, or it could indicate a more serious underlying condition. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, iron studies, and vitamin D level. We'll also need to check your thyroid function. Additionally, given your symptoms, I’d like to order a stool analysis to rule out any parasitic infection. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Parasites?! Oh, for heaven’s sake. You mean like…worms? Look, Doctor, I just want a pill. A simple pill to make me feel better. All this…testing…it sounds expensive. And frankly, terrifying. I don’t even have insurance.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your concerns, but dismissing potentially serious issues with a “simple pill” is not responsible medical care. We need to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. As for the cost, I can connect you with a social worker who can assist you with finding low-cost or free testing options. Ignoring these symptoms could lead to more severe complications down the line. Do you want me to proceed with the orders for the blood work and stool analysis?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Just…fine. But I’m warning you, if this ends up costing me a fortune, I’m holding you responsible. And can you please just tell me where I need to go to get these tests done? I don't have time to mess around.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to give you a referral to LabCorp, they have several locations in the city. The requisition forms will be sent electronically to them. They'll draw the blood and collect a stool sample. It's important to follow the instructions carefully for the stool sample collection – you’ll receive those with the form. Once the results are back – which usually takes 3-5 business days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, try to eat a balanced diet, even if your appetite is poor. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A balanced diet? Easy for you to say. Look, just give me the papers. And if I end up with worms, I’m blaming you. I'm going to go lie down now.
DOCTOR: Here you are. As I said, the social worker's number is on the back if you have concerns about the cost. And Ms. Cantoran, while I understand your frustration, please don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or shortness of breath. It's always better to err on the side of caution.
