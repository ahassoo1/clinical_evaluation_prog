DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I’m Dr. Piet. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my patient, Mrs. Henderson. She’s been bruising terribly lately. She’s on that blood thinner, you know, to prevent clots, and it just seems to be… I don’t know… not working right. She’s a delicate woman, and this is concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're concerned about Mrs. Henderson's bruising while on a blood thinner. That is concerning. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about these bruises?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like she’s falling and bumping into things constantly. These appear… spontaneously, almost. A little bump, maybe, barely noticeable, and then a huge purple mark. And they last… far too long. Honestly, it's unsettling. She's usually so careful. I've been practicing for thirty years, and this just doesn't feel normal, even with the medication.
DOCTOR: Okay, "spontaneously" is a good word to use, and the length of time they last is important. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradually worsening over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I’d say. It wasn't overnight, no. Maybe over the last month or so it’s become more… pronounced. At first, it was just a little more bruising than usual after a blood draw, nothing alarming. But now… now it’s like she turns color with the slightest touch. It's rather inconvenient, to be frank. And worrying. Really worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and "worrying" is a fair assessment. Let's get some more details. Does she remember any specific injuries that preceded these bruises, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, that’s the frustrating part! She doesn't. She'll say, “Oh, I must have bumped into something,” but she can't recall what. And she insists it wasn't a hard enough bump to cause this. She’s usually quite precise with her recollections, you see. Very… detail-oriented. This forgetfulness about the cause… it's unlike her. It's… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the lack of a clear injury and a change in her typical recall is definitely something to note. Has she had any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. She mentioned feeling a bit more tired lately, but honestly, she's always a little tired. She is eighty-two, you know. And… she said her gums bled a little when she was brushing her teeth last week. But again, it’s hard to say if that’s significant. She is on the blood thinner, after all. She's a bit of a hypochondriac, if I’m being honest. Always worrying about something.
DOCTOR: Right. Tiredness and gum bleeding… those could be related, or could be separate issues. Let’s talk about her medication for a moment. Do you know the name of the blood thinner she’s taking, and the dosage?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It’s… Warfarin, I believe. And she’s on 2 milligrams daily. We adjusted it a few months ago, actually. She was having some… palpitations. I thought it might be too low, so I increased it slightly. Perhaps that was a mistake? I usually handle these adjustments myself, but I suppose things can slip through the cracks. It's rather frustrating when you're managing so many patients.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin at 2 milligrams daily, and you recently adjusted the dosage. That’s helpful. Now, has she had any recent illnesses, infections, or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, nothing significant. She had a little cold last month, but that cleared up quickly. And she had her annual flu shot, of course. No surgeries in… well, years. She’s a remarkably healthy woman, all things considered. That's what makes this so perplexing. I just want to get to the bottom of this. She relies on me, you see. And I… well, I take that responsibility very seriously.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check her bruising, look at her gums, and listen to her heart and lungs. Then we can discuss some possible explanations and whether we need to do any further testing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Though, frankly, I doubt you'll see anything I haven't already. I've examined her thoroughly myself, of course. But I suppose a second opinion never hurts. Proceed. I’m rather pressed for time, though, if you don't mind being efficient. I have patients waiting.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as efficient as possible. Okay, I see quite a bit of bruising here, as you mentioned. And it’s in various stages of healing. There's some ecchymosis on her forearms, and I see some smaller petechiae on her hands. Her gums are slightly inflamed, and there's a small amount of bleeding when I gently probe. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. No murmurs or wheezes. Blood pressure is 130/80, and pulse is 72. Alright, that confirms what you've already observed. Given the bruising, petechiae, gum bleeding, and the fact that she's on Warfarin, we need to investigate this further.
PATIENT: Well, that’s hardly surprising. I told you something wasn't right. What sort of investigation are you proposing? I assume a blood test is in order? Though, frankly, I suspect it will just confirm what we already know - that her INR is too high. It's rather inconvenient, to be honest. Adjusting the dosage is never fun.
DOCTOR: You’re right, a blood test to check her INR is definitely the first step. We also need a complete blood count to rule out any other underlying issues, like a low platelet count or anemia. It’s important to be thorough. I’m going to order those labs now. And, to be cautious, I'd also like to order a coagulation panel to get a more detailed assessment of her clotting factors. It will give us a broader picture. I’ll also order a metabolic panel to look at her kidney and liver function, as those can affect Warfarin metabolism. While we wait for the results, I want to be very careful. I’m going to recommend holding her Warfarin for a couple of days, and we’ll reassess once we have the lab results. Do you agree with that course of action?
PATIENT: Holding the Warfarin… yes, that’s probably prudent. Though I must say, I’m rather skeptical that it will reveal anything new. I’ve been managing her Warfarin for years, as you know. But, very well. Do what you think is best. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long for the results. My schedule is quite full. And please, avoid unnecessary testing. I’m a bit of a traditionalist, you see, and I believe in keeping things simple.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I’ll certainly keep things as streamlined as possible. I’ll prioritize the lab results and let you know as soon as they're available. In the meantime, are there any other medications Mrs. Henderson is taking that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… She takes a low-dose aspirin for heart health, 81 milligrams daily. And she occasionally takes acetaminophen for arthritis pain, but only as needed. Nothing else, to my knowledge. She’s quite diligent about keeping me informed of any changes. And she always fills her prescriptions promptly. Honestly, she’s a model patient, even with this… unfortunate bruising. It just doesn't make sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, aspirin 81 milligrams daily and acetaminophen as needed. Thank you. That’s helpful. Given the aspirin use, it’s important to remember that it can also contribute to bleeding, even at a low dose. We’ll need to factor that into our assessment. I’ll have the lab orders sent to the lab now, and they should be able to draw the blood relatively quickly. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you notice any new or worsening bleeding – such as nosebleeds, blood in the urine, or black, tarry stools – please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… get the results back quickly. And try to avoid unnecessary alarm. She’s a delicate woman, you see, and she gets anxious easily. I’ll inform her of your recommendations, of course, and I'll keep a close eye on her. Just… do your best. I trust you'll do what's best for her. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have patients waiting. I appreciate your attention to this matter, Doctor.
