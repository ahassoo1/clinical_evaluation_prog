DOCTOR: Hello, Jaylyne. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Andraca, nice to meet you too. Uh, it’s my ears. They’ve been ringing. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it's really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears – that’s something we can definitely look into. And when you say “a bit now,” could you give me a rough idea of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Maybe... three or four months? It started pretty quietly, I barely noticed it at first. But it’s gotten louder, and now it's almost constant. It’s hard to concentrate sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, three to four months… and it's progressively worsened, impacting your concentration. That’s helpful to know. Is it in one ear, both ears, or does it seem to switch around?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my left ear, but sometimes I hear it in my right one too. Not as often, though. Mostly just the left. It doesn't switch exactly, it's just… sometimes both. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So primarily left ear, with occasional involvement of the right. Is the ringing constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant. Like, I can always hear something. But the loudness changes. Sometimes it's a really faint hum, other times it’s like a high-pitched whine. It’s the changes in the loudness that really get to me, you know? Makes it hard to ignore.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fluctuating tinnitus can be particularly bothersome. Now, has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question… Hmm. I did do a lot of gardening a few months back, around the time it started. Used a trimmer, you know, the weed whacker thing? Maybe that? I didn’t wear earplugs or anything, to be honest. I don’t usually. It didn't seem that loud at the time though.
DOCTOR: Okay, gardening with a trimmer around the time the ringing started, and no ear protection. That's definitely something we need to consider. We'll explore that further. Before we get to an examination, let me ask a few more general questions. Have you experienced any hearing loss, dizziness, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness or fullness, thankfully. My hearing… I think it's okay. I haven't really noticed any difference, to be honest. People still tell me to turn the music down, like always, but nothing worse than usual. I'm not sure if that makes sense. I'm not the most sensitive listener, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know – no noticeable change in hearing despite your usual reminders to lower the volume. Okay, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I’m going to take a look in your ears with an otoscope, and then we’ll do a brief hearing screening just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Just… try to be quick if you can, please? I have to get back to work later.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as efficient as possible. Okay, opening your mouth and saying “Ahhh”... Excellent. Now the right ear... Good. And now I’ll just do a quick rub test near each ear. Okay, so externally, your ears look normal – no signs of infection or blockage. The rub test... seems a little diminished on the left side, but it’s subtle. It could be a lot of things, honestly. We'll need to do a formal audiometry test to know for sure. But based on what you've told me, and the initial examination, it sounds like noise-induced tinnitus is the most likely culprit, potentially from the trimmer. What do you think of that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… about right. I mean, I was using that trimmer for hours. I just didn’t think it would… do this. So, what does that mean though? Is there anything I can do about it? And will it… go away? I really need to hear properly for work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a fair question, and a very important one. Noise-induced tinnitus, as the name suggests, is caused by damage to the tiny hair cells in your inner ear from loud noise. Unfortunately, those hair cells don't regenerate. However, that doesn’t mean there’s nothing we can do. Often, tinnitus improves on its own over time, especially if you avoid further noise exposure. We can also explore strategies to manage the symptoms and help you cope. Right now, I recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible – use earplugs or earmuffs whenever you anticipate being exposed. We can also discuss tinnitus retraining therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy , which can help you habituate to the sound. I’d like to schedule you for a formal audiometry test – that'll give us a clearer picture of your hearing levels. And to rule out any other potential causes, I'm going to order a basic blood panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds like a plan. Avoiding loud noises, the test, blood work… yeah, that’s fine. Is the blood work just to check for anything else that could be causing it? And… how long does the test take? I really need to know, so I can tell my manager. I don’t want to leave them short-staffed. Also, is there anything I can take now to make it a little better? Even just something over-the-counter?
DOCTOR: Yes, the blood work is to rule out other potential causes, such as inner ear infections, thyroid issues, or vitamin deficiencies. It’s a standard precaution. The audiometry test typically takes about 30-45 minutes. It involves wearing headphones and responding to different tones and sounds. It’s non-invasive and shouldn't be uncomfortable. As for over-the-counter options, there's no cure-all, unfortunately. Some people find relief with white noise machines or apps to mask the tinnitus. Magnesium supplements may help in some cases, but the evidence is limited and it's best to discuss it with a pharmacist first. Avoid prolonged use of high-dose aspirin or other ototoxic medications, if possible. More importantly, stay hydrated! I'm going to write you a referral for the audiometry test and a lab requisition for the blood work. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and formulate a more detailed management plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, two weeks sounds good. As long as I can get the results quickly. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Okay, so test, blood work, follow-up in two weeks… I think I’ve got it. Thank you, Dr. Andraca. That's all I think, for now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions before your follow-up. And remember, prioritize protecting your hearing! Have a good day, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
