DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. I… well, I was told I have cancer. I’m here to… to find out more about that, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand. That must be very concerning news to receive. We will certainly discuss this thoroughly. Just to clarify, who told you about the possibility of cancer, and do you have any initial reports or information from them that you can share with me?
PATIENT: Um… it was the hospital. They did some tests, a few weeks ago, I think. And then a doctor there… Doctor Ramirez, I believe… called me with the results. I have… a paper here. I don’t really understand all of it, though. It has a lot of words I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Thank you. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t understand the medical terminology; that’s what I’m here for. Let’s take this one step at a time. I see here there were some imaging studies done… a CT scan, it appears. And a biopsy was performed. Do you recall what area the biopsy was taken from?
PATIENT: The biopsy… I think it was from my lung. Yes, that’s right. They said something about a spot, a small spot on my lung. It didn’t hurt or anything, I just… I was coughing a little more than usual. That’s why I went to the hospital in the first place. I didn’t think it was anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, a spot on the lung discovered during evaluation for a cough. And Doctor Ramirez mentioned the possibility of cancer based on the biopsy results. Can you tell me a little more about this cough?
PATIENT: Well… it wasn’t a bad cough, at first. Just… dry, mostly. Like something tickled my throat. But then it got a little worse, I guess. More frequent. And… sometimes I felt a little short of breath, but only when I was doing something. Like walking upstairs, or… carrying groceries. It wasn’t constant, though. And it hasn’t been… that bad recently, to be honest. I just wanted to get it checked out, you know? Just to be safe.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you came in to get it checked out, and it’s helpful to know that the cough hasn’t been severe recently. Has there been any blood when you cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No blood at all. And… no fever, either. No weight loss, I don’t think. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work long hours, so… I just thought it was from that. I’m an Occupational Therapist, you see. It can be a pretty tiring job.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Occupational Therapy is demanding work. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. My legs and feet feel… normal, I suppose. I do stand a lot at work, so they get a little tired sometimes, but no swelling. Is that… is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven’t noticed any swelling. We ask about that sometimes as it can be related to certain medical conditions. Now, let's talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. I had chickenpox when I was a little girl, and… I broke my arm once, when I was in high school. But other than that, I’ve always been pretty healthy. I don’t take any regular medications, either. Oh! Except for… allergy pills, sometimes. During the spring, when the pollen is bad. But that’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I’ve never had any trouble with medicines. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. It doesn't seem very helpful right now, though.
DOCTOR: That’s good. No known allergies is excellent. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… heart trouble. She passed away when I was young. And my uncle… he had diabetes. But other than that, I don’t really know. My mother and father… they were both pretty healthy, too. I don’t… I don’t really talk about my family much. It’s a long story.
DOCTOR: I understand. You don’t need to share anything you’re not comfortable with. Knowing about heart trouble and diabetes is helpful, though. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I very rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine once or twice a year. And I definitely don’t use any drugs. I… I take pretty good care of myself, you know? I eat healthy, I exercise when I can… I just… I don’t understand how this could be happening.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of this information with me, Chellsea. It helps me get a clearer picture of your overall health. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and feel your lymph nodes. This will help me assess your current condition and determine the best course of action. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want to know what’s going on. And I want to… to do whatever I need to do to get better. Please. Let’s just… let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'm going to start by listening to your lungs with my stethoscope. Please take slow, deep breaths in and out. Your breath sounds are a little diminished on the lower right side, and I can hear some subtle crackling. This could be due to a number of things, including inflammation or fluid buildup. I'm also going to check your heart rate and blood pressure now. Your blood pressure is 128/82, and your heart rate is 78 beats per minute, which are both within a normal range. I'm also going to feel your lymph nodes in your neck, armpits, and groin. Your lymph nodes feel slightly enlarged, but not significantly concerning at this time. It’s important to remember that enlarged lymph nodes can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection. I’m documenting these findings as I go.
PATIENT: Okay. That… that doesn’t sound good, does it? The crackling… and the enlarged lymph nodes. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it… is it bad? I know you said it could be a lot of things, but… what are the chances it is cancer?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Chellsea. It’s good that we're getting a thorough assessment. The crackling in your lungs and the slightly enlarged lymph nodes could be signs of cancer, but they can also be caused by other conditions, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, or even a viral infection. It’s too early to say definitively. The biopsy report from Doctor Ramirez is the most important piece of information right now. Do you happen to have a copy of that report with you, or do we need to request it from the hospital?
PATIENT: I have the paper they gave me. It's… it's not the full report, I don't think. It just has some of the results, and some words I didn't understand. Here. It says… "Adenocarcinoma, positive for EGFR mutation." That’s what it says. I still don’t know what that means. Is that… is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, this is significant, Chellsea. “Adenocarcinoma” is a type of lung cancer. And “positive for EGFR mutation” means that the cancer cells have a specific genetic change that can be targeted with certain medications. This is actually good news, in a way. It means there are targeted therapies available that may be very effective in treating your cancer. However, it does confirm the diagnosis of lung cancer. This is a lot to take in, I know. We need to do further staging tests – a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and brain – to determine how far the cancer has spread. We will also need to discuss treatment options. These could include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. I’m going to schedule those tests for you right away. Would you like me to explain these options in more detail now, or would you prefer to process this information first and discuss it at a follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Cancer… it’s really cancer. I… I don’t know. I think… I think I need to process it first. I don’t think I can… I can’t think about treatment right now. Just… the tests. Schedule the tests. And… and maybe I could get a copy of this report? The full report? So I can… look at it later. When I’m ready. I just… I just need a minute.
DOCTOR: Of course, Chellsea. That’s perfectly understandable. We will get the full report for you right away. I’ll have my nurse schedule the CT scans and send the request to radiology. We’ll also set up a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and treatment options in more detail. In the meantime, I want you to know that you are not alone in this. We have a team of oncology specialists who will support you every step of the way. Do you have anyone you would like to call to share this news with?
PATIENT: No… no, not really. I’m… I’m widowed. I don’t have any family close by. And my friends… they’re all busy with their own lives. I… I don’t want to burden them. I think… I think I just need to get through the tests first. And then… then I’ll figure things out. Thank you, Doctor. For… for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. And you don’t need to apologize for anything. We are here to support you, and you are not a burden. We will get through this together. My nurse will come in shortly to go over the instructions for the CT scans and schedule your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please take your time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor Alanes. I… I should probably go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chellsea. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. We’ll be here when you’re ready. .
