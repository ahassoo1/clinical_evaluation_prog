DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, to be quite honest, I’m not entirely sure what prompted me to schedule this appointment. Something about… plans for the future, I believe? A friend suggested I look into some paperwork, in case… well, in case something happens. It has to do with making decisions, doesn't it? I apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I think it’s called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form?
DOCTOR: I see. A proactive approach, commendable, though somewhat… unusual for someone your age, Ms. Buoniconti. It is prudent to consider these matters, regardless of one’s age, but typically, these discussions arise with a specific health concern or in the context of an existing illness. Let's clarify. You mentioned paperwork regarding future decisions. Are you experiencing any current health problems that prompted this concern, or is this purely a preventative measure?
PATIENT: No, no health problems at all, Doctor. Truly. I feel… quite well, actually. It’s… difficult to explain. A friend—old family friend, really—was discussing it recently, and it sounded sensible. Something about ensuring my wishes are known, should I become… incapacitated. She said it would relieve a burden on my family. I suppose I just… thought it was a good idea, even if I don’t recall exactly why she was so insistent. It’s all a bit hazy, to be honest. I’m sorry for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: Very well. While I appreciate your foresight, Ms. Buoniconti, it is… atypical to pursue these documents without a clear medical need or an existing condition. It suggests a certain… anxiety, perhaps?
PATIENT: Anxiety? I… I suppose it’s possible. My divorce was rather recent, and… things were complicated. Perhaps that’s coloring my perceptions. I haven’t really connected it to this, though. It’s just… I want to be prepared, if that makes any sense. And my friend was quite firm that this would simplify things. She’s always been very organized. Is it… is it unusual to have these forms completed without a specific illness? I don't want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: It is not trouble, Ms. Buoniconti. It is simply… inefficient. These documents are designed to clarify medical wishes during a period of incapacity. Without a defined health situation, the process becomes… abstract. However, if you are determined to proceed, we can certainly discuss the components of an Advance Directive and a POLST form. To begin, let's review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Chronic illnesses? Um… not that I’m aware of. I had a bout of the flu last winter, a rather bad one, but that cleared up completely. And… I think I had strep throat as a child? Nothing serious, nothing ongoing. I see a dentist regularly, of course, and… and I had my annual check-up last year. The results were… normal, I believe. Everything was fine. I truly don't recall any diagnoses. Is that… problematic? Should I be seeing a specialist? I apologize, I’m really trying to be helpful.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Buoniconti, it is not “problematic”. It is simply… unremarkable. A clean medical history is, frankly, preferable. Now, let us move on to surgical history. Have you undergone any operations or procedures in the past?
PATIENT: Operations… procedures… Hmm. Let me think. As a child, I had my tonsils removed. That was… quite a long time ago. And… oh! When I was in university, I had a wisdom tooth extracted. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. Other than that… I don’t believe so. Nothing major. I had some minor cuts and scrapes, of course, growing up—horseback riding, you see—but nothing requiring a hospital stay or… anything like that. Does that suffice?
DOCTOR: Adequate. And family history, Ms. Buoniconti?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a bit difficult. My parents both passed away several years ago. My mother… she had some heart trouble, I believe. Not a massive attack, more… a gradual decline. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. Type 2, perhaps? It was a long time ago, and I wasn't heavily involved in their medical care. My brother, he's healthy as far as I know. We don't speak often, so I wouldn't be aware of any issues. Is that helpful? I apologize for my lack of specifics. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Sufficient. Now, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve always been very careful about my health, even if my memory isn't what it used to be. No smoking, no… recreational drugs, either. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps one or two glasses, but that’s it. And I try to maintain a healthy diet, though… I admit, I’ve been indulging in pastries lately. Stress, you see. But no harmful habits, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Allergies, Ms. Buoniconti?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Nothing major. I get hay fever sometimes, during the spring, but it’s mild. A bit of sneezing, itchy eyes. Over-the-counter antihistamines usually do the trick. And… I think I’m slightly allergic to cats, but I avoid them, so it’s not a problem. No severe reactions, no anaphylaxis, nothing like that. Just the usual seasonal sniffles.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Buoniconti, given your remarkably unremarkable medical history and your stated lack of current health concerns, I must confess, I find your pursuit of these advanced directives… premature. However, if you insist, we can proceed with a basic discussion of your wishes. But first, a quick physical exam, just to confirm your overall health status. Will that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly acceptable. I understand your reservations, and I apologize for any inconvenience. I truly just want to be prepared, if possible. A physical exam sounds… sensible. Perhaps it will alleviate some of your concerns, as well as my own.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat. We will begin with your vital signs. 128 over 76. Acceptable. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is regular, 72 beats per minute. Lung sounds are clear, bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. As expected. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Oh! That's… a little sensitive. I think I may have pulled a muscle gardening last week. But otherwise, I believe everything is functioning normally.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflex is 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflex is also 2+. Within normal limits. Gait is steady, no observable abnormalities. Neurological exam is grossly intact. Ms. Buoniconti, while your physical exam confirms your stated good health, I must reiterate, pursuing these documents without a specific medical indication seems… unnecessary. Are you under any undue stress, perhaps?
PATIENT: Stress… yes, perhaps. My divorce was finalized only a few months ago, and… it was a complicated situation. A lot of emotional upheaval, you see. And I suppose… I’m just trying to regain a sense of control. To be prepared for anything. It’s silly, I know. A waste of your valuable time. But my friend was so adamant that this would simplify things for my family, and… I didn’t want to leave them with any difficulties. Perhaps you could just explain the basics? What are these documents, and what would I need to decide? Even if it’s just for peace of mind?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Buoniconti. I suppose a brief explanation won't cause any harm. We will discuss two primary documents: the Advance Directive and the Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, or POLST form. The Advance Directive allows you to specify your wishes regarding medical treatment in the event you become incapacitated and unable to communicate. This includes things like whether you want life-sustaining measures, such as mechanical ventilation or artificial nutrition, to be continued or withheld. The POLST form, on the other hand, is a medical order that translates your wishes into actionable instructions for healthcare professionals. It is typically used for individuals with serious illnesses or those nearing the end of life. Do you understand the distinction?
PATIENT: I… think so. The Advance Directive is more of a general statement of wishes, and the POLST form is a specific order? Like a… a direct instruction? So, the POLST form would only be relevant if I were seriously ill? And the Advance Directive is more for… unforeseen circumstances? It’s a bit confusing, I apologize. I'm trying to follow, but… my mind isn't as sharp as it used to be. Perhaps an example would help?
DOCTOR: Precisely. Think of it this way: the Advance Directive is a broader declaration, outlining your values and preferences. For example, you might state that you value quality of life over prolonged existence, or that you do not wish to be kept alive by artificial means if there is no reasonable hope of recovery. The POLST form, however, is much more specific. It would state, for instance, whether you want cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, performed if your heart stops beating. It would also specify whether you want intubation, or a breathing tube inserted, if you are unable to breathe on your own. As you are currently in good health, Ms. Buoniconti, a POLST form is entirely unnecessary. However, we could discuss drafting an Advance Directive, should you wish. It would involve designating a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf – and outlining your wishes regarding medical treatment. Are you interested in proceeding with that?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… yes, that sounds sensible. My brother… he's always been quite pragmatic. Though we don't speak often, he's reliable, I believe. And outlining my wishes… yes, that would alleviate some of my anxiety. Perhaps if I had something in writing, I wouldn’t feel so… helpless. Yes, Doctor, I think I would like to proceed with drafting an Advance Directive. If it’s not too much trouble, of course. And if you think it's worthwhile, given my… unremarkable medical history.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will begin with the necessary paperwork. It’s a fairly standard form, but requires careful consideration. I will provide you with a copy to review, and we can discuss your wishes in detail. It's crucial to be precise, Ms. Buoniconti. Ambiguous language can lead to misunderstandings and complications down the line. And remember, you have the right to change your mind at any time. This is your document, and it should reflect your values and preferences. Here you are. Please take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your completed document. Do you understand the next steps?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Review the forms, and schedule a follow-up appointment. It’s… quite a lot to read. But I will do my best. And thank you, Doctor, for your patience. And for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your help. Perhaps I should allow myself some time to digest this information before scheduling the appointment?
DOCTOR: Precisely. Take your time, Ms. Buoniconti. There is no rush. My secretary will contact you in a week to schedule a follow-up appointment. And please, do not hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Well, I believe that concludes our consultation for today. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Buoniconti.
