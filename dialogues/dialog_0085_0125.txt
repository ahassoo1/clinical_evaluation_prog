DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I just... wanted to get tested for, you know, the thing. HIV. Better safe than sorry, right? My wife and I were just talking, and figured it wouldn't hurt. I’m Jacquille, by the way. Belan.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re thinking proactively, Jacquille. Absolutely, better safe than sorry is always a good approach. And thank you for confirming your name. So, you're wanting an HIV test. That's perfectly fine. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little bit about why you’re wanting to get tested now specifically?
PATIENT: Well, honestly? It’s just… common sense. You hear things, read things. Lots of people being… careless. And I wouldn’t want to be one of them, would I? We’re both pretty careful, but you never know, do you? It's just… a precaution. A responsible one. I mean, I don’t think anything’s happened, but… it's good to be certain. It’s not like I’m the type to take risks.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jacquille. It is responsible to be proactive, and with everything going around, it's natural to want peace of mind. You’re right to think that way. Just to be thorough, and to help me understand your risk a little better, have you had any recent changes in sexual partners?
PATIENT: Recent changes? No. Absolutely not. I’ve been married for… fifteen years, Doctor. Fifteen. Same wife. It’s not like I’m… gallivanting around. Really, the question is a bit insulting, if I’m honest. We’re a devoted couple. It's… a commitment. You’d think that would be obvious.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Jacquille. That was a standard question, and I didn’t mean to imply anything at all about your relationship. It’s important for me to gather a complete history, and sometimes the questions can seem… impersonal. I assure you, it wasn’t meant to be insulting. Fifteen years is wonderful. So, if you’ve been exclusively with your wife for those fifteen years, has either of you had any medical procedures – like surgeries, blood transfusions, or dental work – that might require further discussion regarding potential exposure risks?
PATIENT: Look, I get it's “standard”. But honestly, it feels like you’re trying to find something wrong. We both have regular check-ups, perfectly healthy. My wife had her wisdom teeth out a couple of years ago, that’s about it. Standard procedure, local anesthetic. I had a minor shoulder surgery five years back, sports injury. Nothing fancy, just arthroscopic repair. Again, standard stuff. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: You’re right to question me, Jacquille. I want to assure you I'm not trying to find something wrong, but gathering this information helps me ensure we choose the most appropriate testing method and interpret the results accurately. The shoulder surgery and wisdom teeth removal are good to know. Sometimes, though rarely, procedures can present very low risks. Okay. And just to be complete, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. Not a single one. I can take anything. Honestly, I'm remarkably resilient. I don’t even get hay fever. I've never reacted badly to anything a doctor has given me. It’s… a blessing, I suppose. Are we almost done with this interrogation?
DOCTOR: I apologize again for the extensive questioning, Jacquille. It’s just my nature to be thorough. And it's wonderful that you don’t have any allergies. Alright, one last quick question, and then we can proceed with the test. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Zip. Nada. I eat healthy, exercise regularly. I don’t need anything. My wife takes a daily multivitamin, but that’s it. I believe in a natural approach to health. Too many people rely on pills for everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, no medications or supplements. Alright, Jacquille, it sounds like you’re in excellent health and have a very low risk profile. We can proceed with the HIV test. There are a couple of options. We can do a standard blood draw, which takes a few minutes, or we can do a rapid finger-prick test that gives results in about 20 minutes. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Twenty minutes? Finger prick, definitely. I haven’t got all day. Blood draws take ages, and then you have to wait for the lab results… no, the finger prick sounds much more efficient. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The finger prick it is. It will be a quick pinch, and then we’ll have your results shortly. I'll need to clean the fingertip with an alcohol swab first. Before I do that, just so you know, a negative result today means you didn't have an HIV infection at the time of the test. It doesn't rule out the possibility of future infection if you were to be exposed later. It's also important to understand that it takes a little time for the body to develop antibodies after exposure, so if you’ve had a recent potential exposure, we may need to repeat the test in a few weeks. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Look, I appreciate the explanation, Doctor, but honestly, I’m not expecting to be positive. Fifteen years of marriage, no medications… it’s a waste of time, really. I just want to get it done and go. I understand it’s a precaution, fine. But I’m not going to sit here and dissect potential future exposures. Just… do the test.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jacquille. I understand. A quick pinch… there. And now we wait. It'll take about 20 minutes for the results to appear. While we wait, I’ll document everything we’ve discussed. Would you like me to explain the process while we wait?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I think I understand the concept of a test. Just… let me know when it's ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jacquille. The results are in. The test is negative. Congratulations. It appears you do not have an HIV infection. Would you like me to explain the implications of this result further and discuss any preventative measures, even though your risk appears low?
PATIENT: Negative. Well, that's what I expected, frankly. Preventative measures? Doctor, I think my lifestyle is a preventative measure. Thank you for your time, but I believe I’ve wasted enough of it here. I’m quite confident I won't be needing any further advice. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Jacquille. I'm glad to hear everything is as you expected. I have documented the results and our conversation. If you do experience any changes in your health or have any concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment. Here's a copy of the results for your records. Have a good day, and thank you for coming in. .
