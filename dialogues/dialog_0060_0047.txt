DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Thanks. It's… long-term care, I think? My… someone told me I needed to get looked at for it. My wife… she would’ve handled all this, but… well. It’s been a bit since I had to think about things like this.
DOCTOR: Right. Long-term care… and your wife usually handles these things. I understand. It’s perfectly alright to be a little…disoriented when taking on something new. Can you tell me a bit more about why you were told to come in for a long-term care evaluation?
PATIENT: Disoriented… yeah, that sounds about right. I… honestly, I don’t really remember who said it. It was… after… everything. Someone from the insurance, maybe? They just said it was a good idea to check, to be prepared. Something about… getting older? I mostly just do my work, you know. Moving things, loading trucks… I don’t think much about… planning. It's hard to explain. It feels like a blur.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s common to feel overwhelmed after… a significant event. And insurance companies do often suggest these things as a matter of course. Let’s try to narrow it down. Are you experiencing any difficulties with daily tasks?
PATIENT: Daily tasks… Not really… I mean, work is hard, always has been. But I can still do it. Lifting, hauling… I get tired, sure, everyone gets tired. But I haven’t… I haven’t stopped doing things. I cook for myself, mostly simple stuff. I keep the place tidy enough. Does that make sense? I just… keep busy. I don't like sitting around.
DOCTOR: So, no difficulties with cooking, cleaning, or getting around?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe… remembering what I ate last week? Or what day it is sometimes. But nothing major. My memory ain’t what it used to be, that's for sure. But I get by. It's just… little things. It’s hard to explain what’s normal and what isn't, you know? Especially now. Everything feels… different.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “different” is understandable. Those little things… memory lapses, confusion about dates… they can be normal, especially with stress and…recent changes. But it's good you're getting it checked. Let's go through a quick review of systems, just to get a broader picture. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… I eat. I think so. Maybe not as much as I used to, but… I don't really pay attention. Weight? Uh… I haven’t weighed myself in… a long time. Probably lost a bit, I guess. Not eating like a horse anymore, if that makes sense. But I haven't been sick or anything, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… less hungry, maybe. Everything tastes… blander now too, I think. Or maybe that’s just me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… It’s… okay. I sleep. But not solid, you know? I wake up a lot. Thinking about… things. Or nothing. Just… lying awake. Been like that for… a while. It’s not keeping me from getting up and going to work, but I’m not as rested as I used to be. Sometimes I just… sit up and read for a bit in the middle of the night. Helps clear my head.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Uh… well, you know. Old man stuff. Things aren't as… regular as they used to be. But nothing… serious. Just… comes and goes. Happens with age, I figure. I don't want to get into too much detail about that, if you don't mind. It’s embarrassing to talk about.
DOCTOR: Understandable. We don’t have to go into detail. Now, have you experienced any dizziness, headaches, or vision changes?
PATIENT: Dizziness… Sometimes, yeah. Not all the time, but… when I stand up too fast. Happens every now and then. Headaches? Not really. I get a little tired, like a weight on my head, but not a headache. Vision… I think it's getting a little blurry sometimes, but I figured it was just my eyes getting old. I haven’t gotten them checked in years. Everything looks… dimmer, maybe? I don’t know. I mostly just work outside, so it’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your recent changes and your wife's usual handling of things, it sounds like a full physical exam would be a good place to start. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah. That sounds… good. If that's what you think. I haven’t really been to a doctor in… a long time. I mostly just tough things out. But if it’ll help figure things out, then yeah. A check-up sounds fine. What does it involve?
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, take a look in your ears, nose and throat. I’ll palpate your abdomen, check your reflexes, and do a basic neurological assessment. It’s fairly standard. I also want to check your gait and balance. Could you please change into this gown, and we’ll get started?
PATIENT: Okay… Sounds… thorough. Gait and balance, huh? I guess that makes sense. I can do that. I’ll be right back. Where is the room exactly?
DOCTOR: Just through there, Mr. Rover. I’ll be right outside when you’re ready. Take your time.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you.
DOCTOR: .
