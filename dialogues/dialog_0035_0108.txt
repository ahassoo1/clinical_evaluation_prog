DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doc, it’s… unpleasant. Been throwin’ up blood, mostly. Not a ton, thankfully, but enough to scare the daylights outta me. Happened a couple times now, over the last few days. Thought I should probably get it checked, didn’t wanna just… ignore it, you know? It’s not somethin’ you just brush off.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is concerning, Mr. Gentz, and you’re right to get it checked out. Vomiting blood is never something to ignore. When did this start happening exactly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was… Tuesday, I reckon. Tuesday night. Had a bit of a stomach ache beforehand, figured it was somethin’ I ate. Then… well, you know. Wednesday morning it happened again, a little worse. And then again last night. All after eating, mind you. Not at random times. I eat pretty simple stuff, usually. Nothin’ fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's consistently happening after meals. And you said a stomach ache beforehand each time?
PATIENT: Yeah, a bit of a rumble, kinda like… indigestion. Not awful, just… noticeable. Like somethin’ didn’t quite settle right. It builds up for maybe an hour or so before… the other thing happens. Honestly, Doc, I'm not one to complain much. I just figured it’d pass, but it keeps comin’ back. It’s probably just somethin’ silly, if you wanna know the truth. A bad batch of coffee, maybe.
DOCTOR: I understand you think it might be something minor, Mr. Gentz, but we need to rule out anything serious. Can you describe what the blood looks like?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… bright red, mostly. Not all dark and chunky, thankfully. More like… streaks, you know? Mixed in with the… other stuff. Not a huge amount, like I said, but enough to make me worry. It's not like I'm coughin' it up or anything, just… when I throw up. And it smells… metallic, if that makes sense. Not a pleasant smell, I assure you. I try not to look too closely, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, bright red blood mixed with your vomit, and a metallic smell. That gives us some information. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I've been feelin’ a little tired, I suppose. But I'm always tired. Old man problems, you know? Nah, nothin’ major. Maybe a little weaker than usual, but I chalked that up to the lack of appetite. Ain't been eatin' much since this started, naturally. And… my gums bleed a bit when I brush, but I always thought that was just… me. Not a big deal. You think this is a big deal? I really just thought I ate somethin' bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, slight weakness, and bleeding gums… those are all things we need to consider. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu a couple times, like everybody does. And my wife… well, she had a bad heart, but I don’t have heart trouble. She passed away five years ago now. Nothing ever really wrong with me, if you wanna know the truth. I've always been a pretty healthy fella. Worked hard my whole life, mostly. That's what I always believed in – keep movin’, keep workin’. So, no, not much in the way of medical history, Doc. Nothin’ serious, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Never been under the knife. Broke my arm when I was a kid, fell outta a tree chasin' a cat, but they just put it in a cast. That's about it. Always been lucky, I guess. Until this, of course. This whole blood thing is new territory for me, Doc. And frankly, it's makin’ me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my father... he had stomach problems. Always complainin' about heartburn and indigestion. Never really went to the doctor much, though. Just toughed it out, like most men of his generation. My mother, she lived to be ninety, healthy as a horse right up 'til the end. No real problems with her. As for my wife’s side… I didn’t know her family very well. She didn’t talk much about them. So… not really, Doc. Not that I know of. Stomach trouble with my dad, that's about it, I reckon. Not a very helpful answer, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, stomach trouble with your father. And what about your current medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Doc, I don’t take nothin’. Never been one for pills. Always thought they did more harm than good. Maybe a painkiller now and then for a bad back, but that’s it. No prescriptions, no vitamins, nothin’. I just… deal with it. Always have. Is that gonna be a problem, Doc? Because I really don’t like takin’ pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been allergic to a thing in my life. At least, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Well, except for okra. Can’t stand okra. But that’s a preference, not an allergy. No, Doc. No allergies. I’m a pretty simple man, really. Don’t need much to keep me goin’. You think I need to worry about allergies right now? With blood comin’ up? Seems like we got bigger fish to fry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doc, are you tryin’ to get somethin' outta me? I used to drink a beer now and then, with dinner. But nothin' heavy. Haven’t touched a drop in… oh, maybe ten years now. After my wife passed, I just didn’t have the taste for it anymore. And no, no smokin’ or… other things. Never been one for bad habits. I worked too hard my whole life to ruin it with that stuff. Is that what you're gettin' at, Doc? I'm a good man. I just got a little stomach trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no recreational drugs, and very limited alcohol use in the past. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me about your diet?
PATIENT: My diet? Well, I eat. It's not fancy, Doc. I ain't one of them health nuts. Mostly simple stuff. Eggs, toast, maybe some stew. Chicken now and then. I cook for myself, mostly. Don't eat a lot of fast food. I eat what tastes good, keeps me goin’. I eat pretty regular, breakfast, lunch, dinner. What, are you thinkin' I'm starvin’ myself? I just got blood comin’ up, Doc. It’s not like I’m livin’ on air.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. It sounds like you have a fairly consistent, simple diet. Now, I'd like to conduct a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also need to feel your abdomen. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. But don't poke too much, alright? It's already sore enough as it is. I never liked doctors touchin' me. But if you gotta do it, go ahead. Just be gentle, Doc. Be gentle. Get it over with, then. The sooner we figure this out, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I'll be as gentle as possible. Please lie down on your back. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. There’s some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, particularly on the left side. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted at this time. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. No masses palpable. Okay. That’s all for the physical exam for now.
PATIENT: Ouch. Yeah, that spot hurts a bit. Been achin’ for a couple days now. Left side, like you said. Not sharp pain, just… dull and achy. Like a bruise, almost. Distended, you say? I’ve been feelin’ a little bloated, come to think of it. So, what does that mean, Doc? What’s wrong with me? You findin’ somethin’? Because I really don’t like bein’ poked and prodded for no reason.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz. Based on the physical exam findings, and your history, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The tenderness in your upper abdomen, along with the vomiting blood, is concerning. Given your history of indigestion beforehand, and the bright red blood, it could be a gastrointestinal bleed, possibly from an ulcer or esophagitis. However, we need to rule out other causes. To do that, I’d like to order some lab work. Specifically, a complete blood count to check your hemoglobin and hematocrit, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a stool test to check for blood and infection. I’m also going to order an upper endoscopy. That involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining and look for any sources of bleeding. It's the most accurate way to determine the cause of your bleeding. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A tube… down my throat? Doc, you're tellin’ me you wanna stick a camera down my throat? That sounds awful. Absolutely awful. No. No, I don’t like that one bit. I knew it. I knew somethin’ bad was gonna come of this. I just got a little stomach trouble, that's all. Why do I need a camera? Can’t you just… give me somethin’ for my stomach? Some pills, maybe? Or somethin’ to stop the throwin’ up? I don’t want no tube down my throat, Doc. I really, really don’t. Is there any other way?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Gentz. It's perfectly natural to be anxious about a procedure like an endoscopy. However, it’s the safest and most accurate way to determine the cause of your bleeding, and that's crucial for getting you the right treatment. Without knowing the source of the bleeding, we can't effectively stop it. The endoscopy allows us to visualize the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, identify any ulcers, inflammation, or other abnormalities, and even take biopsies if needed. Before we jump to the endoscopy, we can start with some medication to help control the acid in your stomach and see if that helps alleviate the symptoms. I can prescribe a proton pump inhibitor, like omeprazole, and an antiemetic to help with the nausea and vomiting. However, if the bleeding continues or worsens despite the medication, we’ll need to revisit the possibility of the endoscopy. Would you be more comfortable trying the medication first?
PATIENT: Medication… yeah. That sounds… better. Much better. A tube down my throat… just the thought of it makes me sick. Yes. Let's try the medication first. Omeprazole, you say? And somethin' for the throwin' up? Will that really help? And how long do I gotta take it? I don't want to be on pills forever. And what if it doesn’t work? Then you’re gonna stick that camera down my throat anyway, aren’t you? Just… please tell me you'll explain everything again before you do that. Everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll start with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, which will reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces. It can significantly help heal any ulcers and prevent further bleeding. I’ll also prescribe an antiemetic, like metoclopramide, to help control the nausea and vomiting. We’ll start with a standard dose of omeprazole, usually 20 milligrams once a day, for 8 weeks. The metoclopramide will be as needed for the nausea. We’ll reassess your symptoms after 8 weeks. If the bleeding stops and your symptoms improve, we can potentially taper the medication off. If the bleeding doesn’t stop, or if your symptoms worsen despite the medication, then we’ll need to discuss the endoscopy again. And absolutely, I will explain the procedure in detail beforehand, answer all your questions, and make sure you feel comfortable before proceeding. It’s a minimally invasive procedure, and we’ll take every precaution to ensure your safety and comfort. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Eight weeks… alright. And the pills for the throwin' up when I need 'em. As long as you promise to explain everything again before stickin' anything down my throat. And you promise to make sure I'm comfortable? I don't like bein' poked and prodded, Doc. I really don't. Alright. Let's try the pills. Write me the prescriptions. And… thank you, Doc. For explainin' it all. I still don't like it, but… thank you. Now, can I go home? I'm feelin' a little weak.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Gentz. I’ll write you the prescriptions for omeprazole and metoclopramide right now. They should be sent electronically to your pharmacy. I’ll also give you some written instructions on how to take the medication, and what side effects to watch out for. And yes, you can absolutely go home now. Please try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or black, tarry stools, go to the emergency room immediately. And don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help. I understand your apprehension about the endoscopy, and I promise to explain everything in detail before proceeding. Your comfort and safety are my top priority. Now, get some rest, Mr. Gentz. And take care. .
