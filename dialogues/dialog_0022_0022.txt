DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor… Tosca, yes? It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… well, my tummy feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. It’s just… not feeling right. I don't really remember when it started, just… lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, "tummy feels big" and not wanting to eat much… and this has been happening “lately.” That's a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about this “big” feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it's just… puffy, I think. Like when you’ve eaten too much, but I haven’t! It doesn’t hurt hurt, just… uncomfortable. And heavy. Like a little… balloon, maybe? I don't know. Things aren’t always clear in my head these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, “puffy” and “uncomfortable” and “heavy,” like a balloon, but without eating a lot. And you said it doesn’t hurt, just feels… off. You also mentioned things aren’t always clear in your head these days. Is that a new thing, or has that been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… the memory… it comes and goes. It's been… a while, I think. Not new, no. Longer than I can say for sure. Sometimes I remember things from… long ago, very clearly. But what happened yesterday? Not so much. It doesn't bother me too much, usually. Just makes talking sometimes… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some memory difficulties that have been present for some time, more noticeable recently. That’s helpful to know. Let’s focus on your tummy for now, and then we can circle back to the memory if we need to. Besides the puffiness and discomfort, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. I… go to the bathroom more often, I think. Not a lot, just… more than usual. And sometimes I feel… tired. Very tired. But everyone gets tired, yes? I don’t know if that’s… part of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency of urination and feeling tired. Both could be related to a lot of things. When you say “more often,” about how many times a day are you going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh, um… More than before. Before… I don't know what “before” is! Maybe… every couple of hours? It’s hard to say, Doctor. I don’t really count. I just… go when I need to. It's not painful, though. Just… frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, "frequent," roughly every couple of hours. And no pain with urination. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? Oh… you mean… going to the bathroom for… other things? Well, they are… regular, I think. Not different. Maybe a little… softer, sometimes. But not always. It’s… not a big problem, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, “regular” but sometimes a little softer. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? Oh dear. I don’t know, Doctor. I don’t weigh myself. I used to… a long time ago. But not anymore. I… I suppose I feel a little lighter, maybe? But that could be… anything. I don’t really eat much, so…
DOCTOR: Okay, so you don't weigh yourself, but you feel a little lighter, and you don't eat much. Let's do a quick exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your tummy and feel it gently to see if we can get a better idea of what's going on. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just be gentle, please. My old bones are… fragile.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. I’m listening to your tummy now. It sounds a little… full of air. And when I press gently, it’s a little tender down here, in the lower part. But it doesn't seem to be anything sharp or painful. I’m also going to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart. Your blood pressure is a little high, and your heart is beating a bit faster than usual. We will need to investigate the cause of this.
PATIENT: Oh dear… high blood pressure? Is that bad, Doctor? I don't understand all these… numbers. I just want to feel better. My tummy is making me tired, and I don't remember things so well. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel worried, Soila. High blood pressure can be a concern, but it’s something we can manage. It often doesn't have any obvious symptoms, which is why it’s important to check it. As for your tummy and the memory problems, there could be many reasons for what you’re experiencing, and it’s too early to say if it’s something serious. That’s why I want to do a few more tests to get a clearer picture. Would you be willing to have some blood work done?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh… I don’t like needles. But… if you think it will help, yes. I want to know what’s wrong. I don’t want to just… feel this way forever. Please be quick, Doctor. And gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your hesitation, and we’ll take it as slowly as we need to. The blood work will help us check your kidney function, liver function, and look for any signs of infection or other issues that might be causing your symptoms. We’ll also check your blood count. I'll also order a urine test to check for any infection. It's a standard procedure, and the phlebotomist is very good at making it as comfortable as possible. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Urine test… that doesn't sound so bad. Blood work… yes, alright. If it helps find out what’s wrong with my tummy and… my head. Just… please tell me what everything means, Doctor. I don't understand these… fancy words.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Soila. I promise to explain everything in plain language, no fancy words, I will go over the results with you step-by-step. We will take things one at a time. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. After the results are back, which usually takes a few days, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids and get as much rest as you can. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. You explained everything very nicely, Doctor. Just… thank you. For listening to an old woman. It's easy to forget about old women, you know.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Soila. It’s never easy to forget about anyone, and I’m glad you came in today. We’ll take good care of you. The nurse will be in shortly to get started with the blood work and urine sample. If you have any concerns or questions at all before then, please don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will. Thank you again.
