DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MayHugh. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit…fuzzy. My daughter, Lani, she made the appointment. Something about my ears, and…feeling off balance? It comes and goes, you see. Not all the time. It’s hard to explain. And my husband…he used to have something similar, I think.
DOCTOR: I see. It's perfectly alright if it's difficult to explain, Ms. MayHugh. Many things can cause dizziness and balance issues. We'll take our time and try to get to the bottom of it. So, this feeling of being "off balance," when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Oh dear…when did it start? It feels like…a long time ago. Maybe…last year? Or the year before? It’s not constant, like I said. Sometimes I just feel a little wobbly when I stand up, and other times…well, it feels like the room is spinning. But not always. It’s hard to pinpoint, honestly. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. MayHugh. We can work through it. So, this spinning sensation… does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Hmm…not that I’ve noticed, really. It just…happens. Sometimes when I’m walking, maybe? Or…when I turn my head quickly? But even then, not every time. It’s very unpredictable. I used to work at the casino, you know. Lots of standing and moving about…maybe it started then? I’m not sure. Everything feels a bit muddled, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. A busy work environment could certainly contribute. And it's not uncommon for things to develop gradually. Now, besides the dizziness and feeling off balance, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me think. Sometimes my ears…they ring. A sort of…faint humming sound. And…oh, yes! A few times, I’ve felt…a fullness in my ear. Like it’s blocked, you know? Not painful, just…stuffed up. And…I think my hearing’s a little worse in one ear, maybe? But it's hard to say for sure. I don't pay much attention to those things anymore, if I'm honest. It's all just a bit much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ringing in the ears, a feeling of fullness, and possible hearing loss. That's helpful information, Ms. MayHugh. Do you recall if the hearing loss or fullness seems to happen on one side more than the other?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…I think it’s my left ear. Yes, that sounds right. The fullness, and the…not hearing as well. My left ear, definitely. It comes and goes, though. Sometimes it’s fine, and other times…well, I just can’t hear as clearly. Lani mentioned something about…vertigo? Is that like dizziness? I get that too, sometimes. It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Vertigo is a type of dizziness, Ms. MayHugh, a spinning sensation specifically. It sounds like you're experiencing a number of symptoms that could be related. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see…I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. I take a little pill for it, every day. And…arthritis in my knees, which is why I walk a little slow sometimes. Other than that…not much, I think. I had the flu a couple of times, of course, and a bad cold last winter, but nothing serious. My husband…he had diabetes, but I don’t. I hope I never get that. Is that enough? I’m terrible at remembering things, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. MayHugh. High blood pressure and arthritis. And you take medication for your blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A little white pill. Every morning with my breakfast. It's…amlodipine, I think? Lani helps me with my pills, so she probably knows better than I do. She keeps track of everything. I just take what she gives me, honestly. It’s easier that way. I just want to get this ear thing sorted, you know? It's making me feel…unsteady.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. MayHugh. We will. And it’s good you have Lani to help you. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm…allergies? Not that I know of, no. I eat pretty much anything. Lani always asks me before I try something new, just in case, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I get a few mosquito bites in the summer, but that’s all. No, no allergies, to the best of my knowledge. Though…my husband was allergic to shellfish. But I’m not. I love a good prawn cocktail, you see. Is that okay? I'm rambling again, aren't I?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. MayHugh. That's perfectly alright. No allergies, that’s good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your ears, and maybe check your balance a little. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to find out what’s going on with my ears. I’m a bit wobbly today, so please be careful. And…don’t mind if I close my eyes, alright? Sometimes it makes me feel a bit better when I'm being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. MayHugh. We'll take it slowly. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Alright, I'm just going to take a quick look inside your left ear… Hmm…I see a little bit of wax buildup, and the eardrum looks slightly…dull. Not a major concern at this stage, but it could be contributing to your symptoms. Your right ear looks much clearer. Now, I’m going to check your balance… Please follow my finger with your eyes. A little unsteady, as you mentioned, but no significant issues that jump out right now. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs briefly, just to get a general picture.
PATIENT: Alright. Oh, dear…it’s a bit hard to focus. My eyes aren't what they used to be either, you see. And my knees…they ache a little when I stand still for too long. Is everything alright? You sound…serious. Are my knees bad? Is that why I’m wobbly?
DOCTOR: Everything is alright, Ms. MayHugh. Your knees do have some crepitus, which is common with arthritis, and that can certainly contribute to your feeling unsteady. Your heart and lungs sound good. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam, it sounds like you could be experiencing a combination of things. The wax buildup in your left ear could be contributing to the fullness and hearing loss, and the balance issues could be related to a variety of factors, including your arthritis and possibly some mild age-related changes in your inner ear. I’d like to order a simple hearing test, called an audiogram, to get a better understanding of your hearing loss. I’d also like to send you to a physical therapist for a balance assessment. They can help you with exercises to improve your stability. What do you think about that?
PATIENT: Oh…that sounds…a lot. A hearing test, and a…physical therapist? My daughter can help me with all that, I suppose. She’s very good at organizing things. I just want to feel…steady again. Is it something serious, Doctor? Will I have to have…surgery? Or…something awful?
DOCTOR: It's a lot, I understand. But we're taking things one step at a time. And no, Ms. MayHugh, it doesn't sound like anything serious at all. Surgery is very unlikely. The hearing test is a simple, painless procedure, and the physical therapist will teach you some exercises to improve your balance and strength. It's very common to experience these kinds of issues as we get older. I'm going to write you a referral for the audiogram and the physical therapist. I’ll also give you a prescription for some ear drops to help soften the wax buildup in your left ear. Use them as directed, and avoid getting any water in your ear. We’ll get those results, then we can discuss a plan tailored to your needs. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh…ear drops. That sounds…manageable. And exercises. My daughter can help me with those too, I’m sure. No, I don’t think so. Not right now. Just…thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for not saying it’s something awful. I just want to be able to walk without feeling like I’m going to fall over, you know? Is it alright if Lani picks up these papers for me? She’s much better at remembering things than I am. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. MayHugh. That's perfectly fine. Lani can pick up the papers for you. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We're here to help. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Have a good day, Ms. MayHugh.
