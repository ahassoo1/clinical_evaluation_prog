DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh… good morning. I think… the lady on the phone said something about… learning? I don't really remember. Something about… checking things? I just… work a lot with metal, you know? It’s noisy. Makes my head… fuzzy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. It sounds like you were scheduled for a general check-up today. And you mentioned you work with metal, which can be quite loud. That's good to know. Just to clarify, when you say "fuzzy," can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Fuzzy… like… things aren't clear. Hard to hear sometimes, even without the metal banging. And… dizzy. Not all the time, just… when I stand up fast, maybe? Or when it's really loud. My husband says I talk too much, too. He says I repeat myself. Men. They always exaggerate.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're experiencing some unclear hearing, dizziness especially when standing quickly or in loud environments, and your husband has noticed some repetition in your speech. That's helpful information. Before we proceed, have you experienced any recent changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? Uh… not really. I mean, things are… blurry sometimes? But I always thought that was just… my eyes. I don’t wear glasses. My husband drives, so I don’t need good eyes, you know? He says I should get them checked, but… I'm busy. Metal doesn't bend itself.
DOCTOR: I understand being busy, Ms. Fontanazza. It sounds like you've been experiencing blurry vision for a while now. Let's make a note of that. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past… medical history? Oh dear. That’s… a lot to remember. I broke my arm once, when I was little. Climbing a tree. My mother was very angry. And… I think I had the flu last year? Or maybe the year before. Everything feels the same when I’m sick, just… tired and achy. Honestly, I don't go to the doctor much. Waste of time, mostly. I just take some… pills when I need them. For the headaches.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm in childhood and occasional flu-like symptoms. And you mentioned taking pills for headaches. Could you tell me what kind of pills you take for the headaches?
PATIENT: Uh… they're… white. Small, round, white pills. My neighbor gave them to me. She said they were good for… everything. I don’t know the name. I just take them when my head really hurts. She's a nice lady. Always helping people. Better than some doctors, I guess.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, it’s important for me to know the exact name of any medication you’re taking, even if it was given to you by a friend. Taking medications without knowing what they are or their potential side effects can be risky. Do you have the bottle with you, or perhaps remember where your neighbor obtained them?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, no. I don’t have the bottle. She just… handed them to me. Said they were good. I don't… ask questions. It’s just… rude, you know? Besides, they do help. I don’t want to cause trouble. Maybe I should just stop taking them? But then my head… It hurts so much. It’s a headache that feels like… metal is squeezing my brain. It’s very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I understand you don’t want to cause trouble, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. However, it’s crucial that we identify this medication for your safety. We need to know what you’re taking to make sure it’s not causing any unintended side effects or interacting with anything else. Before we proceed further, let's do a quick physical exam. We'll start with your ears, just to get a baseline of your hearing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: My ears are fine. I can hear just fine, mostly. It’s just… when it’s loud. And sometimes… after I stand up. Honestly, I don’t have time for poking and prodding. I need to get back to work. Metal doesn’t bend itself, you know. And my husband will be angry if I’m late. Can’t we just… skip the exam?
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I understand your concerns about time and your husband’s expectations. However, a quick examination is necessary to gather information and ensure we’re making the best decisions for your health. It will only take a few minutes. We'll start with listening to your heartbeat and checking your blood pressure. Then we'll briefly examine your ears and eyes. This will help us understand your overall health and determine the cause of your symptoms. If you are uncomfortable with any part of the exam, please let me know, and we can stop. But I strongly recommend allowing me to proceed, even for a few minutes, to ensure your well-being. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. Very quick. And don’t poke too hard. My head already hurts. And don’t tell my husband about this. He worries too much. He says I push myself too hard. He’s always right, unfortunately. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. Thank you for allowing me to examine you. We’ll be quick and gentle. I'm listening to your heartbeat now. It sounds… slightly elevated. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a bit higher than ideal. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look inside your ears… There appears to be some mild cerumen buildup, but nothing concerning at this time. Finally, I’m just going to shine a light in your eyes to check your pupils… Your pupils are equal and reactive to light, but your vision does appear slightly blurred. Okay, Ms. Fontanazza. Those were just a few quick checks. Based on your symptoms and the preliminary exam findings, I’m concerned about your headache, dizziness, and slightly elevated blood pressure. And I am very concerned about the unknown medication you are taking.
PATIENT: See? Everything's fine. I told you. Just a little tired. Metal is heavy, you know? And I don’t like doctors poking around. It makes me nervous. Can I go now? My husband is probably wondering where I am. And the metal… it won’t bend itself. It’s very important.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, while you may feel everything is “fine,” your symptoms and the exam findings indicate we need to investigate further. The elevated blood pressure, dizziness, and blurred vision are concerning. And taking an unknown medication is a significant risk. I understand your concern about your metalwork and your husband, but your health is my priority. I strongly recommend we order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We should also consider a CT scan of your head to investigate the cause of your headaches. And it is crucial that you stop taking the unknown medication immediately. I can provide you with a list of safe pain relievers while we determine the cause of your headaches. I also recommend a referral to an audiologist to assess your hearing and rule out any hearing loss. Would you be willing to consider these recommendations?
PATIENT: CT scan? Blood tests? Audiologist? That’s… a lot. And expensive, probably. I don’t have time for all that. And my husband… he’ll be angry. He says I worry too much. He thinks I’m fine. He says I’m just tired. Look, can’t you just… give me something for the headache? Something strong? And let me go back to work? I promise I’ll… try to rest. Maybe. But the metal… it won't bend itself. It’s very important. And I really, really don’t want to spend money on all those tests. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I understand your concerns about time, cost, and your husband's expectations. However, I am ethically obligated to prioritize your health and ensure you receive appropriate care. While I can prescribe a pain reliever for your headache, it will only address the symptom, not the underlying cause. Ignoring the underlying cause of your symptoms could lead to serious complications in the future. I realize this is a lot to take in. To help you make an informed decision, I can provide you with information about financial assistance programs that may cover the cost of the tests. I can also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your concerns in more detail and answer any questions you may have. However, I strongly advise against delaying further investigation. Given your symptoms, and your reluctance to undergo further testing, I recommend, at the very least, a referral to a neurologist. They can assess your headaches and dizziness and determine the best course of action. Would you agree to that?
