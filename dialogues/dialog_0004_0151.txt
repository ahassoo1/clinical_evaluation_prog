DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's...well, it's this tingling. In my hands, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought maybe it would just go away, but it hasn't. It's a bit bothersome when I’m sorting mail, you know? A lot of little papers... makes it harder to feel things properly.
DOCTOR: Tingling, you say. And it’s primarily in your hands?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. Sometimes it goes up my arms a bit, but it's worse in my hands and fingers. It's not painful, exactly… just… weird. Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as strong, and it doesn’t go away quickly. Does that make sense? I hope so. I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has this “weird tingling” been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, I’d say, maybe… three months ago? Around the end of April, maybe? It was just a little thing then, hardly noticeable. But it’s definitely gotten worse over the summer. It comes and goes, but it’s happening more often now, if that makes sense. I keep hoping it’s just from carrying heavy bags, but… it just doesn't feel right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this tingling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, definitely. Some days I hardly notice it at all, and other days… well, like today, it's pretty constant. It seems worse when I’ve been working, you know, handling the mail. But even when I'm resting, sometimes it’s there, just a little buzz. It's very unpredictable, to be honest. I wish I knew what was causing it. Is there anything specific you need to know? I’m trying to be helpful, I just… I'm not a doctor, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's try to be thorough. Besides handling mail, are there any other activities that seem to worsen the tingling, or anything that makes it feel better?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Let me think. Nothing really makes it feel better, to be honest. Warm water sometimes helps a little, but not much. As for making it worse… well, cold makes it worse, definitely. And sometimes, if I’m really stressed, I notice it more. But honestly, the mail is the biggest thing. It's hard to say if the stress is making it worse, or if it's the mail, or both! It’s just… inconvenient, you know? I need my hands for my job. And I don’t want to lose my job. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any other medical problems – things like diabetes, thyroid issues, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, not really. I mean, I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s managed with a little pill. Nothing else, really. I used to have some trouble with my back, years ago, but that's been okay for a long time. Arthritis… no, never been diagnosed with that. Thyroid… no. Just the blood pressure. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat good food, walk when I can, but… things happen. I wish I could remember everything perfectly, but my memory isn't what it used to be. Is that okay? I'm not trying to be difficult, I just… forget things. A lot.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: No, just the one pill for the blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. Small white pill. I take it every morning. That’s it. No creams, no vitamins, no anything else. I don't really like taking pills unless I have to. Makes me feel… sluggish. And I don't want to add more if I don’t need to. I hope you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything. My mother always said I had a cast iron stomach! I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine, or anything else for that matter. I’ve been stung by a bee once or twice, but nothing serious. Just a bit of swelling. Really, I'm pretty lucky, I think. Aside from this tingling, of course. I just want to get to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I need to tell you? I just want to be as helpful as possible. And I'm hoping we can wrap this up soon, if that's alright. I have a lot of mail to sort.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Uzarski, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll assess your reflexes and sensation in your hands and arms. Then, based on my findings, we may need to order some tests to determine the cause of the tingling. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what's going on, and hopefully get it fixed. And… thank you for listening. I've been worried about this for a while now. And… quickly would be good, if that’s possible. I really do have a lot of mail.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat here, and I'll begin the exam. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Then, I'll assess your reflexes and sensation in your arms and hands. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I’ll try to relax. It’s just… it’s hard to relax when you’re worried. But I’ll do my best. Tell me if you need me to do anything specific. And… is my blood pressure usually high? I don't remember the number, but… it's usually managed, right? Just let me know if everything is okay. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range given your history. Now, please extend your arms, palms up. I’m going to test your reflexes now. Just let your arms go limp. Reflexes are normal and equal on both sides. Now, I’m going to assess your sensation. I’ll be lightly touching your hands with this cotton swab. Tell me when you can feel it.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I’m trying to keep them still. It's just… my hands sometimes tingle on their own, so it’s hard to tell if I feel the swab or not. But I'll let you know when I think I feel it. Lightly touching… alright, yes, I think I feel that one. And… yes, I feel that one too. But it's… different than it usually is. Like a buzzing feeling under the skin. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a clear feeling, if that makes sense? Like a… muted sensation. I hope that’s helpful. I’m trying my best to be specific.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you feel the sensation equally in both hands?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Let me think. I think… maybe not. My right hand feels a little bit… less sensitive, maybe? It’s hard to tell for sure, because the tingling comes and goes, and it's all a bit… fuzzy. But I think I feel it more strongly in my left hand. Just a little bit, though. It's very subtle. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at these things. I'm not a doctor, you know? I just know how things feel. And right now, things don't feel quite right. Is that helpful at all? I hope so.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on my preliminary examination, the decreased sensation in your right hand, coupled with the tingling you’ve described, warrants further investigation. I suspect this could be related to nerve compression, potentially carpal tunnel syndrome, though other possibilities need to be ruled out. I’m going to order some nerve conduction studies, as well as blood work to assess for underlying causes like diabetes or vitamin deficiencies. Are you able to undergo these tests?
PATIENT: Nerve… conduction studies? Blood work? Oh goodness. I… I don't know. I don't like needles, you know? And… what do these tests even involve? Are they painful? I haven’t had a lot of medical tests in my life, and… I don’t want anything complicated. I just want to know what’s wrong, and hopefully get it fixed. Are there other options? Could it be… just a pinched nerve? I’ve heard those can sometimes go away on their own. I just don’t want anything too invasive. I'm a bit anxious about all this, if you don't mind. I just… don’t like surprises. And I really need to get back to my mail.
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, I understand your apprehension. Nerve conduction studies involve small electrodes placed on your skin to measure the speed of electrical signals in your nerves. It may cause some mild discomfort, like a brief tingling sensation, but it's not usually painful. The blood work is a standard procedure to rule out other potential causes. While it could be a simple pinched nerve, we can't determine that definitively without these tests. It’s important to be thorough, especially given the persistent nature of your symptoms and the subtle decrease in sensation I observed. We have to rule out more serious conditions. I'll write the orders for the tests, and the clinic staff will schedule them for you. They will explain the procedures in detail. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding activities that aggravate the tingling, such as prolonged mail sorting. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Oh. Avoiding mail sorting… That’s… difficult. But alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I just… I don’t want to lose my job over this. What about the blood work? What are you looking for, exactly? And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to have to keep coming back here if I can avoid it. I’m getting a bit overwhelmed with all this, to be honest. And… is there anything I can do right now to make it better? Like a cream, or a wrap, or… anything? I just want some relief, you know? It’s just… bothersome. And I need to get back to work. If it's possible.
DOCTOR: The blood work will assess your blood sugar levels to rule out diabetes, as well as check for vitamin deficiencies and inflammation. The results typically take 2-3 business days. Unfortunately, there’s no quick fix for this. A cream or wrap won't address the underlying cause. I can recommend over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication, like ibuprofen, to help manage any discomfort, but it's not a long-term solution. We need to determine the source of the nerve compression before we can develop an effective treatment plan. Trying to self-treat without a proper diagnosis could worsen the condition. I’ll write the orders for the tests and a prescription for ibuprofen. The clinic staff will schedule the tests and explain the process. Please follow up with me once you have the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Tests… and ibuprofen. And… wait for the results. I… alright. Thank you… I guess. It’s just… a lot to take in. And I really need to get back to work. Hopefully, these tests won't take too long. And… hopefully, it's nothing serious. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The clinic staff will assist you with scheduling. Have a good day, Ms. Uzarski.
