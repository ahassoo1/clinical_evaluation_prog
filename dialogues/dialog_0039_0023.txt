DOCTOR: Hello, Aron. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my chest hurts. Not all the time, but… yeah, it hurts sometimes. It’s in my… my breast.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. I understand. And you said it’s in your breast… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah. It's… hard to explain. It doesn't feel like… a bad hurt, you know? More like… sore. Like when you… when you use your muscles too much. But it's in my chest. It's not always there, like I said. Sometimes I don't feel anything.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay, a soreness, like after exercise, but in your chest and comes and goes. Do you recall anything specific that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger? You mean… what makes it start? Um… not really. I do a lot of lifting at work, roofing. Maybe that? But it doesn't happen every time I lift stuff. Sometimes it hurts even when I’m just… sitting. I don’t know. It’s confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, lifting at work is a possibility, but it doesn’t seem to be consistent. And you can feel it even at rest. Is the soreness localized to one spot, or does it spread anywhere?
PATIENT: Um… I think… mostly on this side. Not like, a really sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Sometimes it feels a little in my armpit too, on the same side. But not always. It’s hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Discomfort primarily on the left side of your chest, sometimes radiating to the armpit. And you mentioned it comes and goes. Have you noticed anything else happening with the discomfort?
PATIENT: Like… what do you mean? Anything else? Um… no, not really. No fever, no… lumps, I don't think. Just the sore feeling. Sometimes I feel tired, but I work hard, so maybe that. I don’t know if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or lumps, and the tiredness could be related to your work. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No. Nothing much. I… I haven't been to the doctor in a long time. I usually just try to tough things out. I'm pretty healthy, I think. My wife… she worries sometimes. But I feel okay most of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re here now if something is concerning you. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. Just… small things. Like a bad flu once, but nothing serious. I usually just rest and get better.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family who has had heart problems, or any kind of chest pain issues?
PATIENT: Um… my dad, he had… high blood pressure, I think. And my grandma… she had something with her heart when she was old. But I don’t really know what it was. It was a long time ago. She passed away when I was young. My mom is still alive, she's okay. No chest pain that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure in your father and some heart issues in your grandmother. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. Just… water, mostly. And sometimes coffee, to help me wake up for work.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications. And you don’t have any allergies to anything, correct?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I can eat anything, I think. My wife makes all kinds of food. Never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So, just to recap, you're a 38-year-old male experiencing intermittent soreness in your left chest, sometimes radiating to your armpit. It doesn’t seem consistently related to lifting, and isn't accompanied by fever or lumps. You have a family history of high blood pressure and some heart issues in your grandmother, but no personal medical history or allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel around your chest to get a better idea of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Sounds good. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. I do feel some tenderness when I press here, but no obvious masses or swelling. Your muscle feels a little tight, but that could be from the lifting you do. I'm going to take your blood pressure now, just to get a baseline. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90. This isn’t necessarily alarming on its own, as it can fluctuate, but it’s something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I think it’s prudent to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying issues. We'll check your cholesterol, electrolytes, and a few other markers. Also, because of the chest pain, I would like to get an EKG to look at your heart's electrical activity. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Blood work and… EKG? Is that… bad? I don't want anything bad. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: No, an EKG isn't bad at all. It's a quick, painless test where we put some stickers on your chest to record your heart's electrical activity. It's just a way to make sure everything is functioning properly. The blood work is pretty standard too, just to get a better overall picture of your health. It's better to be safe and rule things out, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I understand. Safe is good. So… stickers and blood? Yeah, let's do it. When can we get it done?
DOCTOR: Great. We can get the EKG done right here in the office. It will only take a few minutes. And I'll have the lab order sent over for the blood work. You can go to the lab across the street whenever it’s convenient for you. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity, like heavy lifting, for a few days. If you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. No heavy lifting. And go to the emergency room if it gets worse. I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Aron. I’m glad you came in. Let's get this EKG done, and we’ll take it from there.
PATIENT: Okay. This feels… cold. But I'm okay. Just tell me if it's something bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax and breathe normally. This won’t take long. Alright, the EKG shows some minor changes, but nothing immediately concerning. It looks like there's a slight flattening of the waves, which could be due to a number of things, including muscle strain or electrolyte imbalances. It’s not a definitive diagnosis, and that's why we’re getting the blood work. I’ve sent the lab order to the front desk. They’ll give you the paperwork to take across the street. Once you have the results back, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we'll discuss them in detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… minor changes. Not bad. Paperwork… follow-up. Yes, that sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I feel… better knowing what’s going on, even if it’s not a lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aron. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. Remember, if anything changes or gets worse, don't hesitate to go to the emergency room. And please, take it easy for a few days. Here’s the paperwork for the lab. They’re just across the street, and you don’t need an appointment. Once you have the results, give the office a call, and we’ll get you scheduled for a follow-up. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Kamahele. You were very helpful. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aron. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment.
