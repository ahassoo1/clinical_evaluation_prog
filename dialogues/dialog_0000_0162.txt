DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. So, you're here today… tell me what brings you in. Don't leave anything out, no matter how small it seems. I have a limited amount of time, so let's try to be concise, shall we?
PATIENT: Concise is good. Look, it's my stomach. It's…bloated. Just feels full of air, mostly. Been happening for a bit now, I guess. Honestly, I don't really keep track of that sort of thing. It’s uncomfortable, that’s all. Can we just figure out what it is and get it fixed? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: “A bit now,” is not terribly helpful, Mr. Kristofik. But alright. Bloating, you say. And uncomfortable. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't remember. It comes and goes, I suppose. Sometimes it's worse than others. After I eat, maybe? Or sometimes just…randomly. It's just…air. Like I swallowed a balloon. Is that all you need to know? This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: “A waste of time?
PATIENT: Well, yeah. I mean, no offense, but sitting here describing…gas isn't exactly how I want to spend my Saturday. I work hard, you know? Pile driving. It's physical. I don’t have time for…stomach troubles. Can we just skip to the part where you tell me what's wrong and how to fix it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I assure you, I'm a doctor, not a magician. I need information to determine what's going on. "Air" and “randomly” doesn't give me much to work with. When did this start, approximately?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? Months ago, probably. Maybe six? Look, my wife…she handled all this stuff. Appointments, remembering dates…everything. It’s been a year since she passed, and frankly, my brain’s a little…fuzzy. Six months sounds right. Before that, I wasn’t paying attention. Everything was…different then. Can we move on? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: I see. I apologize for your loss, Mr. Kristofik. That would understandably cause some…disorganization. Six months of bloating. Has it been getting progressively worse?
PATIENT: Worse? I don’t know. Sometimes it feels worse, sometimes it doesn't. It's just…there. Like a constant pressure. It doesn't really hurt, just…uncomfortable. Like I need to burp all the time, but can’t. Does that make sense? It’s embarrassing, to be honest. I work with a crew, you know? Not exactly polite dinner conversation.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, just pressure and a feeling of needing to burp. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Definitely no vomiting. I’ve got a strong stomach, believe me. Pile driving isn’t exactly a delicate profession. Nausea…sometimes, maybe. A little queasy after a big meal, but that's it. Everyone feels queasy after a big meal. It's not…constant. And it’s not related to the bloating, necessarily. Look, is this going to require a bunch of tests? I really don’t have the patience for that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Let's do a quick physical exam. I need to listen to your abdomen, and I'll palpate it a little. Just lie back on the table, please. This will only take a few moments. Try to relax. Hmm. Abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. I hear normal bowel sounds, though they are a bit…hypoactive. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just…pressure. Like a balloon, like I said. Feels…full. And it’s kind of…gurgly? Is that normal? This is…awkward. I haven’t had anyone poke at my stomach in a long time. Can we hurry this up? I got things to do. Seriously.
DOCTOR: "Gurgly" is not a medical term, Mr. Kristofik, but I understand. It suggests gas moving through your intestines. You mentioned diet, have you noticed this is triggered by anything specific?
PATIENT: Triggered? No. I eat what I eat. I'm a working man, I don't exactly have a delicate palate. Steak, potatoes, sometimes some vegetables if my cook feels generous. I haven't changed anything. Maybe it's the water? We had some work done on the pipes last month...could that be it? Honestly, I don’t know. I just want this to stop. Is it something serious? Like…cancer or something? My brother…he had stomach problems. It wasn’t good.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your anxiety, especially given your brother's history. It is unlikely to be cancer, based on what you’ve told me so far. However, we need to rule things out. Let's order some blood work to check for basic inflammation and rule out any underlying medical conditions. We will also order a stool test to rule out any infection. Additionally, I recommend a basic metabolic panel to assess kidney and liver function. Do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don't take anything. Never have. Look, more tests? Seriously? Can't you just give me something for the gas? Like, an antacid or something? I don’t want to spend my weekend getting blood drawn and…and collecting samples. This is ridiculous. Fine, do the tests. But if it’s nothing serious, I’m not coming back. I got a job to do. A real job. Not poking and prodding and running tests. What’s the insurance situation on all this? It's private, right? I filled out the forms.
DOCTOR: Yes, your insurance is private, and I have the necessary forms. The tests are standard procedure given your symptoms and history. We need to have a baseline understanding before we can offer treatment. I will write the orders now. The blood work can be done at the lab downstairs, and the stool test kit will be given to you before you leave. Once we have the results, we can discuss next steps. In the meantime, try to avoid carbonated beverages and excessively fatty foods. Those can exacerbate bloating. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Carbonated beverages...fatty foods... Look, I'm a pile driver. What do you think I eat? Fine, I’ll try. But don’t expect miracles. Just get me the paperwork and let me get out of here. The less I have to think about my stomach, the better. How long will it take to get the results? I got a schedule to keep. And can I just pick them up, or do I need another appointment? I swear, if this takes all week…
DOCTOR: The results typically take 3-5 business days. You can access them online through the patient portal, or we can mail them to you. No additional appointment is necessary unless the results are abnormal. Here's the information on how to access the portal. If you experience any worsening symptoms—severe pain, vomiting, fever—go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions?
