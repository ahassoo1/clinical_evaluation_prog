DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it’s this…shaking. My hand, mostly. It's been…a while now, I suppose. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Feels like forever. Just thought I’d get it checked, if that makes sense. Don't want it getting worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Shaking… alright. And is it constant, this shaking, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Hard to say for sure. It’s worse when I… when I try to do things. Like, holding a cup of coffee? Forget about it. It spills everywhere. But sometimes, when I’m just sitting… it’s not so bad. Though, I haven’t been doing much sitting lately, if you catch my drift. Old bones, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. And is this shaking limited to your hands, or do you notice it in other parts of your body as well?
PATIENT: Hmm… good question. I… I haven’t really paid attention, to be honest. Mostly just the hand. Maybe a little in my leg sometimes, but I figured that was just…old age again. It’s hard to tell what’s what these days. Everything feels a bit…loose, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think. Well, I’ve been feeling a bit… tired lately. Just generally worn out. But then again, I’m seventy-nine. And… now that you mention it, my handwriting’s gotten worse. Even worse than usual, I mean. It’s barely legible. But I figured that was just… well, you know. Old age. Is that a symptom? I don't know. Everything's a mess these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, those can be associated. Now, have you noticed any stiffness or pain in your joints?
PATIENT: Stiffness… yeah, a little. Mostly in my fingers, in the mornings. Takes a while to get ‘em moving. Not terrible, though. Just…creaky. Like an old door, you know? Pain… not really. Just a bit achy sometimes, but nothing I can’t ignore. I’ve always been able to tolerate a bit of discomfort. It's probably just the weather. Always blame the weather.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Past medical history… oh boy. That’s a long one. Honestly, Doctor, I don't really remember much of it. I had… something with my heart, a long time ago. They fixed it, I think. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. Does that count? I’ve been to the doctor a few times for…well, just old age stuff. You know, aches and pains, the usual. I’m sorry, I’m just not very good at remembering things these days. My ex-wife used to keep track of all that stuff. She was very organized.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Jezik. We can try to piece things together. Let's see… the record indicates you were treated for atrial fibrillation approximately ten years ago. Do you recall that?
PATIENT: Atrial… fibrillation? Sounds…familiar. Something with my heart, right? Yes, I think…I remember something about that. They gave me some pills, I think. And told me to…watch my diet? I don't really pay attention to those things. It was a long time ago. Did it cause this shaking, do you think? I just want it to stop, Doctor. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It could be related, Mr. Jezik. Atrial fibrillation can sometimes cause tremors. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take… a little blue pill for my blood pressure. And a white one for… something. Honestly, I just take whatever the pharmacist tells me to take. I don't really know what they're for. I have a bag full of them at home. My daughter helps me organize them, but she's busy with her kids. I don't like taking pills, if I'm honest. Makes me feel worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Used to eat everything, anyway. My stomach’s a bit sensitive these days, but that’s probably just old age. I don’t think I’ve ever had a serious allergic reaction. No, I’m pretty sure I don’t have any allergies. Unless you count dust, maybe. Makes me sneeze.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, would you mind if I performed a quick physical examination?
PATIENT: A physical examination…? Oh. Yes, alright. I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… a thing I need to do later. Not important, but… Just try to be gentle, please. Old bones, you know. Everything creaks and pops.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll take a look at your hands and assess your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Sounds… fine. As long as it doesn’t involve needles. I hate needles. Hurry up, please. I'm not good at sitting still for long. And please, don't tell me I need to lose weight. I've heard that one enough times. Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm for me. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s check your pulse… 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to take a look at your hands. I notice a slight tremor in your right hand, more prominent when you extend your arm. Is there any pain associated with this tremor?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just…shaking. It's more annoying than painful, to be honest. Sometimes it feels like my hand has a mind of its own. It's embarrassing when I try to eat soup, or sign my name. It's getting worse, I think. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but within the normal range for your age. Muscle tone is slightly reduced, but again, not significantly concerning. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, consistent with your history of atrial fibrillation. Lungs are clear. Based on my examination, and considering your history and symptoms, it sounds like you are experiencing a tremor, likely exacerbated by your atrial fibrillation. The diminished reflexes and muscle tone could be contributing factors, or simply age-related changes. However, it’s important to rule out other possible causes.
PATIENT: Other causes…? What other causes? Is it something awful? I just want it to stop, Doctor. I don’t want to end up… you know… shaking all the time. Is there anything you can do? Pills? Surgery? Anything? I’m a simple man, Doctor. I just want to be able to hold a cup of coffee without spilling it. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not too much to ask at all. And no, it’s unlikely to be anything awful. There are several possible causes of tremor, and we need to investigate further to determine the exact cause in your case. It could be related to your atrial fibrillation, as we discussed, or it could be something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few tests. First, a blood test to check your thyroid function and rule out any underlying metabolic issues. Second, an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to further assess your heart rhythm. And finally, perhaps a neurological consultation, to rule out any neurological causes of the tremor. As for treatment, it depends on the cause. If it's related to your atrial fibrillation, we can review your current medication regimen to ensure it's optimal. If it's something else, we'll discuss the appropriate treatment options once we have a diagnosis. We'll take it one step at a time, Mr. Jezik. Don't worry. I’ll make sure you get the care you need. I'll write the orders for the blood tests and ECG now. And I’ll give you a referral to a neurologist. .
