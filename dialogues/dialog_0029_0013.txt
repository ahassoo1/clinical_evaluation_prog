DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I'm Dr. Chora. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s…trouble with going to the bathroom, mostly. I don’t… empty it all the way, it feels like. It’s been happenin’ for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty emptying your bladder completely, for about a month. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. It’s not pain, exactly. More like… a weak stream, and then it just… stops. I gotta wait a bit, and then try again to get the rest out. Sometimes it works right away the second time, sometimes it takes a few tries. It’s…frustrating, mostly. And I feel like I’m always going back.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a weak stream, incomplete emptying, and needing to return to the bathroom shortly after finishing. Any straining to start or maintain the stream?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a little bit. I don’t have to, but sometimes I push a little to get things goin’. It’s not bad, not like I’m really fightin’ it, but…yeah. A little push. It's like it needs a little help, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some mild straining. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, smell, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… sometimes it seems a little cloudy. Not always, but… a few times I’ve noticed. And the smell… well, I’m an older man, Doctor. Things smell sometimes! But maybe…a little stronger than usual, on those same days the color was off.
DOCTOR: Alright, cloudy urine and a slightly stronger smell on occasion. Have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No, sir. No fever, no chills. And my back feels alright. No pain there, or anywhere else, really. Just…this bathroom problem. It’s not hurtin’ me, just botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had a little bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor got it under control with some pills. Stopped takin' those a while ago now. Other than that… nothin’ much. I used to be a pretty healthy man. My wife… she handled most of the doctor visits when we were together.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled hypertension in the past. I see. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never had any surgeries. And I haven’t been in the hospital since I was a boy, broke my arm climbin’ a tree. That was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my wife’s folks both had some trouble with their kidneys when they got older. I don’t know all the details, to be honest. They lived far away, and we didn’t talk about that stuff much. And my own parents… they both lived good long lives, but I don’t remember anything specific about medical problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of kidney problems on your wife’s side. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. No allergies that I know of. I can take most anything without a problem. I’ve never had a bad reaction to a pill, or food, or… anything, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don’t take nothin’ regularly. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. And I don’t really take supplements either. I like to keep things simple, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife didn’t like it, and I didn’t want to upset her. I used to have a beer now and then, with dinner, but I haven’t had one in a long time. Not since…well, since she passed. And I definitely don’t use any…recreational drugs. Never had any interest in those.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for sharing that. I see your weight is… significantly lower than it has been in the past. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's true. I have lost some weight. Not on purpose, though. Just… haven't been eatin' like I used to, I guess. It’s hard, bein’ alone. Used to love to cook for my wife, big meals, you know? Now… I mostly just make somethin’ quick. It’s maybe ten or fifteen pounds, over the last few months. It’s not botherin’ me, but I know it’s not ideal.
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss of about ten to fifteen pounds over the last few months. Alright, Mr. Hilber, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your abdomen, check your prostate, and do a quick neurological exam. It’ll help me get a better idea of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are. It's… a little embarrassing, checkin’ the prostate, but I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for your understanding. I'm listening to your abdomen now... sounds are normal. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen…any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not really. Feels normal, I think. A little pressure, but no pain. Just… feels like a belly. I've had this belly for a long time, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Okay, Mr. Hilber, I’m going to perform a digital rectal exam now. This will allow me to feel the size and texture of your prostate. Let me know if you feel any discomfort. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it should be quick. Okay... your prostate feels slightly enlarged and a little firm, but there are no obvious nodules. It's not dramatically enlarged, but it's definitely bigger than ideal. Now, I'll check your reflexes...
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That… wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. A little uncomfortable, yes, but I’ve felt worse. Good to know you didn't find any lumps, though. I appreciate you tellin' me what you're feelin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'd like to check a urine sample to look for infection or other abnormalities. We'll also order some bloodwork - a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to get a better look at your kidney function. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to do. I just want to know what’s wrong, and get it fixed if possible. I can give you a sample right away, if you tell me where to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. There are cups and instructions in there. Just bring the sample back when you’re done, and we’ll get it sent to the lab. While you’re doing that, the nurse will draw your blood. Once we have the results, we’ll be able to discuss a plan. Based on what we’ve discussed and the exam findings, I suspect a few possibilities – benign prostatic hyperplasia , which is common with age, or potentially an early stage of urinary retention. The bloodwork and urine sample will help us narrow it down. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds very reasonable. BPH… that’s what you said? I’ve heard of that, I think. My wife's father had somethin' like that, I believe. So, it's not… serious, necessarily? I appreciate you explainin’ it to me. I’ll go get the sample now. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber. It can be managed, often with medication or lifestyle changes. We'll know more once the lab results come back. Take your time with the sample. The nurse is ready for you when you are finished. I'll be here when you get back.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience.
