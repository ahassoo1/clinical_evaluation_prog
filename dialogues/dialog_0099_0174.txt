DOCTOR: Right. Nani Derasmo, 75 years old. Good. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Overgaard, if I may… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I just… haven’t been myself lately. Everything feels… heavy. I suppose that’s the best way to put it. I haven’t the energy for much of anything anymore, and frankly, it’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: "Heavy," you say. Right. And how long has this "heaviness" been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. Perhaps… six months now? It started gradually, just a lack of interest in things I used to enjoy. My garden, for example. Used to spend hours out there. Now… it just feels like a chore. And then it just… worsened. It's a bit embarrassing to admit, but even getting out of bed is an effort some days.
DOCTOR: Six months. And has anything specific happened in the last six months that might coincide with this?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specific… well, my grandson, David, moved to Canada. He's a good boy, always was, but… it’s just different without him nearby. And then there was the… well, the anniversary of my divorce. That was in March, I believe. It's been… quite a few years, but it still stings sometimes, you know? Nothing terribly dramatic, but life has just felt… emptier, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Grandson moving, anniversary… emotional things. Alright. And besides the lack of energy and feeling “heavy,” are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, my appetite hasn’t been very good. I used to enjoy cooking, big family meals, but now… I often skip lunch. And I haven’t been sleeping properly. I wake up several times during the night, just… restless. Sometimes I cry, though I don’t usually tell anyone that. It's a silly thing for an old woman to be upset over. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: "Silly"?
PATIENT: Oh, don't misunderstand me, Doctor. It’s not that I think it is silly, exactly. Just… I’ve always been a strong woman, you see? Independent. Complaining feels… undignified. It's just not in my nature, I suppose. But I know something isn't right, and that's why I’m here, isn't it? I just… don't want to bother you with trivial matters.
DOCTOR: "Trivial matters?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I didn't mean to imply… it’s just, you see so many people, I imagine, with real problems. I don’t want to take up your valuable time. It’s just… a general feeling of sadness, really. A lack of… joy. Is that enough to trouble a doctor? I apologize for being so vague. I haven't been feeling quite myself, as I've said. Perhaps I should just try to pull myself together.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get a bit more specific. You mentioned appetite and sleep. Are you losing weight unintentionally?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I believe so. My clothes feel a bit looser, though I haven't actually weighed myself recently. My daughter, Ifiok, commented on it when she visited last month. She’s a worrywart, that girl, but she did notice. She suggested I see a doctor, of course. A good girl, Ifiok is. Very observant. Now that I think about it, I haven't been going to my usual exercise classes either. Too tired, you see. It’s a vicious cycle, I suppose.
DOCTOR: And any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Now you’re asking things I don’t usually discuss with… well, anyone. I suppose… they’ve been a little irregular. Nothing terribly alarming, but… yes, definitely a change. It’s probably just my age, isn't it? Old bodies do strange things, I imagine. Please, Doctor, I’m not one for dwelling on such… details. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mrs. Derasmo. We need to rule things out. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh! Doctor, really! That’s… a very personal question! I… I haven’t checked! I don’t check such things! I… goodness, this is quite distressing. I came here because I was feeling sad, not to discuss… bodily functions! Perhaps I’ve made a mistake coming here. I think I need a glass of water.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Here. . Let’s step back for a moment. You're right, we're getting into…details. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s better. Yes, I am. I take medication for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And something for my arthritis, Celecoxib. My general practitioner prescribes them. I've been taking them for… oh, goodness, five years now, maybe longer. I can’t quite recall. I take them as directed, I assure you. Though sometimes… I forget. Just occasionally. But I try my best. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril and Celecoxib. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. She was a very practical woman, my mother. Always sensible. No allergies, Doctor. None at all. I can eat anything, take anything… though, to be honest, I haven’t much appetite for either these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I want to feel your abdomen. It’s just routine, Mrs. Derasmo. And I'm going to check your reflexes. Can you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh… must I? I wasn't expecting a physical exam. I thought we were just… talking. I'm not very good with doctors poking and prodding, you see. I’m a bit… sensitive. But… Very well, Doctor. If you insist. But please be gentle. And try not to take too long. I have a garden that needs tending, you know. It's probably full of weeds by now.
DOCTOR: Right. If you’ll just lie down on your back, please. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, though slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, but I do detect some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No palpable masses. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a little uncomfortable. Not terribly painful, but… sensitive, as I said. It’s probably just my age, Doctor. Everything feels a bit… achy these days. And please, be careful. I bruise easily. My daughter always tells me I’m too delicate for my own good. And… Are you finished now? I’m not fond of being poked and prodded, you see. It makes me feel… vulnerable.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it could be a number of things. However, given your age, symptoms, and the mild tenderness I detected, I'm concerned about the possibility of anemia or… something more serious. We need to run some blood tests to rule things out. I'm also going to order a stool test to check for any hidden blood. I'll have the nurse draw the blood samples and collect a stool sample before you leave. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Anemia? Something… serious? I… I don't like the sound of that, Doctor. I just wanted someone to tell me why I was feeling so sad, so tired. I didn't want… tests and… potential illness. Is it… is it bad? Must I have more poking and prodding? I thought I was just a bit… low-spirited. This is all very overwhelming. And… stool test? Oh, dear. I don't think I can… I don't think I can do all of this. Perhaps I should just… go home and try to rest. Perhaps it will pass.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Derasmo, you came here because you weren't feeling well. I'm obligated to investigate why. Dismissing your symptoms and hoping they "pass" is not a responsible course of action. I understand it's unpleasant, but these tests are necessary. We need to rule things out. The nurse will explain everything. They're very good at what they do. And frankly, worrying about the tests is far worse than taking the tests. I'll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available. We'll discuss them then. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… very well, Doctor. If you insist. But please… be gentle with the nurse. And try not to make me talk about… unpleasant things. I’m an old woman, you see. I’ve lived a long life. I don’t need… complications. Just… tell me when to go. And please, don’t expect me to be cheerful. I just want to go home and… and be left alone. This is all very… distressing. Perhaps… perhaps my grandson is right. Perhaps I should move to Canada. At least there, I wouldn't have to worry about doctors and… tests.
