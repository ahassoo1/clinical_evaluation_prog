DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally, for a few months now. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a bit. It’s getting noticeable, and frankly, it's a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids… alright. A few months, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about three or four months now, I’d say. It started slowly, just feeling a bit more tired than usual. But it’s been getting progressively worse. It’s not like a sudden thing, thankfully. More… a gradual decline. And the eyelids… they’re definitely more noticeable now than they were a month ago. I find myself having to lift them a little to keep my eyes open properly. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And is this weakness generalized, or is it more pronounced in certain muscle groups?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I… I hadn’t really thought of it in those terms. I suppose it’s… everywhere, a little. But if I had to pick, it’s more in my arms and legs, I think. Carrying things feels harder, and I get tired walking longer distances. Though, even things like holding my head up for too long can be tiring now, which is… unusual. Is that helpful? I'm not very good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: It is… marginally. And have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… let me think. No, not really. Everything seems clear enough. Though, now that you mention it, sometimes things look a little… double? It's fleeting, and I thought it was just because I was tired, to be honest. It doesn't happen all the time. Just occasionally, especially at the end of the day. I haven’t been wearing glasses for anything like that, though. I had my eyes checked a few years back and they were fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your voice?
PATIENT: No, no difficulty swallowing. And my voice… I don’t think so? I haven’t noticed anything different there. My ex-wife would certainly have noticed if my voice had changed, and she’s very observant, let me tell you. So, I’m fairly confident about that. It's just the weakness and the eyelids, really. And the occasional blurry vision, but I don't want to make too much of that.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t have a lot of one, thankfully. I broke my arm when I was a child, playing football, but that healed fine. And I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, rubella, that sort of thing. But nothing major. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, nothing like that. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. That’s part of why this is so… unsettling. I don't usually get sick, and when I do, it’s usually just a cold. I'm 25, you see. I shouldn't be feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of neurological disorders or muscle weakness?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one. My mother's side… there was my great-uncle, I think, who had some sort of… muscle problem? It was a long time ago, and my mother didn’t talk about it much. I think he needed help with walking in his later years. But I don't know the specifics. My father’s side… no, as far as I know, everyone was perfectly healthy. I haven't asked much about it, if I'm being honest. Family get-togethers weren't… frequent. It’s possible there’s something, but I genuinely don't know.
DOCTOR: And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Social history. Well… I’m divorced. As I mentioned before, my ex-wife is very observant. We separated about six months ago. I work as a facilities manager, mostly office buildings, making sure everything runs smoothly. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I don’t really have any hobbies, to be honest. I mostly just… work. It’s not a very exciting life, I suppose. I don’t travel much, either. Just the occasional trip to visit friends, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: And finally, any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, as far as I know. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. I'm not a fussy eater. I haven't needed to take any medication regularly for years, aside from the occasional painkiller for a headache, but even those haven’t bothered me. I really don't think I have any allergies. I wish I had something to tell you, honestly, but I just don’t. This is… frustrating, isn't it? Being unwell without knowing why.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. Alright, Mr. Schaust. I’m going to conduct a brief physical examination. I’ll need you to follow my instructions as closely as possible. First, I’m going to check your vital signs, and then I’ll assess your cranial nerves, motor strength, reflexes, and coordination. This will give me a better understanding of what’s going on. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… thorough. I’ll do my best to follow your instructions. Just let me know if there’s anything specific I need to do. And please, don’t hesitate to tell me if anything feels wrong. I'm ready when you are. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest, but I’m trusting you to figure this out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s check your temperature. 98.6 Fahrenheit. Normal. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Now, I'm going to test your extraocular movements. Follow my finger with your eyes, but keep your head still. Good. Now, I'm going to assess your facial strength. Can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There you go. Is that alright? It feels a little… tight, on one side, maybe? Hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Now, can you furrow your brow?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… difficult. It feels like one side isn't working as well as the other.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to check your tongue. Can you stick it out for me?
PATIENT: Like that? It feels… a little weird. It doesn’t feel completely straight, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to assess your shoulder and arm strength. Can you resist as I try to push your arm down?
PATIENT: Okay… I’m trying. It feels… difficult. It’s not as strong as it usually is, I think.
DOCTOR: And now the other arm. Hmm. There's a noticeable difference in strength between both sides. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are slightly diminished in both arms and legs. Now, let's assess your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: That… wasn’t very smooth, was it? It feels like my hand isn’t listening to my brain properly.
DOCTOR: No, it wasn’t. Alright, Mr. Schaust. That completes the physical exam. Based on my examination, you're exhibiting signs of weakness, facial asymmetry, diminished reflexes, and ataxia. Your vital signs are normal, which is… less concerning, but these neurological findings are significant. I need to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also want to order an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I’m concerned about the possibility of a neurological disorder.
PATIENT: Neurological… disorder? What… what kind of disorder? Is it… serious? I mean, I understand you need more tests, but… is there anything you can tell me now? Is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schaust, it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. There are several possibilities, ranging in severity. These symptoms could be indicative of something relatively benign, but they could also be a sign of a more serious condition like multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, or even a brain tumor, although I want to stress those are just possibilities at this stage. The blood work and MRI are crucial to determine the underlying cause. I want to be upfront with you: these symptoms warrant investigation. It’s better to be thorough and rule things out than to ignore them. I’m going to order these tests immediately. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity and contact me immediately if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new ones. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No… no, not really. I mean… when will I get the results? And what happens if… if it is something serious? What are the treatment options? Is there anything I should be doing now… besides avoiding strenuous activity? Will these tests… will they be able to tell me definitively what’s wrong? Or will I just have more tests after these?
DOCTOR: The blood work results should be back within 24-48 hours. The MRI will take a bit longer, usually 3-5 business days, depending on availability and the radiologist's schedule. Regarding treatment, that depends entirely on the diagnosis. For some conditions, there are highly effective medications available. For others, physical therapy and lifestyle adjustments may be the primary course of action. And, unfortunately, some conditions are more difficult to treat. The MRI is the key. It will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on in your brain and help us narrow down the possibilities. It is highly likely we will need further testing, even with the MRI results, but it is the most definitive imaging study we can currently order. In the meantime, focus on resting and avoiding anything that exacerbates your symptoms. I would also recommend avoiding making any major life decisions until we have a diagnosis. Do you have any family members or friends you can lean on for support?
PATIENT: No… not really. My ex-wife… we’re not on good terms. And I don’t have a lot of close friends. I mostly keep to myself. So… I just wait. And try not to panic. What… what if the MRI shows something really bad? What happens then? Is there… a specialist I would see? A neurologist, I suppose?
DOCTOR: Yes, if the MRI reveals a concerning finding, I will immediately refer you to a neurologist. They are the specialists in diagnosing and treating neurological disorders. They will conduct further testing, review your medical history, and discuss the best course of treatment with you. I understand this is a frightening situation, and waiting is difficult. I want to assure you I will be with you every step of the way. I will personally contact you as soon as the results are available and discuss them with you in detail. I'm going to write a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected neurologist in the area. Her contact information is on the paperwork I’m giving you now. Do you have any questions about the referral process or the paperwork?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. It’s just… a lot to take in. So… I just wait for the call. And try to stay calm. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Schaust. Remember, I’m here if you have any questions or concerns before the results are back. Don't hesitate to call my office. And please, try to focus on taking care of yourself. I’ll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT:
