DOCTOR: Good morning, Lacreasha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Neeraj Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin'. Uh, my nails. They look… funny. Not good funny. Just… different. I don’t really do doctor visits, if you know what I mean. They just kinda… changed. I don’t even know why I’m here, really. Medicare said I should get ‘em checked.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. That's fair enough – it's good you're getting it checked out, even if it feels a bit odd. Nails changing can be a lot of things, some simple, some not so simple. And it’s always best to rule things out. So, when did you first notice these changes?
PATIENT: Umm… a while. Honestly, I don't keep track of dates. Maybe… spring? Or was it summer? Everything kinda blends together. They weren’t this bad then, just… not as nice. They used to be… shinier, I think. Now they're kinda… dull and spotty. And one of ‘em feels a little… thick, maybe? I don't know. I don't look at my hands much.
DOCTOR: Okay, spring or summer, so a few months then. Dull and spotty, and one feels thicker… that’s helpful. And you said “not as nice” before – can you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Well, they just look… old, I guess. Like an old lady’s nails. Not like… my nails. I used to… I don’t know. They just looked better. Younger. Is that weird to say? They definitely weren’t all… bumpy like this one. See? This one's the worst.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not weird at all to say. It’s good you’re noticing a change that concerns you. Let’s take a closer look. Okay, I see what you mean. There's some discoloration, and yes, some ridging and thickening on this index finger. Is it painful at all when I press on it?
PATIENT: Nope. Doesn't hurt. A little… sensitive maybe? But not pain. I mean, it's a nail. It shouldn't hurt to touch it, should it? I don’t really do things with my hands. Not much. So, it's not like I'm using it for anything important.
DOCTOR: Good to know it's not painful. Sensitivity is worth noting, though. Okay, let's have a look at the other nails. Alright, I’ve had a quick look. It seems like a few of them are a little bit discolored, and the texture isn’t quite as smooth as it should be. Do you notice any changes to the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Around ‘em? Hmm… Not really. Maybe a little red sometimes? But I wash my hands a lot, so it's probably just from the water. I use that… that pink soap. You know, the one that smells like flowers. It's kinda drying, I think. But it smells nice. I don’t notice anything wrong wrong, just… normal hand skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little redness, possibly from the soap. That's good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes to your overall health recently?
PATIENT: Overall health? I feel… okay. Same as always, I guess. A little tired sometimes. But who isn’t? I mostly just… sit. My job doesn’t require a lot of… moving. I don’t really eat much either. Not when I’m busy. I don't think anything's different different.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Ummm… no. Not that I know of. I don’t really eat fancy stuff. Mostly just… toast. And sometimes soup. I don’t take any pills, either. Never really needed to.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. No known allergies or medications. Now, do you have any family history of nail changes, or any other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a hard one. My family... well, they're not really around much anymore. Lots of… far away places. My grandma… she had… something with her feet. But I don’t remember what. And my uncle… he always complained about his hands being cold. But that’s all I really know. They didn’t really talk about… health stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. That gives us a little something to work with. Now, one final question before we move on. Do you work with any chemicals or materials that could potentially affect your nails?
PATIENT: Chemicals? No. I'm an audiologist. I work with… ears. And machines that help people hear. Not chemicals. Mostly just… cleaning solutions for the ear pieces. But I wear gloves, always. Never touch anything with my bare hands.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful. So, no chemicals, gloves are used, and you work with ears, not hands. Okay. Right. Based on what you've told me, and after a quick look at your records, it’s good you came in. The changes you’re describing – the discoloration, thickening, and ridging – could be a number of things. It could be something simple like a fungal infection, or it could be related to a nutritional deficiency or something else entirely. To get a better idea of what's going on, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh. That sounds… complicated. What kind of tests? Do they hurt? I don’t really like needles. And I don’t have a lot of time, you know. But, I guess if Medicare’s payin' for it… okay. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And no needles, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to make this as quick and painless as possible. There won't be any needles involved for these tests. We’ll take a small scraping from underneath one of your nails – the index finger, the one that's the most affected – to check for a fungal infection. That’s a quick, painless procedure. We’ll also order a blood test to check your vitamin levels and rule out any nutritional deficiencies. That one will involve a needle, but it’s a routine blood draw, and we can make it as comfortable as possible. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A scraping… that doesn’t sound too bad. Like a… file? And the blood test… I really don’t like needles. But, I guess it’s gotta be done, huh? If you say it’s routine. Is it gonna hurt a lot? And how long will it take to get the results? I have… appointments. Lots of them.
DOCTOR: It’s a very gentle scraping, more like buffing the nail than filing. And the blood test… yes, it’s a small pinch, but it’s very quick. We’ll have the results back within about a week to ten days. We can call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend keeping your nails trimmed and dry, and avoiding harsh chemicals or polishes. We'll get this figured out. Would you like me to go ahead and order those tests for you?
PATIENT: Okay. Trimmed and dry. I can do that. And a week to ten days… alright. Less than a month, anyway. Go ahead and order ‘em. Get it over with. Maybe I’ll just… sit here while you do it? I don’t wanna wander around. And try not to poke me too much with the… whatever you use for the scraping.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No poking, I promise. Alright, the orders are placed. I’ll have the lab technician come in and take the nail scraping first, and then you can head over to the lab for the blood draw. They’re just down the hall, room 203. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: Room 203… okay. Will they… you know. Will they ask me a lot of questions? I don’t like questions. And is it gonna take long? I have a lunch date. Sort of. It’s more of a… coffee meeting. But still. I don’t wanna be late.
DOCTOR: They’ll ask you some basic identifying questions – name, date of birth, insurance information – just standard procedure. They might ask about any medications you're taking, but you’ve already told me you're not taking any, so that shouldn't be a problem. The blood draw itself shouldn’t take more than ten to fifteen minutes, and the whole process – including filling out any paperwork – shouldn't take more than half an hour. You should have plenty of time for your coffee meeting. I’ll have the lab technician come in now. Just relax, and they’ll take good care of you. Do you need help getting to the lab?
PATIENT: Nah, I’m good. Room 203, right? I can find it. Thanks. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long for the results, okay? And no scary questions.
DOCTOR: Definitely. I’ll make sure the results are sent to you as quickly as possible. And no scary questions, I promise. You just head down the hall to room 203, and they’ll take care of everything. Let me know if you have any trouble finding it. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good coffee meeting!
PATIENT: Okay. Thanks.
