DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Honestly, I don't quite know why I'm here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Something about… not wanting me to "give up" on things. I'm perfectly fine, you know. My feet ache a little, what else is new? I've had feet for eighty-three years!
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s always good to be proactive, I suppose. Although, frankly, I have patients much younger than eighty-three with legitimate concerns. But, your daughter seems attentive. Let’s humor her, shall we?
PATIENT: Humor her? Oh, she always has an opinion. A very strong one, at that. She worries too much, that girl. Always has. I told her I didn’t need a doctor poking and prodding at my feet. It’s not like they're going to magically get better, you know? What even is a podiatrist anyway? Is that some newfangled name for a foot doctor?
DOCTOR: A podiatrist is a foot doctor, yes. A specialist. And while I am perfectly capable of addressing basic foot complaints, if it's been bothering you enough for your daughter to drag you in here, we should at least get a proper history. Now, this aching… is it constant?
PATIENT: Constant? Heavens, no. It comes and goes, like everything else, doesn't it? Some days are better than others. Mostly it’s just… there. A dull throb, you know? Not sharp or anything. I've lived a long life, dear. I've had aches and pains in places I didn't even know had places! It's just part of getting old, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. “Just part of getting old.” That's what a lot of people say. But “just” can sometimes mask something more. When you say it comes and goes, can you pinpoint anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm… well, standing for too long, I suppose. Especially on hard floors. And… shoes, definitely shoes. All these modern shoes, they’re just not made like they used to be. Give me a good pair of sensible flats any day. Though even those don't always help, truth be told. Honestly, I think it’s just the bones complaining.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look, then. I'll need you to remove your shoes and socks. And please, try not to tell me your bones are just "complaining." That doesn’t really give me much to work with. I need to see what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to see? After all that talk about me not needing a doctor? Fine, fine. Don’t rush me, dear, I’m not as spry as I used to be. Honestly, the things I do for that daughter of mine… You’d think I was a fragile porcelain doll, the way she carries on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look. Please point to where it hurts the most. And try to describe the sensation – is it a throbbing pain, a burning, a numbness?
PATIENT: Right here, mostly. Though it sort of radiates, you know? It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More like a… heavy ache. A dull throb, like someone’s pressing down. And sometimes, if I’ve been on my feet all day, it feels… swollen. Not visibly swollen, but… full. Like it's too tight in the shoe. You're not going to poke me too hard, are you? I don’t have a high pain tolerance, you know.
DOCTOR: No, I won’t “poke” you. I'm just assessing the area. And I need you to be honest with me, even if it’s slightly uncomfortable. Now, is it painful to move your toes up and down?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a little tender, yes. Not agony, but… noticeable. And moving my toes… It’s not the moving so much as the… stretching. It feels tight, like something's pulling. Honestly, it probably just needs a good massage. Back in my day, people didn’t run to doctors for every little ache and pain.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And do you have any history of plantar fasciitis, or any other foot problems?
PATIENT: Plantar… what-now? Heavens, no. I don’t go around memorizing fancy medical terms, dear. I’ve had bunions, I suppose, like most women my age. And corns, plenty of those. But nothing serious, nothing that required a… specialist. Honestly, I think my feet have just seen better days. They've carried me a long way, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, based on the exam, it could be plantar fasciitis, or possibly some early signs of arthritis. The tenderness along the arch and the tightness are consistent with that. But we need to rule out other things. I'm going to order some x-rays, just to get a better look at the bone structure and rule out any fractures or significant joint damage. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-rays? Oh, dear. More poking and prodding? Honestly, all this fuss over a little foot pain. I suppose if you insist. But I don't want any unnecessary radiation, you hear? My daughter would have a fit. And I don’t want to be spending all day in some sterile hospital room. How long will this take? And will it be comfortable?
DOCTOR: It's a very quick procedure, Ms. Gunasekara. A few minutes, at most. The amount of radiation is minimal – far less than you get from a cross-country flight, honestly. And you’ll be seated, it won’t be uncomfortable. We have a technician who's very good with patients. Now, while we wait for the results, I'm also going to recommend you try some over-the-counter arch supports in your shoes. And avoid wearing completely flat shoes. Is that something you’re willing to try?
PATIENT: Arch supports… Honestly, I’ve tried those before. They never seem to fit right. Always too bulky, always uncomfortable. But… alright. Fine. I’ll try your arch supports. But if they don’t work, don’t expect me to come crawling back. And please tell that technician to be gentle. I’m not made of iron, you know. And no unnecessary probing, promise me.
DOCTOR: I promise, Ms. Gunasekara. No unnecessary probing. I’ll send you down to radiology now, and then we can discuss the results when we have them. It should be a relatively quick process. Do you have any questions before I send you on your way?
PATIENT: Hmm… Will my insurance cover all of this? Medicare, you know. They’re very particular about what they’ll pay for these days. And… will I be able to drive myself home? I don’t want to bother my daughter if I can avoid it. She's been rather busy lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover the x-rays and the office visit. We have a dedicated billing department that will handle everything. And yes, you should be perfectly fine to drive yourself home, assuming you don't experience any significant pain or discomfort afterwards. But if you do feel lightheaded or unsteady, please ask someone for a ride. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Alright, good. That's a weight off my mind. Honestly, the paperwork alone is enough to give anyone a headache. No, I think that’s all for now. Just… please don’t keep me waiting too long for the results. I have a bridge game on Thursday, and I can’t miss that. Lead the way, dear. And remind that technician again… gentle hands, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. Gentle hands. I’ll personally let the radiology technician know. Let’s get you down there now. It shouldn't be a long wait. This way. .
PATIENT: .
