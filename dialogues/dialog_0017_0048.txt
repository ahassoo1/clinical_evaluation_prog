DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste time. You're 66 years old… Medicare, alright. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s these… episodes. My wife, she’s been worried, says I get… mixed up. Can’t always remember what day it is, or where I put things. It’s not that bad, but she insists. It's just… frustrating, you know? I've always been a sharp man.
DOCTOR: "Episodes," you say. And your wife is concerned about… memory lapses, specifically?
PATIENT: Lapses is… a polite way to put it. More like… moments where I just… don’t quite connect. Like the other day, I went to the shed for the trowel, ended up looking for my glasses. They were on my head! It's embarrassing, really. And I’m a tile setter, Doctor! I need to remember things, precise measurements, where the cuts go. It's my livelihood.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Let's try to be systematic. When did these "moments" begin?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It’s not like they started on a specific date, you know? It's been… gradual, I suppose. Maybe six months ago? It started with forgetting little things, names of customers, what I had for breakfast. Now… well, now it's a bit more noticeable. My wife says it’s been worse the last month or so. She's got a good memory, that woman. Better than mine, certainly.
DOCTOR: And has anything changed in the last six months, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean? Life changes, Doctor. I’m getting older, isn’t that enough of a change? No, nothing specific. Same work, same routine. Same wife nagging me about my tools. No, nothing out of the ordinary. Except for these… episodes. And honestly, I think she worries too much. A little forgetfulness is normal, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Let’s move on. Any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches? No, not really. A little tension sometimes, from bending over all day, but nothing a good rest can't fix. I don't get those throbbing, pounding headaches some people complain about. No, no headaches. And please, Doctor, I'm a practical man. I don't have time for fancy illnesses. Just tell me if it's something serious or if my wife is just being… dramatic.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? Well… now that you mention it, things haven't been as sharp lately. I just figured it was my eyes getting old. I work with small tiles, very detailed work, you see? It's hard to notice subtle changes. My wife keeps telling me to get my eyes checked, but I haven't gotten around to it. It’s probably nothing. A little blurriness, maybe. It doesn’t affect my work… much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any difficulty speaking?
PATIENT: Difficulty speaking? No, I don't think so. I'm talking to you perfectly fine, aren’t I? I’ve never had trouble expressing myself. Although… sometimes I stumble over words, but that’s just… a normal thing, isn’t it? Everyone does that. My wife hasn’t said anything about that. She'd be the first to complain if I was slurring my speech or something. She’s got a good ear for these things.
DOCTOR: And any weakness or numbness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, no weakness. I'm still hauling bags of cement, still kneeling all day. My knees ache, of course, but that's from the work, not some… weakness. No numbness either. I can feel everything just fine. I am a tile setter, Doctor. I need to be strong and steady. This job requires physical strength, you know? I wouldn't be able to do it if I had weakness or numbness. Perfectly capable, still.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed to a brief physical examination, then. Perhaps we can determine if this is simply age-related concerns, or something more… concerning. Please follow my instructions. I’ll start with your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes, alright. Fine. Just get it over with. My time is valuable, you know. Though I doubt poking my knees will tell you much. I've always been a healthy man. Good Khmer blood, strong and resilient. Just do it quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Patellar reflexes are diminished bilaterally, but within normal limits for your age. Grip strength is adequate. Range of motion is… acceptable. No obvious weakness or asymmetry noted. Now, I’m going to check your cranial nerves. Follow my pen with your eyes. Don't blink.
PATIENT: Cranial nerves? Honestly, Doctor, this feels… excessive. I'm a tile setter, not a test subject. I'm following the pen. It's just a pen. Get on with it. Though I must say, this room is rather… bright. Perhaps that’s affecting my focus.
DOCTOR: Adequate extraocular movements, though slight difficulty with convergence. Maintain your balance, please. Hmm. Slight instability noted. Mr. Lason, I am concerned. While some of these findings are consistent with age, the instability and difficulty with convergence are… noteworthy. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying deficiencies. And I recommend a full neurological evaluation with a specialist. It's better to be thorough.
PATIENT: Neurological evaluation? Blood work? Doctor, are you saying there’s something wrong with me? I told you, it’s just a little forgetfulness. My wife worries too much. I don't need a specialist poking around in my brain. And blood work? I'm a healthy man! I eat rice and fish, work hard every day. This is… unnecessary. Honestly, I think you’re overreacting. Is this about the insurance? Is Medicare going to cover all this… fuss?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, my concern is for your wellbeing, not insurance protocols. While I understand your skepticism, dismissing potential issues based solely on your perception is… unwise. The neurological evaluation will help determine if there is any underlying cause for your symptoms. The blood work will rule out deficiencies that can contribute to cognitive decline. It's a standard procedure. I will order both. And frankly, your initial dismissiveness and attempts to attribute this to your wife’s “worrying” are… concerning in themselves. I am recommending this regardless of insurance coverage. This is about providing the best possible care. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do your tests. But don’t expect anything. It’s just… getting old, that's all. Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never had any problems with medications. Maybe a little stomach upset sometimes, but nothing serious. My wife handles all that. She's good with pills and things. I just want to get this over with and go back to work. All this… fuss is making my head spin. Honestly, I think a good rest would do me more good than all these tests and specialists.
DOCTOR: Very well. I am ordering a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a Vitamin B12 level. I will also provide a referral to Dr. Emily Carter, a neurologist specializing in geriatric cognitive function. She will schedule a full evaluation. Here are the lab requisition forms and the neurology referral. Please schedule an appointment with Dr. Carter as soon as possible. I strongly advise you to follow through with these recommendations. Ignoring these symptoms will not make them disappear. I will also send a note to your primary care physician. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. I’ll… schedule the appointment. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time and money. My wife will be pleased, of course. She always wants me to see doctors. Just… send me the bill, and I'll deal with Medicare. I have other things to worry about. Is that it? Can I go now? I have tiles to lay. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Lason, you may leave. However, I strongly urge you to take this seriously. If you experience any sudden changes in your vision, speech, or balance, seek immediate medical attention. Some people… .
