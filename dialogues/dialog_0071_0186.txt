DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I’m Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a check-up, really. For a team tryout. Gotta make sure I’m still good to go, you know? Old bones need looking at sometimes. Don’t want to pull anything before I even start.
DOCTOR: Right, a team tryout. Good idea to get things checked out beforehand. Just to be thorough, can you tell me a little more about what you mean by “good to go”?
PATIENT: Well, it's a… a semi-pro wrestling team. Mostly local stuff, but still. I'm… 62, as you can see. Need to know my joints are alright, no old injuries flaring up. I mostly do throws and grappling, not a lot of high-impact stuff anymore. But you gotta be able to move, you know? Don't want to be slow.
DOCTOR: Wrestling, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. Been doing it on and off for… a long time. Mostly just to stay in shape, honestly. Keeps me young, or at least, younger than I am. Is there… a standard thing you do for athletes? Like, a bunch of tests? I'm not really sure what to expect.
DOCTOR: Well, we usually do a full physical, go over your medical history, and depending on what we find, maybe some bloodwork or imaging. We’ll definitely check your joints, range of motion, and strength. Have you had any recent injuries, or any pain you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: No major injuries lately, thankfully. My shoulder gets a little stiff sometimes, but that's just… old age creeping in, I guess. Nothing that stops me from training, but it pops a little when I reach over. And my knees… well, they remind me it's raining, even when it's sunny. Just aches, you know? Nothing serious. Been icing them after practice.
DOCTOR: Alright, shoulder stiffness and “raining knees.” We’ll take a look at those. Just to get a complete picture, have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No surgeries, no. Hospitalized… when I was a kid, I broke my arm falling out of a tree. That was… a long time ago. Nothing since. No serious illnesses, either. Just the usual colds and flu. I try to stay healthy. Lots of… well, not a lot, but some vegetables. And I don’t smoke. Or drink much, really.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty lucky, I think. Or maybe I just haven't found the thing that bothers me yet.
DOCTOR: Well, that simplifies things. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just… ibuprofen, sometimes. When my knees are really complaining. Otherwise, no. Nothing regular. And I don't take anything fancy, just the basic stuff you can get at the drugstore.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sounds good. Whatever you need. Just… try not to pull anything on me, okay? Old man's bones, you know.
DOCTOR: I'll be as gentle as possible, I promise. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Then we'll move onto a quick look at your joints and range of motion. Blood pressure is 130 over 80… pulse is 72 and regular. Not bad at all. Now, can you just raise your arms above your head for me?
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. There. A little creaky, but they go up. I guess. Is that… bad? It doesn't hurt, exactly, just… feels old.
DOCTOR: A little creakiness is understandable. I'm feeling some mild tenderness in the rotator cuff. No obvious swelling or deformity. Can you rotate your arms inwards and outwards for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… that’s where it gets a bit stiff. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a pulling sensation. And the range of motion isn’t what it used to be, I guess. Not as smooth as it should be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your knees… can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: There. That's… that's the rain you were talking about. They bend, but they're not happy about it. And yeah, there's a little bit of a pop sometimes. It doesn’t hurt hurt, but I can feel it. Like little pebbles rubbing together.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm noting some crepitus in both knees and mild tenderness along the joint line. Your gait appears stable, but I do notice a slight limitation in your range of motion. Given your age and activity level, and the findings of my exam, I think it would be prudent to order some X-rays of both knees and your shoulder. This will help us to assess the underlying cause of your discomfort and rule out any significant structural damage. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. X-rays. Better to know what we're dealing with, I guess. I don't want to mess anything up before the tryout. When can I get those done? And… will they tell me if I'm too old for this wrestling stuff?
DOCTOR: We can get those ordered right away. I'll write you a referral to the imaging center down the street. They usually can get you in the same day or tomorrow. As for whether you’re too old… the X-rays won't tell us that directly. They'll show us the condition of your joints, and we can discuss your options based on those results. We’ll look at the level of arthritis, if any, and see if physical therapy or other interventions might be helpful. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have to stop wrestling, but we need to be realistic about your limitations. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's… fair enough. Realistic limitations. I can live with that. Physical therapy… okay. I guess I can try that. So, the referral… do I need to call ahead? And how long do the results usually take? I'm hoping to start training again soon.
DOCTOR: Here you go. Yes, it's best to call ahead to schedule an appointment. The number is on the form. As for the results, they usually take 24-48 hours to get back to us. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that causes you pain. We can discuss a potential physical therapy plan once we have the results. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thanks, Doctor. You've been… thorough. And realistic, which I appreciate. Hopefully, the X-rays don't show anything too scary. I'll call the imaging center right away.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kingan. I hope so too. Just remember to listen to your body and take things slow. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and good luck with your tryout!
PATIENT: Thanks again, Doctor. You too.
