DOCTOR: Right. Sharifa Firestone, 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's my legs, Doctor. They just…gave out. Not all at once, you understand. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a nasty cold. Felt like jelly, they did. Just wouldn’t hold me up properly. It's very inconvenient, let me tell you. I'm a tour guide, you see, and you can't exactly guide a tour if you can't stand.
DOCTOR: A cold, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a very unpleasant one. Runny nose, sore throat, the whole bit. Nothing I haven’t dealt with before, honestly. But this weakness…that’s new. It’s both legs, and it’s…difficult to explain. They feel weak, and kind of tingly sometimes. It’s not a pain, exactly, more like…not there. Do you understand? It’s just…not reliable. I keep expecting them to buckle.
DOCTOR: Right. Tingling. And this started after the cold resolved?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely after. The cold was gone, I thought I was in the clear, and then, boom. Weakness. Honestly, I thought maybe I hadn’t gotten enough rest while I was sick, but it hasn't improved with a few days of taking it easy. I do try to keep up with things, you know? I'm not one to complain, but this is really putting a strain on everything. Especially my schedule. People are relying on me.
DOCTOR: And what exactly do you do as a tour guide?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I lead walking tours of the historical district. Mostly downtown. It involves a lot of pointing, explaining, and…walking, naturally. It’s a very active job. I also do some bus tours, but I prefer the walking ones. Keeps people engaged, you know? I specialize in the architecture and local legends. It’s quite a prestigious position, really. I’ve built up a good reputation over the years. It’s not just a job, it’s…important. And difficult to do when your legs won't cooperate.
DOCTOR: Right. So, significant ambulation. Any history of…falls?
PATIENT: Falls? No, not exactly falls. I’ve stumbled a few times, had to lean against things to steady myself. It’s more a feeling of instability, like they’re going to give way under me. It hasn't happened enough to fall completely, thank goodness. I'm usually quick to react, you know? But it's quite frightening, honestly. I had to cancel a tour yesterday, which was very embarrassing. The clients weren’t pleased. A perfectly good reputation, almost ruined by a little weakness. It’s…frustrating.
DOCTOR: And any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Well, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years back, but it's been managed with medication. Nothing major, Doctor. I see my primary care physician regularly, and he keeps a close eye on it. I don't really have any other issues. I used to have some trouble with my back, but physical therapy sorted that out years ago. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat reasonably well, though I admit I have a sweet tooth. And I try to walk as much as possible, when my legs aren't…being difficult. Honestly, this weakness is so out of character for me. It’s really concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look at your legs. Please, come over here and sit on the examination table. And try not to exaggerate anything, just show me what you normally do.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’ll try my best. I’m not one for theatrics, you understand. It’s really quite…embarrassing, actually, having to demonstrate this weakness. I hate feeling unstable. I suppose it's better to show you than to try and explain it, though. Just…try not to rush me. I prefer to take things slowly when my legs are…uncooperative. It makes me feel safer, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are…normal. Strength is…slightly diminished in both legs. Can you stand on your toes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s…difficult. It’s not impossible, but it requires a great deal of concentration, you understand? And I'm not as stable as I normally am. It feels…precarious. It’s not like it used to be, certainly. I used to be able to do that without even thinking about it. Now…well, now it's a conscious effort. And a bit wobbly, I'm afraid. I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you walk on your heels?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s even more difficult than the toes, Doctor. It’s…unnatural, you see? I'm not used to putting my weight on my heels like this. It feels very awkward, and…unstable. I'm trying, but it’s…challenging. I really don't want to lose my balance. I feel a bit dizzy, actually. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: Alright. Stop. It sounds like you might be experiencing some…weakness. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. Could be a vitamin deficiency, could be something else. Honestly, it's difficult to say without more information.
PATIENT: Blood work? Very well. I suppose that’s…sensible. I do hope it’s nothing serious, Doctor. I have a very busy schedule, you see, and being ill is…inconvenient. A vitamin deficiency…is that common? Is it easily fixed? And will I be able to continue working while I wait for the results? I have a tour booked for tomorrow morning, and I really don’t want to disappoint anyone. I pride myself on my reliability, you know.
DOCTOR: Vitamin deficiencies are common enough. Easily fixed, usually. But we need to find out which one, if that's the issue. As for work… avoid strenuous activity until we have the results. No tours, alright?
PATIENT: No tours… That’s…disappointing. Very disappointing, actually. I suppose I understand, Doctor, but it's going to be difficult explaining this to my clients. They rely on me. And I’ve already had a cancellation due to this weakness…another one won’t look good. Will the results be back quickly? And what if it’s something more serious than a vitamin deficiency? I do hope it’s not something that will keep me out of commission for long. I have commitments, you know.
