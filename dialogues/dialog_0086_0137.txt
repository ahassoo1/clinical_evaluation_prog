DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is... is okay if I call you Doctor? My husband, he say I need paper... for the place. The senior place. They want to know I am... healthy enough? For live there.
DOCTOR: Yes, “Doctor” is perfectly fine. And yes, I understand. A pre-admission assessment for the senior living facility. We’ll get all the necessary paperwork completed. So, let's start with why you decided to come in today. Are you experiencing any specific health issues or concerns?
PATIENT: No, no big problem. I feel... okay. Old, you know? But okay. My knees, they sometimes hurt when it rain. And I forget things... small things. Like where I put my glasses! But nothing... serious, I think.
DOCTOR: "Okay." Right. So, the knees bother you with changes in the weather and some memory lapses... small things, you say. We need to get a better picture of everything. Let’s start with those knees. When did you first notice the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm... a long time. Maybe five years? When I move to this city. The rain is... different here. Colder, I think. Not like Honduras. It's not all the time, only when it rain a lot. And when I walk too much. Not every day, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, so five years, coinciding with your move. Worse with heavy rain and prolonged walking. Do you experience any swelling, stiffness, or clicking in your knees?
PATIENT: Swelling... sometimes. After I walk a lot. Not big swelling, just... puffy. And stiff... yes, in the morning. Hard to move. Clicking... no, I don't think so. Maybe a little pop, sometimes. But not always. Old lady noises, maybe?
DOCTOR: "Old lady noises," right. We'll explore that. And you mentioned some forgetfulness. Can you give me an example of what you’ve been forgetting, beyond misplacing your glasses?
PATIENT: Oh... like... names. Sometimes I meet someone, and the name... it fly away. Or what I go to the kitchen for. I go in there, and... forget! My husband, he laugh. He say I always have been forgetful. But maybe it is worse now? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, difficulty recalling names and occasional trouble remembering why you went to another room. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Slow. Not... boom, one day I forget everything. More... little by little. My husband, he notice first. He say I ask the same questions two times. Or tell the same stories. But I not think it is so bad. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It's good that your husband is observant. And it's certainly worth investigating. It could be normal age-related changes, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Let’s go through a quick review of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure. The doctor in Honduras, he tell me. I take the pills... every morning. And sometimes my feet swell. That is all, I think. No heart problems. I feel strong. For an old lady! I eat good food, too. My husband, he is a good cook.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and occasional foot swelling. Do you know what medication you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Is a white pill. Small. And... I think is “amlodipine”? My husband, he always get the pills for me. I don't remember the name very good. He knows. Sorry. I am not good with the names.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we can confirm that later. And besides amlodipine, are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pill. And sometimes, when my knees hurt, I take... Ibuprofen. The blue one. But not every day. Only when I need it. That is all, Doctor. I try to not take too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never. I eat everything. My husband, he grow a lot of things in the garden. Tomatoes, peppers... I like everything. No problems with allergies. Never had one. That is good, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is good. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. When I was young, I have the tonsils out. But that was a long time ago. And… when I have my son, I have a C-section. But that is all. No other hospital or surgeries. I try to stay healthy. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a C-section for the birth of your son. And, just to be thorough, can you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: My mother… she have the high blood pressure too. And my father, he have the… diabetes. But he eat too much sugar, you know? He love the sweets! My brother, he is healthy. And my sister… she have the heart problems. But she smoke too much when she was young. Is bad history, yes?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know. High blood pressure in your mother, diabetes in your father, and heart problems in your sister. Thank you. And finally, let's talk briefly about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoke. Never. My husband, he try one time, but he cough so much he stop. No alcohol either. Is not good for the health, you know? And no... other things. Just the food! My husband is a good cook, but sometimes too much!
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for all of that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, look in your ears, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That is okay. Whatever you need. I want to be healthy for the senior place. Take your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Not overly concerning, but something we should monitor. Lungs are clear. Ears are normal. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. And finally, I'm going to check your reflexes... Reflexes are normal. Overall, your exam is largely unremarkable, but we'll need to investigate the murmur further.
PATIENT: Murmur? What is murmur? Is bad?
DOCTOR: A murmur is simply an extra sound your heart makes when it's beating. It doesn’t always mean something is wrong, especially given your age. It could be perfectly benign. However, to be safe, I’d like to order an echocardiogram – that's an ultrasound of your heart. It will give us a better picture of what's going on and rule out any potential issues. It's a simple, non-invasive test.
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Okay. Is that... painful? Will it take long? I have to get to the senior place soon.
DOCTOR: No, it's not painful at all. You lie on a table, and a technician moves a wand over your chest. It doesn’t involve any needles or discomfort. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. We can schedule it for next week. In the meantime, to address your memory concerns and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I also want to order some blood work. It will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and kidney function. These can all impact your cognitive abilities and blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work and… echo-thing. Next week. Is good. Will these tests… let me go to the senior place? Is that what you think? Will I be okay?
DOCTOR: The tests will help us get a clearer picture of your overall health so we can make the best decision about what’s right for you. The senior living facility will likely require these results before admitting you, and it's important to be thorough. We're not necessarily looking for problems, but we want to make sure you are in the best possible condition before starting this new chapter. I will review the results as soon as they are available and discuss them with you in detail. Based on what we've discussed today, and assuming the tests come back within normal limits, I don't foresee any reason why you wouldn't be able to move forward with your plans. But we need to be cautious and rule out anything serious first. Now, let's get the paperwork started for the lab and echocardiogram. Do you have a preferred lab?
PATIENT: No, no preference. Whatever is close. My husband, he usually drive me. He worries a lot, you know. I hope these tests don’t scare him. He get so anxious when I am sick.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll make sure to explain everything clearly and address any concerns he may have. There's a lab just down the street – Memorial Lab. It's conveniently located and has good reviews. I will fax the orders to them immediately, and they should contact you to schedule an appointment. As for the echocardiogram, I will give you a referral to Cardiology Associates – they have several locations and offer flexible scheduling. Here are the orders for the lab and the referral for the echocardiogram. Please call them as soon as possible to schedule your appointments. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. And you will call me when the results come? I hope everything is okay. For the senior place… and for my husband.
DOCTOR: Yes, my staff will contact you as soon as the results are available. And I will be happy to discuss them with you and your husband. We will take excellent care of you, Ms. Abdollahi. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and please tell your husband I said hello.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will.
