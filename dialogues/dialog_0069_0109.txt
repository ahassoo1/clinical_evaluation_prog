DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Andraca. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… the back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A dull ache at the back of your head, coming and going for about three days. Okay. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not… sharp. Not like a stabbing pain. More like… someone is squeezing. And it feels… worse when I am… thinking hard. Or when I’m… walking in the sun. Not bad bad, but… noticeable. I used to work with the trains, you know? Lots of sun. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, a squeezing sensation, worse with thinking or walking in the sun. And you used to work with the trains, spending a lot of time outdoors. That's helpful information. First, let's get a better understanding of the pain itself. On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain you’ve ever experienced, what number would you say this headache is usually at?
PATIENT: Zero is no pain, ten is… really bad. Hmm… usually, maybe a… three? Sometimes it goes up to a five when I’m… trying to remember things. Or if I’m out in the sun for a long time. It’s not always there, you understand. Comes and goes. But when it is there… three, maybe five.
DOCTOR: Okay, a three to five, increasing with mental effort or sun exposure. That helps. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No… no dizziness. Not feeling sick to my stomach. My vision… seems okay. I can see just fine. No… blurry spots or anything. I did feel… a little tired lately. But I am ninety years old, Doctor! A little tired is normal, yes?
DOCTOR: You are right to point that out! A little tiredness is perfectly normal at ninety. Good to know you haven’t experienced dizziness, nausea, or changes in your vision. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you had any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no. I don’t think so. My wife… she always took my temperature when I had a fever. But she is… gone now. And I haven’t felt hot or cold, you understand? No chills. Just… the headache. And maybe a little tired. Is this something serious, Doctor? It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Brum, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. No fever is good. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Existing conditions… hmm. I had a problem with my heart, many years ago. They fixed it with… with surgery. A long time ago. No… no diabetes. No… nothing else, really. I used to be very strong, working with the trains. But… things change when you get old. I don’t take any… medicines now. Not regularly. Sometimes a little something for my… arthritis, but not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart surgery, but otherwise generally healthy. Some arthritis managed with occasional medication. And no regular medications currently. That's good information. Do you recall when you had the heart surgery, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was… oh, goodness. Maybe… twenty years ago? Maybe more. It was after my wife and I… moved to this town. She liked it here. Quiet. The doctor… Dr. Ramirez… he was a good man. He did the surgery himself. I remember being very… scared. But it worked, you know? It worked very well. I was able to go back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly twenty years ago. And that surgery was successful. Thank you for sharing that. Now, Mr. Brum, just to complete the picture, can you tell me about any significant medical history in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she died when I was young. Pneumonia, I think. My father… he lived a long time. Very strong man. He worked on the coffee plantations. He… he had trouble with his… his memory, towards the end. But he never went to the doctor much. My wife’s mother… she had… something with her blood pressure, I think. But that was a long time ago. I don’t… I don’t really know much about it. We didn’t talk about those things much, you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for those details to be less known over time. Okay, a history of pneumonia in your mother, potential memory issues in your father, and blood pressure issues in your wife's mother. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. Not that I know of. My wife… she was allergic to bees. But I… I never had any trouble with allergies. No… no hives, no… difficulty breathing. I can eat anything. I used to eat everything!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, Mr. Brum, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment. That will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. My wife… she always said I should listen to the doctor. She was a smart woman. Go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, but not overly concerning given your age. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. Balance is a little unsteady, but you’re able to maintain it with support. Coordination appears intact. No obvious focal neurological deficits. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam findings, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing tension headaches, potentially exacerbated by mental effort and sun exposure. The mild elevation in blood pressure could be contributing as well. However, given your age and the recent onset of symptoms, I’d like to order a simple blood test to rule out any other underlying causes, just to be safe. This will include a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tension headaches… that sounds… reasonable. I do worry a lot, you know? About… things. And the sun… yes, the sun. Blood test… yes, that sounds… safe. Better to be careful. Yes, Doctor, please. Whatever you think is best. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’ll write an order for the lab, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. It’s usually a quick process. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, especially when you’re in the sun. Avoid prolonged sun exposure if possible, and try to manage your stress levels. Perhaps some gentle exercise, like walking, could help. We can also discuss some over-the-counter pain relievers if the headache becomes bothersome, but let’s wait for the blood test results before we start anything. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Hydrated… yes, my wife always told me to drink water. Stress… that’s hard. But I’ll try. Gentle exercise… yes, a little walking. Over-the-counter… yes, wait for the test. Yes, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve been very… kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. I’m glad I could help. We'll get those lab results back as quickly as possible. The lab will likely contact you within a couple of days to schedule the appointment. Once we have those results, we can discuss a more definitive plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as a severe headache, fever, dizziness, vision changes, or weakness – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Worsening symptoms… yes, I will remember that. Severe headache, fever… yes. No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. You’ve explained everything very… clearly. Thank you again. You’ve put my mind… a little more at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. I’m glad to hear that. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Here’s a copy of the lab order for your records. Have a good day, and I’ll see you again soon once we have those results. .
