DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. I’m Dr. Chora. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I just need some forms notarized, really. They're health forms… for something. Honestly, the lady on the phone didn’t explain it very well, and I’m trying to get them sorted quickly. It’s about verifying them, I think?
DOCTOR: Notarizing forms… Okay. While I can certainly look at them, this isn’t really a typical medical visit, and I'm not a notary public. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding when you scheduled the appointment?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, that is a problem, isn’t it? I thought… I was told this was where I could get them verified for something involving… benefits, maybe? I really don't know. I just want to get this done and go home. Is there anyone here who can do it?
DOCTOR: Let me see if I can clarify. Could you describe the forms to me?
PATIENT: They're… long. White paper. Lots of boxes to check, and places to sign. There’s something about my medical history on there, and a place for my doctor’s signature. It also asks about… well, it asks if I have insurance, which I don't. And… it has a space for a stamp, I think. A notary stamp. That's what I was told I needed. Do you understand what I mean? It's all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like these forms are related to verifying your medical information for some type of assistance program. It's not unusual for those programs to require doctor verification. Unfortunately, as I mentioned, I am unable to notarize documents. However, I can review the medical information on the forms to confirm its accuracy, and provide my signature attesting to that. It won't be a notarized signature, but it might be sufficient. Would you like me to take a look and see if I can help in that way?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor, truly. If you can just look at the information and sign it... that might be enough. I just don’t want to get stuck going back and forth. I’m getting too old for all this paperwork! Yes, please, if you don’t mind taking a look. Here they are…
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tippens. Let’s see… this is a fairly standard medical verification form, as I suspected. It appears to be for a state assistance program… let me see… Medicaid eligibility. Okay. Let’s go through some of this to make sure everything’s accurate. First, can you confirm your date of birth for me?
PATIENT: August 12th, 1949. Though sometimes I get it mixed up with my sister's... she was born a few months before me. But August 12th is right, I think. Definitely 1949.
DOCTOR: Okay, August 12th, 1949. And your race, just to confirm what we have on file?
PATIENT: Mexican. Though my grandmother was Spanish, if that makes a difference. I was born and raised right here, though. Plain old Mexican.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tippens. And your current height and weight, if you happen to know them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I haven’t been weighed in ages. I’m… tall. Very tall. Six foot two, maybe? And… I'm quite thin. Around 110 pounds, I'd guess. I used to weigh more, but I haven’t been eating much lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. The chart has you listed at 5'11" and 110 pounds, which is consistent with what you’re telling me. Now, the form asks about any current medical conditions. Do you have any health problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, well… my knees bother me. Badly. Especially when it rains. And I get a little short of breath sometimes, walking up the stairs. Other than that… not much. I was pretty healthy, up until a few years ago. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, I suppose. Nothing that needs… real attention, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll make a note of the knee pain and shortness of breath. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't taken much medication in my life. A little aspirin sometimes, for a headache. But nothing regularly. No reactions, no swelling, nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, and just to confirm, you are not currently taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: That’s right. Nothing at all. Just… vitamins, sometimes. But that’s it. Nothing the doctor needs to know about, I wouldn't think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tippens. This form also asks about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious illnesses, like heart problems, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… well, I had pneumonia when I was a little girl. A bad case, they said. But I recovered. Other than that… no. Nothing serious. My mother had high blood pressure, but I haven’t had any trouble with that myself. Just the usual aches and pains, like I said. Nothing the doctor needs to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now that you mention it… I had my appendix out when I was young. And… oh, yes! I had a hysterectomy many years ago. That's about it, I think. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We’ve got the appendix removal and the hysterectomy documented. Now, just a few more questions, and then I can sign the form. Do you have a family history of any serious illnesses, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That’s a tough one. My father… he had a heart attack when he was young. And my aunt… she had diabetes, I think. My mother’s side… lots of high blood pressure. It runs in the family, I suppose. Is this important, Doctor? It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Tippens, but don't worry. It helps me get a complete picture of your health. Okay. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven’t had a drink since… well, since my husband passed away, many years ago. And definitely not those other things. I’m a very… a very good woman.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tippens. Thank you for being so thorough. Based on what you’ve told me, everything appears consistent. I’m happy to sign this form attesting to your medical history as we’ve discussed. However, I do want to reiterate that this is not a comprehensive medical evaluation. I would strongly recommend that you schedule a full physical exam with me at your earliest convenience to ensure you are in optimal health. Especially given your family history of heart disease and your reported shortness of breath. Would you like me to have the receptionist schedule that for you now?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, Doctor, truly. Yes, please, if you wouldn't mind. But, um… about the cost? I… I don’t really have insurance. I don't want any surprises. I’m on a fixed income, you see.
DOCTOR: Here you are. And don't worry, Ms. Tippens. We have a sliding scale for patients without insurance. Let me have the receptionist explain the fees to you. She can also see if you qualify for any assistance programs. We don't want cost to be a barrier to you receiving the care you need. Now, let me call her in… Rosa, could you come in here for a moment, please?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. You're a good man. Really good. I appreciate it. .
