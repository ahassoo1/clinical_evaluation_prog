DOCTOR: Good morning, Madame Minatra. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I received a letter… a notice, really, about some tests I had done on my stomach. The results weren’t quite right, they said. Something about an “endo test”? I'm not entirely sure what that means, but it sounded concerning enough to come in for a visit.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. An “endo test” refers to an endoscopy, a procedure where we examine the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum with a thin, flexible tube with a camera. I see you received a notice regarding the results. Could you tell me a little more about what prompted these tests in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly. For a good while now – perhaps six months, maybe a little longer – I've been having some… discomfort. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a burning sensation, mostly in my upper stomach. And sometimes, after I eat, I feel quite full very quickly. It’s… unpleasant. I thought it might just be something I ate, or perhaps a change in my routine, but it hasn’t gone away. My late husband always said I worried too much, but this felt different. That's why I finally went to get it checked.
DOCTOR: I understand. A persistent burning sensation and early satiety – feeling full quickly – are certainly symptoms worth investigating. It’s good you decided to get it checked. And it’s perfectly reasonable to seek medical attention when something doesn’t feel right. Now, could you describe the timing of this burning sensation?
PATIENT: That’s kind of you to say so, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s not constant. It tends to flare up after I eat, like I mentioned. But sometimes, even when I haven’t eaten for a few hours, I’ll feel a twinge. It seems worse when I lie down, actually. If I sit up, it’s usually better. And it's not always after eating. Sometimes it just...happens. Though, I do find spicy foods make it much, much worse. I used to enjoy a good mole, but I haven't dared touch it in weeks.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s very helpful. The fact that it worsens with lying down and is aggravated by spicy foods is particularly relevant. Does anything relieve the discomfort, besides sitting up?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Honestly, not much does, truly relieve it. A glass of water sometimes helps a little, just to wash it down, you know? But it's temporary. I’ve tried those over-the-counter antacids, the ones with calcium carbonate... they take the edge off, perhaps, for a short while. But they don’t really fix it. And I don’t like relying on them all the time. I prefer to understand why I’m feeling this way, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Madame Minatra. It’s always best to address the root cause, rather than simply masking the symptoms. And it’s good you haven’t been relying heavily on over-the-counter medications. Now, regarding other symptoms, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No nausea or vomiting at all. And swallowing is… perfectly normal. I haven't had any trouble with that, not even with my favorite tortillas! Sometimes, I feel a little… bloated, perhaps, after a large meal, but that’s about it. Though, I have noticed a slight… change in my appetite. It's not that I don't want to eat, exactly. It’s more like… I don’t feel as hungry as I used to. A smaller portion is usually enough these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And you mentioned a change in appetite; has there been any unintentional weight loss associated with that?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. I hadn't thought much of it, but I weighed myself recently, just a few days ago, and I've lost a few kilograms. Perhaps three or four? It wasn’t a dramatic drop, but enough to notice, certainly. My clothes feel a little looser than they used to. I attributed it to the warmer weather, but perhaps it’s related to this stomach trouble. I do try to eat regular meals, though, I assure you. I was always taught a proper diet is important.
DOCTOR: That’s important information, Madame Minatra. A weight loss of three or four kilograms, even if unintentional, warrants further investigation. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I don't believe so, Doctor. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. My late husband, bless his soul, was the one with a touch of the high blood pressure, but I’ve never had any problems myself. I've had the usual aches and pains of getting older, of course, but nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing of that sort. I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but I recovered fully. I try to take good care of myself, you see. A healthy body is a gift.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I've been very fortunate, truly. I did break my wrist as a child, climbing a tree, foolishly, but that was a simple fracture. It healed quite well. Aside from that, I’ve been remarkably… robust, I suppose is the word. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. I do hope she was right! This stomach trouble is the first real medical issue I've encountered.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Madame Minatra. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Ah, family history… let me think. My mother lived to be eighty-seven, a very long life. She passed away peacefully in her sleep. She had some arthritis in her later years, but otherwise, she was quite healthy. My father… he was a farmer, a hardworking man. He developed some heart problems in his seventies, but that was many years ago. And my siblings… my sister is still alive, thankfully, and she’s doing well. No history of stomach cancer or any major digestive issues, as far as I know. They weren’t ones for talking about such things, you see. More practical folk.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, I live alone now, as I mentioned. My late husband passed away five years ago, a great loss. I keep busy, though. I enjoy gardening, particularly growing herbs and vegetables. I also do a lot of cooking, naturally. I like to prepare traditional Mexican dishes. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I try to stay active, walking in the garden and taking gentle strolls in the village. I don’t drive anymore, unfortunately, so I rely on friends and neighbors for errands. I believe in a simple, balanced life.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very healthy lifestyle, Madame Minatra. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of. I've never had any allergic reactions to any medications or foods. I can eat anything, thankfully. My mother always made sure I tried everything, even the spicy things! She said it was good for the digestion. I did have a touch of hay fever as a child, but that cleared up years ago. I don’t take any regular medications, not even vitamins. I prefer to get my nutrients from fresh, whole foods. I believe in the power of nature, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Madame Minatra. That was all very helpful. Based on what you've told me – the burning sensation, early satiety, unintentional weight loss, and the fact that it's not relieved by antacids – I think we need to investigate this further. It could be several things, and I don’t want to jump to conclusions without more information. The endoscopy results are concerning, but they are just the first step. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. This will involve listening to your abdomen, checking for any tenderness, and palpating your stomach. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment. Please, do whatever you think is necessary to get to the bottom of this. I understand you can’t make a diagnosis without proper examination. And yes, a physical exam is perfectly acceptable. I'm ready whenever you are. It's just… I hope it's nothing too serious. But I suppose worrying won't help, will it?
DOCTOR: No, worrying won’t help, and we’ll take things one step at a time. Let’s start by listening to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm going to listen in a few different areas to assess the bowel sounds and check for any abnormalities. It may be a little cool, please let me know if you're uncomfortable. Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants, though somewhat diminished. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any tenderness or pain. I’ll start here, in your upper abdomen…
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Go ahead. Oh… yes. That’s… a little tender, right here. Not sharp pain, exactly. More of a… discomfort. Like a dull ache. It’s not constant, but definitely more sensitive than the rest of my abdomen. Please, be gentle. I am a little anxious, you see. It’s just… unpleasant. But I will try to remain still and let you do your work.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. Yes, I do feel some tenderness in your upper abdomen, as you indicated. It’s localized, which is helpful. There’s no guarding or rebound tenderness, which is reassuring. The rest of your abdomen feels soft and non-distended. There are no palpable masses. Now, based on the examination and your history, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Given the tenderness in your upper abdomen, the weight loss, and the endoscopy results, we need to rule out several things, including gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and, less likely, but we need to be thorough, a possible malignancy. The endoscopy showed some inflammation, but further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some additional tests. Specifically, a complete blood count to check for anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your liver and kidney function, and a stool test to check for H. pylori infection and blood in your stool. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Gastritis… peptic ulcer… malignancy… Oh dear. Those all sound rather… serious. But I understand you must consider everything. It's best to be thorough, as you say. Yes, Doctor. Of course. I agree to the tests. Whatever you think is necessary. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool test… Yes. Please. The sooner we know, the better. I would rather face whatever it is with knowledge than worry in the dark. And… what does H. pylori have to do with it? I've never heard of that. Is that… dangerous?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Madame Minatra. It’s best to be proactive, and we will get to the bottom of this. H. pylori, or Helicobacter pylori, is a bacteria that can infect the stomach lining. It’s quite common, and often causes no symptoms, but in some cases, it can lead to gastritis, ulcers, and even an increased risk of stomach cancer. The stool test will help us determine if you have an infection. It’s a simple test, you just collect a small sample at home and bring it to the lab. The other tests will give us a broader picture of your overall health and help us rule out other possibilities. I will write the orders for the lab tests now. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. It may involve medication, lifestyle changes, or further investigation, depending on the findings. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. Bacteria… medication… lifestyle changes… I understand. A simple stool test… I can manage that. I will collect the sample and bring it to the lab as soon as possible. One question… How long will it take to get the results? I understand these things take time, but I am anxious to know what we are dealing with. And… will these tests require a special diet? Should I avoid certain foods while I’m waiting for the results? I don’t want to complicate things unnecessarily. I’ve been trying to eat healthy, as you know, but I want to be certain I’m not doing anything that might interfere with the tests.
DOCTOR: Excellent questions, Madame Minatra. The lab results typically take about 3 to 5 business days to come back. I will call you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment. Regarding diet, there's no need for a special diet while you're waiting for the results. However, it's generally advisable to avoid foods that may irritate your stomach, such as spicy foods, acidic foods, caffeine, and alcohol. Stick to bland, easily digestible foods. But it’s not crucial, and it won't significantly affect the test results. For now, just focus on taking care of yourself and getting adequate rest. We’ll discuss the results in detail once they are available and formulate a plan based on your individual needs. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Three to five business days… that seems reasonable. No special diet… just avoid irritants… I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. That puts my mind at ease. I believe… no, I think that’s all for now. You’ve answered all my questions very thoroughly. I appreciate your kindness and patience. It’s… unsettling to hear about potential problems, but I feel much better knowing you are taking good care of me. I will collect the sample and bring it to the lab as soon as possible. And I will await your call. Thank you again, Doctor Stilaire.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Madame Minatra. It’s my pleasure to help. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We're here to support you every step of the way. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. Have a good day.
