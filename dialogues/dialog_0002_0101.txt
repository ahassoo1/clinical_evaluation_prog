DOCTOR: Hi Aldine, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. It's this headache I've been getting, right at the back of my head. Been botherin' me for a little while now, it has. Not all the time, mind you, but when it comes on, it's a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head. And you said it’s been going on for a little while – can you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think now… It started, oh, must be about three weeks ago, give or take a few days. Started kinda mild, just a dull ache, but it's gotten a bit sharper lately. Not constant, like I said. Comes and goes. Mostly in the afternoons, if I remember right. Now that I'm thinkin' on it, it was after I did some work in the garden... lots of bending over, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, starting mild and getting sharper, mostly in the afternoons, and it seemed to start after some gardening. That's helpful. Can you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a throbbing headache, not at all. More like a… a tight band around the back of my head. Sometimes it feels like pressure, you know? And it can spread a little bit up the sides, towards my temples, but mostly it's just right at the base of my skull. It doesn’t make me feel sick or anything, just uncomfortable. And light doesn't bother me, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, a tight band or pressure at the base of your skull, sometimes spreading to the temples, but no nausea or light sensitivity. That's good to know. Have you tried anything to relieve it so far?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. My wife, bless her heart, she always tells me to take some of those… what are they called? Paracetamol, that's it. They help a little, take the edge off, but it always comes back. I also try to lie down in a dark room for a bit, that can sometimes ease it too, but it doesn't always work. Mostly, I just try to ignore it, which isn't ideal, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, paracetamol helps a little, and lying down sometimes eases it. And you’ve been mostly trying to manage it on your own. Have you noticed anything specifically triggers the headache, besides the gardening?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Let me think... I don't know if it's a trigger, exactly, but it seems to be worse when I'm stressed. My grandson, he's a lovely boy, but he got into a bit of trouble at school, and that was worryin' me somethin' fierce last week. And I was helpin' my daughter with some renovations, lots of lifting and bending... so maybe stress and physical work? It's hard to say for sure, though. I'm an old man, things ache all the time!
DOCTOR: I understand. Stress and physical work seem to be associated with it. And it’s completely normal for things to ache more as we get older! Just to get a better picture, have you had headaches like this before, or is this new?
PATIENT: No, I haven't had headaches quite like this before. I used to get the occasional tension headache, you know, from worryin' too much, but they were always across my forehead, not at the back of my head like this one. And they'd go away with a cup of tea and a lie-down. This feels… different. More persistent, and the location is new. I’ve never had a pain right at the base of my skull before.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important information – a different type of headache than you've experienced before, new location, and more persistent. Now, I’m going to ask you a few general health questions, if that’s alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache, like any fever, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. No, thankfully, none of those things. No fever, no changes in my vision, I can see just as well as I always have – though my wife says I need new glasses! No weakness, no numbness, and I haven’t had any trouble speakin', as you can see. Just the headache. I’ve been feelin' a bit tired lately, but I put that down to my age, and helpin’ out around the house.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, vision changes, weakness, or numbness. Just the headache and some fatigue, which you attribute to age and activity. Have you had any recent injuries, even minor ones, like bumping your head?
PATIENT: No, no injuries at all. I'm very careful, you know? I might be old, but I'm not clumsy! I haven’t bumped my head or anything like that. I haven’t fallen or had any accidents. Just been tryin’ to keep busy, really. The garden needs weedin’ and my wife keeps finding things for me to fix around the house!
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, just a few more questions about your overall health history. Do you have any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me years ago I had slightly high blood pressure, but it’s always been under control with a little dietin’ and regular check-ups. I don’t have diabetes, thankfully, and I do have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it’s not too bad. Just a bit of stiffness in the mornings. Other than that, I'm fairly healthy for an old man, if I do say so myself!
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly high blood pressure under control, and some arthritis in the knees. Do you take any medications regularly, besides anything for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the medication for my blood pressure, a small tablet every mornin'. And I take some glucosamine for my knees sometimes, when they're acting up. That's it, really. I try to avoid takin' too many pills if I can help it. My wife keeps offerin’ me all sorts of remedies, but I prefer to keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, just blood pressure medication and glucosamine as needed. And you have no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. Never had a reaction to anythin', thankfully. I can eat anythin' and take any medication without worryin’ about it. My wife is always askin’ me if I’m sure, but I've never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Now, before I do a quick physical exam, I want to ask about your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has a history of frequent or severe headaches, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. Let me think... My mother used to get migraines when she was younger, quite bad ones, but she hasn't had one in years. And my brother, he had a stroke a few years ago, but he was a smoker, you see? Other than that, I don’t think anyone in the family has had any serious headaches or neurological conditions. It’s a fairly healthy family, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had migraines in the past, and your brother had a stroke but was a smoker. That’s helpful. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your reflexes and do a brief neurological exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm not afraid of a little exam. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aldine, just take some nice, deep breaths for me. Everything sounds good there. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Those are good as well. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and I'll check your strength and sensation in your arms and legs. Okay, strength and sensation seem normal. And your eye movements are good. I’m going to palpate your skull and neck muscles… There’s some mild tenderness in the muscles at the base of your skull, which is likely related to the headache. Overall, the neurological exam is pretty normal, but the tenderness is notable.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't so bad, was it? You've got a gentle touch, Doctor. So, what do you think it is? Is it somethin' serious? I've been worryin' a bit, you see, it's just not like my usual headaches. Could it be stress, like I said? Or maybe I'm just gettin' old?
DOCTOR: No, it wasn't bad at all, and you're right to ask. Based on what you've told me and the exam, I don’t think it’s anything serious at this point, but we need to investigate further to be sure. It’s very likely a tension headache, possibly related to stress and muscle tension in your neck and shoulders, especially given the tenderness I felt during the exam. The gardening and helping out around the house could also be contributing factors. However, because this is a new type of headache for you and it's persistent, I want to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a blood test just to check your overall health and rule out any underlying inflammation or other issues. And, just to be extra cautious, I'm going to recommend a simple CT scan of your head. This will give us a clear picture of your brain and rule out anything more concerning. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A CT scan, you say? Hmm… That sounds a bit scary, doesn't it? Is it somethin' you really think is necessary, Doctor? I mean, I'm an old man, I've had a few bumps and scrapes in my life, but I've never needed a scan before. Maybe the blood test would be enough? I don't want to go through all that trouble if it's just a bit of stress, you see.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Aldine. A CT scan can sound a bit daunting, and I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t think it was prudent. It's not about thinking it is something serious, it's about being thorough, especially since this is a new headache pattern for you. The scan helps us to rule out other, less common causes of headaches, like any structural issues or changes in the brain. It’s a quick and relatively painless procedure. The blood test is a good starting point, absolutely. However, a blood test won’t give us the same level of detail about what’s going on in your brain. We can start with the blood test, and if the results are normal and your headache persists or worsens, then we can discuss the CT scan again. Would that make you feel more comfortable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better, Doctor. Start with the blood test, and then see how things go. If it's still botherin' me after that, then we can talk about the scan. I trust your judgment, you seem to know what you're doin'. And thank you for explainin' it so clearly, I appreciate that. It's good to have a doctor who takes the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aldine. That’s what I’m here for. I'm glad we came to an agreement that you're comfortable with. Okay, so I'll write you a requisition for the blood test. You can take it to the lab just down the street, and they’ll schedule an appointment for you. The results usually take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to manage your stress as much as possible, get plenty of rest, and try to avoid strenuous activities. You can also continue to take paracetamol as needed for pain relief. If your headache suddenly gets worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, vision changes, weakness, or numbness, please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've covered everything very thoroughly. I feel much better now, knowin' what we're doin'. Thank you again for your time and patience. You're a good doctor. And tell me, is there anything I can do to help speed up the process, or anythin' I should be aware of before the blood test?
DOCTOR: You're very kind to say so, Aldine. I'm happy to help. As for the blood test, just make sure you drink plenty of water the day before and the day of the test. Fasting is not required for this specific test, so you can eat and drink normally. You may also want to wear comfortable clothing with sleeves that can be easily rolled up. And most importantly, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Here’s the requisition form, and the clinic’s phone number. Feel better, Aldine, and I’ll see you when the results come back.
PATIENT: Thank you kindly, Doctor. You take care now. And I will see you when the results come in.
