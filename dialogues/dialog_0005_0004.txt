DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Donate. Just for my shots, really. Routine stuff. I think it's time for a check-up on those, you know, the things to keep me from getting sick. I get a little forgetful sometimes, so I like to make sure I'm all up-to-date.
DOCTOR: “Routine stuff,” right. Well, we should probably confirm what those “routine stuff” are, just to be sure. And I'll need a complete medical history, even for routine things. It's policy. It's important to know what we're dealing with, and frankly, patients often misremember what they've had before. So, let’s start with… have you had a tetanus booster in the last ten years?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Ten years… that’s a long time ago. I honestly can't remember. I think… maybe? I was helping my husband build that shed last summer, and I think I might have gotten one then, but I don't really recall going to the doctor for it. It could have been at a clinic somewhere, or even a traveling one. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: “A bit fuzzy” isn’t exactly reassuring, Ms. Fornes. Look, it’s important. Tetanus is serious. We’ll need to proceed as if you haven’t had a booster. And before we get to shots, let's cover some basics. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with any medicine, thankfully. My grandma always said I had a strong stomach, and I guess that stuck with me! I used to help her with her herbal remedies, too, and those sometimes had… interesting smells, but never made me sick. Does that count? I mean, those weren't doctor medicines.
DOCTOR: Herbal remedies aren’t what I’m asking about, Ms. Fornes. I need to know if you’ve ever had a reaction to a prescription medication – a rash, difficulty breathing, anything like that. It’s a simple question. And please, try to focus on things a doctor prescribed, not what your grandmother used. Have you been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, you're right, you're right. Sorry, I get rambling. No, no reactions to anything a doctor gave me. Never. And no, I’m not taking anything right now. Just a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. Nothing for anything specific. My husband keeps telling me I should take something for my joints, but I tell him a little ache is just part of getting older. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Multivitamin is fine. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… chronic conditions… let me think. Well, the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high a few years back, but it went down when I started walking more. He said to just keep an eye on it. Other than that… no, not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, measles and chickenpox, but I got over those, you know? I haven’t been sick sick in a long time, thankfully. Does high blood pressure count as a condition? I try not to worry about it too much.
DOCTOR: “Try not to worry about it” isn’t a medical strategy, Ms. Fornes. Elevated blood pressure is a condition, and it requires monitoring. Do you know your most recent blood pressure reading?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I don’t. I haven’t been to the doctor for a check-up in a while, like I said. My husband usually reminds me, but he’s been so busy with the fishing lately… I think it was around 140 over something when they last checked it, but I’m really not good with numbers. He worries about it more than I do, honestly. He always says I need to take better care of myself. Is that bad? It being that high? I really don’t want to be on medication, you know?
DOCTOR: Well, we’ll get a reading now. And frankly, relying on your husband’s memory and your own vague recollections isn't a good way to manage your health. Let’s just get this over with. Please extend your arm. And please, try to relax. It will be inaccurate otherwise.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Relaxing… trying to relax. It's just… I don’t like going to the doctor. It always makes me feel… anxious. And then there’s all the talk about numbers and conditions… It's just a lot. But I’m here now, so… go ahead.
DOCTOR: 158 over 92. Again. That’s… concerning. And you said you haven’t had a check-up in how long?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. That is high, isn't it? I knew I should have listened to my husband more. It's been… probably two years, maybe longer. Everything just got so busy with the grandkids and helping him with the boat repairs… I just kept putting it off. Is that really bad? What does that mean? I'm not a numbers person, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It means your blood pressure is significantly elevated, Ms. Fornes. And ignoring it won’t make it go away. This increases your risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney failure… a whole host of problems. We need to get this under control. It’s not simply a matter of “numbers,” it’s a matter of your health. I’m going to need to start you on medication, and we’ll need to schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor your progress. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Medication? Oh dear. I… I really didn’t want to take medication. Is there anything else we can try? Maybe… more walking? A special diet? I eat pretty healthy, mostly fish and berries, but I could try harder, I guess. I just… I don't like the idea of being on pills forever. What kind of pills are they, anyway? Are there side effects? I’m just a bit worried, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, your blood pressure is dangerously high. Walking and berries are not going to cut it. We've already established that. I'm recommending a low-dose ACE inhibitor. It’s a common medication, relatively safe, but yes, there are potential side effects - a dry cough, dizziness, fatigue. We’ll monitor you closely for those. We need to get this under control now to prevent serious complications. I’m not willing to simply wait and see while your health deteriorates. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, you’re right. I just… it’s a lot to take in. And I don’t like feeling like something is wrong with me. But… if you really think it’s necessary… then I guess I’ll try the pills. What do I have to do? When do I take them? And… what about my routine shots? Did we forget about those? I came in for my shots, you know. I don’t want to get sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. One step at a time. I’m prescribing Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once daily. Take it in the morning, with or without food. We’ll get a blood test in one month to check your kidney function and make sure you're tolerating it. As for your "routine shots," we can address those after we get your blood pressure under control. It’s simply not a priority right now. Your health is at risk. Now, let's schedule that follow-up appointment. And please, try to be more proactive about your health in the future. This isn't just for me, it's for you. Here. And the nurse will schedule your follow-up before you leave.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I… I’ll try. I really will. It’s just… hard, sometimes. I always put everyone else first. And… is there anything else I should know about the pills? Like, things I shouldn't eat or drink? Or things they might interact with? I just want to be prepared. .
DOCTOR: Avoid salt substitutes containing potassium. And don’t take them with any other blood pressure medication without my knowledge. The nurse will provide you with a detailed information sheet. Honestly, Ms. Fornes, I’ve explained the basics. I have other patients waiting. I'm confident that you'll manage. The nurse will go over the details before you leave. Please follow her instructions carefully. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
