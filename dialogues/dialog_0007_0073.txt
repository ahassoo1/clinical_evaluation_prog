DOCTOR: Hi Triana, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s been… awful. Just awful. I’ve been to doctors about this already, and nothing’s working. It’s… well, it’s diarrhea. Non-stop. And it’s embarrassing to even talk about, frankly. I don’t usually complain, but I'm at my wit's end.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It is frustrating when you've been dealing with something for a while and haven’t found relief. And you're right to seek help – it’s no fun dealing with that on your own. “Non-stop” is helpful, but could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t need a detailed description requested. It’s… liquid. A lot of it. Multiple times a day. I’ve tried… I don’t know… everything the other doctor said. Bland food, those little chalky things… nothing sticks around for long, if you get my drift. It's been going on for weeks now, and I'm just… tired. Really tired. And weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you. Weeks is a long time to be dealing with this. And the tiredness and weakness are concerning. Just to clarify – when you say "weeks," roughly how long?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly, I’ve lost track. At least three weeks, maybe four? It all feels like one long, unpleasant blur. I really don't keep calendars or anything. It just… started, and hasn’t stopped. Is that good enough? I've got things to do, you know. This is taking up a lot of my time.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Three to four weeks is significant. Okay, and has anything changed in your diet or routine around the time this started?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I eat the same things, do the same things. I haven’t been traveling or anything dramatic like that. I'm a painter, I'm usually at home or on a job site. Same routine for years. Frankly, I think the other doctor was just trying to find something to blame, instead of actually, you know, fixing the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, consistently the same routine. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any fever, nausea, or vomiting alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No blood. Definitely no fever. And I haven't been sick to my stomach. Just… this. Constant running to the bathroom. It’s humiliating, honestly. I’m starting to avoid leaving the house. And I really don’t appreciate being asked these… personal questions when we haven’t even figured out what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Triana, and I apologize if the questions feel intrusive. I’m asking because those things can help narrow down the possibilities. We need to rule things out to find the cause. Okay, so no blood, no fever, no vomiting. Have you noticed any abdominal pain or cramping?
PATIENT: A little cramping, sometimes. Not bad pain, just… uncomfortable. Like when you’re really hungry. It comes and goes. Honestly, the whole thing is just… disruptive. I've got work to do, and I can’t exactly run to the bathroom in the middle of a paint job. It's impacting my livelihood. Are you going to actually do something, or just keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: I am gathering information, Triana, and it's important. The cramping is good to know. Let's switch gears a bit. Do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I take a multivitamin, that’s it. And I take it every day, same brand for years. I’m not one of those people with a long list of sensitivities or anything. I'm a pretty simple person, really. And honestly, I think this is a waste of my time. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, just a daily multivitamin. We are getting somewhere; I'm building a picture of what's going on. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu, even if it was mild?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I haven’t been sick in ages. I’m usually pretty healthy. I don’t sit around feeling sorry for myself. I keep busy. I really don't have time for being sick. This… this is just… happening. And nobody seems to be able to figure it out. It’s like they aren’t even listening to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent illness. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I've never had any of those things. I'm a pretty straightforward person. I don’t have a lot of medical problems. I’ve been lucky, usually. And frankly, I find this line of questioning insulting. Are you suggesting I'm making this up? Because that’s what it sounds like.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Triana. That wasn't my intention at all, and I’m very sorry if it came across that way. I’m not suggesting you’re making anything up. I’m just trying to rule out possibilities. It’s important to get a complete picture. Okay, any past surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. I’m a healthy person! I told you that already! Honestly, I think I should just go. This is getting me nowhere, and I have work to do. You’re just asking a bunch of questions that aren’t relevant. Are you even listening to me when I tell you I haven't been sick or had any problems before? .
DOCTOR: Triana, please hold on a moment. I understand your frustration, and I apologize again if I’m not conveying this well. I am listening, and I’m trying to understand what’s going on. It's a process of elimination. Before you go, let me quickly check your electronic health record to see what previous doctors have documented. It might give us a starting point. Would that be alright?
