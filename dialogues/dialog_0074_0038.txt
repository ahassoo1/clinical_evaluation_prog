DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly, it's… a bit difficult to explain. I believe I need some paperwork regarding future medical decisions. Something to… clarify my wishes, should I become unable to speak for myself. I think it's called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I was advised to seek assistance in completing one. It’s all rather vague in my memory, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconi. It is a bit complex, and it’s very responsible of you to be thinking about this now. You’re right, an Advance Directive and a POLST form are both options, and we can certainly discuss which would be most appropriate for you. To start, let’s clarify what you're hoping to achieve with this document. Are you thinking about a broad outline of your wishes for end-of-life care, or are you more concerned with specific medical treatments in the event you are temporarily unable to communicate?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I genuinely don’t recall. I believe the suggestion came about due to… a recent health scare, though the details are… elusive. Perhaps both? I would like to be certain my wishes are known, but I also wouldn’t want to be a burden with overly specific instructions if it’s not truly necessary. It feels… important to have something in place, regardless. Would a broader outline be simpler to begin with? I confess, I’m not very good at remembering specifics.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable approach, Ms. Buoniconi. It sounds like starting with a broader Advance Directive would be the best course of action. It allows us to document your overall values and preferences regarding medical care, and we can always add more specific instructions later if you wish. An Advance Directive typically includes a Living Will, which outlines the types of treatments you would or would not want in various medical scenarios, and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, which designates someone to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. Does that sound like a good starting point?
PATIENT: A Durable Power of Attorney… yes, that sounds sensible. I… believe I discussed that with my solicitor briefly, after the… incident. A Living Will, too. It all feels… very overwhelming, to be frank. I do recall wanting to ensure my sister, Anya, would be the one making decisions. She's… very level-headed. Is there a form I need to fill out, or is this more of a conversation to begin with? I apologize for my… vagueness. It’s frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Buoniconi. It’s perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed, and your vagueness isn’t frustrating me in the slightest. We’ll take it one step at a time. And yes, there are forms involved, but we don’t need to tackle those immediately. Right now, let’s focus on the conversation. I want to understand your values and wishes, and then we can use that to complete the necessary paperwork. First, let’s talk about Anya. You mentioned wanting her to be your Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare. Is she aware of this, and is she willing to take on that responsibility?
PATIENT: Yes, Anya is aware. She… graciously agreed, thankfully. She’s always been the responsible one. We spoke about it after… everything settled. She understands my wishes, generally. I believe I told her I wouldn't want to be kept alive by machines if there was no hope of recovery. Prolonging suffering… that’s my primary concern. I'm not afraid of death, simply of a drawn-out, uncomfortable end. Is that… clear enough? I worry I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: That is very clear, Ms. Buoniconi. And you’re not rambling at all. It’s important to articulate these feelings, and you’re doing a wonderful job. So, to summarize, you want Anya to be your Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, and you’ve expressed a strong desire to avoid prolonged suffering and life support without a reasonable hope of recovery. Now, let's delve a little deeper. Thinking about different medical scenarios, are there any specific treatments you would definitely want, even if your quality of life was significantly diminished?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. I suppose… pain management is paramount. Regardless of the situation, I would want to be kept comfortable. Beyond that… I honestly don’t know. I’ve never been particularly fond of hospitals. I’ve always valued independence, and the thought of being reliant on others… it’s unsettling. I suppose… if there was any possibility of regaining some semblance of my former self, I would be open to treatment. But if it’s simply… extending life for the sake of it, without any quality… then no. It’s a dreadful thought, I realize. I apologize for the morbid tone.
DOCTOR: You’re not morbid at all, Ms. Buoniconi. These are very important and thoughtful considerations, and it’s perfectly natural to feel unsettled discussing them. It’s far better to have these conversations now than to leave things uncertain. So, to clarify, pain management is a high priority for you, and you would be open to treatment if there was a reasonable possibility of regaining some quality of life. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: That’s… another area where my memory is frustratingly vague. I recall a… brief hospital stay a few years ago, for… complications. Nothing serious, I believe. And… some routine check-ups, naturally. But no chronic conditions, as far as I’m aware. I’m generally quite healthy, despite… everything. I did have a… a fall recently, which is what prompted this whole discussion, I think. I don’t recall the specifics of the injury, but it was enough to make Anya insist I get this paperwork sorted. She worries excessively, bless her.
DOCTOR: I see here from your record that you were admitted to City General Hospital on March 12th, 2023, for a fractured femur following a fall. It also notes a brief period of observation for possible concussion. Do you recall anything about that incident?
PATIENT: …City General… yes, that rings a faint bell. A fractured femur… that sounds… unpleasant. And a concussion… vaguely. I remember… a lot of bright lights, and feeling very disoriented. It was… a blur, truthfully. I was mostly concerned with getting home. I don’t… I don’t recall any long-term effects, thankfully. Was there any indication of… more serious injury? I worry I’m being unhelpful. It's like trying to recall a dream. Fragments, but no coherent narrative.
DOCTOR: The notes indicate a relatively uncomplicated recovery from the fracture. You underwent physical therapy and were discharged home within two weeks. There was a brief mention of some post-concussion symptoms – headaches and dizziness – but those resolved with conservative management. The primary concern at the time was your fall risk, which led to a referral to physical therapy for balance and gait training. Do you currently have any headaches, dizziness, or balance problems?
PATIENT: No. Not currently. The headaches and dizziness… I believe I experienced them briefly after the fall, but they subsided quickly. And the balance… I haven't noticed any issues, thankfully. I do try to be more careful now, naturally. I avoid slippery surfaces and… well, I just generally take things slower. But no ongoing problems, no. Perhaps that’s why it’s so difficult to recall the details. If it had been a prolonged or debilitating injury, I’m certain I would remember. It’s all rather frustrating, isn’t it? The gaps in my memory…
DOCTOR: It is frustrating, Ms. Buoniconi, and it's perfectly understandable that you're feeling this way. The fact that your symptoms resolved and you haven't experienced any ongoing problems is a good sign. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. My parents… they were both generally healthy. My mother passed away a few years ago, from… old age, I believe. And my father… he had some minor heart issues, but nothing serious. No history of… cancer, Alzheimer’s, or any other major illnesses, as far as I know. My family wasn’t particularly forthcoming about their medical histories, truthfully. It wasn’t something we discussed openly. It's another gap in my knowledge, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Buoniconi. It’s common for families not to discuss medical histories openly. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but very rarely. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I lead a very… quiet life, truthfully. I prefer reading and… etching. It’s a solitary hobby, but I find it very fulfilling. I believe in moderation in all things.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Buoniconi. And etching sounds lovely. Finally, let's talk about allergies and current medications. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I have no known allergies. And I’m not currently taking any medications. I occasionally use a topical cream for… dry skin, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, truthfully. I pride myself on maintaining my health naturally. I believe I’ve answered all your questions, Doctor. I hope I haven’t been too… rambling or unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Buoniconi. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions so thoroughly. It sounds like you're in good health overall, and it’s admirable that you prioritize a natural approach to wellness. Based on what you’ve told me, and the information in your record, I believe completing an Advance Directive and appointing Anya as your Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare is a very reasonable course of action. Before we proceed, I want to confirm that you understand the implications of this document. It will allow Anya to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself, and it will reflect your wishes regarding treatments and end-of-life care. Are you comfortable with that understanding?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… precisely what I want. I trust Anya implicitly, and I want her to be able to advocate for my wishes if I am unable to do so myself. The thought of being… helpless and unable to communicate… it’s frightening. Knowing she’s there, and will honor my preferences… that brings me a great deal of comfort. I understand the implications, Doctor. And yes, I am comfortable proceeding. I believe it’s a necessary step, regardless of my… fragmented memory. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Buoniconi. I’m glad to hear that. Alright, then. We can begin the process of completing the Advance Directive. I have a form here that outlines the key considerations. I'll walk you through each section, and we can discuss your preferences in detail. It’s a bit lengthy, but we’ll take it at your own pace. Would you like to begin now, or would you prefer to take a break and start later?
PATIENT: Let's begin now, if you don't mind. I'd rather get it over with, truthfully. The sooner it's completed, the better. Though… perhaps we could start with the simplest section first? I confess, I'm a little overwhelmed by the thought of navigating all the legal jargon. I trust your guidance, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconi. We’ll absolutely start with the simplest section first. This first part simply confirms your identity and designates Anya as your healthcare proxy. It’s mostly just factual information. Here, we just need your full name, date of birth, and address. Then, in this section, we'll write Anya's full name, address, and phone number. Do you have that information readily available, or would you like me to provide a form for her details?
PATIENT: Yes, I have her details. Though… my handwriting isn't what it used to be. Anya’s full name is Anya VOLKOV. Her address is… 14 Birchwood Lane, Willow Creek. And her phone number is… 555-123-4567. I hope that’s legible. I apologize for the slowness.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly legible, Ms. Buoniconi. Don't apologize at all. We have plenty of time. Excellent. Now, the next section asks for Anya’s relationship to you. We’ll simply write “Sister” here. Then, it asks for an alternate healthcare proxy, in case Anya is unavailable. Do you have someone in mind for that role?
PATIENT: An alternate… hmm. That’s… a good question. I hadn’t considered that. Perhaps… my cousin, Dimitri? He’s… reliable, and lives nearby. Though, we haven’t been particularly close in recent years. His full name is Dimitri BUONICONTI. His address is… 22 Oak Avenue, Willow Creek. And his phone number is… 555-987-6543. I… I hope that’s acceptable. I'm not certain he’d be thrilled to take on that responsibility.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly acceptable, Ms. Buoniconi. It's good to have a backup plan, even if he isn't your closest relative. We'll simply document his information here. Okay, now we're moving on to the more substantive part of the document. This section outlines your wishes regarding medical treatments in various scenarios. We'll start with Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, or CPR. Would you like us to document that you want CPR performed if your heart or breathing stops?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I… I suppose I’m not certain. I’ve always believed in doing everything possible to preserve life. But… I’ve also read about the potential for… complications and suffering. Perhaps… it would be best to document that I do want CPR performed, unless there’s absolutely no chance of recovery? I trust the medical professionals to make the best decision in that situation. It’s… a frightening thought, to be honest. Is that… a reasonable approach?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable approach, Ms. Buoniconi. It's perfectly acceptable to document that you want CPR attempted unless there's no reasonable chance of recovery. We call that a "qualified" consent. We'll document that here. Now, let's move on to Mechanical Ventilation. This refers to using a machine to help you breathe if you are unable to breathe on your own. Would you like us to document your wishes regarding mechanical ventilation?
PATIENT: That… that’s even more difficult. I… I’ve seen what that entails. The tubes, the discomfort… I believe I would want to avoid mechanical ventilation if possible. Unless it was a temporary measure, to allow me time to recover. But if there was absolutely no hope of improvement… I would not want to be kept alive by a machine. It’s… a dreadful thought, to be clear. But I believe in quality of life, not simply prolonging existence. Would it be possible to document something along those lines? "Avoid mechanical ventilation unless temporary and with reasonable hope of recovery"?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconi. We can absolutely document that. That’s a very clear and thoughtful wish. Now, let's talk about Artificial Nutrition and Hydration – that’s providing fluids and nutrients through a feeding tube if you’re unable to eat or drink on your own. Would you like us to document your wishes regarding artificial nutrition and hydration?
PATIENT: That… that’s perhaps the most difficult one yet. I… I’ve seen what that entails as well. The tubes, the potential for infection… It feels… undignified. I believe… I would not want to be kept alive by artificial nutrition and hydration if there was no reasonable hope of recovery. It feels… unnatural. It’s… a dreadful thought, to be clear. But I believe in allowing nature to take its course. Would it be possible to document something along those lines? "Do not provide artificial nutrition and hydration if no reasonable hope of recovery"? I apologize for the… morbid tone. It’s just… difficult to contemplate.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Buoniconi. You’re not morbid at all. These are very important decisions, and it’s perfectly natural to feel unsettled contemplating them. We’re getting through this, Ms. Buoniconi. You’re articulating your wishes very clearly. Now, the final section of this part of the document relates to pain management. Would you like us to document your wishes regarding pain relief?
PATIENT: Yes. Absolutely. I would want to be kept comfortable, regardless of the situation. I would want adequate pain relief, even if it meant… shortening my life slightly. I believe in quality of life, and suffering serves no purpose. Would it be possible to document something along those lines? "Provide adequate pain relief, even if it shortens life expectancy"? I believe that's the most important thing, truly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconi. That’s a very reasonable and compassionate wish. There. We’ve completed the first part of the Advance Directive. We've documented your wishes regarding CPR, mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration, and pain management. Now, the next step is to sign and date this form in the presence of a witness. Do you have someone here with you who can act as a witness?
PATIENT: No, I don’t, unfortunately. I came alone. Is that… a problem? I suppose I could ask the receptionist to witness it? Would that be acceptable? I apologize for the inconvenience. I didn't anticipate needing a witness.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconi. Don't apologize at all. We can absolutely ask the receptionist to act as a witness. I'll just quickly ask her if she's available. Just one moment. Sarah, would you mind acting as a witness for Ms. Buoniconi?
PATIENT: "Of course, Dr. Reisig. Happy to help."
DOCTOR: Excellent. There we go. Now, Ms. Buoniconi, you have a legally binding document outlining your wishes regarding medical care. I recommend keeping this form in a safe place and informing your loved ones about its existence. We've completed the Advance Directive portion today. Do you want to discuss the POLST form now?
PATIENT: Thank you, Sarah. Thank you, Doctor. A POLST form? I believe… I’d like to hear about it first. If it's significantly different from the Advance Directive, perhaps I’ll defer it for another day. I feel… rather overwhelmed as it is. What exactly is a POLST form, and how does it differ from this document? I apologize for my… indecisiveness. It's just… a lot to process.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconi. It is a lot to process, and it’s wise to take things at your own pace. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a medical order, unlike an Advance Directive which is a statement of your wishes. It’s essentially a set of specific instructions for your healthcare providers, outlining what treatments you want and don’t want in the event you're unable to communicate. It's typically used for individuals with serious illnesses or frailty, who are likely to need emergency medical care. It covers things like CPR, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition, similar to the Advance Directive, but it’s more specific and legally binding. Unlike the Advance Directive which might require interpretation, a POLST form provides clear, actionable orders. It's also often a brightly colored form that accompanies you to the hospital or other medical settings. Would you like me to go into more detail about each section of the POLST form, or would you prefer to defer it for another appointment?
PATIENT: That… that makes sense. A medical order, rather than a statement of wishes. I believe… I’d like to hear more about it, but perhaps not today. I’m rather exhausted, and I think I need some time to process everything we’ve discussed already. Could we schedule another appointment to discuss the POLST form in more detail? I truly appreciate your patience and guidance, Doctor. This has been… a daunting experience, but you’ve made it much easier.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconi. You've been very brave discussing these difficult topics today. And you are right, this is a lot to take in. Let's schedule another appointment for next week. Would Tuesday afternoon work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Tuesday afternoon would be perfect. Thank you, Doctor. I believe that’s all for today. And again, thank you for your patience and understanding. I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve made a note of that. You’re very welcome, Ms. Buoniconi. It was my pleasure to assist you. Have a wonderful day, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before our next appointment.
