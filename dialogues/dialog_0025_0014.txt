DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, my wife, bless her heart, she said I need to get some papers signed. Something about… time off? Or maybe help with things… I honestly can't quite recall exactly what she said. It’s about work, I think. I’m with the church, you know, directors… religious activities. It's all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's… helpful. Let’s try to clarify things a bit. You said something about papers for work, with the church. Are you experiencing any health concerns that might require documentation, like needing time off due to illness or injury?
PATIENT: Hmm… illness… injury… Well, I've been a little… tired lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. And my back… my back aches a bit, but that’s just getting old, isn’t it? I don't know if that's serious enough for papers… My wife thought it was, but she worries about everything. Honestly, I can’t really pinpoint anything specific. It just feels like… things aren’t quite right. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Things aren’t quite right.” Okay. We'll try to get to the bottom of it. Tiredness and back pain are certainly reasons to investigate. Let’s start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling unusually tired?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… It's been… a while. Maybe a few months? It comes and goes, you know? Some days I feel alright, and others… well, others I just want to nap all afternoon. It’s hard to say exactly when it started, to be honest. My memory isn't what it used to be. It’s not sudden, it just… crept up on me, I guess.
DOCTOR: “Crept up on me.” Alright. And is this tiredness interfering with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a little. It makes it hard to focus during meetings, you know? Directing religious activities takes a lot of concentration. And… well, my wife likes me to help with things around the house. Gardening mostly. I used to really enjoy it, but lately, I just don’t have the energy. I end up sitting down a lot more than I used to. I feel bad about that.
DOCTOR: So, you’re experiencing fatigue that’s impacting your work and hobbies. And you mentioned back pain. Is the back pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. It’s worse after I’ve been… trying to help with the garden, or if I bend over too much. Sometimes it just aches all day, a dull sort of ache, but other times I barely notice it. It hasn’t stopped me from doing things entirely, but it’s… uncomfortable, you know? Like a constant reminder I’m getting old. And sometimes it shoots down my leg a little, that’s new. Not terrible, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Shooting down the leg is important. Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, let’s do a quick physical exam. We'll start with your back. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Careful now… old bones, you know. Is this about the papers? Will the exam help with that? I just want to make sure my wife doesn't worry needlessly. She’s a good woman, but… she worries.
DOCTOR: The exam will help me understand what’s going on with your back and fatigue, which may require documentation for work. Let's see… can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof… not as easily as I used to. That’s about as far as I can go, Doctor. It feels… tight. Everything feels tight. I used to be much more flexible, you know. Back in my younger days... playing rugby. It's a long story.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see. Now, can you walk on your heels for a few steps?
PATIENT: Walk on my heels…? Oh, alright. Like this…? It’s a bit wobbly, Doctor. I haven't done this in years. Is this normal? I feel a bit silly.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It's part of the exam. Now, can you walk on your toes for a few steps?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It's... difficult. My calves are starting to ache already. This is all a bit much, isn’t it? I just want to get back to normal. Is something seriously wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, please have a seat. Based on this quick exam, you have some limitations in your range of motion and some difficulty with your gait. This, combined with the pain radiating down your leg, suggests some potential nerve involvement. I want to order some imaging – an X-ray of your lower back and an MRI to get a clearer picture of what’s going on with the nerves in your spine. We’ll also do some blood work to rule out any underlying inflammation or other causes of fatigue.
PATIENT: Imaging…? MRI…? Oh, dear. That sounds… serious. Is it something terrible, Doctor? Will I need surgery? My wife will be beside herself… I just wanted some papers for time off, not… all this. What about the papers… will I get the papers?
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, let’s not jump to conclusions. Imaging doesn’t automatically mean surgery. It simply gives us more information to make an accurate diagnosis. The papers… yes, we can address that. I'm happy to provide a note stating you’ve been evaluated and are undergoing further testing, which may qualify you for short-term disability, depending on your employer’s policies. However, I need to determine the cause of your symptoms first before I can give a definitive recommendation. The MRI and X-ray will help me do that. Now, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never had any problems with… medicine or anything. My wife always says I’m too stoic, I don’t complain enough. She worries about that too. No allergies… no, I’m pretty sure. But I haven’t seen a doctor in… well, a long time. Maybe I’ve forgotten something?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, just a little something for my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. A small white pill, I think. I take one every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s only when it’s really bothering me. That's all, I think. Nothing else. My wife keeps track of all that stuff, usually. I have a terrible memory, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. What is the name of the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it’s on the tip of my tongue… it starts with a… a ‘L’… or maybe a ‘M’? My wife always refills it, I don't pay much attention. It’s a small white pill, like I said. I really wish I could remember the name… it’s… frustrating. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s essential for me to know what you’re taking to avoid potential drug interactions. I will need you to check with your wife or your pharmacy to find out the exact name and dosage. For now, let's focus on scheduling those imaging tests. I'll have my nurse give you the orders and instructions. She can also help you schedule the appointments. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don’t think so. Just… will the tests hurt? And how long will they take? My wife and I have a church event next week… I wouldn't want to miss that. And… the papers? Will I definitely get the papers for time off?
DOCTOR: The tests themselves shouldn’t be painful, Mr. Limtiaco. The MRI is a bit noisy, and you’ll need to lie still for about 30-45 minutes. The X-ray is quick—just a few seconds. As for the event and the papers, we'll do our best to accommodate your schedule. The nurse will explain everything thoroughly. I’m happy to provide a note stating you’re under evaluation, which may qualify you for short-term disability, pending your employer’s policies. But a definitive determination requires the results of the tests. Let me have my nurse, Patricia, come in and get you set up with the orders and scheduling information. Patricia!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… a relief. Patricia, you say? That’s a nice name. I hope she’s a good scheduler. My wife is very particular about these things. Hopefully, it won't take too long… the church event is important.
DOCTOR: We’ll do our best, Mr. Limtiaco. Patricia is very efficient. I’ll leave you in her capable hands. I'll review the imaging results as soon as they're available. .
PATIENT: .
