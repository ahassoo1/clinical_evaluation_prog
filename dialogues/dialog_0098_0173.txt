DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Bombara, nice to meet you too. Well, I've just been getting these chills, you know? Not like a fever chill, just…cold. It's been happening on and off for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills…on and off for a few days. And just to clarify, you haven’t had a fever accompanying these chills?
PATIENT: No, no fever. That's what's weird! I felt a little tired, maybe, but definitely not hot or anything. Just…brrr. Like I need a sweater even when it's warm.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where are you feeling these chills most prominently?
PATIENT: Hmm, good question. It's not really one place, you know? Sometimes it's my arms, sometimes my legs, even my back. It kind of moves around. It's not like a muscle ache, though. Just…coldness. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to describe. So, it's generalized chills, moving around, not associated with muscle pain, and no fever. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these chills, or anything that makes them better?
PATIENT: That's a good way to put it, "generalized." And… honestly, not really. I haven't noticed anything specific. I thought maybe being tired made it worse, but I've been resting a lot lately, and it still happens. Nothing seems to help them go away either, really. Just waiting it out, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside these chills – things like a cough, sore throat, headache, any changes in your appetite or sleep?
PATIENT: Let me think… No cough, no sore throat. Maybe a little bit of a headache a couple of times, but nothing major. And my appetite is normal, I think. Sleep… yeah, sleep has been pretty good, actually. So, no, nothing else really stands out. Just the chills. It's just…annoying, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I don't really have a lot of medical problems, thankfully. I had chickenpox as a kid, and I broke my arm once, but that's about it. No allergies that I know of, and I don't take any regular medications. I had a divorce a couple of years ago, so I've been under a bit of stress, but…that’s not a medical thing, right? I have private insurance, thankfully. I go for regular check-ups when I can, but it’s been a while.
DOCTOR: No, that’s good to know. Stress can certainly impact your health, and it’s important to acknowledge that. No allergies or regular medications, that’s helpful. And you said you haven’t been to the doctor in a while...do you recall when your last physical was?
PATIENT: Ugh, that's embarrassing. Probably…almost three years ago? Maybe a little longer. It's been hectic, and honestly, I just haven't made it a priority. I know, I know, I should have. It was before the divorce, I think. Sorry, I'm not very good with dates.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jailenne. Life happens. Okay, well, given this is a bit of a check-up as well as addressing these chills, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature and blood pressure, and have a look at your throat and skin. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I'm happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just hop up on the table for me. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Okay, deep breath in…and out. Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from the conversation, or even just a bit of anxiety. Blood pressure is slightly on the higher side of normal… 132 over 84. Now, let's take your temperature… 98.6, so that's normal. Your throat looks clear, no signs of redness or swelling. Skin looks good as well. Now, can you tell me if you've noticed any recent weight changes, like gaining or losing weight without trying?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. I think I might have gained a little bit of weight, maybe 5 pounds? It's probably just from…comfort eating, honestly. Things have been stressful, and I tend to snack. Nothing major, but I've noticed my clothes feeling a little tighter. I'm usually around 150 pounds, but I think I'm closer to 155 right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And just one more quick thing. I'm going to feel your lymph nodes, just to rule anything out. Your lymph nodes feel normal – no swelling or tenderness. Everything feels okay so far physically, but given your history of recent chills, the slightly elevated blood pressure, and a small amount of recent weight gain, I’d like to order some basic bloodwork. It’ll just be a routine check to rule out any underlying infections or thyroid issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. I'm happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to figure out what's going on. Thyroid issues…run in my family, actually. My aunt on my mother's side had something with her thyroid, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good to know. We'll definitely include a thyroid panel in the bloodwork. I'll have the lab technician draw some blood right away. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. While we're waiting for those results, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, not really. You've covered everything pretty thoroughly, I think. I appreciate you listening and taking everything seriously. I guess… how long will it take to get the results back? And will I need to come back in for another appointment?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. It's my job. The bloodwork typically takes 2-3 business days to come back. The lab technician will let you know when they are available, and my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if the chills become more severe, you develop a fever, or you experience any other concerning symptoms – please don't hesitate to call the office right away, or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds perfect. 2-3 days is fine. And I will definitely call if anything changes. Thank you so much, Dr. Bombara. I feel a lot better just knowing we're checking things out.
