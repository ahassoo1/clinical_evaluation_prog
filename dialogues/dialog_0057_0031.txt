DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg is awfully swollen. It’s been happening on and off, but it's worse today, and I know I have... a funny heartbeat sometimes. The teachers at the school told me about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Swelling in the leg and noticing a funny heartbeat… that's good information to start with. When you say “on and off,” how long has this been happening in total?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started maybe… six months ago? It comes and goes, like a few days it’s fine, then a few days it's not. It’s hard to say exactly, I don’t really keep track, to be honest. It hasn't been too bad until recently, though.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we’ll figure it out. Six months is helpful to know. And you mentioned it's worse recently – can you describe what “worse” feels like?
PATIENT: Well, normally it’s just a bit puffy around my ankle, you know? But today, it's up to my calf, and it feels… tight. And it’s a bit painful to walk on it, if I stand for too long. It's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like it's really heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling extending up to your calf, tightness, and discomfort with prolonged standing. That gives me a clearer picture. And you said the teachers at school mentioned a funny heartbeat?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I was feeling a bit poorly one day at work, and one of them noticed I was looking a bit pale. She's a trained nurse, actually, and she felt my pulse and said it was... irregular. She told me to get it checked out. She used a word... like, a fluttering, or something? She said it could be something serious, so I made an appointment. I don’t really understand all of it, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, that's what I’m here for. “Irregular” and “fluttering” are good descriptions. It’s good your teacher noticed and recommended you get it checked out. To get a better understanding, can you tell me more about when you notice this irregular heartbeat?
PATIENT: It doesn't happen all the time, Doctor. Sometimes I don't notice it at all for days. But when it does happen, it's usually when I’m a bit stressed, or if I’ve had a lot of caffeine. Like, if I’ve had too many cups of tea at work. It feels like my chest is… jumping, almost. Not painful, but definitely noticeable. And it makes me a bit breathless sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be related to stress and caffeine intake, and you’ve noticed some breathlessness with it. That’s helpful. Now, just to cover some general health questions, have you had any other symptoms lately, like chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath when not related to the irregular heartbeat?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I haven’t had any chest pain. I get a bit tired, sometimes, but that’s usually just from work. And I get a little dizzy if I stand up too quickly, but I always thought that was just me being clumsy. Nothing too worrying, I haven’t had anything sudden or serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And have you had any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Um… well, I broke my arm when I was a little girl, but that healed fine. And I get migraines sometimes, but I’ve had them for years, and they don’t bother me too much. Other than that, I don’t think so. I’ve not been to the doctor much, if I’m honest. I usually just try to rest when I'm poorly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of a broken arm and migraines, but otherwise generally healthy. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries, Doctor. Nothing like that. I’m not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. It always makes me a bit nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart problems, blood clots, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think... My grandfather, on my mother’s side, had a weak heart, I think. He was always a bit poorly when I was little, and he had to take pills. And my aunt, she had a blood clot in her leg after an operation, but I don't know much about it. Other than that, I don’t think so. My family are generally quite healthy, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of a weak heart in your grandfather and a blood clot in your aunt. That’s important information. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not taking any medications at all. Just the occasional paracetamol for my migraines, if they get really bad. And I take a multivitamin sometimes, but I've been a bit forgetful about it lately. That’s it, really. I try to stay away from pills if I can, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. No regular medications. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Please go ahead. I’m a bit nervous, but I’ll try to be still. Just tell me if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. I do hear a slightly irregular rhythm, and a bit of a rapid rate. I'll document that as "Irregular heart rate with tachycardia noted on auscultation." Next, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 120/80, which is normal, and your pulse is 98, which is a little elevated, consistent with what I heard with my stethoscope. Now, I want to take a look at your left leg. Can you point to where the swelling is the worst?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It's mostly here, in my calf, as you can see. It feels quite tight, and it’s a bit tender to touch. It’s a bit red as well, I think, but it's hard to tell for sure. Oh, that’s a bit sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, I can definitely feel the swelling and tenderness. There’s also some warmth to the touch. I'm going to measure the circumference of your calf and compare it to your other leg. Your left calf is 2 centimeters larger in circumference than your right calf. I’m documenting that as “2cm difference in circumference between left and right calf, with tenderness and warmth to palpation noted.” Given your symptoms and what I’m finding on the exam – the irregular heartbeat, the swelling, tenderness, and warmth in your leg – it’s important to rule out a few things. One possibility is deep vein thrombosis , which is a blood clot in a deep vein. Another possibility could be a muscle strain or infection. While a DVT is less likely given your age, it’s important to investigate. To help us figure this out, I'd like to order a D-dimer blood test, which can help rule out a blood clot. I’d also like to order an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear, a blood clot sounds a bit scary, Doctor. But if it rules it out, then it's good, I suppose. An EKG… that sounds complicated. If you think it’s necessary, then yes, please go ahead. I trust your judgement. Just… tell me what's happening, if you don’t mind. I get a bit worried easily. What does the D-dimer test involve? Is it a lot of needles?
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking questions, Nixon. It’s perfectly normal to be worried, and I want you to feel comfortable and informed. The D-dimer test is just a simple blood draw. It’s not a lot of needles, honestly. It's similar to getting blood taken for a routine checkup. A phlebotomist will just take a small sample of blood from your arm. It doesn't take long at all. The EKG is also painless. It involves placing some small, sticky pads called electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs. These pads measure the electrical activity of your heart and give us a picture of your heart rhythm. It won't take long either. We're just gathering information to help us understand what's going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean there's something seriously wrong, but it’s important to rule things out. While we wait for the results, I’d recommend keeping your left leg elevated as much as possible and avoiding prolonged standing. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor, that makes me feel a lot better. Knowing it’s not too painful is reassuring. I’ll try to keep my leg up as much as possible. And no, I don’t have any allergies, to my knowledge. I've never had a bad reaction to any medication before. Paracetamol is fine, and I’ve had antibiotics a few times, but I can’t remember any problems with those either. I'm usually very careful about what I take, though.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Okay, I'm going to write up the orders for the D-dimer test and EKG, and then we’ll get you scheduled. It should be fairly quick. The phlebotomist is just down the hall, and the EKG technician usually has availability this afternoon. While you are waiting, I would like to ask a few more questions about your social history. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, right, social history. No, Doctor, I don’t smoke, and I’ve never smoked a day in my life. I don’t really like the smell of it, to be honest. And I don’t use any other tobacco products either. My parents always said it was bad for you, and I listened.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have the occasional glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Maybe once or twice a week, if that. I don’t drink very much, and I certainly don’t binge drink or anything like that. Just a small glass to relax, if I've had a long day at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional, moderate alcohol consumption. And are you currently working or in school?
PATIENT: I am working, Doctor. I'm a Computer Science Teacher at the local school. It's quite a demanding job, actually, but I enjoy it. We're very busy at the moment, preparing for the new term. I’m also in my final year of my teaching qualification, so there’s a lot of coursework as well. That’s probably why I’ve been a bit stressed lately.
DOCTOR: That sounds busy indeed! Stress from work and school definitely can contribute to some of these symptoms. Okay, Nixon, I've ordered the D-dimer and EKG. The results should be available within a few hours. Once we have those results, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe pain in your leg, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. That sounds good. No, I don’t think so… Just… what would happen if it is a blood clot? What’s the treatment like? I’m probably being silly, worrying about things, but it's better to know, I suppose. And, how long will I have to wait for the results? I have a bit of preparation to do for work, if I can.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly to ask questions at all, Nixon, it’s very responsible of you. Knowing what to expect is always a good thing. If the D-dimer comes back positive, it doesn’t automatically mean you have a blood clot, but it would warrant further investigation, usually with an ultrasound of your leg. If a blood clot is confirmed, the standard treatment is anticoagulation, or blood thinners. These medications help prevent the clot from growing and reduce the risk of further clots. They are typically taken orally or by injection. The treatment duration depends on several factors, but it’s usually several months, at least. As for how long you’ll have to wait for the results, I expect them within two to three hours. I will have the nurse call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, try to rest and elevate your leg. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Thank you very much, Doctor. That’s really helpful to know. I feel a bit better now, knowing what to expect. No, I think that’s everything. I’ll try to rest and wait for the nurse to call. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll be in touch if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Have a restful afternoon, and I'll talk to you soon.
