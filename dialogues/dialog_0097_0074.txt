DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Well, my blood pressure’s been actin’ up, that’s what the nice nurse said. Been feelin’ a little…flustered, I guess, and she wanted me to come get it checked. Don't really understand all the numbers, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna, that’s perfectly alright. We can definitely sort that out. “Flustered” is a good way to put it – can you tell me a little more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well…kinda like when you get really mad, but it ain’t always about somethin’. Just…a tightness in my chest, and my head feels kinda swimmy. Sometimes I get a little dizzy too. It don’t last long, usually, just comes and goes. Been happenin’ more lately, though. Especially when I’m bakin’. All that heat, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness in the chest, swimmy head, dizziness…and it seems to be happening more often, particularly when you're baking. That’s helpful to know. When you say “more lately,” about how long has this been going on, and how often would you say it happens now compared to, say, a month ago?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…oh, maybe three, four months ago? Not too bad then, just once in a while. But now…seems like most days when I'm in the kitchen for long. Maybe two or three times a day if I’m makin’ a big batch of bread. It used to be just when I was really tired, but now it seems to happen even when I feel alright startin’ out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s progressing – happening more frequently and now even when you're not feeling particularly tired. That's important. Do you notice anything else that seems to trigger it besides baking?
PATIENT: Not really. Sometimes when I’m visitin’ with my grandkids, if they get real rambunctious. But that’s usually just a little bit of a fluster, not like when I’m bakin’. And…well, sometimes when I think about my husband. He’s been gone five years now. Still gets to me sometimes, even after all this time. Not often, though. Mostly it's the bakin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can certainly bring on those feelings, and it's perfectly normal that it still affects you. But focusing on the baking – that seems to be the most consistent trigger right now. When you say "flustered," is it accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well... sometimes my hands get a little shaky. Not bad enough to drop things, but enough that I gotta hold my cup a little tighter. And…sometimes I get a little short of breath. Like I can't quite fill my lungs all the way. It don't last long, just a few breaths, and then it's gone. Mostly it's just the tightness and the swimmy head, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, shaky hands and shortness of breath accompanying the tightness and dizziness. That gives us a bit more to work with. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or are you taking any medications for it currently?
PATIENT: No, never been told I had it before. Doc checked it a few times when I broke my wrist a couple years back, but said it was fine then. And no, I ain't takin' nothin' for it. Just my arthritis medicine, for my hands. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what is the name of the medication you take for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see… rummages in her purse, pulling out a small pill bottle It’s…Naproxen. Two of 'em, twice a day. That’s what the doctor told me. It helps some, but my hands still get stiff sometimes, especially in the cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen twice a day for arthritis. Thank you. Now, let's get a better idea of what's going on with your blood pressure. Would you mind if I took your blood pressure and listened to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go right ahead, Doctor. I trust you. It's probably just somethin' with the heat, I reckon. But it's good to check, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated – 158 over 88. Your pulse is regular, but a bit on the faster side at 88 beats per minute. I'm hearing some normal breath sounds, but there’s a slight wheeze on both sides when you take a deep breath. I also feel a bit of swelling in your ankles. Do you usually have swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Them numbers don’t mean nothin’ to me. Just tell me if it's bad. And…a wheeze? I don’t know what that is. As for my ankles…yes, they been a little puffy lately. I thought it was just from standin’ too long in the kitchen. It’s worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been bakin’ all day. It ain’t too bad, though. Mostly just feels…tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna. Those numbers do indicate your blood pressure is higher than we’d like. The wheezing is a whistling sound when you breathe, and it can suggest some narrowing of the airways. And the swelling, combined with the wheezing, is something we need to investigate further. Now, have you ever had any problems with asthma or allergies?
PATIENT: No, never. Not as a child, not as an adult. I used to spend a lot of time outside when I was little, runnin’ around in the woods with my cousins, but never had no trouble breathin’. And I ain’t got no allergies that I know of. Sometimes I get a little itchy when the pollen’s real bad, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay. And thinking about your family history – do you know if anyone in your family has had high blood pressure, heart problems, or asthma?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me see. My mama, she had high blood pressure towards the end of her life. Had to take pills for it, I think. And my grandpa on my daddy's side, he had a real bad heart. Passed away when he was pretty young, I reckon. But nobody that I know of had asthma.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure and heart problems. That's helpful to know. Now, I'd like to run a few tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would you be okay with a blood test and an EKG – that's a simple test that checks your heart's electrical activity?
PATIENT: Tests…well, I don’t like needles much, but if you think it’s important, I guess so. And that…EKG thing…does it hurt? I'm an old woman, Doctor. I don’t bounce back like I used to.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Venna. The blood test will be a small amount of blood drawn from your arm – it’s usually just a quick pinch, and then it’s over. And the EKG is completely painless. We just attach some small stickers to your chest, arms, and legs, and it records your heart’s activity. It doesn’t involve any needles at all. The results will help us determine the cause of your blood pressure and shortness of breath. We might also want to consider a chest X-ray to rule out any lung issues, but let's start with the blood test and EKG and see what those tell us. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. If it don't involve no needles right now, I guess I can do that. Blood test and that…EKG thing. But you gotta promise me it won’t take too long. I got a batch of bread in the oven, and I don’t want it to burn.
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise we'll be as quick as possible, Venna. And I'll make sure to let the nurse know about your bread! Let's head over to the lab now, and we'll get these tests done. It shouldn't take more than 20-30 minutes, and then we can discuss the results and make a plan. Would you like me to walk with you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. My knees ain’t what they used to be. Let’s get this over with, then. Hopefully, it's just somethin' simple. And I really do need to check on that bread…
