DOCTOR: Good morning, Mande. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Asami. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling… unwell after eating fava beans. I get really tired, and I’ve noticed my skin and eyes are kind of yellow. It started a few weeks ago, and it only happens after I eat them. I love fava beans, so this is a bit of a problem!
DOCTOR: Okay, that is interesting. Tiredness and yellowing of the skin and eyes… that’s something we need to look into. Just to clarify, does this happen every time you eat fava beans, and how much do you usually eat when it triggers this?
PATIENT: Yes, it happens every time, as far as I can tell. And it doesn’t have to be a huge amount, either. Even a normal serving… like, what you’d put on a plate with dinner… that’s enough to make me feel sick. It usually takes a day or so for it to really show up, the tiredness and the yellowing. It's not immediate, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A delayed reaction is helpful information. And the fact that it's consistent with fava bean consumption is definitely a clue. We're going to need to explore this a little further. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything before?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of, no. I've been generally healthy, thankfully. I've had the usual colds and flu, of course, but nothing serious. No major illnesses or anything like that. I’ve never really needed to see a doctor much before this.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. I try to be careful, you know? I'm not a fan of hospitals if I can avoid them. This whole thing with the fava beans is really worrying me, honestly. I've never experienced anything like it before.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mande. It's always unsettling when something new and unexplained happens with your health. Let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – anything that your parents or siblings have dealt with?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had some problems with her stomach, she always complained of indigestion, but it wasn’t anything seriously diagnosed, just… a sensitive stomach, I suppose. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. He was a smoker, so it was probably related to that. As far as I know, there weren’t any other major illnesses on either side of the family. Nothing like… genetic conditions or anything. Actually, now that I think about it, my uncle, on my mother's side, he was always a bit… pale, and tired a lot. But he lived in Romania, and we didn't see him often. I don't know what was wrong with him, if anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Stomach issues and high blood pressure… and the uncle with fatigue and paleness… We’ll keep those in mind. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I don't smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine once or twice a year, and I definitely don't use any recreational drugs. I try to live a pretty healthy life, honestly. I eat a lot of vegetables, and I try to get regular exercise. That's why this whole thing is so baffling! I eat well, I exercise… why would this be happening to me?
DOCTOR: That is puzzling, and it’s good to know you prioritize your health. It helps us narrow down potential causes. One last few questions for now. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I can eat pretty much anything… except fava beans, apparently! It's almost comical, isn't it? I love them, and they make me sick. I've always been able to eat everything without issue.
DOCTOR: It’s certainly… specific. Alright, Mande, thank you for all that information. It’s been very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if there are any obvious signs. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your skin and eyes a little more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I’m ready when you are. I just want to figure out what's going on and get back to enjoying my life… and maybe even a fava bean or two, someday.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. And again… Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please just relax and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. It feels… normal, I guess. A little pressure, but no pain at all. I’ve always had a fairly strong stomach, so I'm not easily bothered. I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. It makes me feel a bit better knowing you're looking into everything.
DOCTOR: I'm just checking for any signs of jaundice – that yellowing of the skin and eyes you mentioned. Yes, I do see a slight yellowing, it’s subtle, but it’s there. And your skin looks a little pale overall. Now, let me check your sclera – the whites of your eyes. Yes, there's a definite yellow tinge there as well. Okay, so based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, we're seeing signs consistent with jaundice and anemia. The history of it being triggered by fava beans is very suggestive of a condition called Favism – a genetic deficiency of an enzyme called G6PD. It causes your red blood cells to break down when exposed to certain triggers, like fava beans. However, we need to confirm this with a blood test. It will measure your G6PD levels and give us a definitive answer. Would you be okay with getting a blood test?
PATIENT: Favism… I’ve never heard of that. A genetic deficiency… so it’s something I was born with? Yes, a blood test sounds fine. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. Is it a simple test? Will it take long to get the results? And… if it is Favism, is it serious? Is there a treatment? I have so many questions!
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly natural to have a lot of questions, Mande. Let's take them one at a time. Yes, Favism is a genetic condition, meaning you're born with it. It affects how your red blood cells function. The blood test is fairly simple – just a standard blood draw. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, maybe 3-5 business days. As for how serious it is, it varies. Some people with G6PD deficiency have no symptoms at all, while others experience complications like anemia, jaundice, and in rare cases, more serious issues. The key is to avoid triggers like fava beans. The treatment is primarily supportive – managing the symptoms of anemia with fluids and, if necessary, blood transfusions. It's not a condition that requires ongoing medication for most people, as long as you avoid the triggers. We won’t jump to any conclusions until we have the test results. But based on everything you’ve told me, Favism is a strong possibility. I’m going to order the blood test now, and once we have the results, we can discuss a plan. In the meantime, I would strongly recommend avoiding fava beans and any products that might contain them. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… a lot to take in. Avoiding fava beans… I can definitely do that. I'll check all the labels carefully. And I’ll wait for the test results. What about other foods? Are there any other things I should avoid? And is it something my family should be tested for, too? If it's genetic, wouldn't they be at risk?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mande. As for other foods, there aren’t typically any other dietary restrictions with G6PD deficiency. Fava beans are the primary trigger. However, some medications can also trigger a reaction, so it’s important to tell any doctor who prescribes you something that you have G6PD deficiency. We can discuss a list of medications to be cautious with once we have the test results. And yes, you’re right to ask about your family. G6PD deficiency is an X-linked genetic condition, meaning it’s carried on the X chromosome. This means that men are more likely to be affected, while women can be carriers. It would be wise to have your close family members – your siblings and any male relatives – tested as well, if they’re willing. A carrier test can also be done for female relatives. I can provide you with information about genetic testing resources and local labs if you'd like. For now, let's focus on getting the blood test done and waiting for the results. I'll also write you a note summarizing what we discussed today and outlining the importance of avoiding fava beans. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor Asami. You've been very thorough and helpful, and you've answered all my questions. Knowing what to look for and what to avoid makes me feel a lot better, even though I'm still a little worried. I'll wait for the test results and then we can discuss next steps. And I’ll definitely talk to my family about getting tested. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a bit. Remember, we’ll take this one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. Have a good day, Mande.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
