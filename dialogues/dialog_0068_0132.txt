DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s this heat, really. Can’t stand it anymore. Used to be able to work all day in the sun, building things, painting… now? I get wiped out after an hour, maybe two. It’s ridiculous. I’m Sammie, by the way. Though I suspect you already know that, looking at your notes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do, Sammie. And yes, this heat is quite something. It's been affecting a lot of patients. But let's talk about you. You said you get wiped out after an hour or two of work… can you describe what you mean by “wiped out”?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I collapse or anything. Just… exhausted. Everything feels heavy. Like I’ve run a marathon, but I’ve just been standing around. And thirsty, always thirsty. I drink a lot of water, more than usual, but it doesn’t seem to help much. My head gets a bit foggy too, makes it hard to concentrate on things. It’s just… not right. Never used to be like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, exhaustion, increased thirst, and some fogginess… And this is a new development, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, new. Last couple of summers it’s been getting worse, but this year… this year it’s bad. Really bad. I'm a practical man, Doctor. I don't complain about a bit of heat. But this feels different. I'm not some weakling, you know. I’ve always been strong, able to handle myself. Now? I feel like an old man.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re coming in to get it checked out, even if it feels… different for you. We’ll figure this out. Now, aside from the exhaustion, thirst, and fogginess, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I haven’t been sleeping as well, tossing and turning a bit. And my skin… it feels dry, even after I shower. Not itchy, just… tight. I also feel a little… off balance sometimes, though that could just be my age. I haven’t fallen or anything, mind you. Just a bit wobbly. And… my appetite’s been down a little. Not that I need much, but even less than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, so disrupted sleep, dry skin, feeling off balance, and decreased appetite… Have you had any changes in your urination – more frequent, less frequent, any difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. I’m going to the bathroom more often, especially at night. Waking up a couple of times to pee. Never used to do that. And the stream isn’t as strong as it used to be. It’s… a bit weak, if you know what I mean. Getting old is no fun, Doctor. Honestly, it's just one thing after another.
DOCTOR: I understand. These are all important things to know. Now, have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No chest pain, thankfully. And I haven’t noticed any swelling in my legs or feet. Shortness of breath… well, I get a bit winded walking uphill, but that’s just normal for someone my age, isn’t it? I live up in the hills, you see. Everything’s uphill one way or another. It’s not like I'm gasping for air or anything. Just… a bit more effort than usual.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had a bit of a cough last winter, but that was ages ago. Just a normal winter cough. Nothing serious. I pride myself on staying healthy, Doctor. I don't go around catching every bug that comes along. I eat well, mostly. And I keep busy. Sitting around is the worst thing for a man.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor back home, before I moved here, said my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on a pill for it, but I stopped taking it. Didn’t feel like I needed it. Felt fine without it. And… I had my gallbladder out years ago. But that was a long time ago, no trouble with it since. Other than that… not much. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor. Don’t need a lot of fancy medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure, and gallbladder removal. Do you remember the name of the medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. It was a little white pill. I don’t pay attention to names of things like that. Just took it because the doctor told me to. Stopped when I felt better. I can’t stand taking pills unless I absolutely have to. They just make me feel… sluggish.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I’ve never had any trouble with pollen or anything like that. I’ve lived in the hills my whole life, surrounded by trees and plants. You’d think I’d be allergic to something by now, wouldn’t you? I’m a pretty hardy man.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Like I said, I don’t like taking pills. I might take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t bother with those fancy supplements. Waste of money, if you ask me. A good diet and hard work are all a man needs.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had heart trouble, I think. Died when he was in his seventies. And my mother had… well, she just got old. Everything started to fail, one thing after another. Didn’t really talk about illnesses much in my family. Just accepted it as part of life. Not much you can do about getting old, is there?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, a little about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… I might have a beer now and then with friends, but not often. And recreational drugs? Don’t be ridiculous, Doctor. I'm a practical man. No time for foolishness. I work hard, I eat well, and I keep to myself. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Sammie. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at you generally. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, go ahead. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but if it’ll get to the bottom of this heat problem, I suppose I can suffer through it. Just don't take too long, alright? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 160 over 90. That’s elevated. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. No swelling in your feet. Now, I want to run some blood tests to check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. And I'd like to get a urine sample as well. That'll give us a better idea of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? Always something. Fine, alright. Do what you need to do. But I'm telling you, Doctor, I'm a healthy man. Probably just need a bit of rest. Where do I go for these tests? Don’t want to be wandering around this place all day.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, first door on the right. The nurse will take care of you. It shouldn’t take too long. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I'm going to suspect dehydration could be contributing to your symptoms, but the elevated blood pressure and other symptoms warrant a more thorough investigation. We need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Dehydration? I drink plenty of water! But alright, fine. I'll go get these tests done. Just… don't keep me waiting too long for the results, alright? I've got work to do.
