DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, I suppose you could say I'm looking for a little…re-energizing. I feel like I need a bit of a jumpstart, if you know what I mean. I'm not sick, not exactly, but I just don't have the pep I used to. It’s getting harder to keep up, and I’d like to do something about it before it gets worse.
DOCTOR: “Re-energizing,” right. Well, it’s good you're being proactive. It’s always better to address things before they become a problem. Now, when you say you don’t have the “pep” you used to, can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s…everything, really. I tire more easily, even with just simple things like gardening, you know? And I don't sleep as well anymore. I used to be able to get up and go all day, but now I find myself needing little rests. And…well, I suppose my memory isn't what it used to be, either. Though, at my age, isn't that to be expected?
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, trouble sleeping, and some memory concerns. And you said gardening is more tiring than it used to be?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I’ve always loved my garden, it’s kept me busy, you know? But even weeding…even just watering the plants feels like a lot more effort than it used to. I used to be able to do it all in one go, but now I have to take breaks, sit down, and catch my breath. It’s a little…frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm…changed? Not really, not that I can think of. My husband passed away about five years ago, and that was…difficult, naturally. But I’ve adjusted, I think. I keep busy, I have friends, I volunteer at the school. Oh! Except… I did start taking that new blood pressure medicine, maybe six months ago? Dr. Alistair prescribed it. Is that…could that be it? I hadn’t really thought about it.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, Lisinopril. It can sometimes cause fatigue as a side effect. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, let’s talk about your sleep a little more. When you say you don’t sleep as well, what exactly does that mean?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t fall asleep easily. I used to just lay my head down and be out like a light. Now, I toss and turn for a good hour, sometimes longer, before I finally drift off. And I wake up several times during the night, too. Not necessarily to go to the bathroom, just…awake. Thinking. It’s not a restful sleep, that’s for sure. And then I don’t feel properly rested in the morning.
DOCTOR: Alright, difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative sleep. And you said you wake up “thinking.” Are you anxious about anything in particular when you wake up?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, not really anxious. Just…my mind wanders. Remembering things, planning things I need to do, thinking about my friends. Sometimes I worry about the children, of course, but they’re all grown up now and doing well. It’s just…thoughts. A lot of thoughts. It’s hard to turn them off, you know? It's not upsetting, exactly, just…present.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's move on to your memory concerns. You mentioned that your memory isn’t what it used to be. Can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s not anything dramatic, you understand. It’s just…little things. Like names, sometimes. I’ll be talking to someone I’ve known for years and the name will just…slip my mind. Or I’ll go into a room and forget why I went there in the first place. And I’m starting to misplace things more often. Not important things, usually…just my glasses, or the TV remote. It's frustrating, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Names, forgetting why you entered a room, misplacing items. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or have you experienced any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is still good, thankfully. I always enjoyed my food! And I haven’t lost any weight, no. If anything, I might have gained a little bit, but nothing significant. I still enjoy my cooking and baking, you see. I make a lovely coconut cream pie, if I do say so myself. Though I haven’t made one in a while… too much effort these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Just the basics – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a quick neurological assessment. Just to rule out anything obvious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. I’ve always trusted doctors, you know. It’s good to have someone looking after you.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138 over 82, a little elevated but not alarming. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Reflexes are a bit diminished, as expected for your age. Balance is slightly unsteady. Everything appears within normal limits for someone your age, though the unsteady balance warrants some attention. Now, I want to run some basic blood tests: a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. Also, I'd like to order a urinalysis. That will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. That’s good. I appreciate you being so attentive. Blood tests and… a what-now? A urine analysis? Oh, dear. Well, if it’s necessary, I suppose. I just… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… uncomfortable? I hope it’s not too much trouble. I do try to drink plenty of water, you know.
DOCTOR: It's a standard test, Ms. McNabb. A urinalysis. It's a simple collection of a urine sample. Not uncomfortable at all. It's just to check for infection or other abnormalities. And no, it's not a bother. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll give you a cup and instructions. It's really quite straightforward. We need to gather as much information as possible, and sometimes that means doing some simple tests. It’s all part of being thorough. Let's get you that cup, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright then. A cup, you say? I suppose I understand. It's just… I've always been a healthy person, you know? Never much trouble with anything. But if you think it's necessary… Lead the way, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… try to be gentle, alright? I’m a bit of an old lady, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. McNabb. Here we are. The nurse will explain everything. It's very simple. Just collect a standard urine sample. I’ll be back to discuss the results once they are available. Just follow the nurse’s instructions, and try not to worry. I'll see you shortly. .
PATIENT: .
