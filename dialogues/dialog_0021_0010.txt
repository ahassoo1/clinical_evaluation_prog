DOCTOR: Alright, Jahaad, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Havird. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I've noticed some… swelling, particularly in my face. It’s been happening on and off for a little while now, and it’s become a bit more noticeable recently. I’m not entirely sure what’s causing it, and it's a little concerning, truthfully. I apologize if this is vague – my memory isn’t what it used to be, and pinpointing when it started is proving difficult.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Swelling… face, you say. “On and off” is helpful, at least. It’s good you’re noticing these things. Let’s try to get a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly. Yes, mostly in my face… around my cheeks, I think, and perhaps a little around my eyes. It's not always on both sides; sometimes it seems to be worse on one side than the other. And it doesn’t hurt, precisely… more of a… fullness? A tightness, perhaps. It comes and goes throughout the day, and I haven't been able to connect it to anything specific, which is frustrating. I’m sorry I’m not being more helpful. I wish I could recall more details.
DOCTOR: It's alright, these things happen. Memory isn't always reliable. “Fullness, tightness… intermittent.” Good. That helps a little. Now, has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me see… No significant changes to my diet, I don't think. No new medications. I've been sleeping reasonably well, perhaps a little less than usual, but nothing drastic. I did travel a few weeks ago – to visit family in Marrakech, but that was… July 10th, I believe? And the swelling didn’t start immediately after that. I honestly can’t recall if it was present before the trip. I apologize. It's all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Marrakech… alright. Travel can introduce all sorts of things, you know. Okay. Let’s not dwell on that right now. Just trying to get a picture. Do you have any allergies, Jahaad?
PATIENT: Allergies… that’s a tricky one. I don’t believe so, no. I've never had any… severe reactions to anything. Nothing that required an EpiPen or anything of that nature. I used to get seasonal allergies when I was a child – hay fever, mostly – but those seem to have subsided. I don’t recall having any food allergies. However, I suppose it's possible I'm mildly sensitive to something without realizing it. It’s not something I’ve ever actively monitored.
DOCTOR: Right. "Mild sensitivity possible, but unconfirmed.” Always good to be cautious. And any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Just a moment, please. I take Lisinopril, 10mg daily, for my blood pressure. And occasionally, Ibuprofen, 200mg, as needed for headaches. That’s it, I believe. Nothing else prescribed. Again, apologies if this is slow going – I try to be thorough, but my recollection is… fragmented, at best.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… alright. Good you’re taking that if prescribed. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, do. I understand. Just let me know if there’s anything specific you'd like me to do. I'm prepared to cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm feeling… some mild pitting edema bilaterally around your cheeks. Not significant, but it’s there. No warmth, no redness. Your lymph nodes feel normal. Let me listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again. Good. Everything sounds clear. Now, open your mouth for me, please. Say “ah.” Your throat looks clear as well.
PATIENT: Ah… I appreciate the thoroughness, Doctor. Is that… normal, then? The edema? I'm not entirely familiar with medical terminology, so forgive my ignorance. Is it something to be concerned about? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I’d prefer to understand what’s happening, if possible.
DOCTOR: “Mild pitting edema” means there’s some fluid buildup in the tissues of your face. It’s not necessarily concerning on its own. It can be caused by a number of things – allergies, a reaction to something, even just dietary changes. Given your Lisinopril, it's also possible it’s a side effect of that medication, though that's less common. However, given that it's intermittent and you’ve traveled recently, I’d like to rule out other possibilities. We need to run some blood work. Just to be safe.
PATIENT: Blood work, of course. That sounds… sensible. Yes, absolutely. Anything to help determine the cause. Is there anything specific I should be aware of before the test? Any dietary restrictions or medications I should avoid? And roughly how long will it take to get the results? I understand these things take time, but I'd appreciate a general timeframe if possible. I appreciate your patience with my… inquiries.
DOCTOR: No dietary restrictions necessary. You can continue taking your Lisinopril as prescribed. Just standard fasting glucose, complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. That will give us a good baseline. The lab should be able to get the results back to us within 48-72 hours. We’ll give you a call as soon as they’re in. You can take this to the lab downstairs. And while we wait for the results, I’d like you to keep a detailed log of your symptoms. Note when the swelling occurs, what you’ve eaten, any medications you’ve taken, and anything else that might be relevant. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it's always best to be thorough. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fasting glucose, complete blood count… comprehensive metabolic panel… Yes, I understand. A detailed log of symptoms, as well. I’ll be sure to document everything as accurately as possible. I’ll head downstairs after this. Doctor Havird, if you don't mind me asking… what are some of the possible causes you’re considering, aside from a side effect of the Lisinopril? I don't want to alarm you, of course, but I find it helps me to understand the situation better if I have some idea of what we’re looking at. I truly appreciate your time and your efforts.
DOCTOR: Look, it's unlikely to be anything drastic. But, given your recent travel, we have to rule out things like a mild allergic reaction to something you were exposed to in Marrakech. Less likely, but still possible, is a viral infection, although you don’t have any other symptoms. And, rarely, facial swelling can be related to kidney issues, which is why we’re running the metabolic panel. But honestly, I suspect it’s something relatively minor. Now, let's get this lab work done and see what the results say. Don't spend your time worrying, alright?
PATIENT: Allergic reaction, viral infection, kidney issues… Yes, I understand. It's good to know what we’re considering, and I appreciate the reassurance. I won’t spend my time worrying needlessly, Doctor. I’ll head downstairs to the lab now. And I will keep a detailed log of my symptoms as instructed. Thank you again for your time and your thoroughness. I'll await your call with the results. .
