DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s been my stomach, I reckon. Seems like I just don’t have much appetite anymore, and when I do eat, I get full awful quick. It’s been going on for… oh dear, I can’t rightly say how long. A few weeks, maybe? It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. Unsettling is… a rather vague descriptor, Ms. Kelder. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right, dear, vague. I do apologize. It’s not like a pain, not exactly. More like… a fullness, right after just a few bites. And then… well, then I just feel… queasy. Not sick to my stomach, necessarily, but just not wanting to eat. It's hard to explain. It just doesn't feel right, you know? Like something's… off. I’ve also been feeling tired, but I always chalk that up to getting older.
DOCTOR: Tiredness is, regrettably, quite common at your age, Ms. Kelder. But let’s focus on this… fullness and queasiness. Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, no vomiting, thank goodness. And my… well, everything down there seems pretty regular, if you don’t mind me saying so. It's just this… feeling after I start eating. It's not like a burning, or cramping… just… a signal, I suppose, that says “enough.” It happens pretty fast, too. I used to enjoy a good meal, but now… it's just not the same. I haven't really told anyone much about it, you see. Didn't want to worry folks.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… just the usual. Something for my arthritis in my hands, and a little something for my blood pressure. I can't recall the names right off hand, I’m afraid. My daughter, bless her heart, she handles most of that for me. I take them every morning, though, religiously. Would it help if I had her bring the bottles in next time? I’m terrible with remembering those names.
DOCTOR: That won't be necessary at this moment. We can review that later, if needed. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's a good question. I… I don’t know. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. I suppose I might have lost a little, but I just figured it was from not eating as much. My clothes feel a bit looser, maybe? I haven't really paid much attention, truthfully. I mostly just try to keep comfortable. I get so tired so easily these days, I just don’t have the energy to fuss over things like that.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what about your family history, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My family… well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, I suppose. My mother lived to be 88, but she had… I think it was diabetes? And my father… he passed away fairly young, from a heart condition. On my husband's side, his mother had… something with her stomach, I think. They didn’t talk about it much. It was a long time ago, and folks didn’t share things like they do now. I’m not sure if any of that’s relevant. It feels like a lifetime ago, all of it.
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, Ms. Kelder. Though, frankly, these vague recollections aren't particularly helpful. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. If you’ll just lie down on the examination table. I need to listen to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. If you think that’s best. It’s just… hard to remember everything. I do apologize. I’ll try my best to be helpful. There you go. Do let me know if it’s uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Normal bowel sounds. No palpable masses or tenderness. Slightly distended abdomen, but not significantly. Tympanic to percussion. No rebound tenderness. Findings are… unremarkable. However, given your reported loss of appetite and early satiety, we should run some basic bloodwork. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We’ll also need a stool sample to rule out any… irregularities.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Bloodwork and… a stool sample? That doesn’t sound very pleasant, but I suppose I can manage. Will it take long to get the results? And… what exactly are you looking for, if you don't mind me asking? I just like to understand what's going on, you see. I'm not a fan of surprises.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Ms. Kelder. The bloodwork will assess your overall health and rule out any underlying deficiencies or infections. The stool sample will check for any signs of bleeding or… other anomalies. The results usually take 2-3 business days. The lab requisition and instructions for the stool sample will be printed for you. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings once they are available. Now, do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Two or three days… that doesn’t seem too bad. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don’t think so. Just… well, I've been feeling a little more tired than usual, like I said. And a little bit… anxious, I suppose. It’s just unsettling, not knowing what’s going on. But I trust your judgment. I suppose I’ll just wait for the results, then. Thank you for seeing me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Kelder. I’ll see you in a few days. Please contact the office if you experience any worsening symptoms. Have a pleasant day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate your time. Oh, and… thank you again for listening to me. It helps just to have someone try to figure things out.
