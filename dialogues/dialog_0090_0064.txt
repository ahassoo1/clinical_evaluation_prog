DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… my chest. It’s been hurting. Not all the time, you know? It comes and goes. It feels… tight. Like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Tightness, alright. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… two weeks? Yes, two weeks, I think. It started after I helped my son move some furniture. Heavy things, you know? Lots of lifting. It wasn’t right after, though. A few days later, it started.
DOCTOR: So, it developed a few days after lifting furniture. And is it related to activity?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. When I move around too much, like when I’m cleaning or walking up the stairs… it gets worse. If I sit down and rest, it gets better. Much better.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where exactly in your chest do you feel this tightness?
PATIENT: Right… here. Not all the way on the side, but… kind of in the middle. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t go into my arm or anything, though. Just… right there. Feels like a heavy weight.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any other symptoms along with this chest tightness?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, not really. I get a little short of breath sometimes when I’m walking, but I always thought that was just because I’m… not as young as I used to be! No dizziness, no sweating, no… I don’t think so. Just the tightness and a little bit of trouble breathing when I push myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of heart problems, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: No, never. My mother had high blood pressure, but I’ve always been healthy. I see my son, he’s a doctor, you know? He always tells me I’m good. He checks my blood pressure and everything when I visit. He says I take good care of myself.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just one. For my arthritis in my hands. It's called… hmm… meloxicam, I think? A little white pill. I take it every day. And sometimes I take something for pain if my hands are really hurting. But that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I’ve taken lots of different things over the years for colds and things, and I’ve never had a problem. My son always checks, too, before he gives me anything. He’s very careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chelberg. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d like to check your blood pressure and oxygen level. Then we’ll talk about what might be going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are… regular. I do hear some mild wheezing in the lower lobes bilaterally. Alright. Now I’m going to check your blood pressure and oxygen level. Blood pressure is a little elevated, and oxygen is a bit on the lower side, but nothing immediately concerning.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that bad, Doctor? The blood pressure, I mean. I get nervous at the doctor sometimes… maybe that’s why?
DOCTOR: It can be elevated in the office due to anxiety, yes. We call that “white coat hypertension.” But it's good we checked. Given your symptoms of chest tightness, some mild wheezing, and slightly elevated blood pressure, it could be a number of things. It could be related to a bit of bronchitis, especially after lifting something heavy. Or it could be a cardiac issue, though I’m not overly concerned at this point. To be on the safe side, I think we should order a chest X-ray to rule out any lung problems. And an EKG to check your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Oh… an X-ray and an EKG? Those sound serious, Doctor. Is it something bad? Like my heart? My son never said anything about my heart being bad… He would tell me, right?
DOCTOR: Now, now, Ms. Chelberg. It's always best to be thorough. These are routine tests, and we're not jumping to any conclusions. We're simply gathering information. Your son is a good doctor, certainly, but he doesn't see you as often as I do, and it’s my job to ensure we explore all possibilities. The EKG is very quick and painless, and the X-ray will simply give us a picture of your lungs. It’s better to have a clear understanding of what’s going on, and rule things out, than to worry unnecessarily. I will order those tests now, and then the radiology department will schedule you for them. I'd also like you to follow up with a cardiologist for a full evaluation. Just to be certain.
PATIENT: Oh… a cardiologist? That sounds… expensive. And it takes a long time to get an appointment, doesn't it? I’m on Medicare, you know. I don’t want to bother my son with this. He’s very busy.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover most of the cost, Ms. Chelberg, and we have a referral process that can help expedite the appointment. It’s a standard precaution given your symptoms and age. Frankly, waiting and hoping it gets better isn’t a good plan. And you shouldn’t feel bad about seeking specialist care – that's what I'm here for, to ensure you receive the best possible treatment. We can discuss some over-the-counter medication for symptomatic relief while we wait for the tests and specialist appointment. Something for the tightness, perhaps. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… worried, you know? About the tests and everything. My son… he’s always telling me not to worry so much. But it’s hard. I guess I’ll do what you say. Tests and the heart doctor. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chelberg. The nurse will come in shortly to schedule those tests for you. I’ll have the lab orders sent over electronically. And I’ll also get the cardiology referral started. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity and take it easy. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Kur. I appreciate you checking me out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chelberg. Take care. .
