DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got all day. I come 'bout… well, lookin’ at myself in the mirror lately. Not happy with what I see. That’s all. Waste of time, really, but my daughter insisted. She sayin’ things… things a man don’t wanna hear.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you're concerned about some changes you’ve noticed. I understand your daughter encouraged you to come in, and that it may be difficult to discuss. That's perfectly alright. We'll take our time and address what's on your mind. To help me understand, could you elaborate on what specifically you’ve been noticing when you look in the mirror?
PATIENT: Notices? Everything, Doctor! Everything is droopin’ and saggin’. Used to be a strong man, you know? Pile driver operator for fifty years! Fifty years, buildin’ things! Now… now I look like a prune. Skin all loose, belly hangin’… It ain’t right. And my daughter, she keep talkin’ ‘bout “options”. Options for what? Makin’ an old man feel worse is what it is.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you're experiencing some distress over changes in your physical appearance, and your daughter's comments are adding to that. It’s understandable to feel this way, especially after a life of physical work like you’ve described. When you say “drooping and sagging,” are you referring to changes in your skin, muscle tone, or something else?
PATIENT: Skin, mostly. And… well, the belly, that’s just… there. Always been a bit of a belly, but now it’s… prominent. Like it got a mind of its own. And the skin around my neck, that's the worst. Like a turkey wattle, I tell ya! Used to have a strong jawline. Now? Gone. Completely gone. Don't need no fancy words, Doctor. Just look at me. You see it, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, I do see what you mean. Changes in skin elasticity and muscle tone are common as we age, and it sounds like you’re noticing quite a few of those changes. It’s good that you're addressing this now. To get a better understanding of the overall picture, could you tell me about any other changes you've noticed recently?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmph. Well… I get tired easier. Always been a strong man, could work all day. Now, gotta take a nap in the afternoon. And my hands… they ache. Real bad sometimes. Arthritis, the doctor back home said. But that ain’t what brought me here! This is 'bout lookin' presentable, not creaky joints. Though, I suppose they contribute to the general… decline. Don't need a list, Doctor. I ain't fallin' apart, just… wearin' out.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing fatigue and some hand pain in addition to the changes in your appearance. While you came in today concerned about your appearance, it's helpful to know about everything that's going on, as these things can often be related. You mentioned arthritis diagnosed previously. Do you recall when you were diagnosed, and what treatment, if any, have you received for it?
PATIENT: 'Bout five years ago, I reckon. Small doctor in Ocho Rios. Gave me some pills. White ones. Didn't do much, to be honest. Just took the edge off sometimes. Stopped takin' 'em after a while. Didn't like feelin' all… foggy. Didn't change nothin’ much anyway. Just gotta push through the pain, that's what my father always said. Still, it ain't the pain bringin' me here. It's this… this saggin’. You got somethin’ you can do 'bout that, Doctor? Or am I just wastin’ my time?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like the medication for your arthritis didn’t provide much relief and had unwanted side effects. Regarding your concerns about the changes in your skin, there are several options we can discuss. These range from non-invasive treatments to surgical procedures, each with its own benefits and risks. However, before we dive into those, I'd like to get a more complete medical history. Would you mind if I ask you a few questions about your past medical conditions, any surgeries you’ve had, and your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Hmph. More questions? Look, I told you already, I worked fifty years buildin’ things! What does my medical history got to do with my saggin’ skin? I ain’t broke nothin’ serious in all those years, if that’s what you’re askin’. Couple of sprains, a broken rib once… but healed right up. Family? My mother lived to eighty-five. Father died young, heart trouble. That’s all I really know. Look, Doctor, if you can’t fix what I see, I don’t see the point in all this. I ain’t got all day to talk 'bout my ancestors.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. You’re right; your work history is impressive, and it’s good to hear you haven’t had any major injuries. However, your medical history does matter, even with concerns about your appearance. Certain medical conditions can affect skin health and how you respond to different treatments. For example, conditions like diabetes or thyroid problems can impact skin elasticity. Knowing about your family history can also help us assess your risk for certain skin conditions. It’s important to ensure you’re a good candidate for any procedure and to minimize potential complications. It will only take a few minutes, and I assure you, it will help me provide the best possible care. Would you be willing to answer a few quick questions about whether you have any chronic illnesses, allergies, or medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I’m startin’ to get annoyed. Chronic illnesses? No. Allergies? Dust, sometimes. Medications? Just a little somethin’ for my blood pressure. Small white pill, take it every mornin’. That's it! Blood pressure, that’s all. Been takin’ it for 'bout ten years now. Satisfied? Can we please get to the fixin’ part now? I got things to do. And a mirror starin’ back at me, remindin’ me of how old I look.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m causing you frustration, Mr. Trendler. I assure you, I’m trying to gather the necessary information to provide you with the best possible care. Knowing about the blood pressure medication is very helpful, thank you. Now, to address your concerns about your appearance, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll simply assess the skin laxity and overall condition of your face and neck. This will help me determine the best course of action. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Just… don’t poke too much. And don’t tell me I look good. I know I don't. Just tell me what you can do. That’s all I want to know. Can you fix it, or can’t ya? Stop talkin’ and start lookin’. I got a lunch appointment, you know. My daughter insisted on that too. Everything’s an insistence these days.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. Alright. I'm observing some degree of skin laxity, particularly around the jawline and neck. The skin texture appears generally healthy, but there is some loss of elasticity, which is common with age. I also note some mild sun damage. Based on my examination, several options could be considered. We could explore non-surgical options like radiofrequency skin tightening, or, if you are interested, surgical procedures like a facelift or neck lift. Each has its own risks, benefits and recovery time. Radiofrequency is less invasive, with minimal downtime, but may require multiple sessions for optimal results. A facelift provides more dramatic improvements but requires a more extensive recovery period. Before we discuss these options in detail, do you have any allergies to topical anesthetics or latex?
PATIENT: Latex? No. Never had a problem with that. Anesthetics... hmm. I had somethin' put on my gums once, at the dentist. Felt kinda numb for a while. Didn't swell up or nothin'. Just felt... strange. That's all I remember. Look, Doctor, I ain't no fancy man. I don’t want no complicated procedures. If it’s gonna involve a lot of cuttin’ and stitchin’, forget it. I just want to look… less like a prune. Is there somethin’ simple you can do? Somethin’ quick? I got a life, you know. Don’t wanna spend it recoverin' in a hospital bed.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Trendler. You're looking for something simple and with minimal downtime. Given your preference, radiofrequency skin tightening might be the most suitable option. It's non-invasive, involves no incisions, and generally requires minimal recovery time. It works by heating the deeper layers of the skin to stimulate collagen production, which can help tighten and lift the skin. However, it's important to manage your expectations. The results are gradual and may not be as dramatic as with a surgical facelift. It typically requires a series of treatments spaced several weeks apart. Would you be interested in learning more about the radiofrequency procedure, including the potential risks and benefits?
PATIENT: Risks and benefits... hmm. Look, Doctor, just tell me what's gonna happen. And how long will I be outta commission? I got a fish fry next Saturday. Can’t miss that. My daughter made arrangements. And she'd kill me if I showed up lookin' like this. So, tell me straight. What's involved? And how long before I can eat some fried snapper? That’s all I need to know. No fancy medical jargon, understand? Just the plain truth.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I’ll explain everything in plain language. The radiofrequency procedure involves applying a handheld device to your skin. It delivers radiofrequency energy to the deeper layers, which stimulates collagen production. You may feel a warming sensation during the treatment, but it shouldn't be painful. We can adjust the energy level to ensure your comfort. Each session typically takes about 30 to 60 minutes. You'll likely need a series of 3 to 6 treatments, spaced about 4 to 6 weeks apart, to achieve optimal results. As for downtime, there is very little. You may experience some mild redness or swelling immediately after the treatment, but this usually subsides within a few hours to a few days. You can resume your normal activities right away, and there are no restrictions on diet or exercise. So, you should be perfectly fine to enjoy your fish fry next Saturday. You shouldn't have any issues at all. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Hmmm. No cuttin’? No stitchin’? Can eat my fish? Sounds… tolerable. But what's this "collagen" business? Is that some kinda snake oil? And how much is this gonna cost me? My daughter don't like me spendin’ money. She say I gotta save for retirement. But lookin' like a prune ain’t much of a retirement, is it? Give it to me straight, Doctor. Costs, and this “collagen” explanation. Don’t sugarcoat nothin’. I'm a practical man.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask those questions, Mr. Trendler. Let me explain. Collagen is a protein that naturally occurs in your body. It's essentially the scaffolding that provides structure and support to your skin. As we age, collagen production declines, which leads to skin laxity and wrinkles. The radiofrequency procedure stimulates your body to produce more collagen, essentially rebuilding that scaffolding and tightening your skin. It’s not snake oil at all – it’s a natural process we’re simply encouraging. As for the cost, a series of six treatments typically ranges from $1,800 to $3,000, depending on the size of the treatment area and the specific technology used. We offer financing options to help make it more affordable. I can provide you with a detailed estimate and discuss the financing options if you're interested. We also accept most insurance plans, although cosmetic procedures are typically not covered. Before we proceed, are you currently taking any blood thinners or medications that could affect your skin's healing process?
PATIENT: $3,000?! My daughter gonna kill me! She say I gotta be careful with my money. Blood thinners... no. Just the little white pill for my blood pressure. And I stopped takin' that aspirin for my knees 'bout a year ago. It weren't doin’ nothin’ anyway. Look, Doctor, this is gettin' expensive. And complicated. Is there somethin'… cheaper? Even if it ain’t as good. I just wanna look… decent. Not like a prune. Is there a compromise? Maybe just a couple of treatments? And can we talk 'bout payin’ for it in installments? My retirement ain’t lookin’ too good right now. This whole prune situation is breakin’ the bank.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Trendler. It’s wise to be cautious about your finances. Yes, we can definitely discuss a more affordable option. We could consider a series of three treatments instead of six. While the results won't be as dramatic, it can still provide noticeable improvement, and it will significantly reduce the cost. A series of three treatments would typically range from $900 to $1,500. We also offer financing options with monthly installments. We can work with you to create a payment plan that fits your budget. To confirm you're a good candidate, and to ensure there are no contraindications, I would like to briefly review your medical history and medications again. Do you have any allergies, and do you have any existing skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Three treatments… that’s… manageable. Maybe. As for allergies... dust, sometimes. And that dentist stuff, like I said. No eczema, no psoriasis. Just old man skin. And a grumpy daughter. Look, Doctor, I think that’s all. No fancy conditions, no hidden problems. Just a saggin’ face and a tight wallet. Can we get this scheduled then? Before my daughter finds out how much this is gonna cost? And can you promise me I won’t look like I had work done? I don’t want no stretched-out face. Just… a little lift. Is that possible? And what about the pain? Is it gonna hurt? I ain't got a high tolerance for that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Trendler. We can definitely schedule that for you. Three treatments is a good starting point. Rest assured, we strive for natural-looking results. We use a conservative approach and tailor the treatment to your individual needs to avoid any overly stretched or unnatural appearance. It's about enhancing your existing features, not creating a completely different look. As for the pain, most patients describe the sensation as a warming or tingling feeling. It's generally very tolerable, and we can adjust the energy level to ensure your comfort. We can also apply a topical numbing cream before the treatment if you're concerned about discomfort. Let me schedule your first appointment. Would Tuesday at 2:00 PM work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00 PM… that might work. Let me check with my daughter. She’s the one with the calendar these days. But yes, that’s probably fine. Just… don’t tell her the price yet. I’ll handle that. And promise me you won’t make me look like a different person. I just wanna look… less like a prune. Is that too much to ask? Alright, schedule it. Tuesday at 2:00 PM. And thanks, Doctor. I hope this works. My daughter’s been talkin’ about gettin’ me a new fish tank if I don’t do somethin’ about this face. So, you’re savin’ me from a lot more than just wrinkles. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, we'll work together to achieve a natural-looking result that you're happy with. I've scheduled your first appointment for Tuesday at 2:00 PM. You'll receive a confirmation email with all the details. Please feel free to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We'll discuss everything in detail then and address any remaining concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Trendler. I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday. .
