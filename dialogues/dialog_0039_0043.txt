DOCTOR: Hello, Percell. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It's this headache, see? Right in the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a few days now. Not real bad, but… constant. Like a dull ache, you know? Never had one quite like it before.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A constant dull ache in the back of your head… and you say it's been a few days now?
PATIENT: Yep, few days. Started maybe Tuesday, I think? It’s hard to say exactly. I'm pretty good with remembering things, usually, but dates… not so much. It's not throbbing or anything, just… there. Makes it hard to concentrate sometimes when I'm lookin' at numbers all day, you know, for my clients. I’m a financial advisor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Tuesday it started… a dull ache, not throbbing. And it's interfering with your work a little, when you're looking at numbers. Financial advisor, that’s good to know. Do you notice anything that makes it worse – like bright lights, bending over, or stress, perhaps?
PATIENT: Hmm… bright lights don't bother it any more than usual, I guess. And bendin' over… no, that doesn’t seem to do it either. Stress… well, who doesn’t have a little stress, right? But I don’t think it’s worse on stressful days, if that makes sense. It's just... always there, kinda low-level. Sometimes I forget it's even there 'til I really think about it. Is that… normal? I don’t usually bother doctors much.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Percell. And no, it's not necessarily normal to have a constant headache, but it's also not always something serious. It's good you came in to get it checked out. You mentioned it’s low-level, and you sometimes forget about it… Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me think… No blurry vision. No dizziness. I haven’t been feelin’ sick to my stomach or anything like that. No fever, I checked this mornin’. Oh! My neck feels a little stiff sometimes, now that you mention it. Not always, but… yeah, a little bit. I thought it was just from sleepin' wrong, maybe? I've been tryin' to stretch it out.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blurry vision, dizziness, nausea, or fever. A little neck stiffness, sometimes… and you’ve been stretching it out. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you had headaches like this before, or is this a new experience for you?
PATIENT: Definitely new. I get little tension headaches sometimes, you know, from lookin' at the screen too long. But those go away with some water and a little rest. This… this is different. It’s in the back of my head, not on the sides like those ones. And it just… stays. I haven't had anything like it before. I don't think so, anyway. My memory's pretty good, like I said, so I’d remember somethin’ like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s different from your usual tension headaches – located in the back of the head, persistent. That helps me narrow things down. Now, Percell, do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a long time ago, but it’s been under control for years now. Just watch my salt intake, that’s all. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I walk every mornin’ and try to eat right. Never been much for medicine, if I can avoid it. I prefer tea. Herbal tea. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Herbal tea absolutely counts! That’s good to hear you’re active and try to eat well. And that's good to know about the high blood pressure being under control. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I'll check your blood pressure and look in your eyes and ears, and feel your neck and head. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I don’t mind. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I’m used to people lookin’ at numbers, not at me, so this is a little different.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell, your blood pressure is a little elevated today – 145/90. Your heart and lungs sound good. Your ears and throat look clear. And I do feel some mild tenderness in the muscles at the base of your skull. No swelling or anything concerning, just some tightness. Your neurological exam is normal – reflexes are good, and you’re tracking my finger appropriately. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing a tension headache, possibly related to stress and muscle tension in your neck. However, since your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and you're 84, I want to be cautious.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Tension… I have been worryin’ a little about some of my clients lately. The market’s been a bit unpredictable, you know? So, it could be that. A little worry. And the blood pressure… I suppose I should probably check that more often. What do you recommend I do, Doctor? More tea?
DOCTOR: More tea is always a good idea! But in addition to that, I recommend a few things. First, let’s try to manage that stress. Are there any relaxation techniques you’ve found helpful in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… relaxation… not really. I used to enjoy fishin’ with my son, but he moved away a few years ago. That was relaxin’. And walkin’, like I said. But that doesn't always calm the worry. I tend to just... think things through. Over and over. Maybe that’s the problem. I don't meditate or nothin’ like that. Is that what you were thinkin’?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're a natural problem-solver, which is great, but sometimes overthinking can actually make the stress worse. Meditation can be helpful, but it's not for everyone. Let's start with something simpler. I'm going to recommend a course of over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen, just to help with the headache pain. And I'd like you to check your blood pressure twice a day for the next week, and keep a record of the readings. We can review them at your next appointment. Also, I'd like to talk about diet and exercise. Are you getting enough water each day?
PATIENT: Okay, ibuprofen or naproxen... I think I've got some of that at home somewhere. I'll check. And I can definitely do the blood pressure checks. Keepin' records isn't a problem, I'm good with numbers, remember? Water… I probably don't drink enough, to be honest. I usually have a cup of tea with my meals, but that’s about it. I should probably be better about that. So, ibuprofen, blood pressure checks, more water… anything else, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Just one more thing. Since your blood pressure is a little elevated, and you haven’t been to a doctor regularly in a while, I’d like to order some basic blood work. Just to check your kidney function, cholesterol, and blood sugar. It’s a standard precaution. We'll also want to rule out any other potential causes for your headache. I'm going to give you a prescription for the blood work and a referral to a local lab. Would you like me to print out some information about managing stress and staying hydrated?
PATIENT: Okay, blood work… Alright, if you think it's best. I trust your judgement, Doctor. And yes, please, some information about stress and hydration would be helpful. I'm always open to learnin' new things. It's good to have things written down, sometimes, so I don't forget.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here are the prescriptions for the blood work, and the referral to the lab. And here’s some information on stress management techniques and the importance of hydration. I’ve also written a summary of our visit, including the instructions for the ibuprofen, the blood pressure checks, and a reminder to increase your water intake. I want you to follow up with me in one week to review your blood pressure readings and blood work results. If your headache gets significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms like fever, vision changes, or weakness, please call the office right away. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered everything pretty well, Doctor. That’s a lot of information, but I’ll do my best to follow it. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen to me, and for not dismissin’ an old man’s worries. I appreciate it. I suppose I'll go home and drink some water now. And maybe take a little ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Percell. It was my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. Take care of yourself, and get some rest. And yes, drink plenty of water! Have a good day, Percell.
