DOCTOR: Alright, Esthela, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Havird, it’s… complicated. I suppose you could say I’m exploring a potential… commitment. A serious one. And frankly, I like to be thorough. I don’t believe in surprises, you see. I need to know everything before I invest my time and energy. It’s a matter of… due diligence, really.
DOCTOR: Due diligence… right. And this commitment… is it a financial one?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Though, I suppose financial stability is important. No, it’s a… personal commitment. A romantic one. I’m dating someone, and I just want to ensure… well, that everything is as it should be. From a health perspective, naturally. I wouldn't want to be… burdened later, would I? It’s a bit… unsettling, starting something new at my age, and I simply want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you're looking for a general health screening before... becoming more serious with a partner. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Precisely. A comprehensive assessment. I want to be certain I haven’t… overlooked anything. You understand, Doctor. A woman of my… experience… needs to be proactive. I've always taken care of myself, but one can never be too careful, especially when… well, when introducing a new element into the equation. And I’d prefer to know everything upfront. No hidden… liabilities, if you catch my meaning.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. So, to be clear, you're requesting a full physical exam, with a focus on identifying any potential health concerns that could impact a new relationship. Is there anything specific you’re worried about?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I wouldn't say worried, exactly. More… discerning. I’d like to know my current status, shall we say? Everything from the usual—cholesterol, blood sugar—but also… anything that might… manifest later. I'm not interested in surprises, as I’ve mentioned. And frankly, I'd like to know if there's anything I should… disclose to this gentleman, before things become… irreversible. It’s simply responsible, wouldn't you agree? One must be forthright.
DOCTOR: Yes, forthrightness is important. Alright. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, thankfully, nothing major. I was diagnosed with mild hypertension about five years ago, but it's been well-controlled with medication—a small dose of lisinopril. And I had gestational diabetes with my youngest, but that resolved after the pregnancy. Otherwise, just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Though I do have a touch of arthritis in my knees, particularly when the weather is damp. It's… manageable. I’ve been careful to stay active, but it does limit some things. Do you need specifics about the medication dosages? I keep a detailed list, naturally.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. The dosages would be helpful. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Certainly. The lisinopril is 10 milligrams daily, taken each morning. As for surgeries… let me see. I had my tonsils removed as a child, of course, and a hysterectomy at age 42. Routine, really. And I had a minor arthroscopic procedure on my right knee about three years ago to repair a small tear in the meniscus. It was outpatient, very quick recovery. Nothing… complicated. I've been very diligent about following post-operative instructions. I do believe in taking good care of myself, Doctor. It’s just… sensible. Are you documenting all of this?
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm documenting everything. Alright. Family history… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother suffered from heart disease – she passed away at 78. And my father had type 2 diabetes. My maternal grandmother had Alzheimer’s, which… that is something I am particularly mindful of. I’ve read quite a bit about preventative measures, naturally. And my brother has high cholesterol, although he’s… not always as diligent about his health as he should be. It’s a bit… frustrating, frankly. I believe in taking responsibility for one’s wellbeing. Does that answer your question adequately? I could provide you with a more detailed family tree if you require.
DOCTOR: That’s very thorough, thank you. And your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Well, I don’t smoke. Never have. I rarely drink – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I work as a personal service manager, which keeps me fairly busy. I'm married, as I mentioned, but my husband travels quite a bit for work. I do enjoy gardening, and I'm active in my church. I suppose you could say I lead a… reasonably healthy lifestyle. I'm not one for… excess, if you catch my meaning. Do you need details about my work environment? It's mostly administrative, nothing strenuous.
DOCTOR: No, that’s sufficient for now. And finally, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I've always been fortunate in that regard. No reactions to any medications I've ever taken. I do have a slight sensitivity to certain perfumes, but it's merely a cosmetic issue. Nothing… life-threatening, certainly. I believe I've covered everything, Doctor. Is there anything else you require before we proceed to the examination? I do hope it will be… comprehensive. I'm not interested in a cursory overview, you understand.
DOCTOR: No, I believe that covers the basic history. Alright, Esthela. Let's move on to the physical exam. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then we'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a brief abdominal exam. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Perfectly acceptable, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. And please, do be meticulous. I want a complete assessment, you understand. No shortcuts. I’ve always believed in the value of a proper examination. And do let me know if you observe anything… unusual. Transparency is key, wouldn’t you agree? I want to be fully informed.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just step over here and have a seat. First, let’s take your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Certainly. I trust you're using a properly calibrated instrument? Accuracy is paramount, naturally.
DOCTOR: Yes, the equipment is calibrated daily. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths.
PATIENT: Do you detect any irregularities? It's best to be forthright, you know. Even minor anomalies should be documented.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Do you require me to perform any specific actions during the assessment? I'm accustomed to following instructions carefully.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal, 2+ bilaterally. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back, and let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: I do occasionally experience a bit of… discomfort after particularly heavy meals, but it’s usually transient. Should I mention any specific areas that are typically sensitive?
DOCTOR: Yes, please point to any areas that are typically sensitive. And describe the discomfort – is it sharp, dull, cramping?
PATIENT: It’s usually a dull ache, Doctor. Not particularly sharp, but… noticeable. It tends to occur after I eat something… rich. Perhaps creamy sauces or fried foods. It’s rarely debilitating, but it’s… bothersome. It usually subsides within a few hours. It's likely nothing, of course. Just a bit of indigestion, I suspect. Do you require a more detailed description of my dietary habits? I keep a meticulous food journal, naturally.
DOCTOR: A food journal would be helpful, if you wouldn't mind bringing it in next time. Alright. Everything else seems normal on the physical exam. Given your history of hypertension and this mild abdominal discomfort, I think it would be prudent to order some blood work. We'll check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and liver enzymes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Proactive measures are always wise. And please, do include a comprehensive metabolic panel. It’s best to have a complete picture, wouldn’t you agree? I'm happy to provide you with a list of previous lab results, if you'd find it helpful. I keep meticulous records, as you know. And do let me know if you require a fasting sample. I'm accustomed to adhering to strict protocols.
DOCTOR: Yes, a comprehensive metabolic panel is a good idea. And a fasting sample is required. I’ll give you the requisition form, and instructions on how to prepare. I will also send a referral to gastroenterology, just to rule out anything more serious causing your abdominal discomfort. It’s likely nothing, but it’s best to be thorough. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That is… very thoughtful of you, Doctor. The referral to gastroenterology is… prudent. And thank you for taking my concerns seriously. I do have one question, actually. Given my… romantic circumstances, is there anything I should be aware of? Anything specific I should disclose to this gentleman, from a medical perspective? I want to be forthright, as I've mentioned, but I also don’t want to… alarm him unnecessarily. It’s a delicate situation, you understand.
DOCTOR: Well, given your controlled hypertension, it’s important he’s aware of that. He doesn't need to know all the details, but understanding you take medication daily is reasonable. As for the abdominal discomfort, it's unlikely to be a concern for him at this point, especially since we're investigating it. But transparency is always a good policy. Perhaps mention you're getting it checked out as a precautionary measure. Do you have any specific concerns about disclosing either of those things?
PATIENT: That is… sensible advice, Doctor. Just a brief mention of the hypertension and the ongoing investigation of the abdominal discomfort. I believe that strikes the right balance – forthrightness without unnecessary alarm. He is a… discerning gentleman, I believe he would appreciate honesty. And I do prefer to avoid surprises, as you know. I suppose… I was simply seeking reassurance. It’s a bit… unsettling, introducing a new element into the equation at my age. Thank you for your guidance. It’s… comforting to have a professional opinion.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Esthela. It’s perfectly natural to feel that way. Just remember, you're taking proactive steps to ensure your health and wellbeing, and that's admirable. Here's the requisition form and the referral. Schedule the blood work at your convenience, and the gastroenterologist’s office will contact you to set up an appointment. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you again for your thoroughness and your… understanding. You've been most helpful. I appreciate your… discretion as well. It's… comforting to know I'm in capable hands.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Esthela. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Havird. You as well. .
