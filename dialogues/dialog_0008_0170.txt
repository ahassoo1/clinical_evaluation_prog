DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for a life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, that's all. Want to get it over with quickly if we can.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A life insurance physical. We can definitely work efficiently. Just to start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not bad for my age, I guess. A little bit of this and that, you know? Nothing major ever. I get tired easier than I used to, but I work a lot of hours at the hotel. It's a busy place.
DOCTOR: Alright. "A little bit of this and that" is pretty common. Let's try to be a bit more specific, if you don't mind. When you say you get tired easier, can you describe that?
PATIENT: Well, like... at the end of the day, I'm just done. Usually around 8, 9 pm. Used to be I could go out, do stuff. Now, I just want to sit. And sometimes even during the day I feel it, especially if I've been on my feet a long time. It's not like a sick tired, just… worn out. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Worn out, rather than sick. Okay. And has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradually getting worse over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It's been a few years, slowly getting there. Didn't really pay it much mind at first. Just figured it was the job. It's a demanding place, that hotel. Long shifts, lots of walking. But it's... more noticeable now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Sometimes my ankles swell up a bit at the end of the day. Not terrible, but I notice it. And... now that you mention it, I've been a little short of breath sometimes when I'm walking up the stairs. Just a little. Nothing crazy.
DOCTOR: Alright, ankles swelling and some shortness of breath with exertion... good to know. Do you have any chest pain with that shortness of breath, or any palpitations – a racing heart, or feeling like your heart is skipping beats?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. And my heart feels... normal, I guess. It doesn't race or anything. Just get winded faster, that’s all. Like I said, just a little. Trying to get this done, Doctor. I got a hotel to run.
DOCTOR: I understand you're busy, Mr. Putney, and I'll try to be as efficient as possible. Just a few more questions to get a good picture of things. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never been told I had any of those things. My mom had high blood pressure, I think, but that's the only family history I can think of. Doctors always ask, but nothing ever came up.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No medications. And no allergies that I know of. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's it. I'm pretty careful about what I put in my body.
DOCTOR: Alright. To get a better sense of things, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Just get it over with, please. I got things waiting.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, let's check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. 148 over 92. A little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Lungs are clear, but I do hear a slight murmur. Not alarming, but worth noting. And finally, let's take a look at your ankles. Some mild pitting edema in both ankles. Alright, Mr. Putney, that gives us a good starting point.
PATIENT: Okay. So, what does that mean? Is it something bad? I really need to know if I need to worry about going back to work, or if I need to call somebody.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. Let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. Your blood pressure is a bit high, the murmur is likely nothing to worry about, and the swelling in your ankles could be related to being on your feet all day, but these findings combined warrant some further investigation. I'd like to order a basic blood panel - to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar - and an EKG to get a better look at your heart's electrical activity. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Look, I just need this life insurance thing done. Can't I just… take something for the blood pressure? I really don't have time for all this. It's gonna cost money, too. Is it necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time and cost, Mr. Putney, and I wouldn't recommend these tests if they weren't important. The purpose of these tests is to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. High blood pressure combined with fatigue and ankle swelling can be a sign of something more serious, like heart failure or kidney problems. Getting a clear diagnosis now is the best way to ensure your long-term health and avoid potential complications down the road. It’s better to be safe. We can discuss payment options with the billing department if cost is a concern. Would you like me to get that started?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Fine. Do the tests. But just the ones you said. And get it done as fast as possible. I got people relying on me. And yeah, please talk to the billing people. This is already a headache. Let's just get this insurance thing approved so I can go back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. I've ordered the blood panel and EKG. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get you in right away. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available - usually within a couple of hours. The billing department will reach out to you directly to discuss payment options. In the meantime, I recommend you limit strenuous activity until we have the results back. And please, if you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or significant swelling, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before I send you to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just… tell me when they got the results. And I need this paperwork for the insurance company. Do you have that ready? I need to get this done, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here is the paperwork for the life insurance physical. It includes a section for me to fill out once I have the results of your tests. I'll make a note to complete it as soon as I have them, and the front desk will let you know when it’s ready for pickup. I expect the results back within a couple of hours. The front desk will contact you when they are available. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… thanks, I guess. Hopefully, this is all quick and easy.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Putney. I hope so too. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
