DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Right, well, my wife suggested I come in. She worries too much, honestly. I just… wanted to get checked for, you know… the HIV thing. Just to put her mind at ease, really. Though I doubt it’ll be anything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s always prudent to address concerns, even if they seem unlikely. And it’s commendable of you to come in for your wife’s peace of mind. Now, to be thorough, could you tell me a little more about why your wife is concerned?
PATIENT: Honestly? She watches too many dramas. And reads a lot of… online things. She gets ideas. We haven't… been with anyone else, ever. It's just… she saw something about how easy it is to get it, even without… well, you know. I mean, I don’t think I’ve done anything to worry about, but she gets anxious. It’s easier to just get the test than argue with her. Really.
DOCTOR: I see. While it's good you're being proactive, it's important to understand the actual risks involved. It is true that HIV can be transmitted in ways beyond what many people realize, but a history of exclusive partnership significantly reduces that risk. Still, we’ll proceed with the appropriate testing. Before we do that, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: No, never. Honestly, it wasn't something I ever thought about. I mean, I've had the usual check-ups, blood pressure and all that, but… no, never specifically this test. It just never came up. And I certainly haven't been ill with anything serious, if that's what you're asking. Perfectly healthy, Doctor. Usually. A bit of a cold now and then, but nothing a good rest doesn’t fix.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections – STIs – diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Look, I told you, my wife and I have been together since… well, a very long time. We’re both… careful people. It’s not something we’ve ever needed to worry about. Honestly, the suggestion is a bit insulting, if I'm being frank. It's like you're implying... well, never mind. I just… haven't had anything like that. Never.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Belan, I am simply gathering information to ensure we provide the most appropriate care. It is a standard part of the process. Now, let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None at all. I can eat anything, take anything. My wife jokes I have a cast-iron stomach. She's always worried about me trying new foods when we travel, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Not even shellfish, and I eat lots of shellfish. Honestly, I'm remarkably robust, Doctor. It's frustrating you’re asking about all these things when I'm perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, occasionally. Nothing else. Sometimes I take something for indigestion, but that’s only when I eat something… rich. My wife keeps telling me to watch my diet, but… you know. I generally feel fine. Honestly, I barely need anything. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. They never agree with me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, to proceed with the testing, I will need to take a small blood sample. We'll also need a urine sample. It's a standard procedure to screen for a number of potential issues. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Urine sample? Really? I thought we were just doing a blood test. Honestly, Doctor, this seems a bit… excessive. For a simple check-up? Is this really necessary? I mean, what are you looking for besides the… HIV thing? I’m starting to feel a bit ridiculous, if I’m honest. And a little bit annoyed. This is just to appease my wife, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, while your wife’s concerns initiated this consultation, a responsible physician conducts a comprehensive assessment. The urine sample helps us to rule out other potential infections and assess your overall kidney function. It is standard procedure, particularly given that you haven't had a recent medical evaluation. It isn't simply about the HIV test; it's about ensuring your overall health. I understand your frustration, but it’s a relatively quick and painless process. Now, would you be able to provide a urine sample for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, alright. A urine sample. Just… where do I even go? Honestly, this is a bit humiliating. I thought doctors were more… efficient these days. Is there a restroom nearby? And don't tell me it's a complicated procedure. Just tell me where to go. I’m starting to regret coming in, if I’m being perfectly truthful. This is all a bit much for a simple check-up.
DOCTOR: Down the hall, second door on the left. There are instructions inside. A sterile cup will be provided. Please ensure you collect a mid-stream sample for the most accurate results. Once you have completed the sample, simply bring it back to me, and we can proceed with the blood draw. Honestly, Mr. Belan, it's a very straightforward process. I assure you, it won't be unpleasant.
PATIENT: Mid-stream… Honestly. Fine. I’ll go. Don’t expect me to be cheerful about it. .
