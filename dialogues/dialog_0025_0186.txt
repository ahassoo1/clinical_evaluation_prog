DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. Uh, it’s about a tryout. For a team. I gotta get checked out first, you know? Physical, they call it. I’m Lamark, by the way. Just Lamark is fine.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lamark. A physical for a team tryout. Right. Well, that’s...good you’re being proactive. Though frankly, most people come to me when they're actually ill, not to get a pre-participation exam. But, alright. Let’s get some details. What kind of team is this for?
PATIENT: It's... Mongolian wrestling. Not the fancy kind with the horses and everything, just… regular wrestling. It’s a local thing. You know, keeps me active. I don’t want to waste your time, Doctor. Just need a quick look-over, tell them I'm good to go.
DOCTOR: "Regular" wrestling. And you're 62, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, 62. Still got it, though! Don’t let the age fool ya. Seriously. I’ve been doing this most of my life. Just need the paperwork, or whatever you need to say I’m okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lamark. While I admire your…enthusiasm, a physical exam is more than just a cursory glance to say you’re “okay.” It’s a necessary step, especially at your age and with a physically demanding activity like wrestling. We need to assess your cardiovascular health, musculoskeletal system, and overall fitness level. Have you had a physical recently?
PATIENT: Uh... not really. It's been a while. Honestly, probably… ten years? Maybe more? I usually just… feel around, you know? If something hurts, I don’t do it. It’s worked so far.
DOCTOR: “Feel around”?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like… if my shoulder feels okay, I wrestle. If my knee’s creaky, I take it easy. It’s pretty straightforward. Look, I understand you gotta ask questions, but I'm a pretty simple guy. I don’t get sick much, I’m strong enough for what I do, and this tryout is important to me. Can we just… get through this?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, with all due respect, that is… not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation. Ignoring potential problems because you "feel around" could lead to serious injury. And frankly, at 62, you're at higher risk for complications. However… let’s start with a basic review of systems. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Pal... what? Look, no. Nothing like that. I get winded sometimes, sure, but wrestling does that to ya. No pain, no dizziness, nothing weird. I just… lift people and throw them around. It’s not complicated. Can we skip all this and just check my heart and, uh, bones?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I am going to ask these questions, and I expect a direct answer. Skipping steps is not an option. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t even go to doctors usually. I told you, I'm a simple guy. I eat normal food, I stay active, and I don't feel sick. I don't know anything about high... colo- what you said. Look, is this going to take all day? Because I gotta get back to training.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand you're eager to get back to training. But I need a complete medical history to ensure your safety. Have you ever experienced any problems with your joints – pain, swelling, stiffness?
PATIENT: My knees creak sometimes, like I said. Especially in the mornings, or when it's cold. It's just old age, I guess. Nothing major. I can still wrestle, I promise. Just a little stiff sometimes. I rub ‘em and they’re fine. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: And your family?
PATIENT: Family? Uh... my brother, he had some heart trouble a few years back. Not sure what kind. He lives back in Mongolia, so I haven't seen him in a while. Besides that… not really anyone with… problems. They all just lived normal lives. Mostly farmers and herders.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. Let’s move on to a physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then we’ll assess your range of motion and musculoskeletal system. I'm going to start with your blood pressure and pulse. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… be quick, okay?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated, 160 over 95. Your heart rate is also a bit fast, 98 beats per minute. I’m hearing a slight murmur. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Murmur? What's a murmur? Is that bad? I... I don't feel any different.
DOCTOR: A murmur is an abnormal sound when listening to the heart. It can indicate a variety of issues, and it requires further investigation. Given your elevated blood pressure, the murmur, and your family history of heart trouble, I'm concerned about potential underlying cardiovascular disease. I’m going to need to order an EKG and a full lipid panel. I also recommend a referral to a cardiologist.
PATIENT: A cardio… what? Look, I just need a piece of paper to say I'm okay for wrestling! I can't go to specialists! I don't have insurance! This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand you're concerned about cost, but your health is not something to be taken lightly. I will not, in good conscience, clear you for a physically demanding activity like wrestling without a proper cardiac evaluation. It would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. I can connect you with resources for low-cost or free cardiac care in the area, but I cannot simply ignore these findings.
PATIENT: So… I can’t wrestle? Not until I see a… cardio-guy? And pay for a bunch of tests I can’t afford? This is just… great. Really great.
