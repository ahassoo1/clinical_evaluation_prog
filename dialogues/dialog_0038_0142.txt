DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaxston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Neeraj Auelua. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Right, well… headaches, mostly. They come on pretty strong, and I get all sweaty when they do, and my heart kinda races, you know? It's been happening on and off for… a while now, I think. Honestly, the time kinda blurs together.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, coming on strong with sweating and a racing heart. And you say this has been going on for a while, but it’s hard to pinpoint exactly how long?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's the thing. It's not like a constant thing, it comes and goes. Maybe… a few months? Longer? I really can't be sure. It feels like it's been happening since… well, since things got a bit messy with my divorce, but I don't know if that's just because of that, if that makes sense? It’s hard to remember exactly when they started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint things when you've got a lot going on. So, these headaches – can you describe what they feel like?
PATIENT: Um… they’re not like a normal headache, if that makes sense? It’s not just a dull ache. It feels… really intense, kinda throbbing, right behind my eyes, and then it spreads all over my head. It’s hard to think straight when it's happening. And like I said, all the sweating and my heart pounding… it’s pretty scary, actually. It feels like… something’s really wrong, but I don't know what.
DOCTOR: Okay, intense throbbing behind the eyes, spreading across the head, accompanied by sweating and a racing heart. That does sound concerning. Have you noticed anything that triggers these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It doesn’t seem to be linked to anything specific. I mean, I work… production, you know? It’s kinda noisy and busy, but I’ve been doing that job for a while now, and they didn’t start happening right away. Sometimes it’s after I’ve been stressed, maybe? But then again, I'm pretty stressed a lot these days, so it’s hard to tell. I wish I knew what brought them on. It’s just… random, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, random onset, not clearly linked to specific triggers, though potentially related to stress. Have you experienced any other symptoms with these headaches?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes I feel a bit… nauseous, I think? Not always, but sometimes I get kinda queasy when they hit. And… I dunno, a bit dizzy, maybe? Everything just kinda spins for a bit. It doesn't last long, usually. I haven’t actually been sick, though, if that makes sense. Just… not feeling great all around, alongside the headache and everything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea and dizziness alongside the headaches, racing heart and sweating. Have you noticed any changes in your vision during these episodes – like seeing spots or blurry vision?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, actually. Sometimes, right before the headache really kicks in, things get a bit… blurry. Not all the time, but a few times I’ve noticed it. Like looking through a… a wavy piece of glass, I guess? It doesn't last long, though. Just for a few minutes, maybe. I didn't really think much of it at the time, just figured I was tired or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision preceding the headaches. That's good information, Jaxston. Let's move on to some general questions. Do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I mean, I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. I don’t really get sick, to be honest. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time, actually. Nothing major ever, you know? Just the usual bumps and bruises. I wouldn’t say I have any conditions, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant past medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. I'm pretty lucky, I guess, haven't needed any. I try to stay away from hospitals if I can, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgical history. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Nothing at all. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I maybe take a painkiller for a really bad backache, but that’s it. Just the regular stuff you can buy at the shop. Nothing regularly, though. No prescriptions or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I haven’t… broken out in rashes or anything like that. I don’t think I have any allergies. It's hard to be completely sure, though, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have a history of headaches, migraines, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mum used to get headaches pretty often, I think. Just normal headaches, as far as I know. Not like these ones. My dad… he was pretty healthy, as far as I remember. Never really talked about illnesses much. I'm not really sure about my grandparents, to be honest. I didn't know them very well. It’s hard to say, really. I don't think anyone had anything serious like migraines, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of headaches, but not severe migraines. Finally, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Uh… I used to drink a bit, but not really anymore. Not since… well, not since things got a bit rough. I don't smoke, never have. And definitely no drugs. I don't really go in for all that. Just… a quiet life, really. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat alright, try to get enough sleep when I can. Work's pretty tiring, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no recreational drugs. Jaxston, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s gonna be anything… uncomfortable. I’m not great with… needles, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. We'll take things slowly. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll do a quick neurological exam – checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination. We’ll finish with a brief look in your eyes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… alright. Just… take it easy, yeah? Like you said, slowly. I'm not good with… surprises, if you know what I mean. I just wanna figure out what’s going on with these headaches, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaxston, absolutely. We'll take it very slowly. Okay, blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Pulse is 88, regular rhythm. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Balance is a little unsteady, but could be related to anxiety. Coordination is good. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light. I'm checking the back of your eye now… I do see a little swelling of the optic disc bilaterally, which is something we'll need to investigate further. It's subtle, but it's there. Okay, Jaxston. Everything else looks normal on the basic exam. However, the swelling of the optic disc is concerning and requires further investigation. I'm going to order a CT scan of your head, just to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Is that… bad? What does swelling of the… the disc mean? Is it something serious? I'm getting a bit worried now, to be honest. I just thought it was headaches…
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaxston, take a deep breath. It’s good you're voicing your concerns. A CT scan is just an imaging test. It helps us see what's going on inside your head. It’s not necessarily a sign that anything is bad, but it helps us rule out potential causes for your symptoms and the swelling. Swelling of the optic disc – it can be caused by a number of things, including increased pressure inside the skull, inflammation, or even a blockage of blood flow. It's important to investigate it, but it doesn't automatically mean it's something serious. We need the CT scan to get a clearer picture. To be completely honest, the symptoms you’ve described – the headaches, the blurry vision, the nausea, the racing heart, and the swelling of the optic disc – they could indicate a number of possibilities, ranging from relatively benign to something more concerning. We need to rule out things like a brain tumor, an aneurysm, or increased intracranial pressure. That’s why I'm ordering the CT scan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A brain… tumor? Oh, wow. That’s… that’s scary. I didn’t even think about… all that. And an… aneurysm? I feel a bit faint, actually. So, you’re saying there could be something really bad wrong with me? I just want to be honest, I was hoping it was just stress. This is… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Jaxston, I understand your fear, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed right now. I want to be clear – I'm not saying you have a brain tumor or an aneurysm. I'm saying those are possibilities we need to rule out. It’s my job to investigate all potential causes for your symptoms, and the CT scan is a crucial step in that process. The vast majority of headaches are not caused by serious conditions. But with your specific symptoms, and the finding of optic disc swelling, it's important to be thorough. We’re going to get this scan done as quickly as possible. I'm going to give you a referral to the imaging center now. They'll get you scheduled, and we’ll get the results back within 24-48 hours. Once we have those results, we can discuss them in detail and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe headache, stiff neck, fever, weakness, or changes in your vision – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. 24-48 hours… That feels like a really long time. What if it is something bad? What happens then? And… will I feel sick after the scan? I hate enclosed spaces, I get really claustrophobic… And… about the money… I don’t have insurance, so will this be really expensive?
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaxston, let's address all of those concerns. Firstly, regarding the timeline – I understand 24-48 hours feels like a long time, especially when you're anxious. We’ll expedite the scan as much as possible. The imaging center will prioritize it given your symptoms. I'll also call them directly to ensure it's scheduled quickly. Regarding what happens if it is something serious – we will discuss all your options, and refer you to the appropriate specialist for further evaluation and treatment. There are many effective treatments available for a variety of conditions. We’ll work through it together, step by step. Regarding the scan itself – it's a relatively quick and painless procedure. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It can be a bit noisy, and some people do feel claustrophobic. If you’re prone to claustrophobia, you can ask for medication to help you relax before the scan. We can also discuss an open MRI as an alternative, but it’s less detailed. Let the technicians know about your anxiety; they are very experienced in helping patients feel comfortable. Finally, regarding the cost – I understand you don't have insurance, which is a significant concern. I'm going to connect you with the hospital's financial assistance department. They can help you explore options for reducing the cost of the scan, such as payment plans or charity care. They may also be able to negotiate a lower rate. We’ll do everything we can to make it affordable. Here’s the referral to the imaging center. The phone number for the financial assistance department is on this sheet. Do you feel okay to call a taxi or do you need help arranging transport home?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Thank you. That… that helps, knowing there are options. I… I think I can manage a taxi. I just need to… process all this. I… I don't know what I'd do without you explaining everything. It's just… a lot. I think I'm ready to go now. Thank you… really.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaxston. It's my job to help you through this, and I'm here for you. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns, even after you leave. We’ll get through this together. Take your time, and don't rush. Remember to call the imaging center and the financial assistance department as soon as you feel ready. Here’s my card with the clinic’s number. Take care, Jaxston. And please, if anything changes, or if you feel worse, don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room.
PATIENT: .
