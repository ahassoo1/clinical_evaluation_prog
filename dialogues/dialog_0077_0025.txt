DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I want to know more about where my family come from, you know? I hear you can do tests... with spit? To see who your people are, long ago. I'm Laury, by the way. Everyone call me Laury.
DOCTOR: Yes, Laury, I understand. You're interested in genetic ancestry testing, to learn more about your heritage. We do offer that service here, through a simple saliva sample. It can provide a fascinating glimpse into your ancestral origins. However, it's important to understand that these tests aren't always entirely definitive, and can sometimes be…complex to interpret. Are you primarily interested in tracing your Marshallese ancestry, or exploring other potential origins as well?
PATIENT: Complex? Oh dear. Well, mostly Marshallese. My family been on the islands a long time, but… stories get lost, you know? My grandma, she talk about other places, maybe before. But I don’t remember exactly what she say. I just want to know… where we really come from. Is it very expensive? I just have Medicare.
DOCTOR: Yes, stories do get lost over time, that’s very true. And it's perfectly understandable to want to connect with your roots. Let me see… the cost of the test is… approximately $450. Fortunately, Medicare does cover a portion of the genetic ancestry testing if it's deemed medically necessary – for example, if it's related to assessing risk for certain inherited conditions. Given your interest is primarily for genealogical purposes, it may not be fully covered, but we can certainly submit a pre-authorization request to see what portion Medicare will approve. Before we proceed with that, Laury, are you aware of any family history of genetic diseases?
PATIENT: Oh, $450! That's... a lot. I don't think my grandma ever talk about sickness in the family, not really. Just... hard work and living on the island. Everyone pretty healthy, I think. Mostly old age get them, you know? Not… special sicknesses. I don’t think so. We just try to eat good fish and stay out of the sun. Is the test… painful? Do they take a lot of spit? I'm a little dry today.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It is a significant cost, and we certainly wouldn't want to proceed if it's a financial burden. And no, the test is not painful at all. It's a very simple procedure. We provide a small tube, and you simply spit into it a few times – it doesn’t require a large amount, perhaps a teaspoon or two. If you are a little dry, we have some water available, of course. It’s more important to get a good sample, but we can try again if needed. Before we get to the sample itself, Laury, just to be thorough, I’d like to briefly review your medical history. Have you been seen by another doctor recently?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Not painful is good. A teaspoon... okay, I can do that. I went to the clinic on the other side of the island last year... for my flu shot. That's about it. Old Man Hemmings gave it to me. He's a good man, but he's… forgetful, like me! He asked me my name three times. I don’t think I see a doctor regular. Mostly just try to stay healthy. I eat lots of coconut. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Coconut certainly counts! A very healthy choice, Laury. And Old Man Hemmings... well, we all have our moments, don’t we?
PATIENT: Yes, he does! He's a good man, though. Always smiling. So, about this spit test... what happens after you get the spit? How long does it take to find out where I come from? And what if it says I'm… not Marshallese? That would be a surprise!
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and a perfectly reasonable concern. After we collect the sample, it's sent to a specialized laboratory for analysis. The turnaround time is typically around 6-8 weeks. They will then provide a detailed report outlining your ancestral origins, based on your DNA. Now, regarding the possibility of it not confirming Marshallese ancestry… it’s important to remember that these tests provide an estimate based on available data. It’s also very common to find a mixture of ancestral origins, reflecting the complex history of migration and settlement. It wouldn’t necessarily mean you aren’t Marshallese, but rather that your ancestors may have come from other regions as well. We can discuss the results together when they come in, and I can help you interpret the findings and understand what they mean. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Six to eight weeks... that's a long time to wait! But… a mixture, you say? That sounds... possible. My grandma did talk about people coming from far away, long ago. I guess it wouldn't be so bad to know where else we come from. Okay. I think I want to try it. If it’s not too expensive, and it doesn't hurt. And you'll help me understand it, right? I don't know much about… DNA. Sounds complicated.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad to hear that. And yes, absolutely, I will be here to help you understand the results every step of the way. DNA can be complicated, but we don’t need to get bogged down in the technical details. We can focus on the broader picture and what it means for you and your family history. Let me just get a few basic details here… your date of birth, insurance information… and a contact number where we can reach you. Then we'll proceed with the sample collection. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… date of birth… August 12th, 1940. Medicare… here it is. Phone number… 555-1234. No allergies, Doctor. Just… old bones. And sometimes I forget things, like I said. But I’m pretty healthy for my age! I still go fishing every week, if the weather is good. And I make little boats out of wood. My hands are good for it.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Laury. Staying active is key! And it sounds like you have a very skilled set of hands. Alright, everything seems to be in order. Now, if you'll just follow me to the next room, we’ll collect the saliva sample. It’s a very simple process, and shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. There's a sterile tube and some instructions on the table. Just spit into the tube until it reaches the marked line. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Laury. If you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to ask. I’ll be just outside the door. .
