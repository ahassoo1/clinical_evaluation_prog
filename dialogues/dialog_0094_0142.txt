DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaxston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning to you too, Doctor. Right, well… it’s my head. It’s been, uh… acting up again. I get these really bad headaches, and I start sweating, and my heart kinda races. It’s… not fun. I’ve had it on and off for a while now, I think. Honestly, it’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches with sweating and a racing heart. That does sound unpleasant. “On and off for a while now” is helpful, but could you give me a little more detail about that “while”?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that’s the tricky part. It’s… months, I guess? Maybe longer? It comes and goes in waves. There’ll be a stretch where I’m fine, then boom, a headache hits and it’s bad for a day or two. It's been happening more often lately, though. Does that make sense? I’m not great at remembering dates and stuff.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Jaxston. It's very common for symptoms to come and go in waves, and not being precise about dates isn’t a problem at all. More frequent headaches recently is a good detail to know. Let's try to pinpoint some specifics about the headaches themselves. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Um… it’s like… a really tight band around my head, mostly. Sometimes it feels like it’s throbbing, like a really bad pulse. It’s usually on both sides, not just one spot. And it’s pretty intense, like… hard to think straight intense. Not like, the worst pain ever, but… really unpleasant. It makes me wanna just lie down in a dark room. Does that help? I’m trying to remember if it feels different each time.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. “Tight band” and “throbbing” are good descriptors. Both sides of the head, intensity that makes you want to lie down... Okay. And does anything trigger these headaches, or seem to make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. Sometimes it happens after I’ve been… stressed, I guess? Work can be a bit much sometimes. But other times it just comes out of nowhere. And I haven't noticed anything making it better, either, not really. I usually just try to sleep it off. I drink water, I suppose, but… I don’t know if that helps or if I just do it because I know I should.
DOCTOR: Okay, stress is a possible trigger, but it’s not consistent. Sleeping and drinking water… those are good general things to do, but not consistently relieving the pain. Let’s move on to those other symptoms you mentioned – the sweating and the racing heart. When those happen, do they come with the headache, or do they happen separately?
PATIENT: They always happen with the headache. Like, I’ll get the headache first, and then… a little while later, I start getting really hot and sweaty. And my heart just… pounds. Not like a panic attack, just… fast. It makes me feel kinda dizzy, sometimes. They all seem to go together, yeah. Headache, then sweat, then fast heart. It’s… not a good combination.
DOCTOR: Okay, headache followed by sweating and a racing heart. That's important information. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside those?
PATIENT: Ugh… sometimes I feel a bit… sick to my stomach? Not full-on vomiting, just kinda queasy. And… this is weird… sometimes my vision gets a little… blurry around the edges. Not a lot, just a bit fuzzy. It goes away when the headache gets better, though. I don’t know if that's related or just… me being tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea and some blurry vision accompanying the headache, sweating, and racing heart. That's helpful to know, Jaxston. Now, let's step back a bit. Have you had any head injuries recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Not that I remember, anyway. I work at the… the factory, doing… stuff. It’s not a dangerous job, not really. No bumps to the head or anything. I’ve definitely stubbed my toe a few times, but… that’s about it. And that wasn’t related to the headaches, I'm pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I had… I think it was just tonsillitis when I was a kid. And… well, I got divorced a couple of years ago, if that counts as a condition. But nothing serious, not like, diabetes or heart problems or anything. I try to eat okay, I guess. I wouldn’t say I’m super healthy, but… not terrible. I don't go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions. Divorce is… stressful, certainly, but not a medical condition. I understand you don’t get to the doctor often. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. I take some ibuprofen sometimes, for the headaches, when they get really bad. But that’s it. Just the occasional ibuprofen. And… sometimes a multivitamin, if I remember. But honestly, I forget more often than I remember. So, not really taking anything regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen for the headaches and a multivitamin sometimes. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. I’m pretty sure I’m not allergic to anything. My mum always said I had a strong stomach. But, to be honest, I haven’t really paid much attention to allergies. I just… eat things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. It will involve checking your blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and doing a basic neurological exam. That means I’ll check your reflexes and eye movements, and assess your strength. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it’s gonna be… weird or anything. I’m not great with needles, if you were wondering. But, yeah, go ahead. I trust you.
DOCTOR: No needles today, I promise. First, let’s take your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, and your pulse is 88 beats per minute. Both are within normal limits, though the blood pressure is slightly elevated. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Okay, let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Your cranial nerves appear intact. Pupil size and reaction to light are normal. Everything looks normal so far, but given your symptoms and the frequency of these headaches, I'd like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your head, just to rule out anything serious. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Like… the one where you lie in that… tube thing? Ugh. Is it… is it really necessary? I mean, if everything looks normal, why do I need to… lie in a tube? I’m not good with small spaces, honestly. And blood work is okay, I guess, but… the scan sounds kinda scary. Is there anything else we could do first?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Jaxston. The CT scan can feel claustrophobic, and it's completely reasonable to be anxious about it. The reason I'm recommending it is to rule out any structural issues causing your headaches – things like an aneurysm, tumor, or even signs of a previous stroke, though it’s unlikely given your age and history. It provides a very detailed image of your brain. We can certainly discuss alternatives, but it’s important to understand the limitations. We could try a trial of medication to prevent the headaches, but that won't tell us what’s causing them. We could also refer you to a neurologist for a more in-depth evaluation, but they will likely want a CT scan or MRI anyway. Before we decide, let me explain the CT scan process in more detail. It's a quick procedure, usually only takes a few minutes, and you'll be closely monitored by a technician. We can even give you a mild sedative to help you relax if you’re feeling anxious. Would you like me to explain the blood work I’m ordering first?
PATIENT: Okay… a sedative sounds… better. But honestly, the thought of being in that tube still makes me wanna just… stay home. And I don't really want to know about anything serious, if you know what I mean? It's better to just… pretend everything's okay, sometimes. But… if it’s really necessary to rule things out… what kind of blood work are we talking about? Just so I know what's going on. And… how long does it take to get the results back? Will I have to come back again? I just… I have stuff going on, you know? Work and… things.
DOCTOR: I understand your feelings completely, Jaxston. It’s perfectly valid to be anxious about knowing potential problems, and to want to avoid unnecessary procedures. The blood work I’m ordering is a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. The comprehensive metabolic panel will check your kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. The complete blood count will check for signs of infection or anemia. And the thyroid test will check your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause headaches. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. I want to assure you that I'm not ordering these tests to scare you, but to get a clearer understanding of what's going on and ensure you receive the best possible care. We can discuss the risks and benefits of the CT scan again if you'd like, and explore alternative options if you're still hesitant. Would you like me to write down the names of the blood tests for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, writing them down would be… good. That makes it feel less… scary, I guess. Knowing what they're looking for. And… okay, 24-48 hours isn’t too bad. I can probably manage that. Maybe… maybe if the blood work comes back normal, we can just… try medication for a while? See if that helps? I really don’t want to do the scan, if I can avoid it. I just… I have a bad feeling about small spaces.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jaxston. That’s a perfectly reasonable plan. If the blood work comes back normal, we can absolutely try a trial of medication to prevent the headaches. We can start with a low dose of a preventative medication, like propranolol or topiramate, and see if that helps reduce the frequency and severity of your headaches. Here are the names of the blood tests. I'll also give you a prescription for an as-needed medication, like ibuprofen 800mg, to help manage the pain when you do get a headache. I will need you to come back in about a week to discuss the results of the blood work. We will evaluate your response to the medication, and if the headaches are not well controlled, we can revisit the discussion about the CT scan. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… sounds good. A week is good. And having something for the pain… that’s helpful. So, just try the medication and see what happens? And then come back and talk about it? Okay. I think… I think I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… made me feel a bit better, honestly. It’s just… scary, you know? When your head’s hurting and you don’t know why. I think… that’s everything, right? No other tests for now? Just the medication? And come back in a week?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's everything for now. Just the medication, and a follow-up appointment in a week. I completely understand your anxiety, Jaxston. It’s perfectly normal to feel scared when you’re experiencing unexplained symptoms. My goal is to help you get to the bottom of this and find a solution that works for you. Here’s some information about the medications I’ve prescribed. Please read it carefully, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or experience any side effects. If anything changes before your appointment, or if your symptoms worsen, please call us immediately. Otherwise, I’ll see you in a week. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I… I will. Try not to worry… easier said than done, but… I will. Bye. And… thank you again. .
