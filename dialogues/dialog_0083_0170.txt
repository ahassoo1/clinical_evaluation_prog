DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They sent me here for an exam, that’s all. I'd like to get it over with as quick as possible if we could.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. We can certainly work efficiently. This is a standard examination required for life insurance policies. It’s primarily to assess your overall health. To begin, let’s go over some basic information and then we’ll proceed with the physical exam. I see here you’re 49 years old and your height is 174 centimeters and weight is 97 kilograms. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Sounds about right. I haven't checked in a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just… nothing regularly. Sometimes I take something for my back if it's acting up, but that's it. It's just ibuprofen, the usual stuff. I don’t take it every day or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain. Do you remember approximately how often you take it, and what dosage do you typically use?
PATIENT: Uh… not very often. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. Two pills, usually. The regular strength ones you get at the store. I don't really pay attention to the milligrams, to be honest. Just what the box says.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Honestly, not much. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, you know. Nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but that healed fine. As an adult… not much. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was okay now. I don’t go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so childhood illnesses, a broken arm, and a history of high blood pressure that is currently resolved. Do you recall when you were diagnosed with the high blood pressure, and what, if anything, was done to treat it?
PATIENT: Let me think… maybe five or six years ago? The doctor put me on some pills for it, but I only took them for a little while. He said my lifestyle changes were helping, and he took me off them after a few months. I started walking more, that's all. I haven't really had any problems since.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Not even tonsils out. I've been lucky like that. Can we get this over with soon? I have some things I need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. We’re getting there. Just a few more questions, and then we’ll proceed with the physical exam. It won’t take long. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... my dad, he had some heart trouble when he was older. He smoked a lot, though. And my mom... she had diabetes, I think. But she didn't take care of herself very well. Other than that, not really. Everyone else seemed pretty healthy. I don't know much about my grandparents, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble in your father, likely related to smoking, and diabetes in your mother. That's helpful information. And finally, do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never been much of a smoker. I used to drink a little beer sometimes, but I haven't had a drink in years. Not into any of that stuff. I try to stay healthy. Are we done with the questions now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Putney, we are. That was very thorough, thank you. Now, we'll just do a brief physical exam – check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your general health. It shouldn’t take long at all. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Finally. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay… Blood pressure is 142/90. That’s a little elevated. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are normal. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Overall, you appear to be in generally good health, but your blood pressure and the murmur warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation? What does that mean? Is something wrong? I just need this exam for the life insurance, I don't need a whole check-up.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Putney. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. A slightly elevated blood pressure is common, and we can monitor that. The murmur is faint, and often harmless, but it's best to rule out any underlying cause. For the life insurance exam, I’ll note these findings in the report. However, I would recommend following up with your primary care physician for a more comprehensive evaluation. They may want to order an EKG or echocardiogram to further assess the murmur, and discuss blood pressure management. Would you like me to provide you with a summary of my findings, and a recommendation for follow-up?
PATIENT: An EKG? An echo-what? Look, I really just need this form signed so I can get the insurance. Is the insurance company going to give me trouble if you write all this down? I don't want to pay more because of a little murmur and some slightly high blood pressure. This is getting complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Putney. The insurance company will likely receive the findings from this exam, and they may request further information. However, it doesn't necessarily mean they will deny coverage or increase your premiums. To be transparent, I will document my findings accurately. I can write a note clarifying that the murmur is faint and requires further evaluation, and that your blood pressure is slightly elevated but could be managed with lifestyle modifications. Ultimately, the decision to approve your insurance policy is up to the insurance company. Would you like me to proceed with completing the insurance form with these notes included?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Just… get it over with. Put the notes in, whatever. I just want this done. And can you hurry, please?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Putney, the form is complete. Here it is for your review and signature. Please let me know if you have any questions before you sign. Once you’ve signed it, you can submit it to the insurance company. I've also printed a summary of my findings for your records. Again, I strongly recommend following up with your primary care physician to discuss these findings further. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s it. Just… thank you. I guess. I’m outta here.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Putney. I wish you all the best, and please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a good day. .
