DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get on with it. It's this tiredness, this exhaustion. And… well, I've been eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I just… crave it sometimes. It's embarrassing, really. I don't know why I'm telling you this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s perfectly alright to share anything you feel is relevant, and I appreciate you being open with me. We'll take things at your pace. The exhaustion is certainly something we need to investigate, and… you mentioned craving dirt?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt. Clay, mostly. Red clay if I can get it. It started a few months ago, just a little bit here and there. Now… well, now it's almost every day. Don't look at me like that! It's not like I'm enjoying it. It just… feels like I need it. And it doesn’t help the tiredness, obviously. I just feel weak all the time. I used to be so strong, you know. Worked with people all day, lifting and moving… now, I can barely get up the stairs.
DOCTOR: I’m not judging you at all, Ms. Hardenburgh. It sounds like you’re experiencing something quite distressing, and it's good you're seeking help. The craving for dirt – we call that pica – and the accompanying fatigue are definitely things we need to explore. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when these cravings occur?
PATIENT: Oh, now you have a fancy name for it. Pica. Figures. It’s whenever, really. Not like after a meal or anything. Sometimes it’s in the morning, sometimes at night… honestly, I don't keep a schedule for eating dirt, Dr. Reisig. It just… happens. A feeling. Like something’s missing. And then I have to have it. It’s… frustrating. And it doesn’t help anything. You think it's because I'm old? Everything just starts falling apart when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily because of your age, Ms. Hardenburgh. While changes in the body can contribute to various sensations, pica can have a number of causes, and we need to investigate those possibilities. It’s good you're aware of the timing being somewhat random; that’s helpful information. To get a clearer picture, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and the cravings?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Symptoms. Let me think. Well, I get a lot of headaches, especially in the afternoons. And… my stomach hasn’t been right for a while now. Just… off. Sort of bloated and uncomfortable. Not diarrhea, not constipation, just… wrong. And I've been feeling colder than usual, even when it’s warm. I always used to be warm-blooded, you know? Now I'm wrapped in a shawl all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, stomach discomfort, and feeling colder… Those are all important pieces of the puzzle. And you said the stomach discomfort is more of a general feeling of being "off" rather than specific diarrhea or constipation?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. "Off." Like something’s just… not working properly. It's hard to explain. Bloated, a little nauseous sometimes, but I haven't actually thrown up or anything. Just… uneasy. And the headaches are mostly on the sides of my head, sort of throbbing. I used to just take some aspirin, but it doesn't seem to help much anymore. Honestly, Dr. Reisig, I just feel old. That's probably all it is. A body wearing out.
DOCTOR: I understand your feeling that it could be simply the effects of time, Ms. Hardenburgh, but it’s important that we rule out other potential causes for these symptoms. We don't want to dismiss anything without investigating. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history. Not much, really. I had the flu a few times, when I was younger, naturally. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a horse. That’s about it. No serious illnesses. I’ve always been a healthy eater, mostly. Lots of vegetables, lean meats… until this dirt thing started, of course. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothing like that. My mother, she had arthritis, but I haven’t had any joint pain or anything. Honestly, I think I’m just being a hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: You’re not being a hypochondriac, Ms. Hardenburgh. It takes courage to come in and discuss these concerns, and we're going to work through this together. It’s good to know you haven’t had any major medical diagnoses in the past, and that your mother’s arthritis didn’t affect you directly. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Never had anything operated on. I always said I'd rather just live with whatever was bothering me than have someone cut me open. A little foolish, maybe, but I never could stand the thought of it. I avoid doctors as much as possible, to be honest. I just hope this isn't something serious that requires surgery.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation with surgery, Ms. Hardenburgh. Many people share that feeling. We’ll certainly explore all non-surgical options first, and only consider surgery if absolutely necessary. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the aspirin, like I said. Sometimes. And… well, I take a calcium supplement. My niece told me I should, for my bones. She’s very insistent. That's it. No other pills, no fancy potions, nothing like that. I don’t believe in all that stuff. Just trying to keep my bones from crumbling, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, aspirin as needed and a calcium supplement. That’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction in my life. Not to anything. I eat everything, try everything… well, except this dirt, of course. That's a new one. But no hives, no swelling, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I'm just a tough old bird, I guess. I always said I had a cast-iron stomach. Until now, anyway.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Ms. Hardenburgh. Alright, we’ve covered a lot of ground. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a few other routine checks. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. The quicker we finish this, the better. I have things to do, you know. Just… don't poke around too much. And try to be gentle, alright? My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hardenburgh. I will be as thorough and gentle as possible. If you could please sit up here, we'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Your blood pressure is 140/85. That's slightly elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's not particularly concerning at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Breath sounds are clear, but a little diminished. That could be due to several factors. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is there any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: Nope. Not much pain. Just… feels a little bloated, like I said. Sort of uncomfortable, but not sharp pain. Ooh, there. That’s a little tender. But it’s always been that way, I think. Maybe it's my gallbladder. My mother had trouble with her gallbladder. Honestly, I just feel like everything is falling apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the right upper quadrant. It's good you mentioned your mother’s gallbladder issues. That’s something we’ll need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to check your extremities for any swelling or changes in sensation. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes my fingers get a little cold, but that’s just the circulation, I think. Always had cold hands. Not much feeling lost, though. Still can knit just fine. I’m a very good knitter, you know. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. Everything seems relatively normal on a quick physical exam, but there are a few things we need to look into further. Given your fatigue, the craving for dirt, the abdominal tenderness, and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order some blood tests and a possible ultrasound of your abdomen. The blood tests will help us check your iron levels, vitamin deficiencies, kidney and liver function, and rule out any underlying infections. The ultrasound will give us a better look at your gallbladder, liver, and other abdominal organs. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests. Honestly, I just want to feel normal again. But… alright, fine. Do what you think is best. Just… try not to take too much blood. I always get lightheaded. And the quicker we get this over with, the better. Just… tell me when I can go home.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh. We'll take as little blood as possible, and I'll be right there to make sure you're comfortable. I’ll also have the nurse bring you a juice box and a snack to help stabilize your blood sugar after the blood draw. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn't take too long. Once the results are back – typically within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… hurry up. I have things to do, remember? And honestly, I don't really want to think about all of this. Just… get me home. .
