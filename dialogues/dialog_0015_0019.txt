DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Hmm… my wife… she wants… a baby. We… old now, you know? She thinks maybe we need… help? I forget what she say exactly. Something about… planning? It’s good to meet you.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s… unusual to be discussing this at your age, but I suppose anything is possible. Let’s clarify. Your wife is interested in attempting to become pregnant?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. She very sure. She always wanted a baby. We… have many grandchildren from other children, but… none from us. It makes her sad. I… I am happy to try, if she is happy. But… is it safe? For her? She not so young anymore, you understand.
DOCTOR: Safe is… relative, Mr. Carlotta. Pregnancy at any age carries risks, but those risks increase substantially with maternal age. Before we even consider any sort of intervention, we need a comprehensive assessment of your wife's overall health. I'll need her complete medical history, any past surgeries, a list of all medications she’s taking, and a detailed family history. And we’ll need to run some tests. Has she had a recent physical exam?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? Hmm… I think so. Maybe last year? She goes to the… the regular doctor, you know? The one near the market. But… I don’t remember the name. She keeps all the papers… at home. Lots of papers. I am not good with remembering things like that. She does take… pills for her blood, the doctor says it’s important. And… sometimes for her heart, when it… flutters.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “sometimes” isn’t particularly helpful, Mr. Carlotta. We need a precise medication list, including dosages and frequency. And knowing why she’s on these medications is crucial. We’ll need to access her records from her primary care physician, if possible. Do you happen to know her date of birth?
PATIENT: Her birthday… hmm… let me think. It’s… July. July 12th, I believe. Yes, July 12th. She likes cake. A big cake. And… she is… oh dear. I forget the year! She is… older than me, that much I remember. I am… 70. She is a few years older. Maybe… 73? 74? I am very sorry, Doctor. My memory is not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. July 12th, approximately 73 or 74 years of age. We'll need to verify that, of course. And we absolutely must obtain a complete medical history. Considering her age and existing medical conditions, pregnancy would be… high-risk. Before any discussion of attempting pregnancy, we need to assess if she's even physically capable of carrying a child, let alone delivering one safely. I’m going to have my nurse take her vital signs and draw some initial blood work. We'll also need an EKG, given her heart palpitations. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Never had a problem with… anything, really. Maybe a little sniffle when the flowers bloom, but that’s all. She… my wife… she is allergic to… shellfish. Yes! Shellfish. Makes her very sick. But I don’t think I am. Just the sniffles. Is EKG… like a picture? Of her heart? I hope it doesn't hurt.
DOCTOR: An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of the heart. It doesn’t involve any injections or discomfort. It’s just stickers placed on the chest, arms, and legs. It's a standard procedure. And, yes, shellfish allergy noted. My nurse will get her set up for the EKG and blood work now. After that, we'll need to schedule a more thorough consultation with her to discuss her medical history and evaluate if pursuing pregnancy is even a remotely safe option, given her age and pre-existing conditions. I want to be very clear, Mr. Carlotta: the risks are significant.
PATIENT: Significant… yes. I understand. She is very strong. Always been strong. But… I worry about her. Maybe… maybe we should just… talk to her more. See how she feels. I don't want to… put her in danger. Can we… just talk first? Before all the… pictures and tests?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Carlotta. I understand your concerns. While I maintain that a thorough medical evaluation is paramount, I can certainly schedule a longer consultation with your wife to discuss her wishes and expectations. We can explore the potential risks and benefits in more detail before proceeding with any testing. However, please understand that I will not endorse any course of action that I deem medically unsafe for her. My priority is her well-being. I'll have my secretary schedule that consultation for next week. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is good. Next week is fine. Thank you. You are very kind. And… please be honest with her. She is a very… determined woman. She needs to know everything.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Carlotta, I always prioritize honest and transparent communication with my patients. I will discuss all potential risks and benefits with your wife in detail. Please have her bring a list of all her current medications and any relevant medical records to the appointment. That will allow me to provide her with the most accurate and comprehensive information possible. I will have the secretary contact you to schedule the appointment. Thank you for coming in. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
