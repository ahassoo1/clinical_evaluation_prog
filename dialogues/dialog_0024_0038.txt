DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… rather difficult to explain, truthfully. I was hoping to discuss… planning for the future, I believe. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… things change. I think it has to do with forms? An Advance Directive, perhaps? I’m terribly sorry, my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: An Advance Directive. Yes, quite. A sensible precaution, though somewhat… premature for someone of your age, wouldn’t you agree?
PATIENT: I understand your concern, Doctor. It’s not that I expect anything to happen, precisely. It’s more… a friend suggested it, after a rather upsetting incident. Honestly, I can’t recall the specifics. It just felt prudent. And, well, better safe than sorry, I suppose. Is it a complicated process?
DOCTOR: Complicated is a… relative term, Ms. Buoniconti. It involves documenting your preferences regarding medical treatment should you become incapacitated. It’s paperwork, mostly, and requires a clear state of mind. Let’s begin with a basic review of your medical history. It will help me assess your capacity, naturally. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Significant… illnesses? That’s… a difficult question. I’ve had the usual colds, I suppose. And a bout of… something with my gallbladder, years ago. It required a procedure, but I don’t recall the details. And… a broken arm when I was a child. Is that helpful? I truly apologize for my vagueness. I feel as though my mind is filled with cotton wool sometimes.
DOCTOR: Colds, gallbladder, broken arm. Standard fare. Any surgeries beyond the gallbladder?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. No, I don't believe so. Not that I recall, at least. There was… a dental procedure, quite recently, but that hardly counts as surgery, does it? I’m certain I’d remember something as significant as surgery. Unless… unless it was very long ago? It's all so hazy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Family history, then. Any notable illnesses within your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… a difficult topic, Doctor. My parents are… were both from Mongolia, and I haven’t had contact with most of my extended family for many years. I know my mother had… something with her heart, I think. It was a long time ago. And my father… he was a very stoic man. He rarely spoke of illness, even his own. I’m afraid I can’t offer you much in the way of specifics. It’s terribly frustrating, I know.
DOCTOR: Frustrating for me as well, Ms. Buoniconti. Now, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. I find the habit… distasteful. And I drink… very rarely. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion, but that is all. I spend most of my time in my studio, etching and engraving. It requires a steady hand and a clear mind, and… well, those activities don't pair well with substances. I assure you, I lead a very… quiet life.
DOCTOR: Quiet lives can still be fraught with… complications. Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I do get a slight rash when I handle certain metals, particularly nickel. It’s… inconvenient, but not life-threatening. And I believe I have a mild sensitivity to dust, but that's more of an irritation than a true allergy, I suppose. Is this all relevant to the Advance Directive, Doctor? I don’t mean to be difficult, I’m simply trying to understand why you are asking these questions.
DOCTOR: It’s a matter of establishing a comprehensive baseline, Ms. Buoniconti. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a mild blood pressure medication. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. And… occasionally, an over-the-counter pain reliever for my hands, when I’ve been working for too long. Is there something specific you're looking for? It's just... trying to recall everything is proving rather difficult, and I wouldn’t want to omit anything important.
DOCTOR: Name of the blood pressure medication, Ms. Buoniconti. Dosage. And when was the last time you had a physical exam?
PATIENT: The medication… it’s… Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, daily. And the last physical… oh dear. That’s a difficult question. I see a doctor for check-ups, of course, but the dates… they all seem to blur together. It was… within the last year, I think. Perhaps six months ago? I truly apologize, Doctor. I should have made a note of it. I am not a particularly organized person.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Perhaps that will… clarify matters. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I do hope I haven’t wasted your time with my… vagueness. It's just… disconcerting, not being able to recall these things.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat, Ms. Buoniconti. We’ll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Respiration is… normal. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are… regular. Slight wheezing in the left lung, but not significant. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Please inform me if you feel any discomfort. Soft, non-tender. No masses palpable. Reflexes are… within normal limits. Now, I'd like to check your throat, eyes and ears. Throat is clear. No signs of infection. Eyes… normal. Ears… normal.
PATIENT: That… that was a little uncomfortable, Doctor. But not painful, exactly. Just… sensitive. Is everything alright? The wheezing… is that something I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: The sensitivity is likely due to gas. The slight wheezing is… not alarming, but we’ll monitor it. It could be a minor bronchial irritation. Now, Ms. Buoniconti, based on this cursory examination and your… less than precise medical history, I recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying pulmonary issues. And a complete blood count, just to be safe.
PATIENT: An X-ray… and a blood test. Of course, Doctor. Whatever you recommend. But… will these tests help determine if I’m… capable of making these decisions about an Advance Directive? I’m worried that my… memory lapses might be perceived as a sign of something more serious. I don't want to be a burden, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The tests are standard procedure, Ms. Buoniconti. They will help establish a baseline, and then we can assess your cognitive function. As for your… memory lapses, they are concerning, naturally. However, they do not automatically disqualify you from making healthcare decisions. We will need to perform a more thorough neurological evaluation if these issues persist. My nurse will draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. I recommend you see a neurologist in the interim. I can provide a referral. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: A neurologist… Yes, I suppose that makes sense. I… I don't think I have any questions at the moment, Doctor. Just… a little apprehensive, that’s all. And… grateful for your patience. I suppose I should wait for the nurse, then?
DOCTOR: .
