DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been having in my side… my flank, I think it’s called? And… I keep getting water infections, you see. They tell me it’s something to do with my kidneys. A bit of a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, flank pain and recurrent urinary tract infections. I understand. Let's talk about this flank pain first. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It comes and goes, you see. Not constant. Sometimes it’s just a dull ache, other times it’s… well, sharp. Really sharp. It’s usually on my right side, but sometimes I feel it on the left as well. It doesn’t seem to be connected to anything specific, eating or moving about… just comes on. It lasts for a few hours usually, then goes away. Then comes back another day.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent, sharp pain in both flanks, but more often on the right. Not related to activity or food. And how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… it’s been a while now. Years, I’d say. At least five years, maybe more. It comes and goes in waves, so I didn't think much of it at first. Just thought it was… old age, you know? But it’s been happening more often lately, and that's when the doctor back home suggested I see someone about my kidneys. They mentioned something about cysts… Polycystic something? I can’t quite remember.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease is a possibility, yes. It's good you're getting it checked out. And these water infections – how frequently are you experiencing those?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it used to be maybe once a year. But this past year… it’s been at least four times, Doctor. Four! And each time, it’s quite unpleasant. I have to take those… antibiotics, you know? The doctor says I get them often because of the kidneys. It’s just… tiring, always feeling unwell. And worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Espinueva. Four urinary tract infections in a year is definitely something we need to investigate further. Let's go through some other questions to get a clearer picture. Do you have any trouble urinating – like a burning sensation, difficulty starting, or a weak stream?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it… sometimes it’s a bit difficult to get it going, you see? It doesn’t happen every time, but often I have to wait a bit. And the stream isn’t as strong as it used to be, definitely. No burning sensation, thankfully, but it’s just… a bit weak and slow. And I find myself going to the toilet more often than I used to, especially at night. It wakes me up, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty starting urination, a weak stream, and increased frequency, particularly at night. That's helpful information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, so I was put on some tablets for that. I take them every day. Apart from that… no, not that I know of. I’ve always been reasonably healthy, all things considered. I don’t have any heart problems, and they never said anything about diabetes. Just the blood pressure, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you manage high blood pressure with medication. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it written down somewhere… Ah, here we are. It’s… Lisinopril, I think? Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for high blood pressure. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. And I’ve been very lucky, haven’t been in hospital for anything. A few bad colds and flu, of course, but nothing serious enough to need a hospital stay. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like kidney problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had a weak heart, I believe. He passed away when he was quite young, from a heart attack. As for kidney problems… I don't recall anyone specifically having trouble with their kidneys, but my family isn’t one for talking about these things, you see? We just sort of… dealt with it. So, it’s hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure and heart disease. That's helpful. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Always thought it was a silly habit. My wife… she used to smoke, but she gave it up years ago.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I enjoy a glass of wine with my dinner sometimes, Doctor. Just one glass, usually. Nothing more. I don’t drink spirits or beer. Just the occasional glass of red wine.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional red wine. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I can take most medications without any problems. I’ve never had any bad reactions to anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva, that’s very thorough. Thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm palpating your abdomen now. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a little bit. Right there… it's not sharp, but it’s… uncomfortable. A dull ache, really. Like a heavy feeling. It’s worse when you press harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the right flank. And what about here, on the left side?
PATIENT: No, not so much on the left. A little bit, maybe, but nothing like the right side. It’s much more noticeable on the right. Feels… different, you see? More… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, right flank tenderness is more pronounced. I'm going to listen to your abdomen now with the stethoscope. Your bowel sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. Kidney stones, an infection, or possibly something related to your kidneys themselves, such as polycystic kidney disease, as the doctor back home mentioned. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some tests. A urine analysis, a blood test to check your kidney function, and an ultrasound of your kidneys. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary, please go ahead. I want to get to the bottom of this, you see? It’s been troubling me for a long time now. And… if it is something to do with my kidneys, the sooner we know, the better. So, yes, please order those tests.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab. They’ll contact you to schedule the tests. The ultrasound may require a separate appointment, and the lab will coordinate that for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, severe pain in your back or side, or difficulty urinating, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. Fever, chills, severe pain, difficulty urinating… go to the emergency room. I’ve made a note of it here. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. I appreciate your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could help. We'll get those test results back as quickly as possible, and we'll discuss them thoroughly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s everything for now. I think I’ve covered everything I was worried about. Thank you again for your kindness and your thoroughness. I’ll wait to hear from the lab about the tests. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. You have a good day as well, and please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Goodbye.
