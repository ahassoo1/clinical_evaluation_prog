DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires some medical information before I can confirm my booking. Nothing serious, mind you, just paperwork, really. I was hoping you could assist me with it.
DOCTOR: Paperwork, hm?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. They’ve sent a form… a rather lengthy form, actually. It asks about past illnesses, operations, that sort of thing. And a current health summary, I suppose you’d call it. I just thought it would be best to have a doctor complete it, rather than trying to recall everything myself. My memory is quite good, but it’s always better to be thorough, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Thoroughness is… advisable. Let's start with the basics then. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… let me think. Now, my husband, God rest his soul, he had high blood pressure, but I haven’t. No, I don’t believe I have. I had a touch of bronchitis a few years back, but that cleared up completely with antibiotics. And I’ve always been prone to hay fever in the spring, but that’s hardly a chronic condition, is it? Mostly just sneezing and a runny nose.
DOCTOR: Alright, no chronic conditions to speak of. Bronchitis… and seasonal allergies. Anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I had my tonsils out when I was a wee girl, and I broke my arm once falling out of a tree – a rather silly accident, looking back – but those were many years ago, and fully healed. Nothing that would trouble me now, or affect my trip, I should think. I was always a bit of a tomboy, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Tonsillectomy and a fractured arm in childhood. Noted. Any current medications you’re taking?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I don't take anything regularly. Just the occasional over-the-counter pain reliever if I have a headache, but that’s perhaps once or twice a year. I pride myself on staying healthy, you see. A good diet, plenty of fresh air, and a bit of gardening. That's my recipe, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Gardening, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, indeed! It keeps me active and, as I said, healthy. Roses are my specialty, you know. They require a good deal of attention, but the rewards are well worth it. Is that… unusual, Doctor? To not be on any medication at my age? I just want to be certain I’m providing you with all the necessary information.
DOCTOR: It's… less common. Tell me, Ms. Squiers, have you had any major surgeries as an adult?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I've been very fortunate, you see. As I mentioned, my tonsils came out when I was a child, but that was the extent of it. Never a need for anything more serious. I do worry a bit about flying, as I haven’t travelled much in recent years, but I wouldn't say it's a medical concern, exactly. Just a bit of nervousness, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Right. No surgeries. And just some travel anxiety. Now, let's talk about allergies. You mentioned seasonal allergies. Anything else you're allergic to?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Hay fever in the spring, as I said. A bit of a nuisance, really, but easily managed with a tissue and a bit of fresh air. I've never had a serious allergic reaction to anything – food, animals, anything at all, come to think of it. I've always been rather careful about what I eat and where I go, I suppose. One must be cautious, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies beyond seasonal hay fever. And you’re not currently taking any medications. Now, Ms. Squiers, I need to ask about your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, I’m afraid not. My mother passed away about fifteen years ago, from a heart condition. And my father… he died when I was quite young, in the war, actually. A tragic loss, but that was a long time ago. I do remember my mother mentioning my grandfather had some trouble with his digestion, but that was a rather vague ailment, as I recall. Nothing serious, mind you.
DOCTOR: Mother: heart condition, deceased. Father: deceased, wartime. Grandfather: vague digestive issues. And what about siblings?
PATIENT: I had one brother, Thomas. He lived a long and happy life, thankfully. He passed away about five years ago, from pneumonia. He was a very active man, always outdoors, so it was quite a shock. He didn't have any major health problems before that, as far as I know. Just a bit of a cough in the winter, nothing to worry about. He was a lovely man, always cheerful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mother: heart condition, deceased. Father: deceased, wartime. Brother: pneumonia, deceased. Now, Ms. Squiers, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband didn't smoke either, thankfully. We always believed in a healthy lifestyle, you see. Fresh air and good food are far more appealing, wouldn't you agree? And I certainly wouldn't risk damaging my lungs. That would rather spoil my gardening, wouldn't it?
DOCTOR: Indeed. Non-smoker. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Only very occasionally, Doctor. A glass of sherry with Christmas dinner, perhaps, or a small glass of wine with a nice meal. Nothing excessive, mind you. I’m not a heavy drinker at all. I prefer a nice cup of tea, to be honest. It's far more relaxing, and far better for one's health, I believe.
DOCTOR: Occasional alcohol consumption. And what about your activity level?
PATIENT: Oh, I’m quite active, actually! As I mentioned, I love gardening, and that keeps me very busy. I spend several hours outdoors most days, tending to my roses. I also enjoy a nice walk in the countryside when the weather is good. And I do a bit of housework, of course. I certainly don’t spend all my time sitting down, Doctor! I believe in keeping busy and staying active. It’s good for the body and the mind, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Gardening. Let's move on. Do you have any history of depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Never a spot of trouble there. I’ve always been a cheerful person, and I enjoy a good laugh. Losing my husband was difficult, of course, a terrible blow, but I have a good support network of friends and neighbours, and I cope very well. I’m not one to dwell on things, Doctor. I prefer to look forward, not back. And I certainly don’t suffer from any mental health concerns. I’m perfectly content, thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Squiers, that seems to cover the basics. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure, just to be thorough. If you'll just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I do hope I haven’t taken up too much of your time. I just want to be certain everything is in order before my cruise. Do let me know if there’s anything else you require.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, rate is 78. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Blood pressure is 130/80. Everything sounds normal. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not concerning for someone your age.
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring to hear, Doctor. I do try to stay active, as I mentioned. I’m glad to know everything appears to be in order. So, does that mean you can complete the medical form for my cruise? That would be most helpful. I'm rather anxious to finalize my booking, you see, before the prices go up any further.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Squiers, I can complete the form. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend monitoring it at home for a week. If it consistently remains above 140/90, you should consult with a cardiologist. And I suggest limiting your salt intake and increasing your exercise.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Monitoring my blood pressure… that sounds rather complicated. I’m not very good with machines, you see. And I do enjoy a bit of salt with my dinner, I must confess. Would it be alright if I just… kept an eye on things? I do try to be careful, and I’m generally very healthy. Perhaps it was just a temporary fluctuation? I’m rather excited about my cruise, and I don't want to worry about things needlessly.
DOCTOR: A "temporary fluctuation" at your age is still worth investigating. I’m not telling you to drastically change your lifestyle, Ms. Squiers, simply to be aware. I can write you a referral to a cardiologist, just for a baseline check. It’s better to be safe than sorry. And I will note on the form that your blood pressure was slightly elevated, and that monitoring is recommended. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you think it’s best… A referral to a cardiologist… it does seem a bit excessive, but I suppose I should do what’s best for my health. Very well, please do write the referral. I'll try to make an appointment as soon as possible. And thank you… I suppose, for being so thorough. Is there anything else you require before you complete the form? I'm anxious to get this sorted, you see.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Squiers, that will be all. Here you are. And here's the referral. The cardiologist is Dr. Eleanor Vance. She’s quite good, but doesn’t suffer fools. I strongly advise scheduling an appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time, and your thoroughness. I suppose… I suppose that concludes our visit? I do hope I haven’t taken up too much of your valuable time. I’m very much looking forward to my cruise, you see. I'm sure everything will be just fine.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Squiers, that concludes our visit. Do try to schedule that appointment. And try to enjoy your cruise, despite your… tendencies. .
PATIENT: .
