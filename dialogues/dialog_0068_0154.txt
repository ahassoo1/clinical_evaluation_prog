DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Well, it’s… this waterworks business again. It keeps happening, you see. It’s… troublesome. I don’t quite recall when it started started, exactly, but it’s been a bit of a bother for some time now.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks business,” alright. And when you say “happening,” could you describe what that means exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It’s… well, I have to go to the little girls’ room very often. And it… burns. It doesn’t feel very nice at all, you understand. And sometimes... sometimes it feels like it doesn’t quite finish, if you know what I mean. I’m sorry, it’s rather… personal. Is that enough information? I don’t recall all the details.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, burning sensation, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. Right. And is this happening constantly, or are there times when it's better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… worse at night, I believe. I have to get up, you see. Several times. It wakes me. And… during the day it's not as bad, but still… frequent. I don’t drink a lot of water, I don’t think. Not much anyway. Does that… help? I apologize for being so vague. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Nocturia – waking up to urinate. Okay. And how much fluid do you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, that’s a difficult question. I have a cup of coffee with breakfast, and… perhaps a glass of juice with lunch? And maybe some water… if it's hot. Honestly, Doctor, I don't measure it. I just drink when I’m thirsty. Is that… bad? I really don’t keep track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Oh, blood? No, I don’t think so. I would remember that, wouldn’t I? It’s… it hasn't been that noticeable, if it was. As for pain… sometimes a little ache in my lower back, but I assumed that was just my age. I’m not a young woman anymore, you see. Everything aches a little bit. Is that… important? I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: No blood in the urine, some lower back discomfort. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I just want to listen to your abdomen and do a basic neurological check. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a check-up? Well… I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have… an appointment later. It's rather important. But, yes, you may check. Just… be gentle, if you would. My back is a little sensitive, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with this. Just breathe normally. Alright… abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. Now, can you just tell me if you feel anything when I touch your back here?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, I’m lying down. Ooh, yes. That’s… a little tender right there. Not painful, exactly, but… I can feel it. It’s… that’s where it bothers me sometimes, you see. A dull ache. Like a… a weight. Is that… is that normal? I don’t like being poked and prodded, if you don’t mind me saying.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation in the lower back. Okay. Alright, Ms. Wease, based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, it sounds like you could be experiencing a urinary tract infection, or potentially some bladder irritation. However, given your age and the lack of fever or significant pain, we need to rule out other causes. I’m going to order a urinalysis to check for infection. And, I think it would be wise to do a simple blood test to check your kidney function. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh, a blood test? Oh dear. I don’t… I don't like needles. But… if you think it’s necessary. A urinalysis… that sounds a little less frightening. Yes, alright. If that’s what you recommend, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you would? I have that appointment, you see. I really must be prompt.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write the orders for the lab tests. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. They will explain the process. It shouldn’t take too long. And depending on the results, we may need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss further treatment options. Is there anything else you want to discuss at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, no. No, I think that’s all. Just… the tests. And hopefully, they won't take too long. I really appreciate you seeing me, Doctor. I just want this… waterworks business to stop. Thank you. I should probably wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wease. We’ll get these tests done quickly, and hopefully, we can figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better soon. The nurse will be in shortly. .
