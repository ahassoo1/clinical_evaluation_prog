DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Jammal. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Thirty years in family medicine… time flies, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, thirty years… that is a long time. It is very nice to meet you as well. I am Jammal Goodstein. I have… a bit of a problem, if you don’t mind hearing about it.
DOCTOR: Please, Jammal, that’s what I’m here for. Don't hesitate. "A bit of a problem" is perfectly alright. Take your time and tell me what's been going on. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well… it is… gas. A lot of gas. More than usual, and it’s… embarrassing, to be honest. It happens all the time, Doctor. After I eat, sometimes even when I eat. And it… smells, I think. It’s not very pleasant. I was hoping you could… help. I am a fast food worker, so maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Alright, excessive gas… I understand. And you’re right to mention the embarrassment, that's completely valid. It's good you brought it up. And yes, fast food work could absolutely be a contributing factor—lots of processed foods, different oils… We’ll get to the bottom of it. So, you're noticing it frequently during and after meals?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. Both during and after. It’s… difficult to explain. Sometimes it starts while I am eating, and other times it’s a little bit later. It’s not every meal, but… most of them. And it has been happening for… oh, maybe six months now? It seems to be getting worse, slowly, but it is worse. I eat simple foods usually - hamburgers, fries, things like that. Nothing too fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months… and gradually worsening. That gives us a good timeframe. And you mention hamburgers and fries – pretty standard fare. Do you notice any particular foods that seem to trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: That is… a good question, Doctor. I have not been keeping a very close watch, to be honest. But I think… onions? Onions seem to make it worse. And… sometimes the sauces. The sauces that come with the hamburgers. Maybe it is the dairy? I do not know much about dairy, but I think the sauces have it. And… fizzy drinks. If I drink a fizzy drink, then I definitely have gas. It is almost immediate, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very helpful, Jammal. Onions, sauces – potentially dairy in those, and fizzy drinks are definitely a trigger. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the gas?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes my stomach feels… bloated. Like it is very full, even if I have not eaten much. And… a little bit of cramping. Not terrible pain, just… uncomfortable. And… I am a little bit… tired, maybe? I do work long hours at the fast food place, so it could be that. But I think the gas makes it worse. It is… difficult to explain everything, Doctor. I hope I am making sense.
DOCTOR: You’re making perfect sense, Jammal. Bloating, mild cramping, and some fatigue… all of that can absolutely be connected. Don’t worry about explaining, just tell me what you’re experiencing. It all paints a picture. Now, a quick question – any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… hmm. That is… a personal question, Doctor. But… yes, a little bit. I go to the bathroom more often now. Not diarrhea, exactly, just… more frequently. And… sometimes it is difficult. Not constipation, but… not easy, if you understand. I do drink a lot of water, so I thought that would help.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Jammal. Thank you for sharing that. More frequent bowel movements, and a bit more effort than usual. That’s good information. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not been diagnosed with anything. I do not go to the doctor very often. I am usually healthy. I had the… the COVID shot, when it first came out, but other than that… nothing. I have Medicare, so I get check-ups, but they never find anything wrong. They tell me I am… okay. That is why I came to you, Doctor. This gas problem… it is new.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. No prior medical diagnoses, just the COVID vaccine, and generally healthy. And that's exactly why you're here – to address something new. That's excellent. Now, do you take any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. I try to avoid them, if I can. I take vitamins sometimes, a multi-vitamin, but that is it. I drink a lot of water, like I said. And… I try to get enough sleep, but it is difficult with the long hours at work. But no medications. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, just a quick family history question. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had some problems with her stomach. I think she had… ulcers, maybe? A long time ago. She went to the hospital, but that was before I was born, I think. And my father… he had problems with his heart. But other than that… not that I know of. We do not talk about medical things much in my family. It is… not polite, I think. But no, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful, Jammal. Thank you. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. And I do not drink alcohol, either. I do not like the taste of it. I eat a lot of fast food, I admit, but other than that… I try to be healthy. I walk to work sometimes, when the weather is nice. But the work itself is… very tiring. But no smoking, no alcohol. I am a simple man, Doctor. I eat, I sleep, I work. That is all.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Jammal. A simple life, you said. Okay. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies. I can eat anything. My mother used to make me try all sorts of things when I was a little boy, to make sure I did not have allergies. She was very careful. So no, no allergies to medications or foods. I am very lucky, I think. That is one thing I do not have to worry about.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Jammal. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen, and maybe do a gentle press. Nothing to worry about, just getting a feel for things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. You may listen and press. I do not mind. I trust you. I hope you can find out what is wrong with my gas. It is… very embarrassing, sometimes. But I trust you to help me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jammal. Just lie back and relax. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. I'll let you know what I hear. Okay. I’m not hearing anything particularly concerning at this point – normal bowel sounds. And no significant tenderness when I press. A little bit of… fullness, but that's likely related to the gas. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to get a baseline. Heart sounds are good, lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Everything seems normal on the physical exam, which… actually isn’t surprising given your description. This sounds like a functional issue, likely related to diet or how your body is processing foods.
PATIENT: That is… good to hear, Doctor. That it is not something serious. So… what does that mean, exactly? "Functional issue?" And… what can I do about it? I do not want to keep having this… embarrassing gas problem. Can you prescribe me something?
DOCTOR: “Functional issue” just means there’s no underlying disease causing it. Your digestive system is probably a little sensitive, and certain foods are triggering the gas production. It's very common. And yes, we can definitely try something. A prescription isn’t necessarily the first step, though. Often, dietary changes are the most effective solution. Have you ever tried keeping a food diary?
PATIENT: A food diary? No, Doctor, I have not. What does that involve, exactly? It sounds like… a lot of work. I work very long hours, as I said. I do not have much time. But… if it will help, I am willing to try. What do I write down? Everything I eat? Everything I drink?
DOCTOR: It can be a bit of work, I admit, but it doesn't have to be overly complicated. Just write down everything you eat and drink, and when you eat it. And more importantly, note how you feel afterwards – any bloating, cramping, gas, or changes in bowel movements. Even just a simple “good,” “okay,” or “bad” can be helpful. We can start with a week. Then, we can review it together and see if we can identify any patterns. In the meantime, I also recommend trying to reduce your intake of fizzy drinks, onions, and dairy – those seem to be the biggest culprits based on what you've told me. And try to eat smaller, more frequent meals, rather than large ones. It can help with digestion. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… manageable. A week. And just write down everything. I can do that. I will try to be very careful. And I will cut back on the fizzy drinks, and the onions, and the dairy. So… no medication right away? Just the diary, and the cutting back? Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything I can buy at the store?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Let's try that for a week and see how it goes. We don't want to jump to medication unless absolutely necessary. There are a few over-the-counter options that can help with the symptoms if they're really bothersome. Simethicone – brand name Gas-X – can help reduce bloating and gas. And Beano contains an enzyme that helps break down the sugars in beans and other gas-producing foods, but it doesn't sound like that's your main issue. But honestly, I'd hold off on those for now and see if the dietary changes make a difference. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly. A week of the diary, and cutting back. And I will avoid the medication for now. Thank you very much, Doctor. You have put my mind at ease. It is… embarrassing to talk about, but you have been very understanding. I will do my best to follow your advice. When should I come back?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jammal. I’m glad I could help. It’s good that you came in. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today. That will give you a week to do the diary and a week to see how the changes affect your symptoms. We can review the diary together and decide on the next steps then. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Two weeks from today is perfect. Thank you again for your time, and your help. I feel much better now. I will see you then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that for you before you leave. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. I'm glad I could help, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. Take care, Jammal. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that very much. I will see you in two weeks. Goodbye. .
