DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh… good morning. I… something about travel? My wife… she would have remembered. It’s for a trip. I think. A long one.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like this visit is related to an upcoming trip, but you're not entirely sure of the specifics. That's alright, we can figure it out together. Let's start with what you know about the trip. Do you know where you're traveling to, and when?
PATIENT: Hmm… she booked it. Everything. I just… went along. Somewhere hot, I think. Very hot. Lots of sand. And… people. Not like here. When… August, maybe? Soon, anyway. It feels soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a warm, sandy place with lots of people, sometime in August. That helps narrow things down. Do you happen to know which country you’ll be visiting?
PATIENT: Country? Is that important? She said… Egypt? No, that doesn’t sound right. Morocco? Maybe… it sounds like a spice. Lots of spices. I don’t know! She did all the planning. I just… packed. And followed. It was… a while ago now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Morocco sounds like a possibility then. It’s warm, sandy, and definitely has lots of spices! It's perfectly fine that your wife handled the planning; many couples divide tasks that way. To help me understand what we need to address for your trip, let's talk about why you’re here today. Was there something specific your wife asked you to get checked out before you go?
PATIENT: Checked out? She… she worried about everything. Everything! Shots, I think. And… sickness. She read things on the internet. About bugs and… and fevers. She said something about… needing to be careful. She made a list. But I… I can’t find it. It was a very long list.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like your wife was concerned about necessary vaccinations and potential illnesses you might encounter while traveling, and she made a list of things to discuss with a doctor. That's very responsible of her. Let's go through some of the common concerns for travel to Morocco. To start, have you had any vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Vaccinations…? Not that I remember. Maybe when I was little? For school? A long, long time ago. She would have known. She kept all the papers. Everything! I’m… not good with remembering things like that. It’s why I let her handle everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. We can certainly look into your vaccination history. I'll start by checking our records to see if we have anything on file for you. While I do that, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health…? I work. I lift things. It’s heavy work. Sometimes my back hurts. And my knees. Old work injury. But… I’m okay. I eat. I sleep. Mostly. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. She took me when I needed it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you do physically demanding work, and you’ve had a previous knee injury that sometimes bothers you. It sounds like you've been managing alright on your own for the most part. Let's talk about that knee injury for a moment. When did that happen, and what kind of treatment did you receive at the time?
PATIENT: Oh… that was a long time ago. Factory accident. A box… fell. It was… heavy. Very heavy. They… bandaged it. And gave me pills. For the pain. I don’t remember what kind. I just… took them. And went back to work. She… she wasn’t happy about that. She said I should have rested. But… I needed the money.
DOCTOR: Okay, a factory accident with a heavy box, treated with bandages and pain medication. And you went back to work relatively quickly despite your wife’s concerns. Do you still experience pain or limitations with your knee currently?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not all the time. But… when it rains. Or when I lift something very heavy. It aches. And… it clicks. It doesn’t stop me from working. But… it’s there. She always made me put a warm compress on it when it bothered me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so intermittent knee pain, worse with rain and heavy lifting, accompanied by clicking. And your wife was good about encouraging you to use warm compresses. Now, let's briefly talk about any medications you currently take, even over-the-counter ones. Do you take anything regularly for pain, or any other health condition?
PATIENT: Medications…? Just the pain pills. When my knee hurts. The blue ones. I buy them at the shop. Not… regularly. Only when I need them. And… vitamins. She made me take vitamins. Every morning. But… I stopped. After… after she was gone. I forget things. Like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional pain pills purchased from the shop when your knee bothers you, and you previously took vitamins regularly at your wife’s insistence but have since stopped. Now, I understand this is a difficult topic, but it's important for me to have a complete picture of your health. You mentioned your wife is no longer with us. I’m very sorry for your loss. Has it been long since she passed away?
PATIENT: A year. Almost a year. It… it feels like yesterday. Everything is… different now. She always knew what to do. She always remembered everything. I don't… I don't do well on my own.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely natural to feel overwhelmed and lost after such a significant loss. Take your time. There’s no rush. It sounds like your wife was a very important person in your life, and it's clear she took excellent care of you. Now, I want to make sure we address your health concerns for this trip to Morocco. You mentioned you have some pain in your knee, and you are unsure of your vaccination history. To best prepare you, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to assess your overall condition and get a better understanding of your knee pain. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: If… if you think it's necessary. I don't… I don't really understand what you do. She always explained everything. But… if you think it will help. I guess. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. I’ll explain everything as we go. We'll start with some basic vitals – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and finally, I’ll take a closer look at your knee. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but nothing to be overly concerned about right now. Your pulse is 72, and your temperature is 98.6 – both within normal limits. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your knee. Could you please bend it for me?
PATIENT: Ow… that feels… tight. It clicks a lot when I do that. See? And it’s… warm. Not like the other one.
DOCTOR: You’re right, I can feel some warmth and a little swelling around your knee joint. There's tenderness when I press here. It sounds like you may have some mild osteoarthritis, which is a common condition, especially with previous injuries. The clicking is also consistent with that. Do you experience any stiffness in your knee in the mornings, or after periods of rest?
PATIENT: Yes… sometimes. In the mornings, it’s… hard to move. Like it’s stuck. I have to… work it loose. It takes a while. And… after I sit for too long. Like on the bus. Or when I’m watching TV. Then it gets… tight again. It’s just… old. I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that stiffness in the mornings and after periods of rest supports the possibility of osteoarthritis. Now, to help me determine the best course of action for your trip, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your health history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. She… she took me for checkups. But they always said I was… okay. Just… a little overweight. And… she said I needed to exercise more. But I worked. That was exercise enough, I thought. I don’t think I have any… serious problems. Just… old. And… sad.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known major medical conditions other than being slightly overweight. And you've been experiencing sadness since your wife's passing, which is perfectly understandable. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors, such as pollen or dust?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. I don’t think so. I eat… everything. She always made sure I didn't eat anything bad. No… I don't think I’m allergic to anything. Maybe… dust? Sometimes I sneeze when I’m cleaning. But that’s… everyone, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies other than potentially mild sensitivity to dust. Now, one final question about your current medications. You mentioned taking pain pills occasionally. Can you tell me the dosage and how often you take them?
PATIENT: Um… just when it hurts. Maybe… two? Sometimes three. I don't… I don't really count. When my knee is really bad. And… I take them with water. I think they’re… 200 milligrams? She always told me how many to take. But… I forgot. It’s just… blue pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. It's important to know exactly what you're taking, especially when traveling. Unfortunately, these pills are unlabeled, so I can't be certain of the dosage or the specific medication. Taking unlabeled medication can be risky.
PATIENT: .
