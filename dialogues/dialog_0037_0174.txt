DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I wish the circumstances were brighter. I’m here because… well, I haven’t been myself lately. Feeling quite down, you see. Honestly, I’m not sure where to begin. I just want to get this sorted, if possible. I don’t have much time, if you don’t mind a quick visit.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. We’ll do our best to be efficient. “Not yourself” can mean a lot of things. Could you tell me more about what you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to explain. Everything feels… muted. The joy has gone out of things. I used to love my work – lifeguarding, even ski patrol, keeping people safe. Now… it’s just a job. A tiring job. I don't sleep well, and when I do, I don’t feel rested. I’ve lost interest in seeing my friends, even my grandchildren. It’s just… a heavy feeling, all the time. Like a weight on my chest. And I’m eating terribly, I suspect. No appetite, but I force myself to nibble because I know I should.
DOCTOR: Okay. That sounds very difficult, Nani. It's good you're reaching out. Loss of interest in things you usually enjoy, changes in sleep and appetite… those are all important things to discuss. You mentioned this has been going on for a while now?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. It didn’t start suddenly, you understand. It’s been… creeping up on me for months now, maybe six, seven months. At first, I thought it was just… getting older. A bit of tiredness. But it hasn't lifted. It’s actually gotten worse, if I’m honest. I tried to push through it, keep busy, but it’s exhausting pretending. And truthfully, my divorce… that didn’t help things. It was amicable, we’re both better off separately, but it still leaves a… hollowness.
DOCTOR: Six to seven months… and the divorce adding to that feeling. Thank you for sharing that, Nani. It takes courage to talk about these things. We'll definitely explore all of this. Just to get a clearer picture, have you experienced any physical symptoms along with these feelings?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Not really, not anything… significant. Perhaps a bit more tired than usual, but that could be the age, as I said. And a few headaches, mild ones, mostly in the evenings. Nothing that a little lie-down wouldn’t fix. Oh, and my stomach hasn’t been quite right lately, a bit… unsettled. But I put that down to the eating, or lack thereof. I haven’t been ill, haven’t caught a cold or anything like that. I just feel… blah. Is that a symptom? It’s a very imprecise word, I know.
DOCTOR: “Blah” is a perfectly valid symptom, Nani. It tells me something is definitely not right. Headaches and stomach upset are good to know as well. Now, regarding your past medical history – do you have any chronic health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, truthfully. Good genes, I suppose. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, but nothing serious. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s about it. I’ve had a few scrapes and bruises in my line of work, naturally, but nothing that required prolonged treatment. I’m quite resilient, you see. Or, was resilient. I have private insurance, if that’s relevant. I don’t want to waste your time with unnecessary tests if my coverage is limited.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Nani. And your insurance is definitely relevant – we’ll keep that in mind. What about any surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, yes. When I was quite young, perhaps twenty years old, I had my appendix removed. Routine procedure, nothing complicated. And… hmm. I think that’s it. A few wisdom teeth pulled, but I don’t really count those as surgeries. Nothing major, nothing that would affect anything now. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very straightforward case. Healthy, resilient, and now… feeling rather down. I just want to feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: That's definitely not too much to ask, Nani. And you don’t sound straightforward at all – everyone's experience is unique, and it's my job to understand yours. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Do you have any family history of depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she was always a worrier, quite anxious. Never diagnosed with anything, but she was always fretting about something or other. And my aunt… on my father’s side… she was admitted to hospital a few times when she was younger, for… “nervous exhaustion,” they called it. It was a long time ago, so I don’t know the specifics. But no one ever talked about it openly, you understand. It was considered… shameful. So I don’t have much information. It’s just what I vaguely remember hearing as a child. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Nani. Even vague recollections can give us clues. And you're right, those conversations weren't always open. Now, a few questions about your social habits. Are you currently working?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. As I mentioned, I work as a lifeguard, and I also do some ski patrol work in the winter. It keeps me active, or used to, anyway. I work part-time, three or four days a week. I used to enjoy it immensely, the fresh air, the responsibility… But lately, it’s just… draining. I live alone, you understand. My ex-husband moved to another state a few years ago. I have friends, but I haven’t seen them much lately. It’s easier to stay home, honestly. I know I should be more social, but I just don’t have the energy.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you've been experiencing a lot of changes, both internally and externally. Now, just to complete the picture, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never have. I've always been a very… sensible person, you see. I enjoy a cup of tea in the evenings, that’s about it. And perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but very rarely. I’m not one for… excesses. I’ve always believed in looking after my health. That’s why this is so… perplexing. To feel this way, despite everything… It’s quite unsettling. Are we getting anywhere, Doctor? I truly want to feel better. I'm not getting any younger, you understand.
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Nani. And you are doing a wonderful job of explaining everything. It’s very common to experience these feelings, even when you’ve lived a healthy life. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, just one final question: are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the multivitamin, as I said earlier. Occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take paracetamol, but that’s about it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in letting my body heal itself, naturally. Honestly, Doctor, I’m quite a simple case. Healthy, resilient, and now… feeling rather down. I just want to get to the bottom of this and feel like myself again. If you think a physical exam is necessary, then please proceed. I trust your judgment. I just want this over with, if I’m honest. It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nani. Thank you for being so open and honest with me. A quick exam won’t take long. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. First, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I hope it isn’t too high. I’ve been feeling a bit… agitated lately, which I suspect won’t help matters. Honestly, the thought of being poked and prodded isn’t terribly appealing, but I understand it’s necessary. Get it over with quickly, if you would be so kind. I have a luncheon appointment later this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. We’ll be as quick as possible. And don't worry, I'll explain everything as we go. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Not alarmingly so, but something we'll keep an eye on. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms?
PATIENT: Very well. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a medical examination, truthfully. I always prided myself on being healthy, independent… needing no assistance. This is rather… humbling. Are these reflexes normal, Doctor? I confess, I have no idea what to expect. And please, do be gentle. My joints aren’t as supple as they used to be.
DOCTOR: They seem normal, Nani. A little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age, but nothing concerning. Now, just one more quick test. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Everything seems to be tracking well. Overall, the physical exam doesn’t reveal anything obviously wrong. Which, honestly, is good news. It suggests this is likely not due to a physical cause. Now, based on everything you’ve told me – the low mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep and appetite, family history, and the lack of any significant findings on the physical exam – I'm leaning towards a diagnosis of mild depression. Would you be open to discussing treatment options?
PATIENT: Mild depression… It… makes sense, I suppose. As unpleasant as the thought is. I always considered myself a strong person, capable of handling anything life threw my way. To think I might be… depressed… It’s rather disheartening. Treatment options… Yes, I suppose I am open to discussing them. Though I confess, I’m not keen on the idea of taking medication. I’ve always been wary of pharmaceuticals. Perhaps… therapy? Talking it through? Is that an option? I’m not sure I have the energy for a long and drawn-out process, but I’m willing to consider it. What do you recommend, Doctor? And how long would this treatment likely take? I truly want to feel like myself again, but I have commitments, you understand. Luncheons, grandchildren… a life to live.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nani. Therapy is an excellent first step, and often very effective. It's a great way to explore these feelings and develop coping strategies. Medication is always an option, but we can certainly hold off on that for now and see how you respond to therapy. I recommend cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. It focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns. It typically involves weekly sessions for several weeks, maybe 12-16 sessions initially, with the possibility of continuing if you find it helpful. I can refer you to a qualified therapist in the area. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Cognitive behavioral therapy… That sounds… sensible. Identifying negative thought patterns… Yes, I suspect I have a few of those. Twelve to sixteen sessions… That seems… manageable. Not terribly disruptive to my schedule. Yes, Doctor, please. Please refer me to a qualified therapist in the area. Someone… experienced. And preferably someone who understands… a woman of my age, with a full life. I don’t want someone who will dismiss my concerns as simply “getting old.” Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I truly appreciate your patience and understanding. Perhaps… perhaps there is hope yet. What is the next step? Do I need to fill out any forms? Or schedule an appointment directly with the therapist? I confess, I’m not terribly good with these… administrative matters.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nani. I'm glad I could help. I'll have my assistant, Maria, prepare a referral package for you with a list of therapists who specialize in CBT and have experience working with patients your age. She'll also provide you with their contact information and a brief profile. You can then contact them directly to schedule an appointment. She will also provide you with the necessary forms. I will also send a summary of our visit to the therapist to help with continuity of care. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfect, Doctor. Absolutely perfect. Maria… Yes, that’s very kind of you to arrange everything. A summary of our visit… Yes, that’s an excellent idea. It will save me having to repeat myself, which, frankly, is exhausting. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been most helpful. I feel… cautiously optimistic. Perhaps I can finally get my life back on track. I suppose… that concludes our visit? Is there anything else I need to do? Any further forms to fill out? Any payment required? I confess, I’m a bit flustered. It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nani. I’m glad we were able to come up with a plan. Maria will handle the billing, so you don't need to worry about that right now. She’ll also provide you with a receipt for your insurance. And no, there are no further forms to fill out at this time. Just take things one step at a time, and remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s a business card with my contact information. Have a lovely afternoon, Nani. And I wish you all the best with your therapy. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month or two to see how you're progressing, if you'd like.
PATIENT: .
