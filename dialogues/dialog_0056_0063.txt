DOCTOR: Hi Larin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. My back... it hurts really bad. It's been hurting for a while, but now... now I can't do much. It's hard to even stand up straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Back pain that’s interfering with your daily life – that’s definitely something we need to look into. When you say “a while,” roughly how long have you been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I think, maybe… six months ago? It was just a little ache then, after I would work. But the last month… it’s gotten much worse. Every day it’s worse. It doesn't go away now, even when I rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago starting as an ache after work, and progressively worsening over the last month to the point it’s constant, even with rest. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to say. It’s not like a sharp pain, more like a heavy… ache. Deep down. And it goes down my leg sometimes, on both sides, but mostly the right. It feels like… like someone is squeezing. And when I try to move certain ways, it gets really bad. Like if I bend over. Or twist.
DOCTOR: Okay, a deep, heavy ache that radiates down both legs, more prominent on the right, with a squeezing sensation. And it's worsened by bending and twisting. That gives me a better picture. Does anything relieve the pain at all?
PATIENT: Not really, not much. Laying flat sometimes helps a little, but it doesn’t take it away. And warm water feels okay when I shower, but then it comes back as soon as I move. I tried some of those pain creams, the ones you rub on, but they didn't do anything. Nothing seems to really help for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying flat provides some temporary relief, and warm water feels okay briefly. The pain creams didn't help. And it’s been consistent, not improving with any home remedies. Have you had any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. Mostly my feet. Not all the time, but it happens. It feels… like pins and needles. Mostly at night. And my toes feel cold sometimes, even when the room isn't cold. It's not always there, but it's been happening more lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent numbness and tingling in your feet, with a pins and needles sensation, and some coldness, especially at night. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Um… I had cancer a few years ago. Breast cancer. I finished treatment, maybe five years ago? And they said it was gone, but I still go for check-ups. That’s why I came here, because this back pain… I was worried if it had something to do with the cancer.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important information, thank you for telling me. A history of breast cancer is definitely something we need to consider, especially with new pain. And you’re still attending follow-up appointments – that’s good. Do you recall what type of treatment you received for the cancer?
PATIENT: Yes. I had surgery first, to take it out. Then… chemotherapy. And radiation. It was a long time ago, so I forget some of the details. They said it was stage two when they found it. I went to a different doctor then, in the city. They did a lot of tests, scans and everything. But I haven’t had any problems since… until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, stage two breast cancer treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation five years ago, with regular follow-ups. And this back pain is a new development. Do you have any other medical problems, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, not really. My blood pressure is okay, I check it at home sometimes. And no diabetes. Just… the cancer, before. And now this back. I work at the factory, you know? Lifting boxes and things. Maybe it's just from that? But it feels… different than just a pulled muscle.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other significant medical history besides the cancer. And you work at a factory with lifting. We'll definitely consider that as a possibility, but as you said, it sounds like more than just a simple muscle strain. Before we move on to a physical exam, let's quickly cover some other things. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can take most things. The doctors gave me a lot of different medicines when I had the cancer, and I never had a reaction. I remember being very sick from the chemo, but not from the medicines themselves. I think I'm okay with pretty much everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know - no known medication allergies. And you tolerated your cancer treatments well in that regard. Just one last quick question before the exam: are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… vitamins. A multi-vitamin, every day. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take ibuprofen. But I haven’t taken any in a couple of weeks. I try not to, because it makes my stomach hurt. That’s it, really. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin daily and ibuprofen occasionally for arthritis. Thank you for that information. Alright, Larin, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to have you lie down on your back, and I'll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs. I'll also palpate your spine to see if I can identify any areas of tenderness or muscle spasm. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Okay, I can do that. Lie down, you said? Just tell me what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Perfect. If you could just lie flat on your back, that’s great. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Then we’ll move to your back. I’ll ask you to move your legs and feet in different directions, and I'll be checking your strength. Don’t worry if it feels a little uncomfortable. Just let me know if anything causes sharp pain. First, can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It's okay, I’m not nervous. Just… worried about my back. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to feel along your spine. Can you tell me if you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, there. That hurts. Right… there. It’s a deep ache, not a sharp pain, but… it definitely hurts. And a little bit here too… It feels… tight. Like a knot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Tenderness in the lumbar region, specifically around L4-L5, and some muscle spasm. I’m going to gently feel around the muscles on either side of your spine now. Can you tell me if that’s painful?
PATIENT: Yes… on both sides it hurts a little. But… the right side is worse. It feels… like the muscle is really tight. And when you press there… it makes the pain shoot down my leg a little. Like that pins and needles feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now I’m going to check your reflexes. Can you just relax your legs?
PATIENT: Okay, relaxing. Like this? Is there something you want me to do?
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes are a little diminished on the right side, but not dramatically so. Now, can you lift your right leg straight up, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Um… it’s hard. I can’t lift it very high. It hurts when I try to lift it straight up. It’s not like it used to be. I used to be able to lift it much higher.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion and pain with straight leg raise on the right side. Now, can you try to stand up, slowly?
PATIENT: Ouch! That’s… hard. It hurts when I stand up. And it feels wobbly. It’s much harder than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That was helpful. Alright, Larin, based on the physical exam, it appears you have some lower back pain with radiculopathy – meaning the pain is radiating down your leg – likely due to some compression of a nerve root. The diminished reflexes and weakness in your right leg are consistent with that. Given your history of breast cancer, it’s important to rule out any potential for metastatic disease, although your symptoms are more consistent with a mechanical cause. I want to order an MRI of your lumbar spine to get a better look at the nerve roots and rule out any other problems. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, that sounds okay. If it can find out what’s wrong, then yes. Metastatic… what does that mean? Is it bad? And… will the MRI show if it’s the cancer coming back? I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a very reasonable concern. “Metastatic” means the cancer has spread from where it originally started – in your case, the breast – to other parts of the body. We aren't saying that is happening, but because of your history, we need to rule it out. The MRI will give us a very detailed picture of your spine and help us determine the cause of your pain. It will show us if there's any pressure on the nerves, any inflammation, or any signs of a tumor. If the MRI is clear, we’ll then focus on other potential causes, such as a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. I'll also order some bloodwork to check for inflammation and rule out other conditions. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… okay. So the MRI will look for the cancer. And the bloodwork will look for other things. Herniated… what is that? Is that… serious? And if it is serious, can they fix it? I just want to know what to expect. I'm worried about being in pain all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s completely understandable. A herniated disc is when the soft cushion between the vertebrae in your spine bulges out and presses on a nerve. It’s a common cause of back pain, and it’s often treatable. Many people recover with conservative treatment, like physical therapy and pain medication. In some cases, surgery may be necessary, but that’s usually a last resort. We'll start with the MRI and bloodwork, and then we can discuss the results and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. I'll also give you a prescription for a muscle relaxant and some pain medication to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds okay. Muscle relaxant and pain medicine… that will help, I hope. So… how long will it take to get the results of the tests? And where do I go to get the MRI? I need to arrange somebody to drive me, I think. It’s a long drive to the city.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. The muscle relaxant and pain medication should help with some of the discomfort. The MRI facility is at City Hospital – I'll give you a referral order and the address. It usually takes about 3-5 business days to get the results back. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you as soon as the results are available. We’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. You are right to arrange for someone to drive you, as the muscle relaxant can cause drowsiness. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. It still makes me nervous, but… I feel better knowing what’s going on. I'll schedule the MRI as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm glad I could help ease some of your worries. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I'll have my nurse send you the referral order and instructions for the MRI. Take care, Larin. .
