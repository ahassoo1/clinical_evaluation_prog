DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, this is a little embarrassing, but I’ve noticed a change in my body odor recently. It’s…different than usual. I can’t really explain it, just not how I normally smell, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. It's good you brought it to my attention. Changes like that can be a sign of something else going on, so it’s worth investigating. Could you tell me a little more about this change?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, it started maybe a month or so ago? It’s not necessarily bad, just…off. It’s hard to describe. It’s not sweatier, and I haven’t changed what I use – the same deodorant, the same soap. It's just…a different scent. Almost…a little bit musky? Does that make any sense? I really haven’t changed anything else in my routine, so it's a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A musky scent is a good detail. And it’s good you haven't changed any products. A month ago… okay. Now, has this change been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's been pretty constant, actually. I thought maybe it was just a fluke at first, like maybe I didn't wash well enough one day, but it hasn't gone away. It's there every day, all day. I even asked my daughter if she noticed anything different, and she said she did, too. She didn’t say it smelled bad, just…different. It's just a little unsettling, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you mentioned your daughter noticed it too – that's helpful. Constant is important to know. Now, let's talk a little more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes in your body lately?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No major weight loss or gain. I’ve been sleeping okay, maybe a little less than usual, but nothing drastic. No new rashes or anything like that. My appetite is normal. Oh! Actually, I have been feeling a little more tired than usual, now that I think about it. Just a general feeling of being worn down. But I thought that was just from work, you know? Laying floors is hard on the body.
DOCTOR: Laying floors is hard on the body, absolutely. But fatigue is good to note. Okay, so fatigue, and a change in body odor… Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: I have high blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. I take Lisinopril, I think that’s the name of it. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but haven't had any trouble with that since. Otherwise, nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains from getting older! Oh, and I'm covered by Medicare, if that's relevant.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is relevant, thank you. Lisinopril and a history of gallbladder removal…okay. And just aches and pains. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I've taken a lot of different medications over the years for various things, but never had a problem. No food allergies, no environmental allergies...nothing. I’m pretty lucky that way, actually.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies. Alright, Kerriann. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just take a general look. It’s just to get a better overall picture. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I appreciate you taking a look. I’m just hoping it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or anything concerning. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so, considering your history. Lymph nodes feel normal, no swelling or tenderness. Skin looks good, no rashes or unusual markings. I'm not noticing anything immediately obvious that would explain the change in body odor. Now, just to be thorough, I would like to order some blood work. We’ll check your thyroid levels, kidney function, and a complete metabolic panel. It's just to rule out anything that could be contributing to this. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to get the blood work done. It's good to be thorough, like you said. I'm just glad we're looking into it. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood work? Fasting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, for this particular panel, I would like you to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. I'm going to print out a lab order for you now. It will have all the instructions. The lab is just down the hall, and you can go whenever it’s convenient for you. While we're waiting for those results, I'd like to ask about your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Okay, fasting for 8-12 hours, got it. Water is okay. Let me think about my family history… My mother had diabetes, type 2, and she had high blood pressure too. Her mother, my grandmother, also had diabetes. And my uncle, on my father’s side, had heart disease. I think that’s about it, really. Nothing major that I’m aware of. We weren’t a big family for talking about health problems, if I’m being honest. Does that information help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Diabetes and heart disease in the family… okay. It’s good to know. Now, one last thing for now. Are you currently taking any other medications, over-the-counter supplements, or herbal remedies, besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Just the Lisinopril. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. And sometimes I’ll take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but nothing regularly. I really try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I’m not a big believer in self-treating, unless it’s something really minor.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the Lisinopril, occasional multivitamin and ibuprofen. That's good to know. Alright, Kerriann. We’ve covered a lot. To summarize, you’ve noticed a change in your body odor, which has been constant for about a month. You have a history of high blood pressure managed with Lisinopril, a previous gallbladder removal, and a family history of diabetes and heart disease. We’ll get these blood tests done to rule out any underlying causes. I’ll also document your concerns and we can discuss the results as soon as they come in, usually within a few days. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. You've covered everything really well. Thank you for listening to me and taking it seriously. I appreciate it. I’ll go get the blood work done now. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I’m glad I could help. No, I don’t think there’s anything else for now. Just go to the lab, and they’ll take care of everything. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
