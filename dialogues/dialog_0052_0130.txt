DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my family. Lots of… problems with hearts, you see. My mother, my brother… even a cousin. I just… want to make sure I’m okay. I don't want any surprises, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. Family history is very important, and it’s wise to be proactive about your health. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a little more about these heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Okay. My mother… she had trouble breathing, always tired. Doctor said something about… the heart getting big? She was maybe 70 when she passed. My brother… he had chest pain, real bad. Had a… a blockage, I think? He had a thing put in, a little tube… helped for a while, but… he didn’t live very long after that. And my cousin… he just… collapsed. Doctor said his heart was weak. It was quick. I don't know much about what happened, really. It was… sad.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information with me, Mr. Schwer. That sounds like a very difficult experience for you and your family. Knowing this history helps us to focus our attention. To clarify, do you recall approximately when your mother and brother passed away?
PATIENT: Let me think… My mother… maybe fifteen years ago? Around 2010, I think. And my brother… oh, goodness. Maybe eight years ago? 2017, maybe? It feels like a long time ago now… Hard to remember exactly. Sorry. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Mr. Schwer. Memory can be unreliable, and that’s perfectly understandable. Fifteen and eight years ago, respectively, are helpful approximations. Now, turning to your health, are you currently experiencing any symptoms yourself – things like chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but I’m 73! That’s just… getting old, right? No chest pain, no trouble breathing. Maybe my ankles swell a little if I stand for a long time, but nothing much. I walk every day, try to. Don't feel sick or anything. Just… worried. That’s all.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you aren’t experiencing any acute symptoms, Mr. Schwer. It’s certainly reasonable to be proactive about your health given your family history, even without current complaints. To get a more complete picture, could you please tell me about any other medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, the doctor put me on pills. I stopped taking them a few years ago, he said it was okay. And I had my gallbladder out maybe twenty years ago. Other than that… not much, I don't think. I see the doctor every year for a check-up, but he never says anything serious. I have Medicare, so they check everything, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, now managed without medication, and a gallbladder removal twenty years ago. That's helpful to know. And you mention you have annual check-ups with Medicare. Do you happen to recall the name of your primary care physician?
PATIENT: Uh… Doctor… Miller, I think. Yes, Doctor Miller. He’s… older, like me. Nice man. He’s at the… the clinic over on Elm Street, I think. I see him every year, like you said. He does the blood tests, checks my heart… everything seems okay, usually. I just wanted… another opinion, I guess. To be sure.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a second opinion, Mr. Schwer. That’s a very sensible approach to healthcare. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. Never had a problem with any pills, either. I’ve taken a few different things over the years, for colds and aches… never had a reaction. My wife… she was allergic to peanuts, but I’m fine. She passed away a few years ago now, so… it’s just me. Sorry, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Schwer. It’s perfectly natural to share those details. No known allergies, that’s good. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I take a little aspirin every day, just a baby aspirin. Doctor Miller told me to, for my heart. And sometimes I take Tylenol for aches, if I need it. That's about it. No fancy pills or anything. I don't really like taking a lot of medication if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, a daily baby aspirin as recommended by Dr. Miller, and Tylenol as needed. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. This will include listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and looking at your ankles to assess for any swelling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… let me know if you see anything wrong, okay? I’m a little nervous, but… I want to be sure. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schwer. I hear a normal S1 and S2 heart sound. I do detect a very faint systolic murmur at the aortic area. It’s grade 1/6, quite subtle. Everything else appears normal on initial examination. I’d like to order some blood work and an electrocardiogram to get a more detailed assessment of your heart function. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… a murmur? That doesn’t sound good, does it? And edema… what’s that again? Is that the swelling? I guess… if you think it’s necessary, do the tests. Blood work and… ECG, you said? Whatever you need to see what’s going on. I just… I want to know. Is it serious, Doctor? Is it like my brother? I’m getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you're concerned, Mr. Schwer. A murmur doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it warrants further investigation. It simply means there's an abnormal sound when your heart beats. It can be caused by a variety of things, some benign and some that require treatment. And yes, the edema is the swelling in your ankles. It can be related to heart function, but also to other factors like prolonged standing. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, cholesterol levels, kidney function and rule out any underlying inflammation. The ECG will measure the electrical activity of your heart and can detect any irregularities in your heart rhythm or signs of previous heart damage. I'm not going to speculate about whether it's like your brother’s condition at this point, as we don’t have enough information yet. The tests will help us determine the cause of the murmur and the edema, and then we can discuss appropriate treatment options if needed. We'll get a clearer picture once the results are back, typically within 24-48 hours. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results then?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A follow-up appointment would be good. I’d like to know what’s going on. 24-48 hours… okay. I can wait. I guess… just call me at the number you have on file? And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. I’m still worried, but… I feel a little better knowing you’re looking into it. Just… please call if you see anything really bad, okay? Before the appointment? Just… want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we will proceed cautiously and thoroughly. I will absolutely call you immediately if the test results show anything concerning that requires immediate attention before our scheduled follow-up appointment. For now, please try to rest and avoid strenuous activity. We'll discuss the results in detail once they are available. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
