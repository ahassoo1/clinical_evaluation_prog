DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. So, you’re here today… tell me what brings you in. Don’t bother with the details just yet, just the main reason for your visit. And try to be concise, if you would. I have other patients waiting, you understand.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am here for… the check-up. Before the insurance starts. Medicare sent me. Is that… enough information? I do not understand why you need me to explain it more.
DOCTOR: A “check-up” is… rather broad, Mr. Barban. Medicare sends a lot of people for a lot of different things. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. I feel… fine. Normal. I do not get sick easily. I eat good food, mostly. Why would I come here if something was wrong? It is a pre-insurance thing, you said. To make sure I can get insurance. Is this… necessary to list everything that is not wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Medicare requires a baseline assessment before coverage begins. It's… standard procedure. Even if you feel fine, we need to document your current health status. It helps them determine your risk factors, potential pre-existing conditions… things like that. So, let's just run through a few things, shall we?
PATIENT: Risk factors? I work in a factory. Is that a risk factor? It is honest work. I do not understand what this has to do with my insurance. Are you sure this is what Medicare wants? Perhaps I should call them and ask. It seems a waste of my time, honestly.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Barban, I assure you, this is what Medicare wants. Factory work can present certain risks – exposure to chemicals, repetitive strain injuries, potential for accidents… it’s all relevant. It’s my job to gather this information, and frankly, it’s your responsibility to provide it. Now, are you going to cooperate, or would you prefer I simply document “patient refuses assessment” and you sort it out with Medicare yourself?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. You are… insistent. But I do not see how lifting boxes is a “risk factor”. It builds strength. Fine. Ask your questions. But do not expect detailed answers. I am not a doctor, I just work with my hands. And please, speak slowly. I do not always understand everything you say.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? No. Never. I have had a cold, maybe, sometimes. A little bit of back pain from the work. But I take… pills. The over-the-counter kind. For the pain. Is that what you mean? Not a doctor's condition, just… aches.
DOCTOR: Right. And what over-the-counter medication do you take for the back pain?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen, I think. The white ones. From the… store. Big bottle. I do not remember the name exactly. My neighbor told me it was good for pain. Is that important? It is just a painkiller.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is important, Mr. Barban. We need to know everything you're taking, even if it's over-the-counter. How often do you take it, and what dosage?
PATIENT: Dosage…? I take… two, maybe three, when it hurts. Sometimes more if the boxes are very heavy. Once a week, perhaps? It depends on the work. I do not measure them. I just take enough until it stops hurting. Is this very complicated? It is just… pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital…? No. Never. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, climbing a tree. But we went to the… local healer. Not a hospital. It healed fine. Is this still important? It was a long time ago. And not a proper hospital, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? No. Never had one. I have not needed one. I am a strong man. I fix things with my hands, not with… cutting. Are you finished with the questions yet? This is taking a very long time. And I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. I suppose that's… sufficient for now. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It won't take long. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But I warn you, I have been working hard. I may be a little… heavy. But it is muscle. Not… anything else.
DOCTOR: 90 kilograms. And your height is… 1.88 meters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. I am a large man. As I said, it is muscle. From the factory. Not fat. I work very hard, you understand. Are we finished soon? I do not like being… measured. It feels strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt and breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Remove my… shirt? In here? Is that… necessary? I am a modest man. I do not understand why this is required for insurance. But… very well. But please be quick.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes…? What are reflexes? Is this… painful? I do not understand why you need to… test these things. I lift heavy boxes all day. My muscles are fine. But… very well. Do what you must. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, if you’ll just lie down on the examination table, I’d like to palpate your abdomen.
PATIENT: Palpate…? Is this… poking? I do not like being poked. This is becoming very unpleasant. I still do not understand why this is necessary for insurance. But… fine. But please be quick, and do not poke too hard. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No masses palpated. Alright. That’s all for the physical exam. We’ll run some standard blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel – just to get a comprehensive baseline. It’ll take a few days to get the results back.
PATIENT: Blood work…? More needles? This is… too much. I came for a simple check-up before the insurance, not for a full medical investigation. I do not understand why this is required. Are you sure this is what Medicare wants? Perhaps I should just cancel the insurance. This is too stressful. Is this absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Barban. I understand your frustration, but these blood tests are standard procedure for Medicare pre-insurance assessments. They’re required to determine your overall health status and identify any potential risks. It’s not a full medical investigation; it’s a baseline assessment. Cancelling your insurance isn't going to solve anything. It's better to just get this done and over with. I can write you a referral to the lab down the street. They're quite efficient. It'll take less than an hour.
PATIENT: Fine. But I expect a full explanation of everything they are testing for. And I expect the results to be sent to me and to you. I do not want any surprises. And I expect this to be the last thing I have to do for this insurance. Write the referral. And make sure it includes all the tests you mentioned. I do not want to have to come back here. This is… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Here. Complete Blood Count, Metabolic Panel, and Lipid Panel. The lab will send the results to both of us. And yes, I understand your frustration, Mr. Barban. Once you've had the blood work done, we can discuss the results and proceed from there. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. That is all. I hope I do not have to see you again. This has been… a very unpleasant experience.
