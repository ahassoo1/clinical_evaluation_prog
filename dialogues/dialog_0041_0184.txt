DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Polczynski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s get right to it. It’s…well, it’s this body. Always been thin, you see? Skin and bone. Wife used to say it. Now she’s gone, and I just…want to look a little more substantial. Not asking for miracles, just…less like a scarecrow.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. You'd like to discuss… improving your overall appearance, adding some weight?
PATIENT: “Improving”? That’s a fancy word for “not looking like I’m about to blow away in a breeze.” And yes, adding some weight. Not looking for a belly, mind you! Just…fillin’ out a bit. I used to be strong, you see? Pile drivin' takes muscle. Now…well, now I just look old. Is that somethin' you can do? You look awfully young for a doctor, if you don't mind my sayin'.
DOCTOR: No, no, I don't mind at all. It's true, I'm relatively new to practice, been about eleven years now. And yes, we can certainly explore options to help you feel better about your physical condition. It's important to figure out why you've lost weight, and then we can discuss strategies to address that. First, can you tell me a little about when you noticed this weight loss starting?
PATIENT: Eleven years? Bless your heart. Look, the weight loss… it wasn’t sudden. It was after my wife, Beatrice, passed. About five years ago, now. Just…lost my appetite, I suppose. Everything tasted like dust. And then I just…stopped botherin'. Cookin' for one is a sad business, you know? Used to make the best jerk chicken this side of the island, but what’s the point anymore? I eat when I have to, but it ain't the same.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Trendler. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult, and it’s very common for appetite and weight to be affected. Five years is a while, though. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the weight loss?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, I get tired easier, that’s for sure. Used to be able to swing a hammer all day, now I’m winded just climbin’ the stairs. And my bones ache somethin’ awful, especially when it rains. Beatrice used to rub ‘em with liniment, but…well, never mind that. Just feelin’ old, mostly. And weak. And…honestly? I just don’t like lookin’ in the mirror anymore. It ain't a pretty sight.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue and bone pain… that’s good information to have. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your joints. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Just don't go pokin' around too much. I ain't been sick a day in my life, 'til Beatrice… so I don’t rightly know what to expect from all this doctorin’. You got a nice clean office, though. Always liked things tidy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Just relax. I'll be gentle. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, nice and easy. Breathe deeply for me… Good. Heart sounds are regular, a little faint, but no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but a bit diminished breath sounds overall. Now, let's just feel your abdomen… any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No tenderness. Not unless you poke really hard. Feels normal enough to me. Though, like I said, I ain’t been poked and prodded much in my life. Used to fix things with my hands, not have ‘em fiddled with. Beatrice always said I had a strong constitution. That woman knew everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, your joints feel… a little creaky, as expected with age, but no significant swelling or redness. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s common as well. Your pulses are a little weak, but present. I'm going to check your weight and height now just to get a baseline. And then we can talk about some possible causes for your weight loss and fatigue and decide on a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Sounds…efficient. Get it done. I told you, I haven’t got all day. Used to be able to lift a whole load of steel, now look at me. Just want to feel…a little more like myself again. That’s all. Height alright, I haven't shrunk yet. At least something is still workin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, your weight is 122 pounds and your height is 178 centimeters. That puts your BMI at 19.2, which is considered underweight. Given your history, fatigue, bone pain, and low weight, there are a few things we need to consider. It could be related to decreased appetite after your wife's passing, but we should also rule out other possibilities like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or even some underlying medical conditions. I'd like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? More pokin' and proddin'? Look, I ain't scared of a little needle, but all this seems a bit…excessive, don't you think? I just want to put a little meat on my bones, not become a science experiment. But... if you think it’s necessary. Just get it over with quick, and tell me what it all means afterwards. No fancy doctor-talk, understand?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. And I'll definitely avoid the "fancy doctor-talk." It's just a routine blood test, and it will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It will take just a few minutes. We’ll check things like your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, vitamin D and B12 levels, and thyroid hormones. I'll write you a requisition form. You can take it to the lab downstairs. They're used to patients from our clinic. Once the results are back—usually within a few days—we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A requisition form, you say? Downstairs? Fine. Just…try not to keep me waitin' too long for these results. I’ve got things to do, you know? And tell that lab technician to be gentle. Honestly, I preferred fixin’ things with my own two hands.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Trendler. I’ll make a note to have the results expedited and I’ll personally call you as soon as they’re available. And I’ll make sure to mention to the lab technician to be as gentle as possible. In the meantime, try to eat as well as you can, even if you don't feel particularly hungry. Small, frequent meals might be easier. And if you're feeling particularly tired, don’t hesitate to rest. Here’s my card with the clinic number. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just…get me fixin’ again, that’s all I want. Get me feelin’ like myself again. And thank you…for not talkin' down to me. Some doctors…well, let’s just say they make a man feel older than he already is. I'll see you when you have those results. Don’t keep me waitin’.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. And I won’t. We'll do our best to get you feeling better as quickly as possible. I'll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
