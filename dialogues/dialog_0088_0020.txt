DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Thank you for having me. I am here for… the appointment I made on the telephone. A check-up, yes? It is for… Medicare, I think. My husband… he always took care of these things. I just want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see your appointment here, a general check-up covered by Medicare. And I understand your husband usually handles these things – that’s perfectly alright. We’ll get everything sorted out. Just to start, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to come in for a check-up now?
PATIENT: Well… to be honest, I have been… a little tired lately. More tired than usual, you understand? And sometimes… my hands feel a bit shaky. Not all the time, but enough to notice. I do a lot of work with the cars, you see. It’s good work, but… maybe it is too much now? I don’t know. It just feels different than before.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and shakiness in your hands. And you mentioned doing work on cars – is that a recent activity, or have you been doing that for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Since I was a girl, almost! My husband and I… we had a small garage. He was the brains, I was the… the muscle, sometimes. Even after… even after he passed, I kept doing it. It keeps me busy, you understand? But like I said, maybe it is too much now. I don’t want to stop completely, but… perhaps less would be good.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to stay active, and it sounds like you’ve been doing this for a long time. So, this tiredness and shakiness – when did you first start noticing it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. It was… maybe six months ago? No, perhaps eight? It came on slowly, you see. Not suddenly. At first, I just thought I was getting old! But it has not gone away. And sometimes… it is worse after I work on the cars for a long time. It is difficult to hold the tools steady, you understand? It makes me worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, about eight months of gradual onset tiredness and shakiness, worse with activity, specifically working on cars. And you mentioned it makes you worry. Is the worry impacting your daily life at all?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. I… I used to enjoy fixing things for people in the neighborhood. Little jobs, you understand? Now… I am afraid to take on too much. I don't want to do a bad job, or… or hurt myself. I have cancelled a few jobs because of it. And my friend, she keeps asking if I am okay, and… it makes me sad. I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is definitely affecting your quality of life, and it's good you're addressing it. To get a better picture of what might be going on, could you tell me a little bit about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think. I… I have been a little more forgetful, perhaps. Not big things, you understand? Just… where I put my glasses, or what I was going to buy at the store. Nothing serious. And… my stomach has been upset sometimes. Not always, but… a little bit of nausea. Mostly in the mornings. Is that important? It could just be the coffee. I drink a lot of coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, some forgetfulness and occasional nausea, especially in the mornings. And you suspect the coffee might be a factor. Thank you for sharing that. Now, thinking about your past medical history – have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had a problem with my… my blood pressure, many years ago. The doctor gave me pills, and I took them for a long time. But he said it was okay to stop, after a while. I think it was maybe ten years ago? And… I broke my arm when I was a child, but that is not important, is it? Nothing else, really. I have been… lucky, I think. I do not go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure in the past, managed with medication and subsequently discontinued. And a childhood broken arm. Good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. Just the arm, when I was a little girl. They… they put it in a cast. It healed very well. I have been very careful since then, you see. I don't like hospitals. They make me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That's good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My mother… she had problems with her heart, I think. She was very old when she passed. And my father… he had diabetes. But I don’t know much about it. He didn’t talk about his health much. It was… different times, you understand? We didn’t ask those questions. I have a sister, but she lives far away and I haven’t seen her in many years. I don’t know about her health either.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your father. And limited information about your sister's health. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. And I… I used to drink a little wine with dinner, but not anymore. It didn’t agree with my stomach. And… no, no other things. Just coffee. A lot of coffee. I need it to work on the cars, you understand? It keeps me awake.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs, just coffee. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take a pain reliever for my back, if it hurts after working on the cars. Just… ibuprofen, I think. The regular kind you buy at the store. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, you understand? My husband always said… too many pills are not good for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Benites, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what is going on, you understand? And… I hope it is nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll take things one step at a time. If you could please have a seat on the table, we’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 145 over 88. Your pulse is 72 and regular. I'm also going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay. It feels… strange to be here, you know? I haven’t been to the doctor in a long time. My husband… he always took care of these things. Is everything alright? I feel a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds normal, and your lungs are clear. I’m just going to feel your abdomen now. Does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort. It feels… a little tender, maybe? But I often feel that after working on the cars. All the bending and lifting, you understand? It's probably just my muscles.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is some tenderness in your upper abdomen, particularly on the right side. It’s not sharp, but noticeable. I’m also going to check your reflexes and your strength in your arms and legs. Could you please extend your arms?
PATIENT: Okay. They feel… a little shaky today, you see? I told you about that. Maybe it’s just the nerves. I don’t like being examined, you understand? Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed the tremor. It’s mild, but present. We'll need to investigate what's causing that. I'm also going to check your gait and balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Okay. It feels… strange to walk like this, you know? I usually walk much faster. Am I doing it wrong? I feel… silly.
DOCTOR: No, you're not doing anything wrong. It's just a little unsteady, which is helpful information. Okay, Ms. Benites, that concludes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam – the tiredness, shakiness, some forgetfulness, nausea, elevated blood pressure, tenderness in your abdomen, and the tremor in your hands – there are a few possibilities we need to explore. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but I’d like to order some blood work to check your thyroid levels, liver function, and vitamin levels. I also recommend a complete metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte balance. We may also need to consider imaging of your abdomen, like an ultrasound, to get a better look at your liver and gallbladder.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it something bad? Is it my liver? My husband… he had problems with his stomach, you know. What do you think it could be? I just want to know… what’s going on with me.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Ms. Benites. I want to assure you that we are being thorough to get to the bottom of this. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s something serious. Many things can cause these symptoms, and we need to rule out the possibilities. Given your husband's history, it's good we’re considering potential stomach issues, but it’s also important not to jump to conclusions. We need to wait for the blood work results to get a clearer picture. For now, let's focus on what we can do. We’ll start with the blood work, which we can do right here in the clinic. I'll also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive health – just in case we need further evaluation. I want to emphasize that this is a precautionary measure. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to rest and avoid any strenuous activity, especially lifting heavy objects. Also, let’s try to reduce your coffee intake. I understand it helps you stay awake, but it could be contributing to some of your symptoms. Are you able to gradually cut back?
PATIENT: Okay. Gradual… yes, I can try that. It will be difficult, but I can try. My husband… he always said I drink too much coffee. The blood work… and the specialist… yes, whatever you think is best, Doctor. How long will it take to get the results? And… will you explain them to me when I come back? I just… I don’t want to be alone with all this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Benites. The blood work results should be back in about 3-5 business days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they’re available. And I absolutely will explain everything to you in detail when you come back. You won’t be alone with this. I'll also provide you with a written summary of the results and the plan. For now, let me write up the orders for the blood work and the referral to the gastroenterologist. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind and patient with me. I appreciate it very much. Just… please, let’s hope it’s nothing too serious, okay? I just want to feel like myself again. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I understand your concerns, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. I'll keep you informed every step of the way. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. The nurses are always available to assist you. Here are the lab orders and the referral information. Take care, and we’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: .
