DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it is a bit embarrassing to say, but I been feelin'… very thirsty lately. And hungry all the time, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just don’t seem right.
DOCTOR: Okay, very thirsty and hungry even after eating. That's good information to start with. How long has this been going on, Bianca?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe about a month ago? At first, I thought it was just the heat, you know? But it ain’t gettin’ better, and now I worry a little. I drink plenty water, more than usual, but my mouth still feel dry.
DOCTOR: A month ago… alright. And is this thirst constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant, Doctor. Like, I have to have water close by all the time. And I wake up in the night sometimes, feelin’ like I need a drink. It’s not just after meals, it's all day and all night, really. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. And you mentioned being hungry all the time. Can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like a craving for anything special, you know? Just… an empty feeling. I eat a good lunch, a nice plate of rice and beans and chicken, but an hour later, I feel like I could eat another whole meal. My husband, he even say I been lookin’ a little thin, but I still feel hungry all the time. It’s just… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant thirst, increased hunger even after eating, and your husband has noticed some weight loss. Have you noticed any changes in your urination, Bianca?
PATIENT: Urination? Let me see… I think I been goin’ to the bathroom more often, yes. Especially at night. I always had to get up once, maybe twice, but now it’s… more. I just thought it was the water I been drinkin’, to be honest. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me all of this. Increased urination, especially at night, along with the thirst and hunger… those things can sometimes go together. Have you experienced any blurry vision, or any fatigue – feeling unusually tired?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, not really. My eyesight always been a little weak, so I wear my glasses, but it ain't gotten worse, I don't think. And fatigue… well, I am gettin' older, Doctor! I get tired easier than I used to, but I thought that was just… age, you know? Maybe I just need to rest more.
DOCTOR: That’s fair. Age can certainly play a role. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothin’ like that. I had a little trouble with my back a few years ago, but that’s all. The doctor gave me some cream, and it helped. Otherwise, I been pretty healthy, knock on wood. My husband, he always say I strong like a horse!
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries, Doctor. I always try to stay out of the hospital if I can. I don't like the smell of those places! Just a few stitches here and there when I was a little girl, but nothin’ major.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take nothin’. I try to avoid pills if I can. My mother always say, "Too much medicine is worse than the sickness!" I believe in home remedies mostly. A little ginger for my tummy, a little lime for a cold. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any allergies. I eat everything, and I never had a problem with any pills or nothin’ like that. My husband, he's the one with allergies, always sniffin’ and sneezin’ when the flowers bloom. But me, I strong like a horse, remember?
DOCTOR: Yes, you mentioned that. Alright, let's move on to your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, children – have diabetes, kidney problems, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother, she had a little trouble with her sugar when she got older. The doctor said it was diabetes, yes. She had to take pills for it, and she wasn't happy about it. My father, he was strong as an ox all his life, never sick a day. And my brother, he's okay, workin’ hard every day. I think… that’s all I can remember, really. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had diabetes. That’s helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What you mean, exactly, Doctor? I stay home mostly, helpin’ my husband with the garden. We grow a lot of our own food, you know? Rice, beans, tomatoes… good, healthy food. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. Not much excitement in my life, but it’s a good life.
DOCTOR: That sounds very healthy. Now, I'm going to ask you some questions about how you've been feeling overall. Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently, besides what your husband noticed?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it, my clothes do feel a little looser. I haven't weighed myself, but yes, I think I might have lost a little weight. I just thought it was from workin' in the garden. It's hot work, you know? But maybe it's more than that. It is worryin’ now that you ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unexplained weight loss. And have you noticed any changes in your skin, like increased dryness, itching, or any sores that are slow to heal?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, my skin is okay. A little dry sometimes, but I use lotion. No itching or sores, nothin' like that. I take care of myself, you know? I don't let myself get too run down. I believe in good hygiene.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms – the increased thirst, frequent urination, hunger, unexplained weight loss, and your mother’s history of diabetes – I think it’s important to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be willing to do a blood test?
PATIENT: A blood test? Oh dear. I don’t like needles, Doctor. But… if you think it’s important, I suppose I can do it. I just… I get nervous. What is it for, exactly? What you lookin’ for?
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Bianca. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about needles. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. The blood test will help us check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and a few other things. It will help us determine if your symptoms are related to diabetes or something else. It's a routine test, and it will give us the information we need to make the best decision about your health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you say it’s important… I will do it. But please, be quick! And gentle, like you say. I don’t want to faint or anything. Where do we go? And how long will it take?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll go right down the hall to the lab. It will only take a few minutes to draw the blood, and then the results should be available within a few hours. I will review them as soon as they come in and discuss them with you. We also need to check your blood pressure and do a quick physical exam. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s okay. Blood pressure, exam… whatever you need. Just… let's get this over with quickly, please. I’m ready when you are. Which way do we go?
DOCTOR: Right this way. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. We'll get your blood pressure checked first, then we can head back here for a quick exam. Do you have any trouble with balance or dizziness when you stand up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any trouble standin’ up. I’m steady as a rock! My husband always say I strong like a horse, remember? Let’s go then, before I change my mind!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. We're almost there. Here we are. The technician will take good care of you. I'll be right here when you're finished.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I hope this doesn't take too long. I will be right back.
DOCTOR: .
