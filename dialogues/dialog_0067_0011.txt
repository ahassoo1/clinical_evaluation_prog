DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honcoop is fine. Look, I ain’t got all day. Just need somethin’ signed so I can… get this done. A procedure. A cosmetic one. Don’t rightly remember all the details, to be honest. The young man at the place said I needed a doctor to say it’s alright. Is that somethin’ you do?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. I understand you need a form signed for a cosmetic procedure. I’m happy to review the details and see if I can assist. To do that, though, I’ll need a little more information. Even if you don’t remember everything, anything you can tell me about the procedure itself would be helpful. Do you know what type of procedure it is?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Young man didn’t say much ‘bout what it was, just that it’d fix things. Somethin’ with… well, lookin’ better. I work with towers, you see. Radio towers, cellular towers. Climbin’ ‘em and such. It’s… hard work. Makes a man look old. That’s all I know. I’m a tower man, not a… a beauty expert. Is this gonna take long? I got a schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tower man. I understand. And you’re looking for something to help with your appearance. That’s perfectly alright. Just trying to get a clear picture here. So, you said “fix things.” Can you tell me where on your body this procedure is intended to be done?
PATIENT: Well, now... let me think. It's… on my face. Yes, definitely my face. Around here… points vaguely at cheeks and jawline… and maybe a little bit on the neck. It's saggin', you see. Climbin' those towers, gravity ain't your friend. This young fella said it'd tighten things up. He had… lasers and such. Don’t rightly know what that means, but it sounded fancy. Are you gonna ask me a whole bunch of questions? I told you, I got a schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, face and neck, to address some sagging. Lasers involved. I do apologize for the questions, Mr. Honcoop, but it’s important I understand exactly what’s being proposed to make sure it’s safe for you. It’s not about delaying you, but about ensuring the best possible care. To start, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Humph. Never had much trouble with allergies. Maybe a little sniffles in the spring, but that's it. No, I don’t think so. Look, I ain't one for sittin' around talkin' 'bout my sniffles. I fix towers, I don’t spend time worryin' 'bout pollen. Is this procedure… risky? The young man didn’t mention nothin’ ‘bout risks. I'm a practical man, Doctor. I need to know if this is gonna cause problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to hear. And you’re right to ask about risks, Mr. Honcoop. Every procedure carries some level of risk, even cosmetic ones. Risks can include things like infection, scarring, changes in skin pigmentation, or nerve damage, though those are less common. It depends a lot on the specific procedure and who is performing it. Do you happen to know the name of the facility where you’re scheduled to have this done, or the name of the person who will be performing the procedure?
PATIENT: Facility? Now you’re askin’ a lot. Let me see… It was… “New Image Aesthetics.” That’s it. New Image. Young man named… Kevin, I think. Kevin something-or-other. He was very… enthusiastic. Kept talkin’ ‘bout “transformations” and whatnot. Seemed like a nice enough fella. Look, I just wanna look a little less tired, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? I’m payin’ good money for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, New Image Aesthetics, and Kevin… I’m looking that up now. While I’m doing that, have you had any medical conditions diagnosed in the past, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not that I know of. Doctor, I climb radio towers for a livin’. You gotta be in pretty good shape to do that. I ain’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Maybe a check-up when I was younger, but nothin’ serious. I eat okay, mostly. And I sleep when I can. Look, I’m a healthy man. I just wanna get this signed and get back to work. This tower ain't gonna fix itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I’ve found some information online regarding New Image Aesthetics. There have been several reports of complications and concerns about the qualifications of the personnel there. And honestly, based on what you’ve told me about your medical history—or lack thereof—and the nature of this procedure, I’m very hesitant to sign this form. I’m concerned that proceeding with this procedure could be harmful to your health. I strongly recommend that you consult with a board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon before considering this any further. Would you be open to me providing you with a referral to a qualified specialist?
PATIENT: A specialist? Look, I ain’t got time for all these fancy doctors! I just wanna get this done. You mean to tell me this young man Kevin is… bad? He seemed alright. Said he was certified. Humph. This is a waste of my time. I came here for a signature, not a lecture. You’re tellin’ me I can’t even get a little somethin’ done to fix my face? I'm a grown man, Doctor. I can make my own decisions. Just sign the form. I'll take responsibility. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I cannot in good conscience sign this form. As a physician, my primary responsibility is to ensure your well-being, and I believe proceeding with this procedure at this facility poses an unacceptable risk to your health. I understand you feel you can make your own decisions, but I have a professional obligation to advise you against anything I believe could be harmful. I'm not trying to lecture you, but to protect you. I will not sign the form. However, I am willing to provide you with a list of board-certified dermatologists and plastic surgeons in the area who can properly assess your situation and advise you on safe and effective options. Would you like me to do that?
