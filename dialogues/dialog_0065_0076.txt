DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's these bumps on my legs. They’re really bothering me, you see. On my shins, mostly. They’re red and… painful, a little. Not all the time, but when I walk, especially.
DOCTOR: Bumps on your shins, you say. And they’re painful with walking. Okay. How long have you noticed these bumps?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… maybe a couple of months now? It started with just one, I think, and then more kept popping up. I didn’t really pay much attention at first, you know? Old man things. But now, walking feels… not so good.
DOCTOR: A couple of months, starting with one and gradually increasing. I see. And have you noticed anything that makes them better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think anything makes them better, honestly. But… they do seem worse when I’ve been on my feet all day. I do a little work, moving things around for a neighbor sometimes, you know? Just to keep busy. And after that, they really ache. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense. So, activity seems to exacerbate them. Have you had any injuries to your legs recently?
PATIENT: Injuries? Not that I recall. I might have bumped them a couple of times, working, but nothing major. Just little knocks, you know? Nothing that would cause… this. I don't think so. My wife, Elena, she sometimes notices things I don’t. I’ll ask her when we get home, just in case. But I’m pretty sure I haven't really hurt my legs.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are these bumps accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like… what do you mean? They’re just red and sore. No itching, no… fever or anything. Just pain. Sometimes a little warm to the touch, maybe, but not always. I haven't really felt sick with it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: No itching, no fever, just redness, soreness, and occasional warmth. Okay. Let’s do a quick examination of your legs, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. Here, let me just pull up my pants a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see several raised, erythematous nodules on your anterior shins. They are tender to palpation, and I don’t note any signs of active infection – no pus, no significant warmth beyond the tenderness itself. They range in size from approximately 0.5 to 2 centimeters. No edema present. Based on this initial examination, it's possible you have stasis dermatitis, or possibly some form of vasculitis. We’ll need to do some further investigation to determine the exact cause. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. We should also check your ankle-brachial index to assess blood flow in your legs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Wow, that’s… a lot of big words, Doctor. Stasis… something? Vasculitis? I’m not sure I follow. Blood flow? Look, I’m an old man, you know? Just tell me if it’s serious. And what do these tests do? I just want to be able to walk comfortably again. My wife and I, we like to take little strolls in the park. I’d hate to have to stop that.
DOCTOR: Of course. I apologize for the medical jargon. Let me explain it simply. "Stasis dermatitis" happens when blood doesn’t flow as well in your legs, often due to vein problems. This can cause inflammation and skin changes. "Vasculitis" means inflammation of the blood vessels themselves. Both can cause pain and discomfort, like what you're experiencing. The blood tests will give us information about your overall health and help rule out other potential causes. The ankle-brachial index is a simple, non-invasive test that compares the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms. This will tell us how well blood is flowing in your legs. It’s unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, but we need to determine the cause so we can treat it effectively and, as you said, get you back to enjoying your walks with your wife. Does that make more sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes a lot more sense, Doctor. Thank you. So, blood flow is the problem, maybe? And the tests will tell you for sure? Okay. Yes, let's do the tests. I want to keep walking, you know? My wife would be very sad if I couldn't. Where do I go for these tests? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the lab order. You can go to Clarke Memorial Hospital, just down the street. They have a convenient lab on the ground floor. It should take approximately 24 to 48 hours to get the results back to me. Once I have them, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, try to elevate your legs whenever possible, and avoid prolonged standing or sitting. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage the discomfort, if you aren't allergic or have any contraindications to their use. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Thank you. Elevate my legs… yes, I can do that. And I do have some ibuprofen at home. Good. Okay, Clarke Memorial Hospital, that’s easy enough. And they’ll call me when the results are in. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I appreciate it. I think that’s everything, isn’t it? If you don't hear from me, I suppose that means everything is okay? Just kidding! I’ll be sure to schedule an appointment when they call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. And no, please don't assume everything is okay if you don't hear from us. It’s very important to follow up, regardless. My nurse will be proactive in contacting you. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you again for your time. I hope you have a good day. And… I’ll see you soon, hopefully with some good news. .
DOCTOR: You as well, Mr. Aluia. I hope you find some relief soon. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
