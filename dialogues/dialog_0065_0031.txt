DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen. It’s been bothering me for a few days now. And, um, I have a bit of a heart problem, the doctors told me it's called… atrial… fibrillation? Something like that. They said it might be connected.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, yes, I see that noted in your limited record. A few days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a few days. Maybe four or five? It started slowly, just feeling a bit heavier, you know? But it’s gotten worse each day. It's… uncomfortable. And a little bit painful when I walk. I tried to ignore it, but it’s not going away.
DOCTOR: "A little bit" painful, you say. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sharp pain, Doctor. It’s more… a dull ache. Like a really bad bruise, but deep inside the muscle. And it feels… tight. Like something is pressing on it. It’s hard to explain. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It’s…vague, but I understand. Is the swelling constant, or does it fluctuate throughout the day?
PATIENT: It seems to be worse at the end of the day, Doctor. In the morning, it’s a bit better, not as noticeable. But by evening, after I’ve been on my feet for a while, it gets quite big. It’s… quite worrying, to be honest. I haven't been able to get any proper rest.
DOCTOR: And does elevating your leg help at all when you rest?
PATIENT: I… I haven’t really tried that, Doctor. I didn’t think to. I just… sat with it. Would that help? I usually just sit on the sofa with a blanket over it. I suppose I could try putting it up on a pillow? I don’t know if that would make a difference.
DOCTOR: It would make a difference, Nixon. Elevation is a basic principle of managing swelling. Alright. Let’s have a look at the leg. Please, have a seat on the examination table and I’ll begin.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Yes, of course. I… apologize. I haven’t had much experience with… with doctors, to be honest. I’ll sit right here, then. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Please, extend your left leg. I'm going to palpate it, check for any tenderness, and measure the circumference. Then I'll check your pulses. This is standard procedure.
PATIENT: Alright. Is… is it going to hurt? I don’t like being touched unexpectedly. Just… please be gentle? I'm a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: I will be as gentle as possible, Nixon. But I need to assess the extent of the swelling. Tell me if anything is particularly painful. There is definite pitting edema present, and tenderness to palpation along the posterior calf. Dorsalis pedis pulse is present, though slightly diminished. Popliteal pulse is palpable, but weak. Circumference at 10cm distal to the tibial tuberosity is 38cm, compared to 35cm on the right leg.
PATIENT: Oh, that… that’s a bit uncomfortable, Doctor. Not terribly painful, but… definitely noticeable. Is that bad? The difference in size… is that a lot? I… I don’t know what any of those measurements mean. My heart… is it connected to my leg being like that?
DOCTOR: The difference in circumference is significant, Nixon. And yes, your atrial fibrillation could be a contributing factor. It can lead to fluid retention. However, we need to rule out other causes. A deep vein thrombosis is a possibility. I'm going to order a D-dimer test and a venous ultrasound of your left leg. This will help us determine if there's a blood clot. In the meantime, elevate your leg as much as possible, and I'll write you a prescription for compression stockings. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: A… a blood clot? Oh dear. That sounds very serious. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. I’ve never taken much in the way of medicine, to be honest. Just… paracetamol for headaches, sometimes. What will the tests involve? And… will I need to stay in hospital? I have… commitments.
DOCTOR: A D-dimer is a simple blood test, Nixon. It checks for a substance released when a blood clot breaks down. The ultrasound is non-invasive – a technician will use a gel and a probe to look at the veins in your leg. As for hospitalization… we’ll know more after the results come back. It’s unlikely at this stage, but it depends on the findings. I’m not going to speculate. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have the order ready for you. I'll also write you a note for work, excusing you for the appointment. Now, do you currently take any medications for your atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: Oh, right. A blood test. And the… the ultrasound. Yes, I do. I take… Bisoprolol, I think it’s called. And… Rivaroxaban. The doctor said they help keep my heart steady and… prevent blood clots, but I still get… palpitations sometimes. And now my leg… is swollen. It all seems… rather confusing, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Bisoprolol and Rivaroxaban… adequate, but clearly not fully controlling your condition. And the swelling suggests a complication, or potentially, a need to adjust your dosage. We'll need to discuss that with cardiology if the ultrasound is negative. Let's get these tests done first, Nixon. Do you have any questions about how to get to the lab and schedule the ultrasound?
PATIENT: No, I… I think I understand. Down the hall, and schedule the… the ultrasound. I… I don’t think I have any other questions right now, Doctor. I’m just… a bit worried, to be honest. Is it alright if I just… go and get the tests done? I feel a bit… flustered.
DOCTOR: Very well, Nixon. Go ahead. The results will be sent to me, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. And try to elevate your leg. Don't delay.
PATIENT: Right. Thank you, Doctor. I will. .
