DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. It's… this tiredness. Always tired. Like, all the time. Not good for work, you know? I make things with cloth, need hands steady. This liver… the other doctor, he say liver is not happy. But tiredness is… much.
DOCTOR: Right. Tiredness. And another doctor mentioned something about your liver. Hmm. Can you tell me more about this tiredness, Mr. Grumman?
PATIENT: More? It just… is. Wake up tired. Work all day, get more tired. Even when I sit and rest, still tired. Not like a normal tired. It's… heavy. Like someone sitting on my chest, maybe? You understand? I don't know how to explain good. It's been... a long time now. Years, I think.
DOCTOR: Years, you say. A “heavy” tiredness… alright. And is this tiredness interfering with your work specifically, or is it affecting other parts of your life as well?
PATIENT: Work is… hardest. Need to focus, cut straight lines, make things look nice. Can’t do that when you feel like… this. Wife, she says I’m quiet more now. Don’t want to go out. Not fun when you just want to sleep. She gets mad. Says I need to try to enjoy things. What does she know?
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s impacting your concentration at work, and your social life as well. And it sounds like this is causing some friction at home. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I… sometimes my stomach feels funny. Not sick, exactly. Just… bloated. And… I get angry quick, maybe? My wife says so. Little things bother me. Used to not be like that. I don't know if that's a symptom. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Bloating and irritability… alright. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not much change. I eat. Wife cooks good food. Maybe I don’t eat as much as before, but… she worries about me, always asking if I’m hungry. Weight… I don’t know. I don’t weigh myself. I'm always thin, always have been. Not like my brothers, they’re big. This tiredness is the problem, not… how much I weigh.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Other conditions? Hmm… the liver, of course. That’s what brought me to the other doctor. Before that… not much. Little things. Coughs, colds. Old man problems. Nothing serious. My wife keeps telling me to get a checkup every year, but… I don't like doctors. Always poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never surgery. Never in the hospital. Lucky, I think. My brother, he broke his leg when he was young. Bad break. Lots of pain. Me, I just stay out of trouble. Not worth it. This tiredness… this is worse than a broken leg, maybe. It just… wears you down.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My brothers, they are okay. One lives in the city, works in an office. The other, he farms. Both strong men. My mother… she died years ago. Long sickness. My father, he was a good man, worked hard. He died when I was young. Nothing like… this tiredness in my family. They all have energy, always busy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. Eat anything. Take anything the doctor gives me, if I have to. Not picky. Not like those city people, always complaining about something. This tiredness… that's the problem. Not what I eat, not what I'm allergic to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. Make me feel… funny. The other doctor gave me something for the liver, a long time ago. But I stopped taking it. Didn't seem to help. This tiredness… still there.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Mr. Grumman, it sounds like this tiredness has been a long-standing issue. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if that’s alright. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll also examine your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Examine? Prodding and poking? I don’t like that. But… I’m tired of being tired. If it will help… fine. But be gentle. And don't take too long. I have things to do. Well, not things things. Just… things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are… normal. No murmurs or irregularities detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the right upper quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Palpable liver edge is slightly enlarged. No other abnormalities detected. Alright. I’m going to order some blood tests. We need to check your liver function, your complete blood count, and a few other things. These tests will help us determine the cause of your tiredness and abdominal tenderness.
PATIENT: Blood tests? More poking? Fine. Just… tell me when it will be done. And how long it will take to get the results. I don’t want to be sitting around, waiting. This tiredness… it’s making me impatient.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall. It shouldn’t take long. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. We’ll call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and formulate a plan. Would next week work for you?
PATIENT: Next week? Maybe. What days? I don't want to take too much time off work. My wife will complain. And this tiredness… makes everything harder. Can't think straight. Just tell me what day is best, and I'll try to make it work.
DOCTOR: Alright. How about Thursday afternoon?
PATIENT: Thursday… afternoon. Fine. But if it's a long wait, I'm warning you now, I won't be happy. This tiredness is… enough for one week. Get it done quickly. And call if anything is wrong, okay? Don't want to be sitting around wondering.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. We’ve scheduled you for a follow-up appointment on Thursday afternoon. The lab will call you to schedule the blood tests. If you have any questions before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. I’ll see you then.
PATIENT: Fine. Goodbye. Just… get those tests done quickly. And call. Don't forget. This tiredness… it’s wearing me out.
