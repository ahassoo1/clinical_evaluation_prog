DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jaxston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Dr. Piet. Thanks for seein' me. It’s… headaches, mostly. Bad ones. And I get really sweaty when they happen, and my heart feels like it's gonna jump outta my chest. It’s been happenin’ on and off for a while now, I think. I can't really put my finger on when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, sweating, and a racing heart. That sounds quite unpleasant. And you said "on and off for a while now"—can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Maybe… six months? A year? It's hard to say, honestly. Things kinda blur together, you know? They don't happen every day, thankfully. More like… a few times a month, maybe? Sometimes it's just a headache, and sometimes it's the whole sweaty, heart-racin' thing. It’s… confusing. Sorry, I’m not bein’ very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: No, you’re doing perfectly fine, Jaxston. It is often hard to pinpoint these things. A few times a month is helpful to know. And it sounds like the symptoms aren't always the same, which is good information. Let's try to get a little more detail. When you have these headaches, where exactly do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Usually… around my temples, I think? And kinda at the back of my head too. It’s not like one specific spot, it feels… all over, really. And sometimes it spreads down into my neck. It’s a throbbing kinda pain, most of the time. Does that make sense? I'm tryin' to remember what it felt like last time, but it all feels a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Temples, back of the head, spreading to the neck… throbbing pain. Fuzzy is okay, we'll work through it. Now, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very mild and 10 being the worst pain you can imagine, how would you rate these headaches at their worst?
PATIENT: Oof, that's a good question. Ten feels… dramatic, doesn’t it? I don't think I've ever had a pain that bad. Probably… an 8, when they're really bad. It makes it hard to concentrate, and I usually just have to lie down in a dark room. Everything feels… too much. I haven't really thought about numbers for it before, though. Is that a normal thing to do?
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely normal to not think about numbers! We just use it as a way to get a better understanding of how severe the pain is. An 8 is definitely significant, meaning it's disrupting your daily life. Okay, and when these episodes happen, do you notice anything that triggers them?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. That's a tough one. I haven’t really noticed anythin’ specific. Sometimes it’s after a long day at work, maybe? But not always. I've been tryin' to think about it, but nothin’ really jumps out. Stress, I guess? But what man doesn’t have stress? I drink coffee, but I've always drank coffee. It’s probably not that. Honestly, it feels kinda random, which is… frustrating. I wish I could at least figure out what's causin’ them.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Random can be the hardest to deal with. We’ll try to narrow things down. You mentioned work. What do you do, Jaxston?
PATIENT: Oh, right. I… I work in production. Just general stuff, packin' boxes, movin' things around. It’s not glamorous, but it pays the bills. It's kinda repetitive, if that makes any sense. Standin' for long periods, mostly. Not much thinkin' involved, which is good sometimes, but… I dunno. It’s just a job. It’s not too physically demandin’ or nothin’, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, production work, standing for long periods, repetitive tasks. That’s good to know. And you mentioned you drink coffee. How much coffee would you say you drink in a typical day?
PATIENT: Um… probably… three or four cups? Maybe five on a bad day? It’s not fancy stuff, just instant coffee. I use a big mug. I've always been a coffee drinker, though, like I said. My dad drank coffee, his dad drank coffee… it's kinda just a habit, I guess. I don’t really feel it affect me, though. Or maybe I just don’t notice? I don't know. I’m not really a caffeine person, if that makes sense. It doesn't make me jittery or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to five cups of instant coffee. Not jittery. Now, let's talk a little bit about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Not really. I wear glasses, I've worn them for years. But my prescription hasn't changed recently, not that I'm aware of. Maybe things are a bit blurry sometimes, but that's just my glasses, I think. No floaters or flashes of light, or anything like that. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It’s hard to keep track of things like that, isn’t it? I don’t really pay attention to stuff like that unless somethin’ feels… off, and it hasn’t felt off lately.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No changes in vision, prescription stable. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Never any vomit, just… the headache and the sweaty feeling, and my heart racin’. Sometimes a bit dizzy, maybe, but nothin’ too bad. Usually just when I stand up too fast. It's more the headache that bothers me, really. And the… the weird feeling in my chest. Like somethin's wrong. I don't know how to describe it properly. It's not pain, exactly, just… uncomfortable. And scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea or vomiting, dizziness sometimes when standing, and a discomfort, not pain, in your chest during these episodes. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of. I haven't really been to the doctor much. Just for check-ups, really. I think I had chickenpox when I was a kid, but that’s about it. My dad had… somethin’ with his heart, I think. But I don’t know much about it. And my ex-wife… well, that’s a story for another day. I just haven’t really had any health problems, not serious ones, anyway. I try to eat alright and I walk a bit, but I wouldn't say I'm a particularly healthy person. More like… averagely unhealthy. Does that make sense? I'm bad at explainin' things, I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jaxston. No need to apologize. “Averagely unhealthy” is a good description. Your father had some heart condition, we can revisit that later if you get more information. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized?
PATIENT: No, never. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell out of a tree, but that just needed a cast. Nothing serious. No hospitals, no surgeries. Just the usual bumps and bruises, I guess. I’m not a fan of doctors or hospitals, to be honest. That's probably why I haven’t been much. I try to avoid them when I can. But these headaches are gettin' worse, so I figured I should probably get it checked out. Sorry, I'm ramblin' again. It’s just… I don't like bein' sick, and I don't like bein' in hospitals. It makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. It's okay to be anxious about medical settings. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ at all. I don’t really take pills, unless I’ve got a really bad cold, and then I just take whatever my mum tells me to. But I haven't taken anything for ages. No regular meds, no supplements, nothin’. I’m not really a fan of takin' stuff if I can avoid it. I prefer to just… tough it out, I guess. But these headaches… they’re not somethin’ I can just tough out, are they? That’s why I'm here. Sorry, I’m probably just statin’ the obvious.
DOCTOR: You’re not stating the obvious. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. I haven’t had any reactions to anything, ever. No hives, no trouble breathin’, nothin’. My ex-wife was allergic to cats, but that’s about the closest I’ve got to knowin’ someone with allergies. I've always been pretty lucky in that department, I guess. No allergies, no reactions… just the usual sniffles when it’s cold season. Does that make sense? I’m tryin’ to think of anything, but my mind’s just blank. It's all a bit blurry, you know? I wish I was better at rememberin’ things.
DOCTOR: That's alright. No known allergies. Okay, Jaxston, thank you for that information. It sounds like you've been experiencing these headaches for a while now, accompanied by sweating, a racing heart, and sometimes dizziness. Given your symptoms, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, including checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Piet. I just want to figure out what's goin' on, you know? Checkin' my blood pressure and listenin' to my heart sounds good. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest, but I guess it's gotta be done. Just… try not to poke too much? I'm not great with needles. I know that's probably silly, but… just sayin'.
DOCTOR: No needles today, I promise. We'll start with your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90. That’s not drastically high, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly fast. Lungs are clear. No tenderness in your neck, that’s good. Given your symptoms and the elevated blood pressure, I think it's important to rule out a few possibilities. I’d like to order some blood work to check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and thyroid levels. I’m also going to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and an EKG… Yeah, alright. Whatever you think is best. It all sounds a bit scary, but I trust your judgment, Dr. Piet. I just wanna know what's wrong, you know? So yeah, blood work and an EKG… let’s get it done. Where do I go for that? And how long will it take to get the results? I need to go back to work… eventually. It's just… I'm a bit worried about what they might find. Sorry, I’m probably bein’ a bit dramatic. But it's hard not to worry when you don’t know what's goin' on.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be worried, Jaxston. We’ll take it one step at a time. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The technician will draw some blood, and it should only take about 15-20 minutes. The EKG will be done in room 205, and that should only take a few minutes as well. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to get some rest and stay hydrated. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, 24-48 hours. Rest and stay hydrated… got it. And go to the emergency room if it gets worse. That’s… good to know. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… try not to worry, you said? Easier said than done, I guess. Thanks, Dr. Piet. You’ve been really helpful. And… patient. I know I’m probably not the easiest patient. I just… appreciate you takin’ the time to listen. Should I, uh, should I call if I'm still feelin’ anxious before the results come back? Just in case? It's probably silly.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely not silly to ask, Jaxston. Please do call if you’re feeling overly anxious or your symptoms worsen before the results come back. My nurse’s number is 555-123-4567. We'll figure this out. Don't hesitate to reach out. And please remember to follow up with me in a few days once we have the results. Thank you for coming in today. Get some rest.
