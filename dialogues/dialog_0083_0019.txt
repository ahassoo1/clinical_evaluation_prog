DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what bring me? My wife… she want… baby. We old, you see. She say maybe need… help to make baby. I forget what she say exactly, but something like… plan for baby? I not so good remembering things these days.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. Your wife would like to explore options for having a baby, and you’re here to discuss that with me. That’s perfectly alright. It’s very common to need a little help with family planning, regardless of age. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me a little more about how long you and your wife have been trying to conceive?
PATIENT: Trying… how long? Oh… not long. Maybe… six months? Seven? Time… it goes fast. We not try hard hard, you see. More like… see what happen. She… she very good woman. Want baby for long time, but we wait. Now she say… time to really try. I think. Is complicated, my memory… it not so good.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. Six to seven months is a reasonable amount of time to start discussing options. And it’s very thoughtful of you to be here with your wife to explore this. Let’s talk a bit more about your wife’s health. Has she had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Previous… babies? Yes. She have… two. Long time ago. In… Africa, you see. Very long time ago. No problem with babies then, she say. But… she older now. That’s why we come. Is different now, she think. I not sure. I just come with her. She do the talking, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, two previous pregnancies with no complications, that’s good information. And it’s helpful to know she’s feeling things might be different now. Mr. Carlotta, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few questions about both of your medical histories. I understand your memory isn't what it used to be, so please don't hesitate to tell me if you're unsure, and I'll be happy to guide you. First, do either of you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Chronic… health? Hmm… she have little… trouble with her legs sometimes. Old injury, she say. From… work. Long time ago. Not big problem. She walk okay, mostly. I… I mostly okay. Little ache here and there. Old man problems, you see. No… I don't think we have big problems. Just… old. She take pills for her legs, sometimes. But not many.
DOCTOR: Alright, so your wife has some leg pain related to an old injury and takes medication for that occasionally. And you have some typical aches and pains associated with getting older. That’s helpful to know. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask about any surgeries you both may have had in the past. Do you recall either of you having any operations?
PATIENT: Surgery… She… she have one. Long time ago. For her… stomach. Something wrong with it, she say. I forget what exactly. Not big surgery, she say. She heal good. I… I think I have one too. Maybe. When I was young. Broken arm. Football. But long, long time ago. No problem now. Is all very long time ago, Doctor. My memory… it not so good for things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, your wife had a stomach surgery some time ago, and you had a broken arm repaired when you were younger. That’s good information. Now, are either of you currently taking any medications regularly, besides the pills your wife takes for her legs?
PATIENT: Medication… She take the pills for her legs, yes. And… sometimes, for her… head. When it hurts. Not every day. When the weather is bad. I… I take little pills for my… water. Old man problem. I forget the name. Something with… pressure. Little blue pills. That's all. I think. Is that important? I take them every day. But little ones.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s important information, Mr. Carlotta. It helps me understand the whole picture. So, your wife takes medication for leg pain and occasionally for headaches, and you take a small blue pill for blood pressure. To continue, have either of you been hospitalized for anything in the last five years?
PATIENT: Hospital… Hmm… not me. No hospital for me. Maybe… maybe she go once. For her leg. A little stay. Not long. Just a few days. I think. She complain a lot about the leg, so maybe she go more than once. But not… big stay. Just for… check. I forget exactly. She do the remembering. I just… come with her. Is confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your wife may have been hospitalized briefly once or twice in the past five years for her leg. That’s alright, we’re just trying to gather as much information as possible. Now, I'd like to ask about any allergies either of you may have. Are you or your wife allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No… I don’t think so. Not me. I eat everything. Maybe… maybe she don’t like shellfish. But not allergy. She just don’t like it. Not sick if she eat it. I think. She very picky eater, my wife. But not allergy. I think. We not have much allergy problems.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies for either of you. That’s good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of your current situation, could you tell me a little bit more about your wife’s menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Men…strual? I… I don’t understand. Is she… sick? Is something wrong with her? She feeling okay. She just want baby. Is that what you ask? I don’t know about… that. Is woman things. She do the… everything. I don’t ask. Is private. I’m sorry, Doctor. I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Oh, my apologies, Mr. Carlotta. That was a very insensitive question, and I should have been more mindful. Please forgive me. It’s a standard question I ask patients, but I understand it’s a personal matter, and you’re absolutely right to not want to discuss it. Let's move on to something else. Perhaps you could tell me how long you and your wife have been actively trying to conceive?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. No problem. You forget, I old man. I understand. Actively… trying? Maybe… six months? Seven? We not… push too hard. We enjoy time together. When it happen, it happen. She say maybe need help. That why we here. But we not stress. We happy. We just want… little one. If God willing.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Carlotta. Six to seven months of trying, not actively pushing, but open to the possibility. And that’s a very thoughtful approach. To help me determine the best course of action, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam on both of you. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? What kind of exam? She… she not like doctors touching her. She shy. I… I okay. But she… Maybe just me? Or… can we talk more first? I don't want her to be scared. Is she need… undress? Is that what you ask? I want to know. Before she get… upset.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question, Mr. Carlotta. I understand your wife’s concerns, and I would never want to make her feel uncomfortable. For you, the exam would be very basic—checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam. For your wife, I would ideally like to do a pelvic exam to assess her reproductive health, but only if she is comfortable with it. We can absolutely skip that part if she prefers. It's entirely her decision. We can also start with just an exam for you, and then discuss it with her further. The exam room is private, and she’s welcome to have you with her every step of the way. We can take things at her pace. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sound good. Very good. She need to be comfortable. And… I stay with her. Always. No… no exam if she not happy. Just you check me first, maybe? And we talk to her? She listen to you. You seem… kind. Okay. You check me first. And we talk to my wife. She very good woman. I want her to be okay. That's all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Carlotta. That’s perfectly fine. We’ll start with an exam for you, and we can discuss everything with your wife afterward. If you’ll just follow me over to the examination table, we can get started. Please undress from the waist up, and I’ll leave a gown for you to put on if you’d like.
PATIENT: Okay. Waist up. Is private, yes? No one come in?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely private, Mr. Carlotta. I will ensure no one interrupts us. I will also close the curtain for added privacy. Please take your time getting changed. I will be right outside.
PATIENT: .
