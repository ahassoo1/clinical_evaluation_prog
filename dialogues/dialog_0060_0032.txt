DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. So, tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor... Noordin, is it? Yes. It’s… a delicate matter. Something of an… irritation, you see. Down there. It’s been… present for a bit now. Not terribly painful, but… bothersome. I haven’t the slightest idea what’s caused it, and frankly, I’d rather not dwell on the specifics. It’s simply… leaking. A bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Leaking,” you say. Right. Well, these things happen, Mr. Krok. It’s not ideal, but we’ll figure it out. How long has this “leakage” been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? Let me think… a week? Perhaps a little longer. It’s difficult to say precisely. My wife, Shirin, noticed it first, naturally. She has a keen eye for such things. I rather… avoid looking down there myself, if you understand. It’s not a pleasant sight, at my age. Everything… loses its firmness, you know? But the leaking… that’s new.
DOCTOR: So, approximately a week, noticed by your wife. And has it been constant since she noticed it, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant… no, not constant, precisely. It’s more… intermittent. Sometimes it’s there, a bit of dampness, and other times… nothing at all. It doesn’t seem to be related to anything in particular. I haven't changed anything in my routine, and I assure you, Doctor, I’m a man of simple habits. Shirin suggested it might be the weather, but I find that rather… improbable. Still, she’s usually right about these things. Though she does worry excessively, that woman. Always has.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Let’s get a bit more information. Do you have any pain, burning, or itching associated with this?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not really. A slight… sensitivity, perhaps. A tickle, more than anything. And no burning, thank goodness. Itching… occasionally, yes. But nothing unbearable. It’s more… irritating than painful, Doctor. A constant mild annoyance, really. It makes things… uncomfortable. Especially after… well, you understand. It's a nuisance, to be frank. And I'm not a young man anymore; I don't need another discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any changes in your urine – color, odor, frequency?
PATIENT: Urine… now, that’s a good question. Shirin hasn’t mentioned anything about the color, and frankly, I rarely pay attention to such things. Frequency… no, I suppose not. I get up the same number of times as always. Odor… I haven’t noticed anything… unusual. Though, to be perfectly honest, my sense of smell isn’t what it once was. Everything seems to smell faintly of Shirin’s rosewater, which isn’t unpleasant, but does rather mask… other scents. She’s quite fond of it, you see. Perhaps you should ask her; she’d notice these things far more readily than I.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Krok, it sounds like we need to do a quick examination. It's probably nothing serious, but we need to rule out a few things. I'll need you to get on the examination table, and we'll just take a look. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: An examination… oh dear. Must we? It’s rather… undignified, at my age. But if you insist, Doctor. Allergies… let me think. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been a robust fellow, never much trouble with sickness or sensitivities. Shirin always says I eat too much garlic, but that’s hardly an allergy. No, nothing specifically. Though I do dislike the smell of eucalyptus… it reminds me of the dentist. A rather unpleasant association, you see. But no true allergies, Doctor. No.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. Just lie down on your back for now, Mr. Krok. We’ll start with a simple visual inspection, and then I’ll need to do a quick palpation. It won’t be comfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful.
PATIENT: Palpation… is that… poking? Shirin warned me about doctors and their… poking. It’s all so very clinical. I do wish there was a less… invasive way to determine the cause of this… irritation. But if that’s what’s required… Very well, Doctor. Proceed. But please, be gentle. I’m not as resilient as I once was, you see. And try to avoid any sudden movements. It’s my prostate, isn’t it? Shirin suspects it's my prostate. It always seems to be the prostate with men our age.
DOCTOR: We'll see, Mr. Krok. Now, just relax. Alright. Tenderness here… and here. Not severe, but present. I’m also noting some mild swelling. It could be a number of things, Mr. Krok. Now, I'm going to need to perform a digital rectal exam. It’s standard procedure, and will give me a better idea of what's going on. I understand it’s not pleasant, but it’s necessary. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: A… digital rectal exam? Good heavens. Shirin did warn me. Absolutely not. No, Doctor, I simply cannot. It’s… undignified. And frankly, rather alarming. Is it absolutely necessary? Surely there’s another way? A blood test, perhaps? An imaging scan? Anything would be preferable to… that. I’m a man of some… delicacy, Doctor. And I’ve lived a long life. I’m not sure my… constitution could withstand such an examination. Please, Doctor, reconsider. Perhaps we can try… observation? For a week or two? And if it worsens, then we can discuss… more invasive procedures. This is simply… too much. Too much, altogether.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, with all due respect, I am trying to help you. A digital rectal exam is a quick, relatively painless procedure that is essential for diagnosing the cause of your symptoms. It's the most reliable way to assess your prostate, and rule out any serious issues. A blood test won't tell me what's going on internally. Observation could delay a diagnosis, and potentially allow a problem to worsen. Look, I understand your discomfort, but refusing a basic exam is not in your best interest. I'm not going to force you, but I strongly advise you to reconsider. If you are truly opposed, I can write a referral to a urologist, but they will almost certainly insist on performing this exam. What do you want me to document as your refusal?
PATIENT: A urologist… Shirin mentioned a urologist. A younger man, I presume? With… even more probing questions? Oh dear. Very well, Doctor. Document… document my extreme discomfort and… unwillingness. And a strong preference for… less invasive alternatives. And document my wife’s… concerns. She’ll be most displeased. But if a urologist is unavoidable… then so be it. Perhaps a younger man will be more… gentle. Although I doubt it. It’s all so very clinical, isn’t it? And undignified. Document my protest, Doctor. Document it all. Perhaps someone will listen. Write that I'm extremely anxious, and I strongly believe a week of observation is warranted. Just a week, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve documented your concerns and refusal of the exam. I’ll write the referral to Dr. Imani, a urologist in the city. He’s very thorough. Here's the paperwork. You’ll need to schedule an appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
