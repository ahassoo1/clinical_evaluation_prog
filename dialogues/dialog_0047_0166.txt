DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been… persistent enough that I thought I should get it checked out. It’s primarily in my left leg, though sometimes it feels a bit… distant in my right as well.
DOCTOR: Alright. Numbness in the leg… and it's affecting both legs, you say?
PATIENT: Not consistently both, Doctor. It started in just the left one, and that’s where it’s most noticeable. The right leg just… feels a little off sometimes. Like when I’ve been sitting for a while, maybe. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… lack of feeling, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A lack of feeling… and how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It began… approximately three weeks ago, I believe. It wasn’t immediate, it was more gradual. At first, I dismissed it as just… sitting too long while working on a project. I do a lot of animation, so I’m often at my desk for extended periods. But it hasn’t gone away, and it’s starting to become a little concerning.
DOCTOR: Animation, right. So prolonged sitting. And has it been getting progressively worse over those three weeks, or has it been fairly stable?
PATIENT: It's been… a slow increase, I’d say. Not dramatically worse each day, but if I think back to when it started, it was barely noticeable. Now, it’s… consistently there when I’m standing for a while, and it wakes me up a little if I sleep in a strange position. It hasn’t caused me to stop doing anything, but it’s definitely a presence. Does that clarify things?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. And is it just the leg, or does the numbness extend anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, it seems to be isolated to my legs. I haven't noticed any tingling or lack of feeling in my feet or hands, or anywhere else for that matter. Just… the legs. I’ve been trying to pay attention to it, just in case, but so far, it’s confined to my lower limbs.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any recent injuries to your legs?
PATIENT: No injuries, Doctor. I haven't had any falls or bumps or anything of that nature. I’m fairly careful, and I haven’t been involved in any sports or activities that would typically lead to injury. I mostly work indoors, as I mentioned. Though, I did help my uncle unload some lumber last month, but that was… just lifting boxes, nothing strenuous. It wasn’t anything that would cause a visible injury, at least.
DOCTOR: Unloading lumber… Right. Let’s move on to some other things. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I'm generally quite healthy. I haven't been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses or anything of that nature. I have regular check-ups with my family doctor, and everything has always been normal. I do have some seasonal allergies, but those are… manageable with over-the-counter medication. Otherwise, I’d say I’m in good health.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. And I haven’t required any hospitalizations. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, but that was… a very long time ago. It was a routine procedure, and I recovered without any complications. Aside from that, I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid needing any medical interventions.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother has some mild arthritis, and my paternal grandfather had diabetes, though it was well-managed. Beyond that… I don't recall any significant medical history on either side of the family. They all lived to be quite old, generally, so I suppose that’s a good sign. Is there anything specific you're looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Just routine. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any prescription medications. As I mentioned, I occasionally use over-the-counter antihistamines for my allergies during pollen season, but that's the extent of it. I avoid medication whenever possible, if I can help it. I prefer to address things naturally, when appropriate.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a look at your legs. If you could just sit on the examination table, and we’ll start with a basic neurological exam. Can you describe what position you were in when you first noticed the numbness?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I'll be happy to. I was sitting at my desk, working on a particularly complex animation sequence. I believe I had my left leg crossed over my right one, and I was leaning forward slightly. It wasn't an unusual position, I do that quite often. It was a gradual sensation, it didn't happen suddenly. I initially thought it was just my leg falling asleep, but it didn’t go away when I uncrossed it.
DOCTOR: Alright, go ahead and lie down on your back, please. And then we’ll start with some simple reflexes and strength tests.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know what you’d like me to do. I’ll cooperate fully. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Relax your leg, please. I’m going to tap just below your kneecap. Okay. And now the right. Both seem… normal. Now, can you lift your left leg straight up, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Like this? I'm trying to keep it as straight as possible, though it's a little awkward on the table. I feel some… slight resistance, but I don't feel any pain. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Good. Now, do the same with your right leg.
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. This one feels… a little more difficult. I can lift it, but it's not quite as smooth as the other one. And I feel a little bit of… tightness in my hamstring, if that makes sense. I wouldn't say it's painful, but it's definitely more effortful. Is that what you're observing?
DOCTOR: Hmm. And can you wiggle your toes on both feet?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Both feet are responding normally, I believe. I can flex and extend them without any difficulty. I’m trying to be as precise as possible. Let me know if you need me to do anything else.
DOCTOR: Any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't feel tender. Maybe a little bit of… normal muscle soreness, but nothing significant. I do spend a lot of time sitting, so I suppose that's to be expected. Perhaps a little bit of tightness here, but no sharp pain. And no, that doesn't hurt. It's just… awareness of the pressure. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on this brief examination, it’s difficult to say definitively. It could be a mild nerve compression, possibly related to your prolonged sitting, or it could be something else entirely. I'm not seeing anything immediately concerning, but given the persistence of your symptoms, I’d like to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying conditions. And I'm going to recommend an MRI of your lower back, just to check for any issues with your spinal nerves. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me and considering all possibilities. Blood work and an MRI seem like prudent steps. I’m happy to proceed with whatever you recommend. I am a little concerned, naturally, but I trust your judgment. Would you like me to schedule the MRI through the clinic? And are there any specific instructions I should follow before the blood work?
DOCTOR: Yes, please schedule the MRI through the clinic. And for the blood work, I’ll give you a requisition form. Fasting for 12 hours beforehand is required, so no food or drinks other than water. I'll also have the nurse give you a sheet with instructions for preparing for the MRI as well. It’s important to remove any metal objects before the scan, including jewelry and piercings. We’ll get those results as quickly as possible. In the meantime, try to avoid prolonged sitting if you can, and if you must sit, take frequent breaks to stretch and walk around. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: That's very thorough, Doctor, thank you. No, I don't believe so. You've addressed all of my concerns. I'll schedule the MRI right away and make sure to follow the instructions for both tests. I appreciate your time and expertise. I'll let you know if any questions arise.
DOCTOR: Good. We’ll review the results as soon as they’re available, and we’ll go from there. The nurse will be in shortly to give you the requisitions and instructions. Don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening of your symptoms before then. Have a good day, Mr. Kinjerski.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I appreciate everything. .
