DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. It's my nails, okay? They just...look funny. Not good funny. They changed. I don't remember how they changed, just...different. It bothers me.
DOCTOR: Different how, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Hmm. Like...the color. Not the pretty kind. And they're kinda...thick, I guess? Not smooth. I don't paint 'em or nothin'. Just...nails. I don't know what is wrong with 'em. They always been fine.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, changes in nail appearance can be indicative of several things. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort associated with these changes?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. Maybe a little...when I'm scrubbing, you know, dishes or somethin'. But who doesn't get a little ache doin' that? It's just...ugly nails. I want normal nails. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Hmm. And have you noticed any changes to the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Skin? Let me see... Oh. Yeah, kinda red around the edges of some of 'em. Not all, just...a few. I thought it was from the water. We got hard water, you know? Makes everything kinda…irritated. But maybe not? I don't know nothin' about nails.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look. Could you please extend your hands, palms up, so I can examine them?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Be gentle, okay? I don't want you breakin' 'em. They're already a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay… I do see some discoloration and thickening, as you mentioned. And some mild inflammation around the cuticle of a few nails. The nail beds do seem a little slow to return to color after pressure. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical...conditions? I dunno. I'm old. Old people have things. Arthritis, maybe? The doctor told me somethin' once. And my blood pressure is…up sometimes. I take a pill for that. But that's it, I think. Oh! And I get headaches. But everyone gets headaches. Not important. What about my nails?!
DOCTOR: Right. And what is the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Umm... Let me think... it's a little white pill. Small. I get it at the pharmacy. The man knows me there. I don’t really pay attention to the names of things. Is it important? I just wanna know what's wrong with my nails!
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Thut. Certain medications can have side effects that affect nail health. It’s also important for me to have a complete medical history. Do you recall the pharmacy where you get it?
PATIENT: Oh! Okay, okay. It's... Patel's Pharmacy. Down on Elm Street. Old Man Patel, nice guy. He always asks about my daughter. And the pill...it's... ...Lisinopril! That's it! Lisinopril. I think. Maybe. It's a little white pill. Honestly, doctor, I just want my nails fixed. This is too much questioning.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril… yes. It can sometimes contribute to nail changes, although it's not common. Given the discoloration, thickening, and slow capillary refill, and your history of Lisinopril use, it's possible this is a medication-related effect. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a fungal culture of the nails to confirm. And I'd like to do a complete blood count to ensure there are no underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fungal...culture? Blood...count? You're gonna take my blood? And scrape my nails?! This sounds awful! Can't you just give me a cream or somethin'? I don't like needles. And I don't like people messin' with my nails. No. I don't want any of that. Just tell me what's wrong with 'em! Is it serious? Are they gonna fall off?!
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I understand your apprehension. But it’s important to get an accurate diagnosis before starting any treatment. Simply applying a cream without knowing the cause could make things worse. And no, your nails are not likely to fall off. The fungal culture involves taking a small scraping from the nail to see if a fungus is present. The blood count is a simple test to check your overall health. It’s very routine. However, if you absolutely refuse these tests, I can refer you to a dermatologist. They specialize in nail conditions and can assess whether further investigation is needed. Would you prefer that?
PATIENT: A…dermatologist? Is that more needles? More scraping? Ugh. Fine. Do the test. Just…be quick about it. And don't hurt me. But if it’s a fungus, I want a cream. A nice-smelling cream. And no, I don’t want to see a dermatologist. I came here to get this fixed, not run around to a bunch of different doctors. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse draw blood for the complete blood count. And I will take a small scraping from a couple of the affected nails for the fungal culture. It will be a little uncomfortable, but quick. The results usually take about a week. In the meantime, I recommend keeping your nails short and dry. We will discuss treatment options once the results are back. Nurse, could you please prepare a blood draw for Ms. Thut and bring in the supplies for a fungal culture?
PATIENT: Ugh. Short and dry. Like my personality, I guess. Fine. Just get it done.
