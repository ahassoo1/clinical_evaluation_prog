DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Yes, well, I suppose I’m here because… someone said I should come. New to the area, you see. Medicare insisted, really. Honestly, I haven’t the slightest idea what they expect me to tell you. It’s all rather… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Candice. Sometimes these check-ups are just a general overview to get a baseline, especially when you're new to the area and switching care. No pressure at all. Perhaps we can start with how you've been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Well, I feel my age, naturally. Seventy-nine years takes its toll, you know. And the weather… it’s quite humid here, isn’t it? Makes my joints ache. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I don't understand why you need to ask. It's perfectly obvious.
DOCTOR: I understand, Candice. It is obvious that age can bring aches and pains, and the humidity certainly doesn't help. I'm just trying to get a full picture of what’s going on, so we can figure out the best way to help you feel comfortable. When you say your joints ache, are there particular joints that bother you more than others?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Must we go through every joint? It’s… all of them, really. My knees, my hips, my fingers… even my elbows sometimes. It’s a general stiffness, a general discomfort. I used to be quite active, you know. Before… well, before things started to… settle. Now, everything just feels… old. And frankly, it's rather rude to ask a woman her age and then question where it aches!
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to call me out on that, Candice. My apologies. That was a clumsy way of asking. Let's rephrase. You’ve mentioned stiffness and discomfort in multiple joints, and a history of being more active. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: Building up… yes, I suppose so. It wasn’t sudden. Things don’t usually sudden with age, do they? It’s been… gradual. A little worse each year, perhaps. Though I haven’t really kept track. My husband handles all of that sort of thing. He's very organized, you see. I mostly just… feel it. Is that helpful? I truly don’t see why I needed to come here to explain this. It’s common sense, really.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Candice. Knowing it’s been a gradual process is important. And you’re right, it does sound like something very common with age. Just to get a clearer picture, would you say this discomfort is constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Mostly it's there. A dull ache, you know? It’s worse in the mornings, naturally. And on damp days. Like today! Honestly, it's simply dreadful. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for… well, you know. Medicare. Really, I'm wasting my time, and I’m sure yours as well. Are we nearly done? I have a luncheon to attend, and I’m terribly late already.
DOCTOR: We’re not wasting time at all, Candice. We're just gathering information. It sounds like the damp weather definitely plays a role, and mornings are often the worst. Do you notice anything that helps relieve the discomfort?
PATIENT: Helps? Well… nothing really. A hot bath, perhaps. But that only provides temporary relief. And my husband makes me take those little white pills… I can’t recall the name. Something with a ‘T’ in it? They don’t do much, honestly. He insists they’re important. I mostly just try to ignore it. Honestly, fussing over every little ache and pain is simply dreadful. It makes one feel even older, you know? .
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Candice. It sounds like you've been managing this for a while. Let’s see if we can figure out what those pills are. Do you happen to know the dosage, or perhaps what they're for specifically – like for pain, or inflammation?
