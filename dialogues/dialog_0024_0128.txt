DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Hmm... what does bring me in? It's my joints, I think. They get really stiff in the mornings. It’s… uncomfortable. I don't remember exactly when it started, just that it’s been happening for a while now. Not terrible, you know? Just… old. Everything feels old these days.
DOCTOR: “Old,” is it?
PATIENT: Yes, well… maybe not just old. It’s like… when I wake up, it takes a bit to get moving. Like rusty hinges, you know? Then it loosens up a little. My hands mostly, and my knees. It’s… hard to explain. It doesn’t hurt all the time, just… stiff.
DOCTOR: “Rusty hinges.” Right. And this stiffness… is it worse after activity, or before activity, Ms. Voner?
PATIENT: Before, definitely before. Like I said, first thing in the morning. It’s… better after I’ve been up and moving for a while, doing things. Doesn’t mean it goes away completely, just… not as bad. I do a lot of walking with the little ones, you know, at the daycare. That seems to help. But getting started is the hardest part.
DOCTOR: And how long would you say this has been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. Honestly, Doctor, I can’t really say. A long time, I think. Months, definitely. Maybe even longer. It’s… a little fuzzy. Time just seems to go by so fast, you know? I don't remember a specific day or anything. It just… gradually got stiffer.
DOCTOR: “Gradually.” Very well. Have you noticed any swelling in these joints, Ms. Voner?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. My hands sometimes feel a bit… bigger, maybe? But I just figured that was because of the work. I’m always using them, you know, building things with the kids, holding hands, washing dishes… I don’t know if that’s swelling, or just… being hands.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are there any other symptoms accompanying this stiffness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No, not really. I get tired, of course, but who doesn’t? I’m… not getting any younger, you know? And sometimes my knees… feel a bit creaky, but that’s probably just old age again. I don't have any fever, or anything like that. Just… the stiffness.
DOCTOR: Do you have any family history of arthritis, or similar conditions, Ms. Voner?
PATIENT: Arthritis… hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… I think she had something with her hands, when she got older. Always complaining about them. But I don’t know exactly what it was. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about things like that much. And my father… he was a strong man, always working. He never complained about his joints, as far as I remember.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, Ms. Voner?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Not really. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache, if I need it. But that’s very rare. And I take vitamins, you know, to keep healthy. But that’s it. I don’t like taking a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: And finally, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I used to get hay fever when I was younger, but that’s gone now. But medications… no, I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you don't mind, Ms. Voner, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination of your joints. Just to get a better understanding of the situation. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. I’m not afraid, you know? Just… try not to hurt me too much!
DOCTOR: Very well. Please extend your arms, palms up. I’m going to check the range of motion in your wrists and fingers. And then we'll move on to your knees. Now, rotate your wrists clockwise… and counterclockwise. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: Oh… a little bit, Doctor. Not terrible, but… it feels tight. Like they're… stuck. Especially on the left side. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a discomfort. Like a little creak, you know? Like rusty hinges, again!
DOCTOR: Hmmm. “Mild discomfort with range of motion in both wrists, more pronounced on the left. Palpation elicits mild tenderness on the dorsal aspect of the left wrist.” Now, let's check your fingers. Can you make a fist, and then extend your fingers fully?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a bit stiff, Doctor. Especially this finger… It doesn't bend all the way. And it feels… bumpy. Not swollen, exactly, but… thicker. Like it’s been working too hard.
DOCTOR: "Decreased range of motion in the left middle finger. Palpable nodule at the distal interphalangeal joint. No significant erythema or warmth noted.” And now, if you’ll permit, let’s examine your knees. Please sit on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Whatever you need. Here. Just… be gentle, okay? They’re not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: "Mild crepitus noted with knee flexion and extension bilaterally. Palpation elicits mild tenderness over the medial joint line of both knees. No significant effusion noted. Range of motion slightly limited due to discomfort." Alright, Ms. Voner. Based on my examination, and your reported symptoms… it appears you are experiencing signs consistent with osteoarthritis. However, to confirm this diagnosis, and to rule out other potential causes, I would recommend obtaining some X-rays of your hands and knees. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Osteo… what was that now? Oh, it’s the old age thing, isn’t it? The… wearing out? That sounds… about right. X-rays… oh dear. Are they safe? I don’t like… radiation. But… if you think it’s best, Doctor, I suppose so. If it will help figure out what’s wrong. Yes. Okay, X-rays.
DOCTOR: They are quite safe, Ms. Voner. The radiation exposure is minimal. We will also need to take a full blood panel to determine the levels of inflammation in your body. In the meantime, to manage your symptoms, I recommend over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed, avoiding strenuous activity, and maintaining a healthy weight. We also can refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around your joints. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… that’s one of those pain pills, isn’t it? I don’t like taking pills, but… if it will help, I suppose. And no strenuous activity… that’s not a problem. The little ones don’t let me sit still anyway! Physical therapy… oh, dear. That sounds like… work. But… I suppose I could try it. If it will help my joints. Yes. Okay. Pills, no hard work, and… therapy.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will write you a prescription for the ibuprofen and a referral for physical therapy. And we will schedule the bloodwork and X-rays for you. It’s essential that you follow these recommendations, Ms. Voner. Delaying treatment can exacerbate the condition. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. No, not really. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t like waiting. And… is this something that will get worse? I don’t want to end up… crippled, you know? I need to be able to play with the little ones.
DOCTOR: The results should be available within approximately five to seven business days. As for your concerns regarding the progression of the condition… osteoarthritis is a degenerative process, meaning it can worsen over time. However, with proper management – including medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications – we can significantly slow the progression and maintain your quality of life. It’s unlikely, with proper care, that you will become “crippled,” as you put it. But it's essential that you follow the treatment plan diligently. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. “Slow it down” is good. I can manage slow. Thank you, Doctor. No, I think that’s all. Just… thank you for listening. And for not yelling at me for being old!
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment for when the results are available. She will also provide you with the prescription and referral information. Have a good day, Ms. Voner. .
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you again, Doctor.
