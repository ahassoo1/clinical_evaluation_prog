DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s… difficult to explain. I just feel… low. Very low, for some time now. I suppose that’s why I’m here. I’d like to get this sorted, if possible. I don’t have time for feeling sorry for myself.
DOCTOR: “Low,” alright. A lot of people say that. It’s vague, but we’ll try to pin it down. For how long have you been feeling this way, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Honestly, it’s hard to say precisely. Perhaps… six months? Maybe longer. Time does seem to slip away these days, you know? It hasn't been constant, but the bad days are becoming more frequent. It's interfering with things, and I hate interfering.
DOCTOR: Six months, give or take. Interfering with… what, exactly?
PATIENT: Well, my work, for one. I'm a lifeguard, you see – or I was, mostly. Ski patrol in the winter. Keeps me active, keeps me useful. But I've been calling in sick more often. Just… no energy. No enthusiasm. Even the thought of the beach… it doesn't appeal like it used to. And socializing… I've stopped making an effort with my friends, really. It's all a bit… much.
DOCTOR: A lifeguard?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. For many years. Still am, technically. Though… less frequently these days, as I said. It’s a seasonal job, you know? And demanding. Used to be exhilarating. Now… it just feels like a chore. I’ve always been a strong swimmer, very comfortable in the water. It’s… unsettling to feel this way about something I’ve always loved. Is that making sense? I don't usually talk about these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, physical activity... demanding. Okay. Now, has anything happened around the time this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a difficult question. Let me think. No, not really. My divorce was finalized about a year ago, but that was… difficult, certainly. But I’d thought I’d processed that. It wasn’t a particularly amicable split, but it’s done now. Nothing major, no. Just… a gradual decline, really. A feeling of… emptiness. I don’t know if that helps. Honestly, I’m not one for dwelling on things. It doesn’t solve anything, does it?
DOCTOR: Divorce a year ago… alright. And you say you’ve “processed it”?
PATIENT: Well, as much as one can, Doctor. It wasn’t a happy marriage towards the end. We grew apart. Lots of disagreements. I accepted it was over and moved on with my life, or tried to, anyway. I threw myself into my work, kept busy. But… perhaps that was a distraction, not a solution. It’s hard to say, isn’t it? I’m not a psychologist. I just know I haven’t been feeling… right. It's affecting my sleep, too, come to think of it. I wake up several times a night.
DOCTOR: Sleep disturbances… Okay. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I haven't lost a significant amount of weight, but I just don’t feel hungry very often. And… I’ve been more irritable, I suppose. Snapping at people, which isn't like me at all. My friends have noticed. They keep asking if I’m alright. I tell them I'm just tired, but… it’s more than that, isn’t it? I don’t know. It’s a general feeling of… malaise. Everything feels… heavier. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite, irritability… Alright. Do you have any trouble concentrating?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. That’s a good point. I find it hard to focus on things. Even reading, which I used to enjoy. My mind wanders. I have to reread the same sentences several times. And… remembering things isn’t as easy as it used to be. Small things, mostly. Where I put my keys, appointments… nothing serious, but it’s… frustrating. I used to have a very sharp memory. It’s… unsettling. I don't want to be becoming forgetful.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, concentration issues, some memory problems… Are you on any medications, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications regularly. Never have. I prefer to avoid them if possible. I believe in keeping my body as natural as possible. I take a multivitamin now and then, but that’s it. I used to be very strict with my diet, but my appetite… well, you know. I’m not even bothering with healthy eating anymore. It all feels… pointless. I do drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. And perhaps a little more than usual recently. But nothing excessive, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, occasional glass of wine. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to spend a lot of time outdoors, working as a lifeguard, and never had any issues with pollen or anything like that. I'm quite robust, usually. It’s just… this feeling. It’s so unlike me. I'm starting to worry. Is there anything… physically wrong, do you think?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam, then we’ll see. Could you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I suppose that’s a sensible thing to do. I haven't weighed myself in… oh, I don’t even remember when. Hopefully, it’s not too dreadful. I haven't been exercising as much lately, as you know.
DOCTOR: 78 kilograms. Alright. And your height is… 1.8 meters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct, Doctor. 1.8 meters. Or six feet, if you prefer. I used to be quite proud of my height, it was helpful for my work, you see. Reaching things, spotting people in the water… Now, it just feels… like another thing. Is something wrong? You seem… preoccupied. I don’t mean to rush you, but I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please do, Doctor. The sooner we get to the bottom of this, the better. I have a life to get back to, you see. Even if I don’t feel much like living it at the moment. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130/80. Heart sounds regular, lungs clear. Nothing remarkable there. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. I'm going to have a look in your ears and throat now. Open wide, please. Hmm. Throat looks fine. Ears seem clear too. Everything appears normal physically.
PATIENT: Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. But it doesn’t explain how I’m feeling, does it? I feel… empty. And tired. All the time. Is there anything else you can do? Perhaps some blood tests? I’m not one for leaving things to chance, you see. I want to know what’s going on. It’s frustrating to feel like something is wrong when everything appears to be right.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Blood tests are a reasonable idea. We’ll check your thyroid function, vitamin levels – especially B12 and D – and a complete blood count. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s good to rule things out. I'll order those now. It'll take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime… … try to get some rest. And perhaps try to engage in some light activity. Even a short walk can be helpful. It won’t solve everything, but it’s a start.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I suppose that’s something. Light activity… I’ll try. Though frankly, the thought doesn’t fill me with enthusiasm. When can I expect the results? I have commitments, you see. And I'd like to get this sorted as quickly as possible. I appreciate you taking the time, Doctor, but I'm growing impatient.
DOCTOR: The lab says three to five business days. I'll have my nurse call you with the results. Now, if there's nothing else… … I have other patients waiting. It's likely just stress, Mrs. Derasmo. Try not to worry too much. .
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Three to five business days. I shall await your call. And I’ll try, as you say, not to worry. Though frankly, I find that easier said than done. Thank you for your time. .
