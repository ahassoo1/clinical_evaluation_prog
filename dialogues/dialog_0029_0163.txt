DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you. Well, it's about a…rather enthusiastic dietary experiment I’ve been undertaking. I suppose “experiment” is putting it mildly, actually. It’s proving…challenging, and my daughter suggested I get a professional opinion before I do anything too foolish. She worries, you see. A very sensible girl.
DOCTOR: Sensible daughters are a blessing. And this "enthusiastic dietary experiment"... can you tell me a little more about what that entails?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s called the, ah, the “Sunfast Diet”. I read about it in a rather…colourful magazine at the newsagent. The core principle is only consuming food that can be grown directly in sunlight. Fruits, vegetables, certain grains… nothing processed, no meat, no dairy, no…well, a great many things, actually. It started rather well, I must confess. But now, three weeks in, I find I’m… lacking a certain oomph, if you will. And my energy levels are rather low. I thought, perhaps, a bit of professional guidance might be…advisable. It seemed a simpler option than arguing with my daughter further.
DOCTOR: I see. So, strictly fruits, vegetables, and grains – avoiding all animal products and processed foods. Three weeks in, you’re experiencing fatigue. Okay. Just to clarify, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it... my sleep has been rather disrupted. Not terribly, but fitful. And, if I’m honest, I’ve felt…a little colder than usual. I generally run quite warm, you see. And, ah, this may sound ridiculous, but my hands…they’ve been trembling slightly. Not constantly, but when I’m attempting delicate work. I still manage my animations, thankfully, but it does require a…greater degree of concentration. I hadn't considered mentioning the trembling, as it seemed so minor. But now that you ask…yes, there’s that as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, disrupted sleep, feeling colder than usual, and some hand tremors… I appreciate you sharing all of this. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Goodness. Straight to the point, aren't we? Well, yes, actually. A certain…lack of regularity, shall we say. It's been…somewhat unpredictable. And, if I'm perfectly candid, a little…difficult. Nothing alarming, mind you, but not as…smoothly functioning as it usually is. My daughter would be delighted to know I'm discussing such things with a doctor, I suspect. She’s always encouraged frankness.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re able to be open about these things, Mr. Vantine. That helps a great deal. And daughters do tend to encourage frankness, don’t they?
PATIENT: Indeed they do. A most discerning generation. Doctor, if I may ask, does this…sound as foolish as I fear? I'm rather proud of my work, you see. I’ve been animating for nearly sixty years now. I wouldn’t want to jeopardize that because of a…misguided dietary whim. It’s just…the concept appealed to me. A return to basics, a cleaner lifestyle. But perhaps I've been a little too enthusiastic.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, it’s not foolish to explore healthier lifestyles. However, the “Sunfast Diet,” as you describe it, is extremely restrictive and likely causing several nutritional deficiencies. Your symptoms – fatigue, disrupted sleep, feeling cold, tremors, and changes in bowel habits – all point to that. We need to get some blood work done to assess your vitamin and electrolyte levels. It's highly probable you're low in Vitamin B12, iron, and potentially other essential nutrients.
PATIENT: I suspected as much, to be honest. My daughter was quite adamant about it. Blood work, you say? Yes, of course. Whatever you deem necessary. I suppose I allowed the…romance of the idea to outweigh common sense. A failing of an old artist, perhaps. We do tend to be rather…lost in our own worlds. When would be a convenient time for this blood work, Doctor? And might I ask…how serious is this? I do have a project deadline approaching, you see. A rather important commission, actually.
DOCTOR: We'll get you scheduled for blood work right away. There's a lab just down the hall. It shouldn’t take long. As for how serious… it's not an immediate emergency, thankfully, but prolonged deficiencies can lead to more significant health problems – anemia, nerve damage, and weakened immunity, to name a few. Your deadline is important, but we need to address this now to prevent it from escalating. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, vitamin B12 levels, and iron studies. While we're waiting for the results, I strongly advise you to gradually reintroduce some variety into your diet, including lean proteins and dairy. We can discuss specific recommendations after we have the lab results. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Gradual reintroduction… yes, that sounds…sensible. No more extremes, I promise. I’ve clearly been a bit foolish. Lean proteins and dairy… my daughter will be thrilled. You know, she suggested a consultation with a nutritionist as well. Perhaps that wouldn't be a bad idea, after we've addressed the immediate concerns. I suppose she's right. A comprehensive approach is always best. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease considerably. Now, about this blood work… shall we proceed?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, let's get you over to the lab. And yes, a consultation with a registered dietitian would be an excellent idea. I can provide a referral once we have the results. It's good that you're taking this seriously, Mr. Vantine. It will make a big difference. Let's get this done, and we'll go from there. The nurse will be expecting you.
PATIENT: Excellent. Lead the way, Doctor. I must confess, I’ve always been rather proud of my constitution. To think a diet could…unravel it so quickly. Perhaps I should have consulted my daughter before embarking on this adventure. She does have a knack for practicality.
DOCTOR: It’s easy to get carried away with enthusiasm, but it’s good to recognize when adjustments are needed. And it’s always wise to listen to the sensible advice of daughters! The nurse inside will draw your blood. It shouldn’t take long, and we’ll have the results back in a few days. I'll have my assistant contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – particularly weakness, dizziness, or severe fatigue – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic immediately.
