DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Blim, is it? Yes, well... it’s a bit silly, really. I just... I need to know my blood type. It’s been a long time, you see. My husband… he always knew, for… things. And now… well, now I just don’t recall. It's important, I think.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nini, with all due respect, determining your blood type is… not typically the reason one schedules a comprehensive medical visit. However. We can accommodate. It's a simple test, though I must ask, is there a specific reason now after all this time, that you require this information?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no, you’re right, it is silly. I don't… I really don’t remember why now. Something about… a form? A new… something or other. Maybe for travel? I get so mixed up these days. It felt important, that’s all. My mind isn’t what it used to be, you understand. Everything feels a bit… blurry. It's probably nothing, really. But better safe than sorry, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Blurry,” you say. Hmm. Very well. We will proceed with a blood draw, then. However, while we are at it, it would be… prudent to conduct a standard review of systems. A general check-up, if you will. We can’t simply address one isolated concern without considering the whole picture. It’s… responsible medicine. Now, do you have any allergies to latex, or any issues with fainting during blood draws?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Yes, a check-up is good. I always mean to, but… time gets away from me. Allergies… let me think. No, I don’t think so. Nothing I’m aware of. And fainting… oh dear. Well, I did feel a bit faint once when I saw a particularly… large spider. But not from needles, no. I've had shots before, plenty of them. Not a problem, usually. Though, could you maybe… tell me when you're about to stick me? Just a little warning? I don't like surprises, you see.
DOCTOR: Very good. A fair request. We’ll certainly provide ample warning. Now, let's begin with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that's a hard one. Let me see… my husband always took care of those sorts of things, you understand. He kept all the papers. I… I think I had a bit of trouble with my water once, a long time ago. The doctor said it was just… something women get. But nothing serious. And my joints ache a bit, especially in the mornings. But I blame the weather, mostly. It’s been so damp lately. I don't think I have anything truly… serious, Doctor. Not that I know of, anyway. It's all so fuzzy, you see.
DOCTOR: “Fuzzy,” indeed. Very well. Let's move on. Any past surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. Now that's a good question. I… I think so. When I was quite young, I had my tonsils out. That was a long time ago, though. And… oh dear. My husband said something about… a stitch or two after I fell in the garden. But it was just a little scratch, really. Nothing to write home about. And I think I had a… something taken out, a little lump, years and years ago. But it was nothing important. He handled all of that, you see. He always said I didn't need to worry my pretty little head. Though he's gone now, of course.
DOCTOR: Right. And your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family… yes. Well, my mother… she lived to be a very old age, almost ninety. She had… a weak heart, I think. And my father… he was a strong man, a fisherman. He… died at sea, sadly. That was a long time ago. My brother… he had trouble with his breathing. Something with his lungs. And my sister… she was always very healthy, thankfully. But… honestly, Doctor, I don't remember much else. It was all so long ago, and we didn't talk about those things much. It felt… impolite, somehow. They all just… lived their lives, you see. A good, hard life, mostly.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Not a drop. My husband… he enjoyed a little sherry sometimes, after dinner. But I never cared for it. Made me feel quite dizzy. And smoking? Never. My mother always said it was a dreadful habit. And it always smelled so unpleasant. No, I've always been a very… sensible woman, Doctor. A cup of chamomile tea is quite enough for me, thank you very much. Though I do enjoy a little biscuit with it, now and then.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. That’s a tricky one. I don't think so, but… there was that time I had a reaction to… something the doctor gave me for a cold, years ago. It made me itch terribly, all over! But I don't remember what it was called. It was just a little pill, a pink one, I think. My husband took me to the doctor, and they gave me something else. It stopped the itching, thankfully. But I don’t remember the names of either of them. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is just… dreadful. It’s all a bit of a blur. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It’s… preferable to have a complete list, Mrs. Nini. We'll proceed cautiously, then. Now, before we move on to the physical examination, are there any medications you are currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… let me see. I take a little something for my… joints, you see. It's a small, white pill. I get it from the chemist. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take… something else. A little blue one. But I don’t take it very often. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good with names. My husband always took care of all that. He knew exactly what I needed, and when. Now I just… take what feels right. Is that alright? I really wish I could be more helpful. It's all so confusing these days.
DOCTOR: “Feels right,” you say. Hmm. Very well. We will need to ascertain exactly what you are taking. I will have the nurse draw a blood sample, as we discussed, and also ask you to bring in any bottles or packaging of the medications you mentioned. Now, before we begin the examination, is there anything else you feel I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s sensible, Doctor, yes. I'll try to find the bottles, though goodness knows where my husband kept them. He was such a tidy man… everything had its place. Oh… well, there is something. I’ve been feeling… a little dizzy sometimes, especially when I stand up quickly. And my hands… they tremble a bit. But I thought it was just old age. And… I’ve been forgetting things, of course. You've probably noticed. It's all a bit frightening, really. I just hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Dizziness and tremors. Noted. We'll assess those during the examination. Now, please lie back on the examination table. I will begin with your blood pressure and pulse. Please remain still, and breathe normally. This may be slightly uncomfortable, but it will be quick.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Just… try to be gentle, please? I'm not very good with… things. And… is it alright if I close my eyes? It makes me feel a little safer. I just hope everything is alright. It's all so very worrying, you know.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 78, regular. Lung sounds are clear. Heart sounds… within normal limits, though slightly diminished. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Reflexes are… diminished, but symmetrical. Some mild peripheral edema in both lower extremities. These findings are… not unexpected for a patient of your age. Now, please stand up slowly. We will check your gait and balance.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Oh dear… I am a bit wobbly, aren’t I? It’s worse when I stand up quickly, you see. Like everything… swirls around for a moment. I just hope I don’t fall. Is it… is it bad?
DOCTOR: Gait is slightly unsteady, with a tendency to veer to the left. Balance is… compromised. These findings suggest… possible neurological involvement, though further investigation is required. Now, I will need to draw a blood sample for a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. We will also need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. I am referring you to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation and to a cardiologist for an echocardiogram. It is important to address these issues promptly.
PATIENT: Oh… neurological? Cardiac? Goodness me… that sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it… is it something awful? I just… I just wanted to know my blood type! I feel… faint. What… what is happening?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nini, please remain calm. It is too early to determine the exact cause of your symptoms. These are simply precautionary measures. The neurologist will assess your neurological function, and the cardiologist will evaluate your heart health. It does not necessarily indicate a serious condition. The nurse will draw your blood now. I will have the results sent to my office, and we will schedule follow-up appointments as soon as possible. I understand this is unsettling, but it is best to be thorough. I believe that concludes our consultation for today. The nurse will explain the next steps.
PATIENT: .
