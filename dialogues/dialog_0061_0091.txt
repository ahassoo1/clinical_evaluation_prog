DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Bianca! It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, lately… I does be feelin’ very thirsty. All the time thirsty, you know? And hungry too. Even after I eat a good plate of food, I feel like I need more. It’s just… not normal for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You've been experiencing increased thirst and hunger, even after eating, and you say this isn't typical for you. That’s good you’re paying attention to changes in your body. When did you first start noticing this increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think now. It start… maybe about a month or so ago? Hard to say exactly. Things does blend together sometimes, you know? But I would say around a month. It wasn't bad at first, just a little bit more thirsty than usual. But now… it’s really bothering me. I does have to drink so much water, and still feel dry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been progressively worsening over the last month. That’s helpful to know. Besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me see… Well, I does be going to the bathroom more often, if that count. Especially at night! Waking up a few times to pee, which is not something I usually do. And… sometimes I feel a little tired, but I always feel a little tired these days, to be honest. Old age, you know? But I don't know if that's connected.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, increased urination, especially at night, and some fatigue. The increased urination is definitely something to pay attention to, along with the thirst and hunger. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision, like blurry sight?
PATIENT: Blurry sight? No, Doctor, not that I have noticed. My vision is… well, it's not what it used to be, but it hasn't gotten any worse lately. I does need my glasses, of course, but that’s the same as always. No sudden blurriness or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm… that's a good question. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, I does not have a scale. But my clothes… maybe a little looser? But I thought that was just me losing a little bit of weight, you know, trying to be healthy. It’s hard to say for sure. I haven't really tried to lose weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible unintentional weight loss, but you haven’t been actively trying to lose weight. That’s helpful information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I does not have any big sicknesses, as far as I know. The doctor at home, he checked me up a few years ago and said I was alright. My blood pressure, he said it was a little high sometimes, but he gave me some tea to drink for it. I drink that tea when I remember. Other than that, nothing. I does get aches and pains, like everyone else, but nothing special.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major medical diagnoses, some occasional high blood pressure managed with tea. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgery. And I've only been to the hospital one time, years and years ago, when I broke my wrist falling off a stool. But that was a long time ago. It healed up fine. Just the wrist, nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations other than the wrist fracture. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. My mother, she had the sugar sickness, diabetes, they called it. And my brother, he had problems with his heart. Other than them, everyone else was pretty healthy, as far as I know. But my mother, she had the sugar sickness for a long time. It made her very sick towards the end.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes in your mother and heart problems in your brother. That’s good to know. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Well, I take that tea for my blood pressure, like I said. And sometimes, when my joints bother me, I take some paracetamol. The regular kind, you know? Nothing special. That’s about it. I does not like taking a lot of pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tea for blood pressure and paracetamol as needed. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I does not have any allergies that I know of. I does eat anything, and I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. I does eat a lot of spicy food, and that sometimes bothers me, but that’s not an allergy, just my stomach!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Bianca, thank you for sharing all of that with me. To get a better picture of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and check your blood sugar. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just tell me what I need to do. I want to figure out what's going on with all this thirst and hunger.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit up here for me, that would be wonderful. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll check your blood pressure again, and I'll take a quick look in your ears and throat. After that, we'll do a simple blood sugar test with a finger prick. Breathe in… and out… nice and deep… Everything sounds clear so far. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 140/90. It's not drastically high, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your throat looks clear, and your ears are also fine. Now for the quick blood sugar check. This might sting just a little.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That’s alright. A little sting is no problem. My mother used to say a little pain is good for you! Just let me know when you're ready. I'm ready when you are. I just hope it's nothing too serious. This thirst is really botherin' me.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's see what your blood sugar is… Hmm… Your blood sugar is quite high at 220. A normal reading would be under 100, especially if you haven’t eaten recently. This, combined with your increased thirst and frequent urination, makes me suspect you may have diabetes. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but we definitely need to do some further testing to confirm this. I’m going to order a fasting blood sugar test and an HbA1c test. The HbA1c test will give us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. Would you be able to get to the lab tomorrow morning for these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Diabetes? My mother had that… That does not sound good. So, you think that’s what this is? All the thirst and the pee… Tomorrow morning… yes, I can go to the lab tomorrow morning. I’ll have to ask my husband to drive me. What exactly does this test do? And what happens if… if it is diabetes? What do I need to do? I'm a little scared now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be scared, Bianca. We're not making a definite diagnosis yet, just looking for more information. The fasting blood sugar test requires you to not eat or drink anything for eight hours before the test, and then we'll check your blood sugar levels. The HbA1c test doesn't require fasting. If it is diabetes, it means your body isn't properly regulating your blood sugar. We can manage it with lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – and possibly medication. It’s very important to control your blood sugar to prevent complications like heart disease, kidney problems, and nerve damage. I'm going to write you a referral to the lab, and I'll also give you some information about diabetes to read. I also want to start you on a simple diet plan. Try to avoid sugary drinks and processed foods, and focus on eating whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water, but don’t overdo it. If you start feeling very weak, dizzy, or confused, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Plenty of water, but not too much… Okay, I can do that. Whole grains and fruits… That sounds alright. I do like my mangoes! And my husband, he drives, so getting to the lab shouldn’t be a problem. What about the tea? Should I stop drinking the tea for my blood pressure now? And… what if I need to take pills? I don't like taking pills, Doctor. Is there anything else I can do besides pills?
DOCTOR: That’s good you like mangoes, just try to have them in moderation! As for the tea, let’s hold off on that for now until we get the results of your blood tests. Some herbal teas can affect blood sugar levels, and we want to get an accurate reading. Regarding pills, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Many people with diabetes can manage their condition with diet and exercise alone. If medication is necessary, there are many different options available, and we’ll find one that’s right for you. Lifestyle changes are often the most important step. We can also refer you to a diabetes educator who can teach you more about managing your diet, exercise, and blood sugar levels. For now, let’s focus on getting those blood tests done. I'm also going to give you a handout about the symptoms of high and low blood sugar, so you know what to watch out for. Do you feel comfortable with this plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I think I can manage that. The blood tests, no tea, no pills for now… and watch for the symptoms. A diabetes educator sounds good too. Someone to teach me what to eat and what to do… That would be very helpful. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. I was very scared at first, but I feel a little bit better now. Knowing what to do… that makes a big difference. I will get to the lab tomorrow morning with my husband. Is there anything else I need to do? Or can I go now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bianca. I'm glad I could help ease some of your worries. Knowing what to expect can definitely make a difference. No, I don't think there’s anything else for you to do right now. I’ve given you everything you need to get started. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Take care, Bianca, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
