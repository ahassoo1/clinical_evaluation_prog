DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s rather unpleasant, truthfully. It's…a bit of a problem in my mouth. A white coating, you see. Quite bothersome. I'd like to get it sorted out quickly, if possible. I haven't much time to be wasting.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schieber. A white coating in the mouth can certainly be uncomfortable. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the coating in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? Honestly, it looks white. Like…milk, perhaps, but not smooth. More…patchy. It’s mostly on my tongue, I think, and it makes it difficult to taste things properly. I don’t really see what further “detail” you require. It’s white, it’s on my tongue, and it’s annoying. Is that sufficient? I assure you, I'm not a doctor; I just tell you what it looks like.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schieber. I apologize if my question was unclear. I simply want to gather as much information as possible to determine the best course of action. "Patchy" is helpful. And you mentioned difficulty tasting things – has this come on suddenly, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I suppose. It didn’t appear overnight. Maybe…a week or two ago, the taste started to diminish. At first, I didn't pay it much mind. One doesn’t dwell on such minor inconveniences. But then this…this coating appeared, and it’s become quite distracting. Really, I don't understand how something so simple can be so…troublesome. I eat a perfectly balanced diet, you know. It's not as if I'm neglecting my health.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Schieber. A balanced diet is excellent. And it’s good you’ve noticed it's been a gradual change. Now, aside from the white coating and the diminished taste, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. No…no pain, exactly. Though sometimes my mouth feels…a little raw. Not burning, just…sensitive. And perhaps a bit of discomfort when I eat very acidic things, like oranges. But that's hardly a symptom, is it? I mean, oranges are acidic. Surely everyone feels that. I haven’t been ill recently, if that’s what you’re asking. Just…this. This irritating patchiness.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Sensitivity and discomfort with acidic foods are relevant details. Now, I’d like to take a look inside your mouth, if that’s alright with you. It will just be a quick examination.
PATIENT: An examination. Of course. The sooner this is over, the better. Honestly, I haven’t got all day. I have…commitments. Yes. Commitments. Just be quick about it, please. I trust you know what you're doing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. I'll be as quick as possible. Please just relax and open wide for me. I see the white coating you described, primarily on your tongue. It doesn’t appear to be causing any significant inflammation or ulceration at this time. I don’t see any other obvious abnormalities. It looks a bit like what we call oral thrush, though we’ll need to rule out other possibilities. Now, have you ever used any inhaled steroids, like for asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Inhaled steroids? Good heavens, no! I’m perfectly healthy, as I said. I've never had any lung problems. Never. I’m a faller, you see. We're rather robust individuals. A little fresh air is all one needs. It's…unlikely I’d be prescribed such things. Are you suggesting I look unwell?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Schieber. I simply ask because inhaled steroids can sometimes predispose people to oral thrush. It’s just a standard question to rule out potential causes. Now, do you wear dentures?
PATIENT: Dentures? Absolutely not! I have all my own teeth, thank you very much. And they are quite strong, I assure you. I take very good care of my hygiene. This…this thrush, as you call it, must be some sort of…random occurrence. It’s simply…inconvenient. I haven’t changed anything in my routine. Honestly, it’s rather frustrating. A man has commitments, you know. I can't be spending my time worrying about…patches in my mouth.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schieber. Now, thinking about your diet, do you consume a lot of sugary foods or drinks?
PATIENT: Sugary foods? Well… I do enjoy a little sweetness with my coffee, perhaps. And a small biscuit now and then. But nothing excessive! I'm not a child. It’s a civilized habit, that’s all. Surely a little sugar won't cause this…this affliction. I eat plenty of vegetables and lean proteins. A balanced diet, as I mentioned before. You seem to be implying I have poor habits, Doctor. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Schieber. I am simply gathering information to determine the most likely cause. A little sugar is unlikely to be the sole cause. Now, let's consider other factors. Have you experienced any recent stress or anxiety?
PATIENT: Stress? Anxiety? Good heavens, no! I am a faller! We deal with precarious situations daily! Stress is… irrelevant. I am perfectly calm and collected. I manage my affairs efficiently and effectively. Honestly, this line of questioning is… unnecessary. You are delving into personal matters. I came here for a medical assessment, not a…psychological evaluation. Perhaps you should focus on the mouth, Doctor, and less on my emotional state.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to express your concern, Mr. Schieber. I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. Let's return to the medical aspects. Given your history and the examination findings, I suspect this may be a case of oral thrush, despite the lack of typical risk factors. However, to be certain, I'd like to perform a quick swab of the affected area to send to the lab for analysis. This will rule out other potential causes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A swab? Another…procedure? Honestly, this is becoming quite tedious. But… fine. If it will expedite matters, I suppose. Just… be quick about it. And please explain the process beforehand. I dislike surprises. I trust it won't be… painful?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. It's a very quick and simple procedure. I’ll use a small cotton swab to gently collect a sample from the white coating on your tongue. It shouldn't cause any pain or discomfort, perhaps a slight tickling sensation. It will only take a moment. Alright, that’s done. We should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining excellent oral hygiene – brushing your teeth twice a day and rinsing your mouth with warm salt water. I'll also prescribe an anti-fungal mouthwash, just in case it is thrush, to start treatment while we await the results. Would you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I have no allergies. I am perfectly robust, as I said before. But an anti-fungal mouthwash…will it taste unpleasant? I have… commitments, you know. I can’t be walking around with a foul taste in my mouth. I suppose I have no choice. Just… ensure it’s not too potent. And please write the instructions clearly. I am a busy man, and I haven’t time for complicated regimens.
DOCTOR: I'll prescribe a mild anti-fungal mouthwash, Mr. Schieber. The taste is slightly minty, but not overly strong. The instructions are quite simple – rinse your mouth with 15 milliliters of the mouthwash twice a day for seven days. I’ll print out a detailed information sheet for you. While we await the results, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as pain, difficulty swallowing, or fever – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, I do not. I believe that is all. I trust this matter will be resolved quickly. I have commitments, you know. Thank you, Doctor. Let's hope this mouthwash works. Good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schieber. I hope it does as well. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you are able to attend to your commitments.
