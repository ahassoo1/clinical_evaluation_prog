DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s about my legs. They just… gave out, practically. After a nasty cold, of course. Not that a little sniffle should do this to a person. It’s quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: "A little sniffle," you say. Right. And when did these legs of yours decide to…give out?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It was… Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday morning. I was getting ready for a tour – I’m a guide, you know – and just… whoosh. Like jelly. I had to sit right down. It wasn’t instant, exactly, but it was fast. Very fast. And it’s both legs, Doctor, not just one. It’s quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Bilateral… yes. And how long did this weakness last on Tuesday?
PATIENT: Oh, it didn’t last as such. It happened, and then it… eased up. Not completely, mind you. I managed to get through the tour, but I was very careful. I had to lean on a few people, which I hate doing. It’s just… been getting worse since then. Every day a little bit more wobbly. I wouldn't say severe, but... disruptive. It's not something one expects, is it?
DOCTOR: Disruptive, alright. And have you noticed anything else accompanying this weakness?
PATIENT: Accompanying it? Well… yes, actually. My feet feel a bit… tingly. Not constantly, but on and off. And I’ve been rather tired, though that could just be the stress of having to constantly worry about falling over. I do pride myself on my professionalism, you know. One doesn't want to be a burden on one's clients. Though, honestly, some of them are rather demanding. But that's beside the point. The tingling is mostly in my toes, and it’s worse at night. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Tingling… worse at night. Alright. And have you had any back pain, Ms. Firestone?
PATIENT: Back pain? No, not really. A little stiffness sometimes, but nothing that a bit of stretching doesn't fix. I used to be quite the dancer, you know. Still am, when my legs cooperate. But no, no pain. It's all in the legs, mostly. And this… odd feeling. Like they don't quite belong to me. It’s hard to explain. I’m generally very grounded, you understand. Very practical. This is all rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a question. Well… no. Not that I’ve noticed. Everything seems… normal, if you must know. I really don’t see what that has to do with my legs, Doctor. It feels like you're asking very… personal questions. And frankly, it's a little insulting to suggest there's a connection. I’m a respectable woman, you know. This is about my legs, not… that.
DOCTOR: Right. Of course. Just routine, Ms. Firestone. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor, I am a very healthy woman. I eat well, I exercise when I can, and I certainly don't spend my days indulging in unhealthy habits. I have Medicare, you know, they keep a close eye on things. Nothing major. A bit of arthritis in my hands, but that's just age. And a touch of the flu now and then, but who doesn’t get the flu? No, nothing serious. Really. I'm quite robust, generally. It's just… this. This leg weakness. It’s very inconvenient, you understand. I have tours booked. Important tours.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications currently, no known allergies. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she had… well, she had a bit of trouble with her memory towards the end. Nothing definitive, just… forgetfulness. And my father, he was a strong man, but he had high blood pressure, I think. He didn’t take care of himself. Always working. But no, no history of anything like… leg problems. Or anything debilitating, really. We're a generally hardy bunch, my family. That’s why this is so… baffling. It simply doesn’t fit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want me to stand? After all these questions? Very well. But be careful, Doctor. I might need a hand. And please, don't expect miracles. It's not as easy as it looks, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, just take your time. Let’s see… can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: See? It’s not graceful, is it? It's like… walking on jelly. And it feels… precarious. I’m trying, Doctor, truly I am. But it's quite frightening, actually. I feel like I'm going to fall. Perhaps you should stand closer, just in case. It’s rather undignified, you know, collapsing in the middle of the examination room.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just… slow and steady. I’m right here. Now, can you try standing on your toes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Absolutely not. It’s quite impossible, Doctor. It feels like my legs will simply give out. I’m telling you, it’s like they’re not my own. It's incredibly disconcerting. And frankly, I'm starting to feel rather lightheaded. Perhaps we should sit down before I do collapse. This is all very… dramatic. And not in a good way. I pride myself on my composure, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, just sit right there. No need to push yourself. Ms. Firestone, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it's difficult to say definitively what's going on. There are a number of possibilities. It could be something neurological, a muscle issue, or even related to circulation. We need to rule out some things. I'm going to order a blood test to check for vitamin deficiencies and inflammation. And I want you to get an MRI of your spine to rule out any nerve compression.
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh, goodness. I don't like the sound of that at all. Is it… dangerous? And what about the blood test? Will it take long? I have tours, you know. Important tours. I can't just disappear for days while you run tests. This is all very inconvenient, Doctor. Very inconvenient indeed. And what if it's something serious? Will I have to… stop guiding altogether? I simply can't imagine.
DOCTOR: The MRI is not dangerous, Ms. Firestone. It’s a painless imaging test. It will take about 30-45 minutes, and you can go home afterward. As for the blood test, it’s just a routine check, and the results should be back within a few days. As for your guiding… we don’t know what’s going on yet. Let’s get the tests done first, then we can discuss options. I'm going to refer you to a neurologist for a proper assessment. They’ll be able to provide a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. I understand your concerns, but we need to rule out serious possibilities first. It’s better to be safe than sorry, wouldn’t you agree?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. And what if they tell me I can’t guide anymore? I’ve been doing this for years! It’s my livelihood, Doctor. It’s who I am! Very well. I suppose I have no choice. But please, make sure it's a good neurologist. Someone who understands the importance of… a person’s career. And can we schedule these tests as soon as possible? I have a tour booked for next week, and I absolutely must be able to… at least try to make it. This is all very stressful, Doctor. Very stressful indeed. And frankly, I’m not sure I’m up to dealing with all of this.
DOCTOR: I’ve referred you to Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s highly recommended and understands the importance of a patient’s lifestyle. I’ll have the nurse schedule the MRI and blood test for you as soon as possible. She will call you with available appointments. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid strenuous activity and, if possible, arrange for assistance with your tours. I'm also going to prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant to help manage any discomfort. I understand your anxiety, Ms. Firestone. But we need to gather information before we can determine the best course of action. Please try to remain calm and follow the recommendations. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma… I suppose that’s something. And the muscle relaxant… will it make me drowsy? I absolutely cannot afford to be sleepy on a tour. It would be a disaster. And what about the results? How long will it take to get them? Will you call me personally with the results, or will I have to… wait on hold for hours? Honestly, Doctor, this is all very overwhelming. I just want to go back to normal. I want to be able to guide my tours without worrying about collapsing. Is that too much to ask? And one more thing… is there anything, anything I can do right now to make my legs feel better? Just something to tide me over until the tests are done?
DOCTOR: The muscle relaxant has a mild sedative effect, but it shouldn’t make you significantly drowsy. If you experience any excessive sleepiness, please avoid operating machinery or driving. As for the results, it typically takes a few days for the lab to process the blood work, and the MRI results will take a bit longer. My nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. I will review them with you personally at that appointment. In the meantime, I recommend you rest as much as possible, avoid strenuous activity, and use a cane or walker for support if needed. You can also try applying ice packs to your legs for 15-20 minutes at a time to help reduce any inflammation. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, may also provide some relief. Unfortunately, there’s no quick fix for this. We need to identify the underlying cause before we can implement a proper treatment plan. Try to remain optimistic, Ms. Firestone. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Optimistic? Doctor, that's easier said than done. My livelihood is at stake! And frankly, I'm not sure I can afford to be laid up for weeks while you run tests. I have responsibilities, you know. I have tours to guide. Is there anything you can do to expedite the process? Perhaps a specialist who can see me immediately? Or a more advanced imaging test? I'm willing to pay extra, whatever it takes. Just please, tell me there's something you can do to speed things up. And one last thing… will Medicare cover all of this? I don’t want to be stuck with a massive bill on top of everything else.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone. Unfortunately, I cannot expedite the testing process. The labs and imaging centers operate on a schedule, and we need to follow proper protocols to ensure accurate results. I can submit a pre-authorization request to Medicare to determine coverage for the MRI and neurological consultation. However, there’s no guarantee that it will be approved. As for a specialist who can see you immediately… that’s unlikely, given the current demand. I can check with Dr. Sharma’s office to see if they have any cancellations, but I cannot promise anything. In the meantime, I recommend you contact Medicare directly to inquire about coverage options and potential costs. I understand your anxiety, Ms. Firestone. But we need to remain realistic. We've done everything we can at this point. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Realistic… that’s what everyone says. But what if “realistic” means losing my job? What if it means I can’t provide for myself? Honestly, Doctor, I feel like you’re dismissing my concerns. You’re telling me to be patient, to contact Medicare, to wait for cancellations… But you don’t understand! This is my life! My livelihood! I suppose… there’s nothing else you can do. Just… please, try to get me an appointment with Dr. Sharma as soon as possible. And I’ll contact Medicare. But honestly, I don’t have much hope. No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will be in touch with you shortly to schedule the appointment. I wish you all the best, Ms. Firestone. .
