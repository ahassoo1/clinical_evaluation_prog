DOCTOR: Right. Odell Tayar, 22 years old… So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh… travel. I need… something for travel. My wife… she wanted to go. But… things happened. Now I go. Alone. I need… shots? Or… a paper? For going.
DOCTOR: “Shots or a paper…” Right. Look, son, that's… incredibly vague. Are you talking about vaccinations?
PATIENT: Vaccina… what now? Is that like… a thing you put in your arm? My wife, she always knew these things. Where are we going, even? Nepal. Back to Nepal. But… I don’t remember what she got. Before… Just… what do people need to go back home?
DOCTOR: Nepal… Okay, okay. Look, traveling to Nepal, you might need Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and depending on where in Nepal you’re going, possibly Yellow Fever. And definitely a Tetanus booster if it’s been more than ten years. Do you have any records of vaccinations at all?
PATIENT: Records? No. Not… here. Everything is… back there. With… her. And it’s been a while. A long while. I don’t even know when I got anything. Is Yellow Fever… bad? I don't want to be sick.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s not ideal, alright?
PATIENT: Ideal? What is… ideal? I just need to go. I told my… everyone. I have to go. Is… is it okay if I don't know these… things? Will I get in trouble?
DOCTOR: Trouble with who?
PATIENT: The… airport? The people at the airport. I don’t know. They ask questions, right? About… papers and… things. I just don’t want them to tell me I can’t go. I promised. It's important.
DOCTOR: Look, the requirements can change. It's best to be prepared. We can do some basic blood tests to see if you have immunity to some of these things. It's not a guarantee, but it's a start. It'll take a couple of hours for the results. And frankly, you should get a travel consultation with someone who specializes in this. I’m an Internal Medicine doctor, not a travel specialist. Are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Allergic? Not that I know of. My wife… she always took care of that. I eat everything. Spicy food… sometimes makes me sweat. But that’s not an allergy, right? Blood tests… okay. But I need to go soon. Very soon.
DOCTOR: Fine. We'll draw some blood. But I’m telling you, this isn't enough. You really should see a travel doctor. It’s irresponsible to go to a place like Nepal without being properly vaccinated. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? No! I work. I build… airplane parts. I’m strong. Just… tired sometimes. Everyone is tired, right? Is that a condition? I don’t get sick. Well… not usually.
DOCTOR: Right. No known medical conditions. Look, I'm going to order these blood tests. While we wait, let’s just do a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, heart rate, lungs… just the basics. It’ll take five minutes. Have a seat.
PATIENT: Okay. But… will it take long? I have to… things. Airplane parts don’t build themselves.
DOCTOR: It won't. Blood pressure first. Just relax. 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not concerning. Lungs are clear. Heart rate is… 78. Regular. Reflexes are normal. Alright. Nothing glaringly obvious. Now, let’s get that blood drawn. Nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: Okay. Nurse? Will she… poke me a lot? I don’t like needles. My wife… she always held my hand. It hurts, right?
DOCTOR: Look, it's a small prick. It’ll be over before you know it. And frankly, worrying about a tiny needle is… well, it’s not the most pressing concern when you're traveling to Nepal. The nurse is very good. She'll be gentle. I'm going to step out for a moment to review some travel guidelines. Don't leave. Don't. Leave.
