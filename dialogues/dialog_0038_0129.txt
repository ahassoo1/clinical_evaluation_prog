DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. I'm Neeraj Auelua, it's lovely to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Lovely to meet you too, I suppose. Look, I don’t have all day, so let's get right to it. It's my…well, it's my stool. It's black. And I take pills, you know, for the aches. Been taking 'em for years. That's all there is to it, really. Is that enough information, or do you need a whole life story?
DOCTOR: Okay, black stool, and you take pills for aches, years now. That is a good start, thank you. It's good you mentioned the pills – that’s important. Just to clarify, when you say black, is it like…tarry and sticky, or more just dark in colour?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Sticky. Yes, sticky and…well, you know. Like tar. Not pleasant at all. I don’t need a detailed description, doctor. I know what it looks like. It's not like I'm enjoying talking about this. And it’s been happening…oh, a few times now. Not every day, thankfully. Is this going to take long? My husband's expecting me back for lunch.
DOCTOR: Right, sticky and tarry, a few times now. Okay. Thank you for telling me. It’s perfectly alright if it’s not pleasant to talk about – we just need to gather some information. The fact that it’s sticky is important, Dawnetta. It can indicate bleeding in the upper part of your digestive system. Now, I need to ask some more questions to get a better idea of what might be going on. Firstly, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel movements, like diarrhoea or constipation?
PATIENT: Constipation, sometimes. Happens when I'm not drinking enough water, I suppose. I try to keep on top of it. And honestly, at my age, things aren’t always…regular. Diarrhoea? Not really. Though I did feel a bit…off yesterday. Just a little unsettled, you know? Not enough to bother mentioning, I thought. Honestly, doctor, is this always how it is? So many questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, some constipation, but generally okay, and you felt a little unsettled yesterday. That’s helpful. It's good you mention things even if they don't seem important – those little details can sometimes be very telling. Now, you mentioned taking pills for aches for years. Could you tell me what kind of pills they are?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. It's just ibuprofen. You know, the over-the-counter stuff. Been taking it for my knees, my back…everything aches at my age, honestly. I take…let me think…usually two or three a day. Sometimes more if it’s particularly bad. I don't really keep track. Is ibuprofen a problem? My friend Elsie takes it all the time and she's perfectly fine. Though Elsie is a bit…robust, if you know what I mean. A bit bigger than me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen, two or three a day, sometimes more. And you've been taking it for quite some time. It's good you mentioned how long. Ibuprofen can be a problem, Dawnetta, especially with long-term use. It can sometimes cause irritation in the stomach and intestines, and it can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if you're taking it regularly. Elsie’s situation is unique to her, and her weight and overall health play a role. Now, have you ever had any issues with stomach ulcers or bleeding before?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Goodness no. Never. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. I’ve always been able to eat anything, really. Though I did have a bit of indigestion sometimes, but everyone gets that, don't they? And bleeding…well, nothing serious. Just the occasional nosebleed, if I’m run down. Honestly, I don't see what any of this has to do with my stool. Is it going to take much longer? My husband makes a lovely potato salad, and I’d hate to miss it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no ulcers, no serious bleeding, just the occasional nosebleed and some indigestion. That’s good information. You’re right to ask what it all has to do with your stool, Dawnetta. Ibuprofen can irritate the stomach lining and cause bleeding, even without causing a full ulcer. This bleeding can then cause the stool to appear black and tarry, like you described. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your stomach and check your overall health. And I’d like to order a simple stool test to check for blood. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. A test? Really? I suppose…if you insist. I’d rather not, honestly. All this poking and prodding. But fine. Get it over with. And don’t take too long, doctor. My husband will be wondering where I am. Honestly, I haven't got all day to spend in a doctor’s office. I have better things to do, you know. Like enjoying a potato salad.
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Dawnetta, and I'll be as quick as possible. The exam will be very brief – just listening to your stomach with a stethoscope and feeling your abdomen. It won't be uncomfortable. Okay, if you could just lie back for me, please. I'm just going to listen to your stomach sounds…Take a deep breath for me…and another…Good. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I'm just going to gently feel your abdomen. Does this cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Though it's a bit…cold. Honestly, doctor, you could warm your hands first. And are you quite sure this is necessary? It all seems a bit…frivolous, if you ask me. I've lived a long life without all this poking and prodding. A bit of black stool isn’t going to kill me. But fine. Get it over with. Honestly, you’re taking up a lot of my time.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Dawnetta. While a bit of black stool may not necessarily be life-threatening, it's important to rule out any underlying causes, particularly given your long-term ibuprofen use. It's better to be cautious and ensure everything is alright. Okay, everything feels normal to the touch. I’m going to order that stool test now. The nurse will give you a collection kit and instructions on how to collect the sample. It’s very straightforward. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I would like you to stop taking the ibuprofen, if possible. Do you have any other medications you're taking?
PATIENT: Stop taking the ibuprofen? What am I supposed to take for the aches then? Honestly, that's just ridiculous. I need something for the pain, doctor. I can't just…not take anything. Elsie takes paracetamol. Would that be alright? And no, that’s it. Just the ibuprofen. Honestly, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. I really think I’m wasting my time here. Is that it then? Can I go now? My potato salad is getting cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ll discuss some alternatives to ibuprofen. Paracetamol is a reasonable option for mild to moderate pain, and it’s less likely to cause stomach irritation. However, it’s important not to exceed the recommended daily dose. We can talk about that in more detail. Given your long-term ibuprofen use and the recent black stools, I would like to be cautious. While the stool test will give us more information, it’s best to be thorough. I'm also going to recommend a simple blood test to check your iron levels, as bleeding can cause anaemia. Would you be willing to do that as well?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Another test? Honestly, doctor, you're going to drain all my blood! I feel like a pin cushion already. Fine. Yes. Whatever. Do the blood test. Get it over with. But if I faint, it’s on your head. Honestly, this is a complete waste of a lovely afternoon. And you’d better have the results quickly. My husband will be furious if I’m not back for dinner. Just get it done. And please, no more poking and prodding. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. The nurse will arrange the blood test for you now. It will only take a few minutes. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. But it’s important to be thorough and rule out any potential problems. We'll get the results back to you as quickly as possible. In the meantime, stop taking the ibuprofen, and try to take things easy. If you experience any dizziness, weakness, or significant abdominal pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
