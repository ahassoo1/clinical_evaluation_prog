DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Though I must say, this…establishment is rather small, isn’t it? My wife, bless her soul, insisted I come. Something about…a bit of a discharge. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea what she was going on about. Old age, you know. Things…leak. Is that what she meant? It’s terribly embarrassing, having to discuss such things.
DOCTOR: It is perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. These things happen, and it’s very common as we get older. It takes courage to come in and talk about these issues, so thank you for coming in today. When your wife says “discharge,” she likely means some fluid coming from your body. To understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Fluid, you say? Well, it's…damp. And occasionally…a bit sticky. It’s not constant, mind you. Mostly after…well, after using the facilities. Though I can’t say for certain when it started. My memory isn’t what it once was. My wife keeps a very tidy home, you see, and she noticed it on the…linens. A most undignified situation. Honestly, I’ve been tinkering with tractors for sixty years; I’m accustomed to grease and oil, not…this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Krok. It sounds like you’re noticing a discharge after urination. And it’s good that your wife is observant. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the color and consistency of this fluid?
PATIENT: Color…hmm. Not bright, certainly. Not red. Perhaps…a sort of murky…beige? Like old tea, perhaps? And consistency…well, it’s not like water, no. Thicker. Not terribly thick, mind you, but…not water. A bit…slimy, perhaps? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a connoisseur of bodily fluids. It’s most unpleasant to contemplate. My wife should have just brought a sample. Much more efficient.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s unpleasant to think about, Mr. Krok, and I appreciate you sharing what you can. A murky beige color and a slightly slimy consistency… that gives me some information to work with. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Symptoms…well, now that you mention it, there has been a slight…burning sensation. Not agonizing, mind you, just…a little discomfort when…well, you know. And perhaps a bit of…hesitation. It takes a moment to…start. It didn’t used to be this way, of course. A man should be able to…perform without such…complications. And truthfully, my lower back has been aching a bit, though I attribute that to all the years bending over engines.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have a slight burning sensation during urination, some hesitation starting the stream, and some lower back pain. The back pain could be related to your work, as you mentioned, but it’s important to consider everything. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or pain in your abdomen or flank area?
PATIENT: Fever…no, I don’t believe so. My wife checks my temperature regularly, and she would have said something. Chills…perhaps a bit of a draft in the house last night, but nothing remarkable. And pain…not in my abdomen, no. My flank…where is my flank, exactly? Oh, you mean my sides? A bit of a twinge now and then, but I’ve always had a sensitive back. Old age, you know. Everything creaks and groans. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel rather foolish discussing all this. A man shouldn't have to explain such things.
DOCTOR: You're not foolish at all, Mr. Krok. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things, and I appreciate you answering my questions so thoroughly. Your flank area is your sides, just below your ribs. It’s good to hear you haven’t had any fever, but the twinge in your back is good information. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medical history…my wife handles all that, you see. She’s very organized. Let me think…high blood pressure, yes. She’s always nagging me to take those little pills. And…something about my cholesterol being high, I believe. Nothing serious, she assures me. She’s a very practical woman. Oh, and I had a bout of pneumonia years ago, when I was still running the farm. Nearly killed me, that did. But other than that…not much, I suppose. Mostly aches and pains. A man my age is bound to have a few complaints.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and a history of pneumonia. Do you know what medications you’re currently taking for your blood pressure and cholesterol?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the faintest idea! Little white pills, mostly. One in the morning, one at night. My wife fills those little pill organizers, you see. All neatly labeled. I just take them as instructed. I wouldn’t know the names if my life depended on it. I’m a mechanic, not a pharmacist! I fix tractors, I don’t memorize medication schedules. It's terribly inconvenient, having to keep track of such things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It’s perfectly alright. We can look up your medications in our system if you provide me with your date of birth and insurance information. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must warn you, my wife handles all the paperwork too. My date of birth is…August 14th, 1942. And my insurance is Medicare. Part B, I believe. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite a tedious affair. I came in for a bit of a leak, and now I’m reciting my medical history and insurance details. A man shouldn't have to endure such indignities.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. I see here you’re on Lisinopril for your blood pressure and Atorvastatin for your cholesterol. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…let me think…ah, yes! My appendix, when I was a boy. A terrible pain, it was. And…a hernia repair, many years ago. Something about lifting a particularly heavy engine block. That was quite painful too, I recall. Other than that…nothing. Though I’ve had my fair share of bumps and bruises tinkering with those machines.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendix removal and hernia repair. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family medical conditions…Now that’s a question. My father…he had a weak heart, I believe. Passed away rather young, it was. And my mother…she suffered from arthritis, terribly debilitating it was. Spent her last years in a wheelchair, poor woman. My brother…he had something with his lungs, I think. But honestly, Doctor, I wasn’t terribly interested in the details of their ailments. I was always more focused on mechanics and machinery.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. It’s good to know about the family history of heart problems, arthritis, and lung issues. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! I haven’t touched a cigarette in sixty years. My wife would have my hide. Drink…occasionally a glass of wine with dinner. A small glass, mind you. For medicinal purposes, you understand. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not! I'm a respectable man, Doctor. A farm equipment mechanic. I deal with grease and oil, not…that sort of thing. Honestly, the very suggestion is rather insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was insensitive, Mr. Krok. It was simply a routine part of the assessment. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your current symptoms. You mentioned a bit of burning during urination and some hesitation. Have you noticed any pain in your abdomen, lower back, or testicles?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it…there has been a dull ache in my lower back, as I said before. But the testicles…good heavens, no! Not a sharp pain, mind you, just a bit of…discomfort. A sort of heaviness. It’s not constant, thankfully. More noticeable after…well, after exertion. Lifting those engine blocks, you see. It’s probably just a strain. A man my age is bound to have a few aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache in your lower back and some discomfort/heaviness in your testicles, especially after exertion. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll just check your abdomen, back, and do a quick prostate exam. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it will help me determine the cause of your symptoms. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A…prostate exam? Good heavens, Doctor, is that absolutely necessary? It sounds…rather unpleasant. I came in for a bit of a leak, not…that. Can’t you just prescribe something? A little ointment, perhaps? I’m a very busy man, you know. I have tractors to fix. Surely a mechanic’s time is valuable. Honestly, this is becoming quite a distressing experience.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Krok. It's perfectly alright to be concerned. A prostate exam is a very important part of evaluating your symptoms, especially given your age and the symptoms you’re describing. It will help me rule out any serious conditions, such as an enlarged prostate or infection. It’s a quick procedure, and I’ll do my best to make you as comfortable as possible. It's a very common exam for men your age, and it provides important information. If we skip this step, we won’t be able to determine the cause of your symptoms accurately, and it could lead to more serious problems down the line. Would you prefer I explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But be quick about it. And gentle, please. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a man of simple pleasures. Tractors, a glass of wine with dinner, a tidy home…I don’t need complicated medical procedures. Explain it, then. But I warn you, I have a low tolerance for…indignities. And if it’s going to be terribly painful, I reserve the right to stop the examination.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I’ll explain everything clearly, and we’ll go at your pace. During the prostate exam, you’ll lie on your side with your knees bent. I’ll lubricate a gloved, finger and gently insert it into your rectum to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. It may feel a little uncomfortable, like a brief pressure, but it shouldn’t be terribly painful. I’ll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way, and you can stop me at any time if you’re feeling uncomfortable. It usually takes just a few seconds. It’s an important part of checking for any abnormalities and helping me determine the cause of your symptoms. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: A few seconds, you say? And you’re certain it won’t be…painful? Honestly, Doctor, the very thought is rather…distressing. And what exactly are you looking for? What abnormalities? Is it something serious? I don’t want to hear about anything serious. I just want to fix my tractors in peace. Perhaps a strong glass of wine afterwards would be in order.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krok. It’s natural to be anxious. Most of the time, the prostate feels normal. I'm looking for any changes in size, shape, or texture. A slightly enlarged prostate is common with age, and often doesn't cause any serious problems. I'm also checking for any tenderness or lumps, which could indicate an infection or, less commonly, something more serious. We’ll discuss any findings thoroughly, and I’ll explain all your options for treatment. I assure you, we’ll take things one step at a time. And yes, a strong glass of wine afterwards sounds like a good idea. But let’s get through the exam first. Would you like me to review the procedure one more time?
PATIENT: No, no. Enough with the explanations. Just…get it over with. Quickly, please. And gently. I have tractors to fix, you know. A man’s work is never done. But I warn you, if it’s too painful, I’m stopping. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. If you could lie on your side with your knees bent, we’ll get started. I will let you know each step as I go. Please, just relax as much as possible and let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time.
PATIENT: Just…hurry up, Doctor. And be gentle. Please. This is most undignified. And don’t say anything unless absolutely necessary. I don’t want to hear any medical jargon. Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I'm just going to gently insert this finger. It might feel a little cool at first. Just take a few deep breaths. Okay, I'm gently inserting it now. Just relax as much as possible. Okay, that’s all done. Alright, Mr. Krok. I was able to feel your prostate gland. It’s slightly enlarged, which is common for men your age. I didn’t feel any tenderness or lumps. However, it feels a bit firm. I’d like to order a PSA blood test to get a better understanding of what's going on. It will help rule out any infection or other problems. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A bit firm, you say? What does that mean? Is it serious? Is it…cancer? My brother…he had something with his lungs, I recall. Is this…the same thing? And a blood test? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming a nightmare. Can’t you just give me something for the…leak? A little ointment, perhaps? I just want to fix my tractors in peace. A man shouldn’t have to worry about all this…complication.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krok. It’s natural to be anxious when you hear the word “firm.” However, a slightly firm prostate doesn’t necessarily mean cancer. It can also be caused by inflammation, an enlarged prostate, or other non-cancerous conditions. The PSA blood test will help us determine the cause. It’s a simple blood draw, and it will give us more information. We are not jumping to any conclusions. The PSA test helps to understand if further investigation is necessary. We can discuss the results when they come back and decide the best course of action. As for the “leak,” as you call it, the PSA test will help us understand if it’s related to an infection or enlargement of the prostate. If it is, addressing the underlying cause will likely resolve the issue. I can prescribe an antibiotic as a precaution while we await the results, as inflammation can sometimes cause similar symptoms. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: An antibiotic…yes, perhaps. Anything to stop this…inconvenience. But I warn you, if it doesn’t work, I’m not subjecting myself to any more…prodding. A man has work to do. And if it is something serious…well, I don’t want to hear about it. Just…do what you have to do. But no promises about further tests or procedures. Understand? And please, Doctor, let’s keep this conversation as brief as possible. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Krok. I will order the antibiotic for a 7-day course. We will also order the PSA blood test. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. If your symptoms worsen before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. I want to assure you that we'll take things one step at a time and explore all available options. We are not jumping to any conclusions. I'll provide you with all the information you need to make informed decisions. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Just…get me out of here. And thank you for the…ointment. I just want to fix my tractors in peace. That is all.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I’ll have the nurse escort you out. Please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Krok. And hopefully, you’ll be back to fixing tractors soon.
