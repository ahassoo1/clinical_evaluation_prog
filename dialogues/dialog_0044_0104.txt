DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. It's a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time. My throat… it hurts. It’s been hurting for a few days now. Not sure why it hurts, just… does. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore throat for a few days. I understand you're short on time, we'll try to be efficient. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: More… what do you mean more? It hurts when I swallow. And… it feels scratchy. Like something is stuck. I don't know. It just is painful. I work with… machines. Big, important machines. I haven't got time for little pains.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it hurts primarily when you swallow, and you describe it as scratchy. And you work with machinery – good to know. Has anything made it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Well, talking, I suppose. Like now. And… dust. There's always dust at the factory. Everything gets dusty. I try to avoid it, but… it’s a factory. What kind of answer are you looking for? Honestly, this is taking too long.
DOCTOR: I apologize; I didn’t mean to pry unnecessarily. It’s just important to gather enough information. So, the pain is aggravated by talking and exposure to dust. Any fever, chills, or cough along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever…? I… I haven't checked. I don't get fevers. Chills… maybe a little cold sometimes, but that's just the air conditioning at work. And a cough? Not really. Just this… irritation. Is this important? I have things to do, Doctor. Important things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chills, just the irritation and sore throat. No significant cough. We'll proceed quickly. Let's take a quick look at your throat. Can you open wide and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Fine. Hurry it up, please.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your throat is quite red, and your tonsils are a bit swollen. There's no obvious pus or coating, which is good. I don't see anything immediately alarming. It looks like some inflammation, likely from irritation. Do you have any allergies, Tammie?
PATIENT: Allergies? I don’t do allergies. I work around metal and dust all day, I told you. If I had allergies, I wouldn’t be able to work. No. None. I don't have time for allergies either, honestly. Can we please be quick?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you're not currently taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: No. No medications. I don’t believe in them. Just… work. That's all. I need to get back to the factory. This is… frustrating. Is there anything you can give me to make it stop hurting? Quickly?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie. It sounds like you're very dedicated to your work. Given your symptoms and the fact that you don't have a fever or any other concerning signs, it’s likely a viral pharyngitis—a sore throat from a virus. Unfortunately, antibiotics won’t help with a virus. We can manage the symptoms. I can recommend some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and throat lozenges to soothe the irritation. Plenty of fluids are also important. Would you like me to write you a note recommending those?
PATIENT: A note…? Look, I don't need a note. I just want something to stop the pain. Those lozenges… are they strong? And… do I have to buy them? I don't have a lot of extra money. And what about ibuprofen? Will that make me… sleepy? I have to operate heavy machinery, Doctor. This is all very inconvenient. .
DOCTOR: Okay, let's address everything. The lozenges are available over-the-counter, and there are many different brands, some stronger than others. They're relatively inexpensive. Ibuprofen can cause drowsiness in some people, but it's not common. It's generally okay to take with your work, but please be cautious and stop taking it if you feel drowsy or lightheaded. Given your limited funds, I recommend starting with throat lozenges and plenty of warm fluids. If the pain worsens or doesn't improve after a few days, then consider the ibuprofen, being mindful of the potential for drowsiness. I can write a note for the lozenges, just in case you want to explore options at the pharmacy. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
