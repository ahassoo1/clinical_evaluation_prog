DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am here today regarding a matter at my place of work, concerning the requirements for wearing masks and other protective gear. It’s… a bit difficult for me, and I’m hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption.
DOCTOR: An exemption, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. To be more specific, I’ve been having some trouble tolerating them. It isn't a matter of preference, Doctor, but rather a physical discomfort. It makes my job… challenging, and I want to ensure I can continue to perform my duties effectively while also respecting the safety protocols in place. Perhaps we could discuss what options are available?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's get some details then. Before we even consider exemptions, we need to understand what exactly is causing this “discomfort.” Can you describe it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… difficult to put into words precisely, but the sensation is primarily one of restriction, a tightness across my face and around my breathing. It triggers a… a sense of unease, almost a slight panic, though I wouldn’t call it a full-blown anxiety attack. It makes it harder to concentrate, and I find myself…distracted. I work directly with people, you see, and need to be fully present. It’s not simply feeling hot or stuffy, Doctor. It’s more… profound than that.
DOCTOR: A “sense of unease,” and difficulty concentrating… interesting. And how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: It began approximately three weeks ago, when the new mask policy was implemented. Prior to that, I had no trouble at all. We had lighter requirements before, you see, more optional guidance. But with the full mandate… well, that's when these feelings started. It’s been steadily worsening each week, unfortunately. It’s not improving with continued use, and, if anything, it’s becoming more noticeable and disruptive.
DOCTOR: So, specifically correlated to the implementation of the stricter policy. And have you tried different types of masks?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, I have. My employer has provided both the standard surgical masks and the N95 respirators. I’ve also attempted using cloth masks, hoping a looser fit would alleviate the discomfort. Unfortunately, each type presents the same issue, though the N95s are the most troublesome. The tightness… it’s almost unbearable after a short time. I even tried adjusting the fit, ensuring it’s snug but not overly constricting, but it doesn't seem to make a significant difference.
DOCTOR: I see. And what is your occupation, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: I work as a Protective Service Worker, Doctor. I assist individuals and families facing difficult circumstances. It involves a lot of direct, face-to-face interaction, home visits, and ensuring the safety and well-being of vulnerable people. It requires a calm and focused demeanor, and, as I mentioned, being fully present for those I serve. It’s rather important work, if I may say so myself. It's why this situation is causing me such concern.
DOCTOR: Protective Service Work… certainly a demanding profession. Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any respiratory conditions?
PATIENT: No, sir. I have never been diagnosed with any respiratory conditions—asthma, COPD, or anything of that nature. I’ve always been in relatively good health, I believe. I do have a slight sensitivity to certain strong scents, but that’s the extent of my medical concerns. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing chronic or requiring ongoing treatment. I’ve attached my medical records for your review, Doctor, should you require further details. It outlines my general health history quite thoroughly.
DOCTOR: I see no documented respiratory issues. Any history of anxiety or panic disorders?
PATIENT: No, sir. I have never been diagnosed with any anxiety or panic disorders, nor have I ever sought treatment for such conditions. I understand how my description of feeling “unease” may lead you to believe that, but I assure you it’s a physical response, not an emotional one. It’s a discomfort, a restriction, that interferes with my breathing and concentration. It’s… unsettling, certainly, but not rooted in anxiety. I’ve always been a rather grounded individual, if I may say so. I can handle stressful situations with relative calm, typically.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Knabenshue, while I appreciate your detailed explanation, this sounds… unusual. We're going to need to rule out some physiological causes. I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. We'll check your lung function, blood oxygen levels, and take your blood pressure. Just standard procedure, to ensure there isn't an underlying medical reason for this reaction.
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I understand the need to rule out any potential medical causes. I am fully cooperative and happy to undergo any examinations you deem necessary. Please, proceed at your convenience. I trust your professional judgement entirely. Do I need to prepare in any way? Should I remove any clothing, or is there anything I should be aware of beforehand?
DOCTOR: No, no need to remove any clothing at this stage. Just sit comfortably. First, I’m going to listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. Take a few deep breaths in and out… that’s good. Lungs sound clear bilaterally. Now, let’s check your oxygen saturation with this pulse oximeter. 98 percent. Within normal limits. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Also normal. So, physiologically, everything appears unremarkable. This is… perplexing.
PATIENT: Perplexing indeed. I must admit, I find it rather concerning that nothing is showing up on the tests, as it only further complicates matters. It's as if my body is responding in a way that isn’t readily quantifiable. Perhaps it's a sensitivity to the material itself? I’ve read some articles online about reactions to certain fabrics, but I’m certainly no medical expert. Would it be possible to explore the possibility of an allergy test, Doctor? Or perhaps there are other types of examinations that could shed some light on this issue? I’m eager to find a solution, as this situation is impacting my ability to perform my duties effectively.
DOCTOR: “Articles online,” you say. While I appreciate your initiative, Mr. Knabenshue, relying on internet research for medical diagnoses is rarely helpful, and often misleading. However… an allergy test could be considered. But frankly, given your clear lung function and normal oxygen levels, I suspect a truly allergic reaction is unlikely. It would be… a low-yield test. We could do it, but I wouldn’t expect definitive results. Perhaps…and I’m only exploring possibilities here… this is a psychological component manifesting physically. Have you considered speaking with a therapist?
PATIENT: A psychological component… Well, I hadn't considered that, Doctor, to be perfectly honest. I understand the logic, of course, that the mind and body are interconnected, but I maintain that this is a physical sensation. It is difficult to explain, but it feels… real, tangible. Perhaps a therapist could help me identify any underlying stressors I may not be aware of, though I am generally quite adept at managing my emotions. But I am willing to explore all avenues, if that’s your recommendation. If a therapist is deemed necessary, I would certainly be open to a referral. I suppose it's better to rule out all possibilities, rather than leave any stone unturned. Would you recommend a specific type of therapist, Doctor, or are any qualified professional sufficient?
DOCTOR: Given the specifics of your concerns—a perceived physical reaction to a mandated safety protocol—I would recommend a therapist specializing in health psychology or, perhaps, one experienced in addressing occupational stress. Someone who can help you explore the connection between your work environment, your physical sensations, and any potential anxieties surrounding the masks. I can provide you with a list of qualified professionals in the area. However, I must reiterate, I believe further medical investigation—while unlikely to yield results—is also prudent. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks. In the meantime, continue wearing the masks as required, and document any specific instances of discomfort—duration, intensity, and any accompanying symptoms. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. A specialist in health psychology would be most helpful, I believe. I appreciate the referral. And yes, I do have a question, if you don't mind. If the therapist determines this is a purely psychological issue, would that impact my ability to request an exemption from the mask mandate? My employer has a form that requires documentation from a medical professional, and I’m concerned that a therapist’s assessment may not be sufficient. I wouldn’t want to jeopardize my employment over this matter. Perhaps a second opinion from another physician would be advisable, if needed?
DOCTOR: That is… a complex question, Mr. Knabenshue. The employer ultimately has the final say regarding exemptions, and their requirements are…at their discretion. A therapist’s assessment may be sufficient, but that is not guaranteed. I will document my findings—normal physiological assessment, recommendation for health psychology evaluation—and you can present that to your employer along with any documentation from the therapist. A second opinion… is always your prerogative. However, I strongly suspect further medical investigation will prove fruitless. We will proceed with the health psychology referral, document our findings, and you can address the exemption request with your employer. Are we clear on that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly clear. I understand the limitations, and I appreciate your honesty regarding the likelihood of further medical intervention. I will schedule an appointment with a health psychologist as soon as possible and present all documentation to my employer. Thank you for your time and consideration, Doctor Paulino. I appreciate your willingness to explore all avenues, despite the… perplexing nature of this issue. I will await your list of qualified professionals. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll have my assistant send that over to you. Good day, Mr. Knabenshue. .
