DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I want to... find out more about where my family comes from. My people, you know? I hear you can do tests for that now. DNA tests.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mr. Scobie! And yes, you're right, we can definitely explore that. Genetic ancestry testing has become quite sophisticated. It’s a fascinating way to connect with your heritage. Just to be sure I have everything correct, your name is Laury Scobie, age 85, and you're of Marshallese descent, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Laury Scobie. Eighty-five years. And Marshallese, yes. My mama come from there, long time ago. It's just… I want to know more. Maybe find cousins, or… something. I don't know exactly. It's a feeling, you know?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Mr. Scobie. That "feeling" is a perfectly good reason to explore your ancestry. It’s very common to want to connect with your roots. Before we talk specifically about the DNA testing, could you tell me a little more about your health history?
PATIENT: Health? Not much wrong, really. Old age is the problem! I get a little tired, sometimes. And my knees… not so good. But I go to the clinic, they give me pills. Medicare pays. Is health important for this test? I thought it was just… spit, or something?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Scobie. It is mostly spit, or a simple cheek swab! But knowing your overall health helps us interpret the results and make sure everything goes smoothly. We want to rule out any underlying conditions that might affect the testing process or the accuracy of the results. Let’s start with a quick review of your current medications. You mentioned getting pills from the clinic – do you remember what those are for?
PATIENT: Hmm… there's a white one, for my water. Makes me go to the bathroom less. And a little blue one… for my knees, I think. Hurts when it rains, you know? And… oh! A yellow one, Doctor. Small one. I take it every morning. I forget the names. Too many pills! They just tell me what to take. Medicare… they know everything anyway.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. Names can be tricky. It's more important to know what they’re for. The white one for your water sounds like a diuretic, likely to help with fluid retention. The blue one for your knees is probably an anti-inflammatory. And the small yellow one... that one’s a little harder to guess without knowing more. Let me see if I can pull up your medication list from the clinic's records. Ah, here we are. It looks like you're taking Furosemide, which is the diuretic for fluid retention. You’re also on Ibuprofen for your knee pain, and… Vitamin D, a small yellow pill, for bone health. Do those sound right?
PATIENT: Wow! You’re smart, Doctor. Yes, those… those are the names! Furosemide… Ibuprofen… sounds like magic words. And Vitamin D… yes, the nurse told me that's for my bones. Old bones! So, knowing about pills… that helps the spit test?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Scobie. Some medications can affect the DNA itself, or how we interpret the results. It’s important to take that into account. Now, beyond those medications, have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Serious…? Hmm… when I was a boy, I had the fever. Very bad fever. Almost died, they said. But I got better. That was… long time ago. And… oh! I broke my arm when I was fishing. Fell out of the boat. They put it in a cast. But that wasn’t serious, really. Nothing else. Just old age things. Aches and pains. Not worth talking about. Is the spit test still okay? I really want to find out about my family.
DOCTOR: Yes, the spit test is absolutely still okay, Mr. Scobie. The fever as a boy is good to know, and the broken arm isn’t a concern. Let's talk a little about your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any illnesses that run in your family – heart problems, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… Mama, she had… trouble breathing, when she got old. But that was just old age, I think. My papa… he was strong, a fisherman. Never sick. But his brother… he had the cough. Very bad cough. They said it was the lung trouble. Nobody talked much about sickness. Just… life. Hard life. Fishing, boats, the ocean. Is the cough important? I don’t know much about family history. We didn’t write things down.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. It’s common for family history to be a bit vague, especially when it wasn’t written down. The cough your uncle had is potentially important. Lung trouble could be a number of things, including chronic bronchitis or even something genetic. Just to clarify, you’re saying your uncle had a chronic cough, and your mother had trouble breathing in her later years?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Chronic cough. Terrible cough. He smoked a lot, too. Bad habit. And Mama, she just… got tired. Hard to breathe when you get old, I guess. So, the spit test… can it tell me about the cough? And if my cousins have it too? That’s what I want to know. If it runs in the family. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, that’s precisely what the DNA test can potentially tell you. It can look for genetic predispositions to certain conditions, including lung diseases. It won't tell you definitively if your cousins have the condition, but it can give you an idea of your risk, and whether it runs in your family. Before we proceed, I want to make sure you understand the limitations of the test. It’s not a crystal ball. It can only tell us about your genetic risk, not your future health. And it can’t identify every single genetic condition. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Risk… not a crystal ball. That’s good. I don't want magic. Just… information. Knowing if it’s in my blood, you know? If I need to tell my cousins to be careful. So, the spit test… how does it work? Is it painful? And how long does it take to get the answers? I’m an old man, Doctor. I don’t have much time to wait.
DOCTOR: It’s not painful at all, Mr. Scobie. It's very simple. We'll give you a small tube, and you just spit into it – that's it. It's a bit like giving a saliva sample at the dentist. The lab then analyzes your DNA from the sample. It typically takes about 4-6 weeks to get the results back. I know that's not a short time, but it takes a while to analyze all the genetic information. We can discuss the results together when they come back, and I’ll help you interpret them and explain what they mean. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Spit in a tube. I can do that! Four to six weeks… alright. I’ve waited longer for a good fish. So, where do I spit? And do I need to do anything special before? Not eat anything? Or drink something? I always forget things…
DOCTOR: Excellent! Here’s the tube and the form. You don’t need to do anything special beforehand – no fasting or anything like that. Just avoid eating, drinking, or smoking for about 30 minutes before giving the sample, to keep it pure. And try to fill the tube to the marked line. The nurse will show you to a private room where you can give the sample. Once you’ve done that, just bring the form and tube back to the front desk, and they'll send it off to the lab. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: Thirty minutes, no eating… alright, I can remember that. Nurse will show me… good. I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I hope I can find some cousins! That would be nice. Now, let me go find that nurse...
