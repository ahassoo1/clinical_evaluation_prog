DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. Or, is it Annelle?
PATIENT: Yes, Annelle is fine, Doctor… Sham, isn’t it? Though, truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I just… I came about my coloring, you see. A bit yellow, and it worries me. I hope we can be quick; I have a few errands to run this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, Sham is correct. And please, call me Zachory. Yellowing… alright. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. When did you first notice this coloring, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I notice it? It feels like… weeks, perhaps? It’s a bit hard to say exactly. It wasn’t sudden, not like a shock. Just… gradually becoming more apparent. I thought it might be the lighting in my kitchen at first, honestly. But it’s still there… even in good light. Is it… serious? I hope it’s not something dreadful.
DOCTOR: Gradual onset is… helpful to know. We’ll need to investigate further to determine the cause. It could be a number of things, some more concerning than others. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this yellowing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. I’ve been… rather tired lately, more so than usual. And a bit of a discomfort… right under my ribs, on the right side. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. I also haven’t been very hungry, but I thought that was just… old age. It's difficult to say what’s normal anymore. Do you need me to be more specific? I'm afraid my descriptions aren’t very precise.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright, Ms. Durig. Every detail, however vague, is useful. Tiredness, discomfort under the right ribs, and decreased appetite… all relevant. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements… Oh dear. That’s… a bit personal, isn’t it? Well… they’ve been… paler than usual, I suppose. Not terribly different, but… lighter in color. And a bit… stickier, if that makes sense. I haven’t paid much attention to them, to be honest. It's not something one dwells on. Is that… important? I apologize if I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Durig, and you are being very helpful. Changes in bowel movements can provide important clues. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My medical history… it’s a bit of a blur. I’ve seen many doctors over the years. I believe I had some trouble with my liver… a long time ago. Hepatitis, perhaps? It was quite some time ago, and I don’t recall the details. I’ve also had the usual things – arthritis, a bit of high blood pressure. Nothing too serious, or so I was told. I'm afraid I don't keep very good records. Is it important to know which type of hepatitis? I doubt I remember.
DOCTOR: Knowing whether it was A, B, or C is helpful, yes. It affects the long-term management. We might need to look at old records if available. Do you happen to know if you received any treatments for the hepatitis?
PATIENT: Treatments… no, I don’t think so. It was a long time ago, as I said. I remember being very tired, and perhaps taking some pills, but I can’t recall anything specific. I was younger then, and… things weren't as well documented. I mostly just rested, I think. And drank a lot of fluids. Is it possible to test for it now, to find out what type it was? I really haven’t thought about my liver in decades. I just want to know what’s causing this yellowing. It's unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly run blood tests to determine the type of hepatitis, if there was an infection. We'll also need to check your liver function, and perhaps order an ultrasound to get a better look. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s another difficult one. My family is…scattered, you see. I haven't seen most of them in many years. I believe my mother had some heart trouble, and my brother… he had problems with his stomach, but I don't recall specifics. Nothing major that I'm aware of. Many illnesses, I suppose, like everyone else. No history of liver problems, as far as I know. It's not something we talked about much. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague. It's a long time ago, and… well, memories fade.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Durig. Every piece of information is helpful. Now, let’s discuss your current medications and allergies, if any. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… I take a small dose of something for my arthritis, a white pill. And occasionally, an antacid, when my stomach bothers me. That's about it, I think. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a while ago. I don't think they were doing much good. As for allergies… no, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I'm quite fortunate, in that regard. Is there anything else I should be thinking about? I hope we’re nearing the end. I have errands to run, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more things. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. That will give me a better idea of what’s going on. It shouldn't take long.
PATIENT: Very well. As long as it's quick, Doctor. My side has been a little tender lately, as I mentioned. Please be gentle. And if I flinch, it's not rudeness, you understand. Just… sensitivity. I do hope this doesn't reveal anything dreadful. I'm a bit anxious, you see. But go ahead, please. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh. Yes, that’s… tender. Not sharp, just… a dull ache, as I said. It's been getting worse over the past few weeks. It feels… swollen, perhaps? Though, I’m not certain. It's hard to tell. Please be careful; it's quite sensitive. And please, hurry. I really do need to get going soon. Is that… concerning? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant, with some swelling… that's concerning enough to warrant further investigation. Your liver feels slightly enlarged, but it’s difficult to say definitively without imaging. We'll need to order a complete blood count, liver function tests, and an abdominal ultrasound. Do you have any known history of gallstones?
PATIENT: Gallstones… no, I don't believe so. I’ve never been told I had gallstones. I've had stomach troubles on occasion, but nothing specific. I remember my mother mentioning something about her gallbladder once, but I don't recall the details. It was a long time ago. Is that… a possibility? What does that mean? I hope it’s nothing too serious. I really am starting to worry. Can we speed things up a little, Doctor? I have errands to run, and I’m not feeling well. Perhaps you could just give me something for the pain?
DOCTOR: Gallstones are a possibility, Ms. Durig, but we need to rule out other causes first. An ultrasound will help us determine the cause of the pain and swelling. I understand your concern, and I want to assure you we're doing everything we can to find out what's going on. We are not able to prescribe pain medication without knowing the source of the pain. I’ll write the orders for the tests now. The lab technician will draw some blood, and you’ll need to schedule an ultrasound appointment. Here’s a requisition form for the blood work and the number for the imaging center. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is… a lot. So, blood tests and an ultrasound… and then we see what happens? I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. I just wish I knew what was wrong. And I really do need to hurry. I’ve wasted most of the morning already. I suppose I should call the imaging center. I’ll… I’ll try to schedule the tests as soon as possible. Thank you again, Doctor Sham. I… I hope it’s nothing serious. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Durig. Please schedule the tests as soon as possible, and call my office if you have any concerns. We’ll review the results and discuss a plan. Take care.
