DOCTOR: Hi Norval, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It’s this… eating thing. I just don't get hungry like I used to. And when I do eat, I fill up awful fast. A few bites and I'm done. It's been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It’s just… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A change in appetite and feeling full quickly – that is something we should look into. About a month, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly a month. Maybe a little longer, hard to say exactly. Time kinda… slips away when you get to be my age, you know? But definitely not longer than two months, I’d say. It just… happened gradually. Not like one day I was eating normal and the next, nope.
DOCTOR: I completely understand that. Time does seem to speed up! So, it was a gradual change, not sudden. And you said you just don’t feel as hungry as you used to, and then you get full after only a few bites. Has this been with all foods, or just certain things?
PATIENT: Pretty much everything, I think. Doesn't seem to matter what it is. My wife makes a lovely salmon chowder, always have, always will. Used to be I could put away a whole bowl, easy. Now? Two or three spoonfuls and I’m stuffed. Same with toast, same with… well, everything, really. It's making it hard to keep my strength up, you know? I like to get out and work in the garden.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not related to a specific food, which is helpful to know. And you're noticing it's affecting your energy levels, especially with gardening. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this, like unintentional weight loss, nausea, vomiting, or any pain in your abdomen or chest?
PATIENT: Hmm… weight loss… I haven't really been weighing myself, to be honest. My wife usually handles that sort of thing. But I suppose my clothes feel a little looser, now that you mention it. No nausea or vomiting, thankfully. And no pain, not really. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but I get that anyway. Old age, you know? It’s just… this lack of appetite is the big thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know about the lack of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. And the occasional heartburn is something we can address separately. So, clothes feeling a little looser, that’s potentially some weight loss, even if we don’t have a number yet. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not much, really. I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back, but they fixed it with a stent. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of getting old. High blood pressure, the doctor told me once, but they got it under control with pills. I’ve been taking those for… oh, must be fifteen years now. And I’m diabetic, type 2. Been managing that with diet and pills, mostly. My wife keeps a pretty close eye on that one. She’s a good woman, that one.
DOCTOR: That's good information, thank you. So, a history of heart issues treated with a stent, high blood pressure managed with medication for fifteen years, and type 2 diabetes controlled with diet and pills. Do you recall what medications you’re currently taking for your blood pressure and diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me see… For the blood pressure, I think it’s… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, that’s the one. And for the diabetes… Metformin, I believe. And maybe something else… oh, now you’ve got me thinking. I usually leave the pill sorting to my wife, she has a system. I think there’s a second one for the diabetes, but I honestly couldn't tell you what it is. It’s a little white pill. Does that help? I’m not the best with remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and Metformin for diabetes, and possibly another medication for diabetes that is a small white pill. That’s helpful. And you said you’ve been managing your diabetes mostly with diet and pills?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. I try to watch what I eat, you know? Not too much sugar, not too many carbs. My wife makes sure of that, mostly. We mostly eat fish and vegetables. I used to love a good piece of bannock, but I haven’t had one in years. It’s a sacrifice, but it’s worth it to stay healthy. We used to go fishing a lot more, but it’s harder getting out these days. It's just...getting older, you know? Everything takes more effort.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you and your wife are doing a great job managing your health with diet and medication. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. My mother, she had diabetes, like me. And her mother, too, I think. So, it runs on the women's side, mostly. My father, he was a strong man, healthy as an ox. Never had a day of sickness in his life, as far as I know. But he passed away young, in an accident. As for cancer… I think my sister, her husband, he had something, a long time ago. But I don’t remember what kind. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to him. Not much else, I don't think. We weren’t a family that talked much about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes on your mother’s side and a possible history of cancer in your sister’s husband. Now, just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a smoker. My father always said it was a foolish habit, and I always listened to my father. Plenty of people smoked back in my day, of course, but I never picked it up. And I don't drink much either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. Nothing more. I always preferred a good cup of tea, myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. You don’t smoke and only drink occasionally. Finally, are you currently experiencing any other symptoms, like fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get tired, of course, but that's just getting old, I think. Bowel habits are... regular enough. Maybe a little constipation now and then, but nothing I can't handle with a bit of prune juice. It's not the tastiest thing in the world, but it does the trick. No, nothing else, not that I can think of. I believe that's everything, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Norval. That’s very helpful. So, to summarize, you're an 88-year-old male with a history of a heart stent, managed hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. You’ve experienced a gradual loss of appetite and early satiety for about a month, with no other significant symptoms like nausea, vomiting, weight loss, or changes in bowel habits. You don’t smoke, only drink occasionally, and manage your diabetes with diet and medication. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. I’ll just sit here and try not to fidget too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm listening to your heart now. Your heart rate is a little slow, but that's not uncommon with your medications. I'm hearing a slight murmur, which we already know about from your previous heart issues. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackling. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Not tender to the touch, no masses. I'm noting some slight… decreased bowel sounds. That could be related to your decreased appetite. Finally, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Okay, everything seems relatively stable, Norval. The decreased bowel sounds are a bit concerning, and the loss of appetite is definitely something we need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood work to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and a thyroid panel. We also need to check your blood sugar levels, just to be sure they’re under control.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Good. I appreciate you taking the time to look into it properly. Blood work, you say? Alright. Whatever you need. Where do I go to get that done? And… how long will it take to get the results? I hope it’s not too long. I'd like to get back to my garden before the summer's over.
DOCTOR: Here you go. You can get the blood work done at the lab just across the street – it’s the one in the strip mall next to the bakery. They’re open until 5 PM today. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. The results usually come back within 2-3 business days. I’ll give you a call as soon as they’re in, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you try to eat smaller, more frequent meals, even if you don’t feel particularly hungry. And make sure you’re staying well-hydrated. Given your age and the gradual onset of these symptoms, I also want to rule out any potential underlying causes. So, if the blood work doesn’t show anything significant, I might recommend a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis just to be extra cautious. But let’s see what the blood work says first. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Smaller meals… I suppose I can try that. It’s just hard when you don’t feel like eating. A CT scan… well, that sounds a bit serious, doesn't it? But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I just hope it doesn't take too long to get the results. Okay. Blood work first, then we'll see. Thank you, Doctor Ranjan. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I'll go get this done now. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I go? Any special instructions for the blood work? Should I fast or anything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Norval. I understand your concerns. We'll take things one step at a time. Yes, you do need to fast for the blood work. That means no food or drink for at least 8-12 hours before your appointment. You can still take your regular medications, but let the lab technician know what you’ve taken. And one more thing - if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever, please call the office immediately. Here's the number. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Alright, that’s all for now. Go get some rest, and I’ll be in touch soon. I hope you enjoy your garden this summer, Norval. And please, take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. No food… right. I can manage that. I appreciate your kindness, and I'll be sure to call if anything changes. And I will try to enjoy my garden. It’s the one thing that still brings me joy. Alright then. I'll see you soon, Doctor Ranjan. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You too, Norval. Take care, and I’ll talk to you soon. .
