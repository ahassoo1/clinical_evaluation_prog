DOCTOR: Hello, Evann. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Um… well, to be frank, I’m rather unclear on the specifics, but I believe I need… a form? Something to do with outlining wishes, should… things become difficult. A friend suggested I get an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form. I confess my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It’s very thoughtful of you to be proactive about this. It sounds like you’re interested in discussing Advance Care Planning – that includes documents like Advance Directives and POLST forms, as your friend mentioned. Both are about making your wishes known if you are unable to speak for yourself. Let me quickly pull up your EHR to see what, if anything, is already on file regarding this. Just a moment… Ah, it looks like there's no prior documentation on this. To start, can you tell me a little more about why you're thinking about this now?
PATIENT: That… that’s difficult to say precisely. It’s not a recent event that triggered it, more a… growing awareness, I suppose. My divorce was… final a few years ago, and it made me realize I hadn't really considered who would make decisions for me. And… well, things just… slip my mind these days. Small things, mostly. Important things, I try to remember, but… it’s unsettling. I suppose I’m trying to be prepared, though I’m not entirely sure what I need to prepare for.
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable feeling, Evann. It’s wise to think about these things, and it’s common for life changes to prompt us to consider our future healthcare wishes. It sounds like you’re wanting to ensure your voice is heard even if you’re unable to express it yourself. Okay, so recent life changes – divorce – and some concerns about memory are bringing this to the forefront. Let’s talk a bit more about what’s important to you in terms of medical care. If you were seriously ill and unable to make decisions, would you want to be kept alive with all possible medical interventions, even if there was little chance of recovery?
PATIENT: That… is a very direct question. I hadn’t really… considered the specifics of ‘all possible interventions’. I suppose… no. Not if there was truly no hope. Prolonging things… for the sake of prolonging them… doesn’t seem… right. But… defining ‘no hope’ is difficult. I wouldn’t want to give up easily, of course. It’s just… I wouldn’t want to be a burden, or kept alive artificially when… when there’s nothing more to be gained. I hope that makes sense. It’s all rather abstract.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Evann. It's not abstract at all – you’ve articulated some very important values. You want a fighting chance, but you also don’t want aggressive interventions if recovery is unlikely and quality of life would be severely compromised. That’s a very reasonable position. Now, let’s talk a little about what you consider a good quality of life. What are some things that are essential for you to feel like you are living a meaningful life?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My work, I suppose. Etching and engraving… it’s not just a job, it’s… an expression of myself. And… being independent. I live alone, and I value my autonomy. Being able to care for myself, to make my own decisions… that’s very important. Socially… I don’t require much. A few close friends… a quiet life. But losing the ability to create, or to care for myself… that would be… devastating. Perhaps being able to still appreciate beauty, even if I can’t create it myself. Does that sound… foolish?
DOCTOR: Not foolish at all, Evann. Those are very insightful and important things to share. It sounds like maintaining your independence, continuing your creative work, and being able to appreciate the beauty around you are central to your well-being. Okay, independence, creative expression, and appreciating beauty are key values. Now, let's shift gears a bit. Do you have a primary care physician that you see regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Dr. Chen. She’s… quite good. Very thorough. Though, honestly, I don’t see her as often as I should. I tend to… postpone things. It’s a bad habit, I know. She’s located on Elm Street, I believe. I have her contact information somewhere… in my bag.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. We can certainly coordinate with Dr. Chen. It's alright about postponing things, many people struggle with that. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not regularly. I used to take something for my… occasional headaches, but I stopped a few years ago. They weren't frequent enough to warrant it, and I prefer to avoid medication if possible. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers now and then, if needed. Nothing consistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Just over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been rather… fortunate in that regard. No known allergies. I’ve eaten… a rather varied diet, over the years, and never had any adverse reactions. Though… I do prefer to avoid shellfish. It’s more a… personal preference, I suppose, than an allergy. The texture… I find it unpleasant. But truly, no known allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Just a preference against shellfish. Alright, Evann. We've covered a lot of important ground. Let's quickly review your weight and height from the record: you’re 183 centimeters tall and weigh 123 kilograms, correct?
PATIENT: Um… yes, I believe so. Though… I haven’t been weighed in quite some time. It’s possible the numbers are outdated. I… haven't paid much attention to those details lately. Is there a reason you're asking? Are those numbers… significant? I apologize, I sometimes worry about… accuracy.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to question accuracy, Evann. We just want to have the most up-to-date information. Your weight and height are helpful for overall health assessment, but it's more important that you feel comfortable with your health. We can certainly re-check them if you'd prefer. Would you like me to take your weight and height now?
PATIENT: Very well. If you think it’s necessary… yes, please. I suppose it’s best to be accurate. I just… I find it rather unpleasant, truthfully. But… if it aids in the assessment, then I’m willing. Perhaps you could avoid reading the number aloud? I… it’s a sensitivity, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. No problem at all. We’ll keep the number private. Just step on here when you're ready. I'll be right here. Alright, it looks like your current weight is 128 kilograms and your height is still 183 centimeters. Do you feel this is accurate?
PATIENT: …Yes. I… I seem to have gained a bit of weight. I hadn’t realized quite how much. It’s… discouraging. But, yes, those numbers are accurate, I believe. Thank you for confirming. Shall we proceed with the forms, then? I’d like to get this over with, if possible.
DOCTOR: Of course, Evann. It’s perfectly alright to feel discouraged, and it takes courage to acknowledge changes. We can certainly proceed with the forms. Now, we can discuss which form is most appropriate for you. The Advance Directive allows you to outline your wishes regarding medical care, and you can appoint someone to make decisions on your behalf if you are unable to. The POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a medical order that specifies your wishes regarding things like CPR, ventilation, and feeding tubes. It’s typically used for people with serious illnesses. Given what you’ve told me, I think an Advance Directive would be a good starting point. We can always revisit the possibility of a POLST form later, if needed. Would you like me to explain the different sections of the Advance Directive, or would you prefer to work through it at your own pace?
PATIENT: Perhaps you could explain the sections, yes. I confess I’m rather unfamiliar with the terminology, and I wouldn’t want to inadvertently… make an incorrect decision. A clear explanation would be greatly appreciated. I’m eager to understand what each section entails before proceeding. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Evann. Absolutely. Let’s start with the first section – Healthcare Agent. This is where you designate someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you're unable to. It's incredibly important to choose someone who understands your values and wishes. Do you have someone in mind?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question. My ex-husband, Dimitri… we remain amicable, but I don’t believe he’s the best choice. He’s… rather pragmatic, and not particularly attuned to my… emotional needs. I have a friend, Anya… she’s very kind and compassionate, but she’s a rather timid person. She might be overwhelmed by the responsibility. I’m… honestly unsure. I hadn’t truly considered who would be suitable. Is it permissible to… leave it blank for now? To revisit it at a later date? Perhaps after careful consideration?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. It's perfectly permissible to leave it blank for now. It's much more important to choose someone you truly trust and feel comfortable with, and it's alright to take your time. You can always revisit this section later, after careful consideration. There’s no need to rush. The next section is Healthcare Instructions. This is where you outline your wishes regarding specific medical treatments, such as life-sustaining treatment, pain management, and end-of-life care. We’ve already touched upon some of these topics, so we can tailor this section to reflect your values. Do you have any specific preferences or concerns you’d like to address?
PATIENT: I… I believe I’ve already expressed my reluctance towards aggressive life-sustaining treatment if there is truly no hope of recovery. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially, only to suffer. Pain management is… important. I wouldn’t want to be in unnecessary pain. And… I would like to ensure my wishes regarding… a quiet death are respected. No unnecessary interventions, if possible. Just… comfort and dignity. I know it sounds… morbid, but I’ve always felt strongly about that. Is that… sufficient? Or is there more detail required?
DOCTOR: That is very clear and thoughtful, Evann. You've articulated your wishes beautifully. We can certainly document those preferences here. "Reluctant towards aggressive life-sustaining treatment if no hope of recovery, prioritize comfort and dignity, avoid unnecessary interventions.” There's also a section regarding Organ Donation. Would you like to indicate your wishes regarding organ donation?
PATIENT: Yes, I… I believe I would like to be an organ donor. If my organs could help someone else… that would be a… meaningful way to end my life, I suppose. Though, I don't have strong feelings about it. It's more of a… general principle. Yes, please document my wish to be an organ donor. I suppose the standard option is fine. I'm not familiar with the specifics.
DOCTOR: Alright, documenting your wish to be an organ donor. Standard option selected. The final section is simply a space for your signature and date. So, we’ve covered all the key sections. We’ve designated no healthcare agent for now, documented your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment, pain management, and end-of-life care, and indicated your wish to be an organ donor. Are you comfortable with everything we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. It’s… surprisingly comprehensive. And you’ve been very patient and understanding. It’s a… relief to have this completed. Although, I admit I’m slightly apprehensive about signing it. It feels… final. But, yes, I am comfortable with everything. Let’s proceed with the signature. I hope this proves… useful, should the need arise.
DOCTOR: It is a significant step, Evann, and it's perfectly natural to feel apprehensive. But you've thought this through carefully, and you've articulated your wishes beautifully. This document is a testament to your thoughtful preparation. Just sign and date here, and we’ll be all set. Wonderful. I’ll make a copy for your records, and I'll also ensure this is included in your electronic health record. Here you go. Please keep this in a safe place. And remember, you can always revisit this document and make changes at any time. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we conclude today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all. You’ve been exceptionally helpful, Doctor. And thank you for your patience. I… I feel much better knowing this is completed. It’s a weight off my shoulders, if that makes sense. Thank you again. I think I’ll leave it at that. Perhaps I’ll schedule a check-up soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. I'm glad I could help. It does sound like a weight has been lifted, and that's wonderful. Please do schedule a check-up when you’re ready. We can discuss any health concerns you may have. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the future. Have a good day.
