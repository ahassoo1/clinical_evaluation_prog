DOCTOR: Alright, Gedalya. So, you're 25… Swedish, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. From Stockholm, originally. Though I’ve been living here for a few years now.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s not dwell on geography. You’re here today… for what exactly?
PATIENT: It’s… well, it’s a bit hard to explain. I’ve just been getting weaker, slowly. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping. It's been happening for a few months now, and it’s starting to worry me. I thought it was just tiredness at first, but it doesn’t seem to be getting better with rest.
DOCTOR: “Weakness” is… vague. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… it's mostly in my arms and legs. Like, carrying things is harder. And I get tired just walking up the stairs. It’s not a sudden thing, it's just… gradually more difficult to do things I used to do easily. It feels like my muscles just don't have the strength they used to. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: So, progressive weakness… a few months duration. And these drooping eyelids… ptosis, as we call it. Hmm. Have you noticed any double vision?
PATIENT: Double vision? No, not that I’ve noticed. Everything seems… normal, as far as seeing goes. Just… heavy eyelids. And sometimes they feel… twitchy? But not always. I hadn’t really thought about it being anything more than just being tired, to be honest. It's been a bit of a slow process, so I didn’t really think much of it at first.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said you’ve been living here for “a few years.” What sort of work do you do?
PATIENT: I'm a Facilities Manager. Mostly office buildings. So, a lot of walking around, checking things, making sure everything is working properly. It's not physical labor, exactly, but it does require being on my feet a lot, and occasionally lifting things. It's becoming harder to do, to be honest. Which is why I'm here.
DOCTOR: Any family history of… neurological problems?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… not that I'm aware of, no. My mother had high blood pressure, and my grandfather had some heart trouble, but nothing like… muscle weakness or anything like that. I don’t really know much about my father’s side of the family, unfortunately. We weren’t very close. Is that helpful? I'm not sure I know enough to answer that properly.
DOCTOR: “Not very close” isn’t a medical history, Gedalya. Alright. Let’s move on. Allergies?
PATIENT: No known allergies, no. I can eat anything, as far as I know. No reactions to any medications, either. I haven’t really taken much in the way of medicine, to be honest. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache. I try to avoid it when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I want to check your reflexes, strength, and see those eyelids up close. Please sit up straight on the examination table.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest. It’s been a while since I’ve been to a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Patellar reflex… normal. Achilles… normal. Now, squeeze my hands. Hard. A little weak on the left, but not alarming. Now, I want you to push against my resistance. Arms… push. And legs… push. Hmm. A bit diminished in the legs, as you said. Now, let me take a look at those eyelids. Moderate ptosis bilaterally. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious ophthalmoplegia. Now, look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m doing my best. It feels a little… strange, pushing like that. Is everything alright? It's hard to say if it feels weaker than usual, to be honest. It just feels tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to check your cranial nerves. Follow my penlight with your eyes, but don't move your head. Good. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that alright? I haven’t really been smiling much lately, to be honest. Things have been… stressful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, stick out your tongue. Hmm. Looks normal. Based on this preliminary exam, and your reported symptoms… it could be myasthenia gravis. It’s a possibility we need to investigate. Don’t panic. It’s manageable with treatment. But we need blood work, and possibly a more detailed neurological evaluation.
PATIENT: Myasthenia… gravis? What… what is that? And what does “manageable” mean? I’m… I’m a bit scared, to be honest. I hadn’t expected anything like this. Is it… serious? I’m sorry, I just… I don’t know anything about this.
DOCTOR: It's an autoimmune disorder. Your immune system attacks the connections between your nerves and muscles, causing weakness. “Manageable” means we can treat it with medication to suppress your immune system and improve your strength. Yes, it can be serious if left untreated, but it’s not a death sentence. We need to confirm it with a blood test, looking for specific antibodies. I’ll order a panel right away. Also, I want a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can do a more detailed exam and possibly an electromyography – EMG – to assess your muscle function. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… autoimmune… antibodies… EMG… Yes, I think so. It’s a lot to take in. So, blood tests and… seeing a specialist? When will I get the results from the blood tests? And what does the specialist… do? I’m a bit worried about… the EMG. What is that even like? I’m… sorry for all the questions. It's just… I’m really scared.
DOCTOR: The blood tests should be back in a few days. The neurologist will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. As for the EMG… it involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to measure electrical activity. It’s uncomfortable, but not dangerous. It will help them determine the extent of the nerve damage. Look, I understand you're scared, but worrying won't help. We need to gather more information before we can make a definitive diagnosis. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s excellent. In the meantime, try to get some rest, and avoid strenuous activity. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No… no allergies. I haven’t really taken much medication, as I said before. Just painkillers, occasionally. Is there anything… anything I should be doing right now? Besides resting? Should I be… trying to strengthen my muscles, or would that make things worse? I’m just… I don’t know what to do with all of this.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no strenuous activity. Trying to “strengthen” your muscles now could worsen the symptoms. Rest is crucial. And frankly, I don’t want you overthinking this. Wait for the results, see the neurologist, and then we’ll discuss treatment options. Worrying yourself sick will only make things worse, and it won’t change the outcome. I’m going to order the blood work now. The lab technician will explain the procedure. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: No… I don't. Not insured, unfortunately. I… I lost my job a few months ago, and I haven't been able to get coverage since. Is that… is that going to be a problem? I don’t really have a lot of money right now, to be honest. Will it be very expensive?
DOCTOR: Uninsured. Of course. The lab does offer a sliding scale for patients without insurance. We'll see what they can do. As for the neurologist, you’ll need to discuss payment options with their office. I can’t control what they charge. Here’s the lab information. Go there as soon as possible. And frankly, Gedalya, you really should have mentioned the lack of insurance earlier. It changes things. Now, is there anything else I should know?
PATIENT: No… no, that’s everything. I’m sorry. I should have said something. I just… I didn’t want to make things complicated. I just wanted to know what was wrong with me. Thank you… thank you for your time. I’ll go to the lab. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Don’t delay. And try not to panic. Next patient. .
