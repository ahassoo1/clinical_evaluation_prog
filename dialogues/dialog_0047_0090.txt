DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe it’s a clearance visit? It’s all a bit… hazy, truthfully. My husband… he would have handled all of this. I just want to make sure I’m alright to proceed, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A clearance visit, right. And for what surgery, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. It has to do with… my face, I think? Something about restoring… things. It was a very long discussion with the surgeon, and honestly, it's all a bit of a blur since… everything. He’s very good, though. Very highly recommended. I just need to be sure I'm okay for it, like you said. Is it alright if I'm not very specific? It's not that I'm trying to be difficult… it's just… the memories aren't very clear.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we still need some information, Ms. Brightful, for medical reasons. “Something about restoring things” doesn’t really tell me what I need to know to assess your fitness for surgery. Do you remember the name of the surgeon?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a good question. I feel terrible, but the name is escaping me at the moment. He has a practice… near the shopping mall, I believe? A very modern office, with lots of plants. I… I recall my husband researching extensively, and he said the doctor specialized in facial reconstruction. Does that help at all? I apologize. I truly do. My memory has been… unreliable since… well, since my husband passed. Perhaps if I see the name written down, it will jog something?
DOCTOR: Facial reconstruction near the shopping mall… Let me see if anything pops up in our referral database. Hmm. There are a few possibilities. Do any of these names ring a bell: Dr. Alistair Finch, Dr. Beatrice Choi, or Dr. Desmond Bell?
PATIENT: Dr. Choi… yes! That’s it! Dr. Beatrice Choi. That is the name. She was… very kind. Very patient with all my questions, or rather, my husband's questions. She explained everything so thoroughly. Thank goodness. You found her! I was starting to feel quite foolish.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Choi. Excellent. Okay, let’s pull up her notes regarding your consultation. According to Dr. Choi’s records, you are scheduled for a… lower face and neck lift with some additional work around the eyes. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Lower face and neck… and the eyes, yes. That is… what we discussed. It’s… it’s been a while. I’m glad you have all the details. It’s a relief, honestly. It feels like a weight is lifted just knowing someone else remembers everything. Is that… is that a standard procedure, Doctor? I don't mean to ask silly questions.
DOCTOR: It's a relatively common cosmetic procedure, Ms. Brightful. But that doesn't make it without risk. We still need to ensure you are a suitable candidate. Now, Dr. Choi's notes indicate you have a history of… let me see… mild hypertension, controlled with medication. Is that still the case?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Mild hypertension. I take a small pill every morning. My general practitioner monitors it regularly. He says it’s well-controlled, stable. I haven’t had any issues, honestly. It’s just… a part of life now, I suppose. I have the medication with me, if you’d like to see it? It's… Lisinopril, I believe is the name.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Let's have a look. Lisinopril, 10mg daily. Good. And do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but it cleared up completely with antibiotics. And… oh, yes! I have a slight sensitivity to codeine. Makes me very nauseous. My dentist keeps a note of it. Other than that… I don’t believe so. I try to stay healthy. Walk every day, eat a sensible diet. It's difficult sometimes, but I manage. Is that… is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think I have any severe allergies. I get a bit of seasonal hay fever in the spring, but nothing that over-the-counter antihistamines can’t handle. No food allergies, no reactions to medications that I’m aware of. My husband always said I was remarkably resilient. He used to joke that I could eat anything without getting sick! I suppose that was true. Is that… helpful? I truly wish I was more organized with these things. It’s just been… a difficult time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Brightful, before we proceed, I need to conduct a brief physical examination to assess your overall health and suitability for surgery. It's just standard procedure. Could you please step onto the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That makes perfect sense. Whatever is needed to ensure everything goes smoothly, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. Please, just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Please lie down on your back, Ms. Brightful. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. Now, another deep breath… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is… 138/82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Deep breath… and exhale. Yes, Doctor. Just let me know if anything is… amiss. Blood pressure a little elevated… is that concerning? I was a bit anxious coming here, perhaps that’s why. Reflexes… yes, that feels… normal. It’s a bit ticklish, though! I hope I’m not being difficult. I just want everything to go well.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be anxious. We'll take that into account. Now, I’m going to palpate your thyroid gland… No abnormalities detected. And finally, I'll take a quick look at your throat… open your mouth, please. Everything appears normal. Overall, your physical condition is… acceptable, though we’ll need to monitor your blood pressure closely before the surgery.
PATIENT: Alright. Anything I can do to help? I’m happy to… whatever is needed. Close monitoring of blood pressure… is that something I should do at home, or will Dr. Choi arrange that? I'm just trying to understand what’s required of me. It's good to hear my condition is acceptable. That's a relief.
DOCTOR: Dr. Choi will likely want you to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week before the surgery, twice a day, and bring the readings with you to your pre-op appointment. We need to ensure it's consistently stable. Now, Ms. Brightful, given your history of mild hypertension and the somewhat elevated reading today, I'm going to recommend a basic blood panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes. And an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Standard precautions, nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Blood panel and an EKG… yes, that makes sense. Anything to be thorough. Check kidney function and electrolytes… is that because of the blood pressure medication? I understand the need for precautions. It's just… a lot to take in, I suppose. Will these tests delay the surgery? I had hoped to have it done before the end of the month, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Possibly. It depends on how quickly the lab results come back and whether anything concerning is flagged. I'd anticipate at least a week, perhaps two, for everything to be processed and reviewed. It’s unlikely we can proceed before the end of the month. It’s better to be cautious than to risk complications during surgery. Safety is paramount, Ms. Brightful. Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A week or two… well, that’s… disappointing, but I understand. Safety is paramount, you're right. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment. Just… a bit overwhelmed, I suppose. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. And for being patient with my… forgetfulness. I appreciate it very much. What's the next step? Do I need to schedule something with the lab?
DOCTOR: Yes. My assistant will give you a requisition form for the blood work and the information for the EKG facility. You'll need to schedule both appointments independently. Please bring the results to your pre-op appointment with Dr. Choi. And try to relax, Ms. Brightful. We'll take things one step at a time. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s everything. Thank you again for your time and patience. I’ll go speak with your assistant now. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Brightful. .
