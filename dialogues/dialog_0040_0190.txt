DOCTOR: Right, Lilyanna Snerling. 23. Okay. Look, I'm quite busy today, so let’s get straight to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s this… unsteadiness. I’ve been feeling… off balance, I suppose. It’s hard to explain. It’s not constant, but it’s… worrying. I don’t… I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. It feels like a while now, though.
DOCTOR: "A while now," is not terribly helpful, dear. But alright. And when you say “off balance,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, I apologize. It’s just… things haven’t been very clear lately, if that makes sense. Um… it’s like… sometimes I feel like I’m swaying, even when I’m standing still. And other times, like when I walk, it feels like I might fall. Not always fall, but… unsteady. It’s… a little frightening, truthfully. I work with… machinery, you see, and… well, balance is important. I don’t recall any particular incident that caused it, if that’s what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Machinery, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I… operate a rotary drill. For oil and gas. It requires… a steady hand, and… well, feet. It’s a bit difficult to explain the work itself, but it's important to be… grounded, you see. And lately… I haven’t felt very grounded at all. I keep finding myself… bracing against things, just in case. I don't even remember the last time I felt completely stable, truly.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, bracing is… sensible, I suppose. Have you had any… dizziness associated with this?
PATIENT: Dizziness… hmm. Sometimes, yes. Not a spinning feeling, exactly. More like… a lightness in my head. A sort of… floaty feeling. It doesn’t happen every time I’m unsteady, though. Sometimes it’s just the balance issue, and other times… both. It’s hard to pin down. I don’t… I don’t think I’ve ever felt faint, though. And no nausea or anything like that. Just… off. Do you… understand?
DOCTOR: "Floaty feeling." Okay. And have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. That’s a good question. I… honestly, I haven’t been able to identify a pattern. It seems… random. Though, now that I think about it… it might be a little worse when I’m tired. Working long shifts… it definitely doesn’t help. But even on days off, it happens. And… I’ve noticed it doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing. Standing, walking, even sitting… sometimes it’s there. It’s… frustrating. I don't remember ever having anything like this before, either.
DOCTOR: Long shifts. Well, that figures. You young people and your relentless schedules. Alright. Let’s have a quick look. Stand up for me, please. I want to see this “unsteadiness” firsthand. And try not to fall, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, um… alright. I’ll try my best. It’s… it’s easier when I’m moving slowly. It's the stopping that’s difficult. I… I don't want to be a bother. I just… I need to be steady for my work. And I'm… a little worried, to be honest. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Hmm. You do seem a little wobbly. And your gait is… uneven. Okay. Let's check your reflexes. Please sit back down.
PATIENT: Oh! That was… unexpected. I… I don’t believe I’ve ever had that done before. It feels… normal, I suppose? Though, I… I don’t really know what I should be feeling. Everything feels a little… fuzzy, truthfully. Is something wrong? I’m not very good with… medical things, you see. I don't remember much from school.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy. Right. Well, your reflexes are… present. Not particularly robust, but present. It could be a number of things. Honestly, with this lack of a clear history… it’s difficult to say. Have you had any headaches recently?
PATIENT: Headaches… hmm. Now that you mention it… yes, a little. Not severe, but… a dull ache, mostly at the back of my head. It comes and goes. I hadn’t really thought much of it, to be honest. I get them sometimes, especially when I’m stressed. Or tired. Or… well, just generally. It’s not… debilitating. Just… annoying. I don’t recall them being linked to the unsteadiness, though. But it’s possible, I suppose. Everything feels… disconnected, to be honest. I don’t remember a time when I didn't feel a little off.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. That’s… a good question. I… I don’t think so. Everything seems… normal. Though, I… I haven’t had my eyes checked in a while, to be honest. Maybe things are a little blurry? I’m not sure. It’s hard to tell. I just… wear glasses for reading sometimes. Nothing major. But I haven’t noticed any… double vision, or spots, or anything like that. Just… general… not-sharpness, perhaps. I don’t recall anything sudden, though. Everything feels… gradual, to be honest. Like it’s been slipping away slowly. I just… I need to be able to see clearly for my work. And stand steadily.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, honestly, this is… nonspecific. It could be a lot of things. Stress, fatigue, dehydration… it’s all plausible. Given your work, I suspect it’s a combination of those factors. I'm going to order some basic bloodwork – just to rule out anything obvious. And I’m going to recommend you get a proper eye exam. And… try to get some more rest, alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Bloodwork… and an eye exam. I… I suppose that makes sense. I just… I was hoping for something more definitive. I need to be able to work, you see. And… I don’t want this to get worse. I just… I don’t recall ever feeling this… unsteady before. Is there… anything else I should be doing? Or… anything worrying I should be looking out for? I don't want to be a bother, but I just… I need to know. I just… everything feels so fragmented, and I don't remember things very well.
DOCTOR: Look, if you develop sudden weakness, severe headache, difficulty speaking, or changes in vision, go to the emergency room immediately. But frankly, I suspect this is just… you pushing yourself too hard. Get the bloodwork done, schedule the eye exam, and try to slow down. And… frankly, maybe reconsider your career choice if it’s causing this much stress. Next!
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Sudden weakness… severe headache… changes in vision. I… I’ll remember that. I’ll try. I… thank you, Doctor. I just… I don't recall ever feeling this… unwell before. But I’ll try to get some rest. And… slow down. Is… is there anything else I should be aware of? Perhaps a specialist I should see? Or… something to help with the… fogginess? I just… I need to be steady for my work. .
DOCTOR: Honestly, if this doesn’t improve, see a neurologist. And stop worrying so much. It's probably just anxiety. Now, if you'll excuse me…
