DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this…itchiness, really. Everywhere, pretty much. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s driving me a little crazy. Not painful, just…constant. It's been harder to sleep, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, constant itchiness for a few weeks now, affecting most of your body and interfering with your sleep. I understand that must be very frustrating. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn’t really seem to matter what I’m wearing, it itches through clothes. And it’s not like…a rash, exactly. My skin just feels itchy. No bumps, no redness…nothing visible. I’ve tried different lotions, creams…even oatmeal baths, but nothing seems to help for very long. It’s just…there. It's worst at night, I think. And after a shower, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a generalized itch, not associated with any visible rash, bumps or redness. It's not relieved by lotions, creams, or oatmeal baths. It’s worse at night and sometimes after a shower. And when you say "a few weeks," roughly how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think…it started around the 15th of July, I'd say. So, almost three weeks now. Maybe a little longer. It was subtle at first, just a little annoyance, and I ignored it. Then it just…kept getting worse. And now, well, you can see why I'm here. It's hard to ignore something that keeps you awake all night.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly three weeks, starting around July 15th. It started subtle and gradually worsened. That's helpful. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger the itch, or make it worse – certain foods, detergents, activities, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I’ve been trying to think about that… honestly, no, not really. I haven’t changed my laundry detergent, I eat pretty much the same things as always. I haven't started using any new soaps or anything. I did do some gardening last week, but I’ve been gardening for years and never had a problem with itching afterwards. It just seems to come and go randomly, which is the frustrating part.
DOCTOR: Okay, no obvious triggers identified – no changes in detergents, soaps, or diet, and no correlation with activities like gardening. Random onset and course. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid problems, liver issues, or any history of skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Well, let's see… I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about ten years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Other than that… not really. No diabetes, no kidney problems, as far as I know. My doctor always said my thyroid was fine. I did have a touch of eczema when I was a little boy, but that cleared up years and years ago. My wife, God rest her soul, she used to say I had sensitive skin, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension is good to know. History of childhood eczema, but resolved years ago. And sensitive skin noted by your wife. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, for the blood pressure. That’s it. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing else. Just the Lisinopril. And I try to take it at the same time every morning, with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily, consistent timing. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medication… never had a problem. I’ve been stung by bees a few times, being a gardener, but just a little swelling, nothing serious. Never had a full-blown allergic reaction.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… my mother had arthritis, but that’s about it, as far as I know. My father was healthy as a horse, lived to be 85. My wife’s mother had some kind of heart trouble, but she smoked for fifty years, so it’s not much of a surprise. No history of skin conditions, allergies, or anything like that on either side.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant family history of skin conditions, allergies, or relevant medical problems. Before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe once a week, but that’s it. And I definitely don’t do any recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I keep pretty active in the garden, which keeps me healthy enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, no recreational drug use. Healthy lifestyle overall, focusing on gardening. Alright, Mr. Ferneding, thank you for answering all those questions. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to take a look at your skin and check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do, go right ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Ferneding. I’m not seeing any visible rash, bumps, or lesions on your skin. There’s no obvious redness or inflammation. Your lymph nodes feel normal – not enlarged or tender. Your ears and throat look clear. I’m not detecting any signs of infection or anything alarming on the initial exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Given everything you've told me and what I’m finding on the exam, it sounds like we’re dealing with a case of pruritus – generalized itching without an obvious cause. There are several things that can cause this, and we’ll need to do some further investigation to figure out the underlying reason. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Pruritus… that’s a fancy word for itching, right? Well, that's a relief to hear it's not something visible, at least. I was worried it was some kind of skin infection or something contagious. Further investigation… what does that involve? Blood tests? Any ideas what we’re looking for, specifically? And is it something serious? I’m just… a little anxious, if you don't mind me saying so. It's just been so persistent.
DOCTOR: You’re right, pruritus is just the medical term for itching. And I understand your anxiety – persistent itching can be very distressing. Yes, we’ll need to do some blood tests to rule out some common causes of generalized itching. We’ll check your complete blood count to look for any signs of infection or underlying blood disorders. We'll also check your liver and kidney function, thyroid hormone levels, and potentially your iron levels. Sometimes, itching can be a symptom of underlying medical conditions affecting these organs. We might also check for certain inflammatory markers. I’m not immediately concerned that this is something serious, but it's important to investigate to make sure we don't miss anything. The most common causes of pruritus are often relatively benign, like dry skin, allergies, or medication side effects. However, it's always best to rule out more serious possibilities. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. Checking all those things… it sounds thorough, which is reassuring. So, blood tests first, and then we see what those show? And you said something about medication side effects… could the Lisinopril be causing this? I’ve been on it for years, but I know things can change over time.
DOCTOR: Exactly, blood tests first to get a clearer picture. And yes, you're right to ask about the Lisinopril. While it's been years, medication side effects can develop over time, even with medications you've been taking for a long time. Lisinopril, in rare cases, can cause itching as a side effect. It’s not the most common side effect, but it's certainly something we need to consider. We'll also discuss your other medications, even over-the-counter ones, and any changes in soaps, detergents, or other products you use. Let me get the lab orders printed. We'll need a fairly standard blood panel. It should take about 15-20 minutes to draw the blood. Once the results are back, we can review them and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I can recommend a hypoallergenic moisturizer to help soothe the itching. Would you like a recommendation for that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A moisturizer would be wonderful. Anything to get a little relief would be greatly appreciated. And thank you again, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we’re looking into this properly. It’s just… nice to have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I'm glad I could reassure you. Okay, I recommend CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. It’s fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, and generally very well-tolerated. You can find it at most pharmacies. Apply it liberally after bathing, while your skin is still damp. Here's the lab requisition and the information about the moisturizer. The lab is just down the hall. Once you’ve had the blood drawn, you can call the clinic to schedule a follow-up appointment to review the results. Do you have any other questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your time and for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor Tosca. I really appreciate it. I’ll go get the blood work done now and schedule a follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. It was my pleasure. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Get well soon!
