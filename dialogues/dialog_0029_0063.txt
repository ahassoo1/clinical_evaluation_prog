DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s my back. It’s been really bad lately. Worse than usual. I… well, you know why I’m here, right? About the… the other thing? It feels connected, somehow.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do recall you’ve been seen for back pain before. And you mentioned something about it feeling… connected to a previous issue?
PATIENT: Yes. The… the cancer. They found it… a while back. And it was in my… well, near my back. It just feels like it’s all coming back, you know? Like the pain is the cancer, maybe? It’s hard to explain. It started a couple weeks ago, not too bad, just a little ache. But now… now I can barely move some days. It hurts to even sit.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, the pain started a couple of weeks ago, gradually worsening. It’s now interfering with sitting and your daily activities. And you’re concerned it might be related to your previous cancer diagnosis. Can you tell me a little more about where exactly the pain is located?
PATIENT: It’s… low, in my back. On my left side, mostly. It feels like it goes around to my side a little bit, too. Not just right on my spine, but more… over there. <gestures vaguely to her lower left back> And it’s not just a dull ache anymore. Sometimes it’s sharp, like a… a stabbing pain. Other times it’s just… a heavy, constant weight. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, low back pain, primarily on the left side, radiating around to the flank. Sharp, stabbing pains at times, but also a constant, heavy weight sensation. Any specific things that make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… lying down helps, a little. Especially on my right side. But even then, it’s not gone, just… less. Standing up is bad. And bending over? Forget about it. Really bad. Walking… depends. If I walk slow, it’s okay-ish. But if I try to hurry, it hurts a lot. Oh! And coughing. Coughing is the worst. Makes me gasp. <grimaces> Does that help? I'm trying to think of everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. Okay, so lying on your right side provides some relief, but standing and bending aggravate it. Slow walking is tolerable, but hurrying makes it worse, and coughing is particularly painful. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… <pauses, thinking hard> I haven’t been sleeping well. The pain keeps me up. And… I’ve been more tired than usual, I guess. Not just from not sleeping. Like… bone-deep tired. And… <hesitates> I haven’t been eating much. Everything just… tastes wrong. Not really sick to my stomach, just… no appetite. I lost some weight, probably. I haven't checked. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay. Insomnia, increased fatigue, and decreased appetite with associated weight loss. These are all important things to note. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Besides the cancer, do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… the usual old age stuff, you know? A little arthritis in my hands, but it doesn’t bother me much. And high blood pressure, but I take medicine for it. I haven’t had any surgeries, or… anything major. Just the regular check-ups and stuff. The cancer… that was the big thing. They did a lot of tests then. <frowns> Should they be checking those tests again?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a very good question. We will definitely review those prior imaging studies. And we should repeat some of them to get a current picture. Let's talk about your medications for a moment. What medications are you currently taking, including the high blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Okay. For my blood pressure, I take… let me see… Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. And… that's it. Just the Lisinopril. I take that every morning with my breakfast. And I take a little bit of ibuprofen sometimes, for the arthritis. But not very often, and not a lot. Just when it really flares up. That's all. No vitamins, or anything like that. I don't really believe in those. <shrugs>
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension, and occasional ibuprofen for arthritis. No other medications or supplements. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. I’ve never had a problem with penicillin, or… anything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. <chuckles softly> I’m pretty lucky, I guess. No allergies. Not that I know of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll need you to lie down so I can check your back and abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need. Just… be gentle with my back, okay? It’s… really sore. <grimaces slightly> I’ll lie down for you. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Okay. I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds clear. And now I’m gently feeling your back. I notice tenderness along your left flank and lower back. No palpable masses. Abdomen is soft, but you do report some discomfort with palpation in the left upper quadrant. Range of motion in your back is limited due to pain. Straight leg raise is negative on both sides. Okay, Ms. Meigs. Thank you for that. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it’s important to investigate the cause of your back pain further, especially given your history of cancer. I'm concerned about potential recurrence or metastasis, but it could also be something else entirely. We will need to order some imaging studies, including a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, and possibly a bone scan. I will also order some blood work to check your overall health and look for any signs of cancer. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: CT scan and bone scan… that sounds serious. Blood work, I understand. <frowns> Is it… is it bad? Is it likely to be the cancer coming back? I… I just want to know what’s going on. And how long will it take to get the results? <looks anxious> Is there anything I can take for the pain in the meantime? It's getting worse even sitting here.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Meigs. It’s natural to be anxious when we're talking about these possibilities. Ordering these tests doesn’t automatically mean it is cancer coming back. It simply means we need to gather more information to make an accurate diagnosis. The tests will help us rule out other causes and determine the source of your pain. As for pain relief, I can prescribe you a mild pain reliever, such as Tramadol, to help manage the discomfort while we wait for the test results. It’s not a long-term solution, but it should provide some relief. I will also advise you to continue taking over-the-counter Ibuprofen as needed, but please be mindful of the dosage and potential side effects. The imaging studies will likely take 24-48 hours to schedule and the results usually come back within a few days after that. I will personally follow up with you as soon as I have them and we can discuss the findings in detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Tramadol… I’ve heard of that. And ibuprofen. That sounds… okay. I guess. As long as we’re figuring out what’s going on. 24-48 hours to schedule… and a few days for results. That feels like a long time. <sighs> But alright. I’ll wait. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining things. And for the pain medicine. <looks hopeful> Do you think… is there any chance it's not the cancer? Just something else? Like… a muscle? Or… something?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. There are many possible causes of back pain, and it’s entirely possible that it’s not related to your previous cancer diagnosis. A muscle strain, a disc issue, or even arthritis are all possibilities. We need to rule those out, and the imaging studies will help us do that. I want to emphasize that we’re taking a comprehensive approach to figure out what’s going on. We're not jumping to conclusions, and we’ll explore all potential causes. I'll write a prescription for the Tramadol now. I also want to discuss some warning signs to look out for while we wait for the results. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, weakness, numbness, or changes in bowel or bladder function, please contact me immediately. Here's the prescription for the Tramadol. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. Really. I appreciate you listening. And for not just… assuming it was the cancer right away. <takes the prescription> I’ll watch for those warning signs. And I'll call if anything changes. <pauses> I think… I think I can go now, right? I should probably get this filled. Thank you again. <smiles weakly>
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I'm glad I could help. Yes, you can absolutely go ahead and get that prescription filled. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll be in touch as soon as the test results are available. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
