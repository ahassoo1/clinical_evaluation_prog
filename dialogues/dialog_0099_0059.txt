DOCTOR: Right. Adyn Swaby, 19 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s my speech. It’s been… difficult. Like, I stumble over my words sometimes, and they don’t come out as clear as they should. It’s been happening for a little while now, I think. Honestly, it’s hard to say exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: "A little while now," is not terribly helpful, Miss Swaby. We need some timeframe to work with. Was it gradual, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right, I’m sorry. It’s just… things have been a bit hazy lately, you know? I… I think it was gradual. Not like one day it was fine, and the next it wasn't. More like… slowly getting worse over… maybe a few weeks? Or months? I really can't pinpoint it. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Alright. A few weeks to a few months. And has this difficulty with your speech been constant during that time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and other days… well, today is one of the worse days, I suppose. It seems to be worse when I’m tired, maybe? Or if I’m trying to explain something complicated. It's… frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, frustration is understandable. Let's see...do you have any other symptoms accompanying this speech difficulty?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… I have been feeling a bit clumsy lately. I tripped over the rug at home just yesterday, and I dropped a hammer at work the other day. Which isn’t usually like me. Does that… count?
DOCTOR: Clumsiness. And when you say clumsy, describe that a little more for me. Are we talking a simple stumble, or something more significant?
PATIENT: It’s… more than just a stumble, I think. Like my coordination isn’t quite right. I almost walked into a doorway at work last week, and I’m having trouble writing as neatly as I used to. My hands just… don’t seem to want to cooperate sometimes. It’s hard to explain. Like they have a mind of their own, almost.
DOCTOR: Alright. Loss of coordination, difficulty with fine motor skills… We'll need to rule a few things out. Now, have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… Not exactly weakness, no. But my legs do feel… heavy sometimes. Especially at the end of the day after work. It’s not pain, just… tired. And a little bit shaky. Is that what you mean by weakness?
DOCTOR: "Shaky," you say. Okay. And are you experiencing any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… Now that you mention it… yes, I think so. Things sometimes seem a little blurry, especially when I look to the side. And… occasionally, things will double. It doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s been happening more frequently lately.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, double vision... Right. Let's move on to some neurological questions. Have you experienced any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… Yes, I get them occasionally. They’re not bad headaches, usually just a dull ache at the back of my head. They come and go. I just assumed it was from stress at work, honestly.
DOCTOR: Stress is a convenient explanation for many things. Alright. And are you experiencing any difficulty with swallowing or speaking?
PATIENT: Difficulty with swallowing… no, not really. But… sometimes my words just… slur, even when I’m not having trouble with my speech. Like they get stuck in my mouth. Is that the same thing? It’s… hard to explain. And it's not constant.
DOCTOR: Slurring speech is concerning, Miss Swaby. Given your symptoms - the speech difficulty, clumsiness, blurry vision, and now slurring - we need to investigate this further. I'd like to conduct a brief neurological exam to assess your reflexes, coordination, and cranial nerves. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… acceptable. If you think it’s necessary, then yes. I just want to know what’s going on, honestly. It’s… unsettling not knowing.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit up straight on the examination table. We'll start with your reflexes. I’m going to gently tap on your tendons to check your responses. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Oh! That was… surprising. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: That was a normal response. Now, I want you to close your eyes and extend your arms in front of you, palms up. Now, try to touch your nose with your index finger. Do this slowly and deliberately.
PATIENT: Oh… I missed. It’s… harder than it looks. My hand feels… unsteady.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Now, follow my finger with your eyes, but do not move your head.
PATIENT: It’s… hard to keep my eyes focused. They keep wanting to wander. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: The findings are… concerning, Miss Swaby. Based on this brief exam, there's evidence of incoordination and possible neurological deficits. We need to investigate this further, immediately. I’m ordering an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities, and blood work to check for inflammatory markers. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… um, no. Not that I know of. I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything. But… an MRI? Is that… serious? What could be wrong?
DOCTOR: An MRI is a diagnostic tool, Miss Swaby, not an indicator of severity. It simply allows us to visualize your brain and identify any potential issues. We need to rule out several possibilities, including multiple sclerosis, a brain tumor, or a stroke, although I'm not suggesting any of these are definitive at this stage. But given your symptoms and these initial findings, it’s crucial we proceed cautiously. I’m referring you to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation and will expedite the scheduling of the MRI. Do you have anyone who can drive you to and from appointments?
PATIENT: Multiple sclerosis… a brain tumor…? Oh, goodness. My husband, David, can drive me. He’s… he’s at work right now, but he can take time off. He’ll want to know about this, won’t he? This sounds… scary.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel anxious, Miss Swaby. It’s always unsettling when faced with uncertainty. I will contact David directly to inform him of the situation and schedule an appointment with a highly-respected neurologist. I’m also prescribing a short course of steroids to help manage any potential inflammation, though this is purely symptomatic and does not address the underlying cause. I will provide you with the details of the neurologist, the MRI facility, and the steroid prescription. We’ll follow up once we have the MRI results. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just… just a daily multivitamin. Nothing else. And… and I sometimes take ibuprofen for headaches, but I haven’t taken any in the last few days. It's… it’s all happening so fast.
DOCTOR: Very well. I understand this is a lot to process, Miss Swaby. I am providing you with a detailed summary of today’s consultation, the referral information, and the prescription. I will also send copies to your primary care physician and your husband. Please contact the neurologist’s office immediately to schedule your appointment. Do not hesitate to contact me if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, particularly any weakness, vision changes, or difficulty with speech. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Um… will… will I be able to drive after taking the steroids? And… what if it is something serious? What are the… the options?
DOCTOR: The steroids should not impair your ability to drive, but it’s essential to be aware of potential side effects such as mood changes or insomnia. If you experience any of these, refrain from driving. As for what if it is something serious… that depends entirely on the diagnosis. The neurologist will discuss all available treatment options with you once we have a clear understanding of the underlying cause. Treatment could range from medication and rehabilitation to more invasive procedures, depending on the condition. However, it’s premature to speculate at this stage. We need to gather more information first. I understand you're anxious, and it’s natural to want answers. However, I want to avoid providing false reassurance or unnecessary worry. My priority is to get you a definitive diagnosis and develop the most appropriate treatment plan. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. It’s just… a lot. Thank you, Doctor Overgaard. I think… I think I’m ready to go home now. I just need to… process everything.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will have my nurse escort you to the waiting area. Remember to contact the neurologist’s office immediately. And please, do not hesitate to reach out if your condition worsens. Take care, Miss Swaby. We’ll be in touch.
