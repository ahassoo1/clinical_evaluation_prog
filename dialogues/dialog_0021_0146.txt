DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thanks, Doc. Uh, well, it’s my muscles, mostly. They feel…weak. It’s been going on for a bit now, a few weeks, I guess. Not suddenly, just…getting harder to do stuff. Lifting things, even just walking sometimes. It’s frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, “weakness”… a few weeks. And it's impacting your ability to lift and walk. Hmm. Can you be a little more specific about the weakness?
PATIENT: Specific…right. Okay. It’s…all over, I think. But it's worse in my legs and arms, definitely. Like, I used to be able to carry groceries in one trip, no problem. Now, I gotta make two or three. And stairs…stairs are a pain. Not a sharp pain, just…takes a lot more effort. It feels like they’re heavier than they should be. I don’t know if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. So, it’s a generalized weakness, more noticeable in your legs and arms, and it’s progressively gotten worse over the past few weeks. And you said it feels like extra effort, not a specific ache or sharp pain. Have you noticed any…twitching, numbness, or tingling anywhere?
PATIENT: No, not really. No twitching, no numbness… tingling, maybe a little in my feet sometimes, but not often. Honestly, I thought it was just from wearing work boots all day. I’m an insurance appraiser, you know, auto damage. Lots of walking around looking at cars. It’s… it’s a physical job.
DOCTOR: Okay, auto damage appraiser… so you are on your feet a good amount. Alright. And the tingling in your feet is occasional. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Actually, yeah. I… I haven’t been eating as much. Not a big change, but I've lost a little weight, I think. Probably five or ten pounds. It’s hard to say exactly, I don't really weigh myself regularly. Just noticed my clothes are a bit looser. And…I’ve been more tired, I guess. Just generally run down.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight loss, fatigue… and the muscle weakness. Let’s take a look at your history here. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. Nothing major. I had the flu pretty bad a couple years ago, but that's about it. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, to be honest. Just usually tough it out.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical history. And no surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Broken a bone or two as a kid, but that's it. Nothing serious. Just a wrist when I was eight, fell off my bike. And a toe, stubbed it pretty bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, minor childhood injuries. What about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family… my dad had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandma on my mom’s side, she had…arthritis, maybe? She was pretty old when she got it. Nothing else that I can think of. Honestly, we don't really talk about medical stuff much.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure in your father, arthritis in your grandmother. And you said no recent illnesses or fevers?
PATIENT: No, no fevers. Nothing like that. I haven't felt sick in any other way, just… weak. And tired. It's just getting harder to do my job, and I figured I should probably get it checked out before it gets worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, weakness, fatigue, weight loss… Do you mind if I do a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, no problem. Go ahead. I just want to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and listen to your heart and lungs. Could you sit here on the edge of the table, please?
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are… a little diminished, but not significantly. Strength is… noticeably weaker in your arms and legs. Not zero, but definitely less than expected. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Everything seems…relatively normal, but your muscle weakness is concerning. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I think we need to do some blood work. To rule out a few things.
PATIENT: Okay, blood work. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doc. What are we looking for, exactly? I don't mean to pry, but I like to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: It's good to be informed. We're going to check your vitamin levels—specifically Vitamin D and B12—and your thyroid function. We’ll also check a complete blood count to look for any signs of anemia or infection, and kidney and liver function. And I'm going to order a Creatine Kinase level to check for muscle damage. Do you have any allergies to any medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. And…I don’t take any medications regularly, if that matters. Just…over-the-counter stuff sometimes, like ibuprofen for headaches.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, no regular medications. Good. The lab is just down the hall. They'll draw some blood. It should only take a few minutes. Once we get the results back—usually a few days—we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity. And if you notice any new symptoms—like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or significant muscle pain—go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. No strenuous activity, watch for new symptoms, and go to the ER if anything changes. Okay. A few days, you said? Alright. Thanks, Doc. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. McKinnon. Hopefully, we can figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better soon. If you have any questions before your results are back, don’t hesitate to call the office. Here's a copy of the instructions for the lab, as well.
PATIENT: Okay, will do. Thanks again.
