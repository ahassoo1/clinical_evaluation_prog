DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit concerning. My patient, old Mr. Abernathy, he’s been bruising like a peach lately. He’s on that… blood thinner, you know, to prevent clots. But it seems like everything makes a bruise appear. A gentle touch, even. It’s… unprofessional, frankly. He’s starting to worry, and so am I.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see Mr. Abernathy here. And you are his caregiver, I understand?
PATIENT: Caregiver is a… generous term. I’m his physician, Doctor. I oversee his care, manage his medications. He just… requires a little extra assistance these days. He's quite frail. And this bruising is new. It wasn’t happening before, not like this. Is there something wrong with the medication, perhaps? A bad batch? I've never seen anything like it.
DOCTOR: I see. My apologies, Dr. Farson. I wasn’t aware. It’s good you brought this to my attention immediately. New onset bruising in a patient on anticoagulation is always something we need to investigate. To be clear, which anticoagulant is Mr. Abernathy currently taking – warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or something else?
PATIENT: Honestly, you'd think that would be in the chart, wouldn't you? Let me see… Ah, here we are. He's on… Warfarin. Yes, that's it. Warfarin. And his INR has been… stable. Mostly. I check it weekly, of course. It's just… this bruising. It doesn't feel like an INR issue. It’s more… widespread. Are you suggesting he's not taking it properly? Because I assure you, I've impressed upon him the importance of consistency.
DOCTOR: Warfarin, alright. And you've been monitoring his INR weekly, and it’s been mostly stable… that’s helpful. While medication non-adherence is always a possibility, widespread bruising even with a stable INR warrants a deeper look. Could you describe the bruising in more detail?
PATIENT: Well, it's not just small spots, Doctor. It's… significant. Like someone’s been giving him a secret boxing lesson. On his arms, mostly, but also his legs. Even his torso. They’re not raised, not painful particularly, just… there. They appear with the slightest pressure. A bump, a gentle touch. It’s unsettling. And it’s getting worse. He's a very… delicate man, and this is frankly frightening him. Have you seen anything like this before? It's… not typical, is it? I've been practicing for a long time, and this isn't how warfarin usually presents.
DOCTOR: No, widespread bruising appearing with minimal trauma is unusual, even with warfarin use. We need to consider other possibilities. First, let’s review his medical history a bit more thoroughly. Do you know if he has any underlying bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Bleeding disorders? Goodness, no. He’s an old man, Doctor, not a hemophiliac. I've done a complete workup when I first took him on as a patient. Everything was normal. I’m quite thorough, you know. He's had the usual aches and pains, a bit of arthritis, but nothing that would explain this. This is… baffling. Are you suggesting I missed something? Because I assure you, I have a very good reputation. Perhaps he's developed one suddenly? Is that even possible at his age?
DOCTOR: I understand your thoroughness, Dr. Farson, and I certainly wasn’t implying you missed anything. It's simply prudent to rule out all possibilities. New-onset conditions can develop at any age, however unlikely. To be sure, let's go through the review of systems. Has he experienced any recent fevers, unexplained fatigue, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, the man is old. Of course he's a little fatigued. He's not exactly bounding with energy. No, no fevers. I would have noticed. And his weight? It fluctuates, naturally. He eats when he feels up to it. This isn’t a mystery illness, it's… bruising. Unexplained bruising. And it’s happening on warfarin. Is it possible the medication is interacting with something? A vitamin? A supplement? He does take a multivitamin. Though I’ve approved it, of course. It's all very… frustrating. I'm wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: Alright. A multivitamin is good to know. Let’s talk about his diet a bit more specifically. Are there any new foods he’s been consuming recently?
PATIENT: New foods? Doctor, he mostly eats bland, easily digestible things. Soup, toast, the occasional bit of chicken. He’s not exactly a culinary adventurer. No, nothing new. Honestly, I’m starting to question why I even came here. This is a perfectly normal patient on a perfectly normal blood thinner exhibiting a slightly unusual side effect. Perhaps a higher dose of Vitamin K? Would that help? I've adjusted his diet slightly when his INR gets too high, but it hasn't solved this. Are you suggesting I’m incompetent, Doctor? Because I find that highly offensive.
DOCTOR: Please, Dr. Farson, I assure you that was not my intention. I’m simply trying to gather as much information as possible to rule out any underlying causes. It’s my responsibility to do so. Now, while Vitamin K can help with an elevated INR, it won't address unexplained bruising. To properly assess this, I would like to perform a physical exam. Can we take a look at the bruising and assess his overall condition?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? You want me, a physician, to show you bruising? I've already described it! Fine. There. Arms, legs, torso. Look all you want. But I highly doubt you'll see anything I haven't already told you. Honestly, I’m losing valuable time with other patients. This is a waste of my expertise. I'm starting to regret even bringing this to your attention. You seem more interested in questioning my competence than actually helping.
DOCTOR: I see the bruising, Dr. Farson, and you are correct—it is quite widespread. It appears to be in varying stages of healing, and there doesn't seem to be significant tenderness to palpation. Given the extent and the lack of obvious trauma, and the fact it is present on multiple body areas, I would like to order a complete blood count and a coagulation panel to rule out any underlying bleeding disorders or abnormalities. Additionally, I think a metabolic panel is prudent, just to assess his overall organ function. Perhaps, also, a peripheral smear to examine the blood cells under a microscope. Is that acceptable?
