DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this shaking. It’s mostly in my hands, I think. It’s been… bothering me. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when it started, just that it’s there now. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik, we'll try to be as efficient as possible. Shaking in the hands, you say. And you’re not sure when it began, just that it's a recent development. That’s alright, we can work through it. Can you tell me a little more about the shaking?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. It’s worse when I try to do something precise, like… using a wrench. I used to work on pipes, you know? Water and wastewater stuff. But even holding a cup of coffee can be tricky sometimes. It’s not constant, not all the time. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable. Is that… helpful? I don’t even know what details are important.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Jezik, thank you. Knowing it’s worse with tasks like using a wrench and holding a cup is a good start. And the fact that it’s not constant tells me something too. So, it’s primarily in your hands, and it seems to be worsened by activities requiring fine motor skills. Does it happen at rest, when you're just sitting and relaxing, or is it only when you're doing something?
PATIENT: Hmm… at rest… I… honestly, I don't remember. I mostly notice it when I’m trying to do something. Sitting… I guess I haven't really paid attention. I usually have something to keep busy with. I don’t sit still well, never have. Does that make sense? I’m probably not being very useful here, am I? It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Mr. Jezik, don’t worry at all. It's perfectly normal for memory to change as we get older, and it’s completely fine that you haven’t specifically noticed it at rest. We'll work with what you have noticed. Okay, so primarily with activity. Now, aside from the shaking, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, my hands sometimes feel… stiff. Not always, but sometimes. And… I’ve been a bit more clumsy lately, dropping things. But I’m old, maybe that’s just… old age. I don’t know. I haven't really told anyone about this shaking, Doctor. It just… started happening. Is this something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness in the hands and increased clumsiness… and you're understandably concerned about whether this is serious. That’s perfectly reasonable. Let’s go through a bit more of your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh, I had my appendix out when I was young. A long time ago. And… I think I had high blood pressure for a while, but I don’t remember taking anything for it. Divorced wife kept on me about it, but I mostly ignored it, to be honest. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. I don’t really like doctors. No insurance either, so…
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal in the past and a history of high blood pressure, though you don’t recall consistent treatment. And you haven't seen a doctor regularly recently. That's good information to have. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I haven't had any reactions to anything, ever. I used to take… something for hay fever, years ago, but I don’t remember what it was called. My wife handled all that. Honestly, I can barely remember what I had for breakfast this morning. Is this… is this going to involve a lot of tests? I really don’t have a lot of time today.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And we'll try to keep things as efficient as possible, Mr. Jezik. I understand your concern about time. Just a few more quick questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have had similar shaking, or any neurological conditions like Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she had arthritis, bad in her hands. But not shaking, not like this. My father… he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life. Never saw a doctor. As for siblings… I had a brother, but we lost touch a long time ago. Haven't spoken to him in decades. As for Parkinson’s or… that other one… I don’t know. Nobody ever talked about that. Honestly, I don't keep up with family news much anymore. Is it alright if we just… skip this part? It’s all very blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother had arthritis, no known family history of Parkinson’s or multiple sclerosis. That’s perfectly alright, we can skip that part. Now, finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Not a single one. Haven't taken anything regularly in… well, forever. I used to drink a bit, but I stopped that a long time ago. My wife didn’t approve. So, no, nothing. Can we be done now, Doctor? I have appointments. And things to do. This is taking a lot longer than I thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Alright, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. Just a quick look at your hands, your reflexes, and your balance. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But make it quick, Doctor. Please. I really am pressed for time. And don't poke around too much, alright? I don't like being touched. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. "Okay, Mr. Jezik, I’m just going to have a look at your hands. I can see a tremor present, even at rest, though it does become more pronounced when you’re trying to do something. Your range of motion appears normal, and muscle tone is… a little bit stiff, as you mentioned. Your reflexes are… slightly diminished. And when I observe your gait, there’s a little bit of slowness in your movements." "Alright, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for your patience."
PATIENT: Slowness, huh? Is that bad, Doctor? Is this something serious? I knew I shouldn't have come. My wife always told me doctors just find things wrong. Just tell me, is this something I need to worry about? And how long is this going to take to fix? I have a lot of things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your concerns and your frustration. It's never easy to hear potentially concerning news, and I want to assure you that we'll figure this out together. Based on the information you've provided and the examination, your symptoms – the tremor, stiffness, slowness, and clumsiness – are suggestive of a condition called essential tremor, or possibly early signs of Parkinson’s disease. However, it's important to emphasize that I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis at this time. Essential tremor is a relatively common neurological disorder that causes involuntary shaking. Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects movement. Both conditions can present with similar symptoms. To determine the exact cause of your symptoms and rule out other possibilities, I would like to order some further investigations. This would include blood tests to check for any underlying medical conditions and a referral to a neurologist for a more specialized examination and possibly a brain scan. A neurologist can perform a more in-depth assessment and potentially perform a DaTscan, which can help differentiate between essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a neurologist… a scan? Oh, for goodness sake. This is exactly what I was afraid of. More appointments, more waiting, more poking and prodding. I don't like this. I really, really don't like this. Can't you just… give me something for the shaking? A pill, a cream, something? I don't need a whole investigation. I'm an old man, Doctor. I've lived a long life. I just want to be able to hold a cup of coffee without spilling it all over myself. Is there anything you can do right now, to make it stop? Just a little something to take the edge off? Otherwise, I think I’ll just… go home. This is too much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I completely understand your reluctance and your desire for a quick solution. It’s perfectly valid to feel overwhelmed by the thought of further investigations, especially when you’re simply looking for some relief. While I appreciate your desire for immediate treatment, prescribing medication without a definitive diagnosis would be irresponsible and potentially harmful. There are medications available to help manage the symptoms of both essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease, but they have side effects and are not suitable for everyone. Furthermore, without knowing the underlying cause of your symptoms, it’s difficult to determine the most appropriate course of action. However, I can offer you a temporary solution to help manage your symptoms while we await further investigations. I can prescribe a low dose of propranolol, a beta-blocker that can sometimes help reduce tremor. It’s not a cure, but it may provide some relief. It’s important to note that propranolol is not suitable for everyone and has potential side effects, such as low blood pressure and fatigue. We would need to monitor your blood pressure closely if we were to prescribe it. Would you be comfortable with trying a low dose of propranolol under my supervision?
PATIENT: Propranolol… more pills. And monitoring my blood pressure? Oh, this is just getting worse and worse. But… I guess a little relief would be better than nothing. I just want to be able to function. Fine. But make it a low dose. And don’t expect miracles. And if it makes me feel terrible, I’m stopping it immediately. And I still don't like the idea of a neurologist. But… alright. Do what you have to do. Just get me the pill. And how long will this take? I really need to go. I have appointments… and things. This is a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. I completely understand. I will write you a prescription for a low dose of propranolol, and we will monitor your blood pressure closely. I'll also send a referral to a neurologist, but you can certainly take your time scheduling an appointment. It's ultimately your decision. The prescription will be ready in a few minutes. I'll also provide you with written instructions on how to take the medication and potential side effects. Here's the pamphlet and the referral information. Please read the instructions carefully. If you experience any concerning side effects, such as dizziness, fatigue, or low blood pressure, stop taking the medication and contact me immediately. I hope the propranolol provides you with some relief. And please, don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Jezik?
