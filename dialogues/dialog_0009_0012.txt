DOCTOR: Good morning, Velda. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I’m planning a cruise – a rather lovely one, actually, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires a bit of medical information before I can go. They sent me a form, and I thought it best to get a doctor to fill it out, just to be safe. I’m not exactly sure what they need, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you, Velda. Cruise lines often have those requirements to ensure everyone’s health and safety. So, it sounds like this is mostly a preventative check-up to satisfy the cruise line’s requirements. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly right. It’s not that I’m ill, you understand. I feel quite well, thank you. Just paperwork, really. I just want to make sure I’m fit enough for all the…excursions. Lots of walking, I suspect. And I wouldn’t want to cause any bother on the ship.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's always best to be prepared, and a thorough check-up is a great way to do that. To start, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, as I said, I generally feel quite well. I've always been reasonably healthy, if I may say so myself. I don't smoke, and I only drink a small glass of wine with my dinner, perhaps three or four times a week. I try to eat a balanced diet – lots of vegetables, lean protein…nothing too extravagant. I do enjoy a good shortbread biscuit now and then, mind you. As for exercise, I enjoy a brisk walk when the weather allows, and I do a bit of gardening.
DOCTOR: That all sounds very good, Velda. A healthy lifestyle is wonderful. Now, have you had any significant medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Well, years ago, when I was a girl, I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox. Nothing serious, thankfully. And I had my appendix removed when I was twenty-two. That was quite frightening at the time, but it recovered well and hasn’t bothered me since. My late husband, bless him, had a touch of arthritis in his knees, but I don’t believe it’s hereditary, and I certainly haven’t experienced any joint pain myself. Oh! And I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle, but that healed up nicely too. Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, childhood illnesses, appendectomy at age 22, and a broken wrist. Are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or insect stings?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take any regular medications at all. I’m very fortunate, I don’t think I’ve ever needed to. As for allergies…well, I’ve always been a bit sensitive to strong perfumes, they give me a headache, but that’s not a proper allergy, is it? And I don’t believe I’m allergic to any foods, although I don’t particularly like oysters, but that’s just a matter of taste. Insect stings…I’ve been stung by bees a few times, nothing worse than a bit of local swelling and discomfort. Nothing requiring an EpiPen or anything like that. I do try to avoid them, naturally!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no medications and no serious allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… let me see. My mother lived to be eighty-nine, and she was quite healthy for most of her life, although she did develop cataracts in her later years. My father had high blood pressure, I believe, and he had a mild heart attack when he was in his seventies, but he recovered well and lived to be ninety-two. My brother has asthma, a lifelong condition, but I’ve never suffered from it myself. As for cancer… sadly, my aunt on my father’s side had breast cancer when she was in her fifties. It was quite a shock. And my grandmother on my mother's side had diabetes, but again, I haven't experienced any problems myself. I suppose there's a bit of everything, really, but nothing terribly alarming, I wouldn't say.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good overview. Childhood illnesses, appendectomy, a broken wrist, no medications or allergies, and a family history of cataracts, hypertension, heart disease, asthma, breast cancer, and diabetes. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, as I mentioned, I live alone since my husband passed. I keep myself busy, though. I volunteer at the local library one afternoon a week, and I'm a member of a gardening club. I enjoy reading, of course, and I do a bit of knitting. I try to stay active socially, I have a few friends I meet for tea or lunch occasionally. I'm not terribly adventurous, I prefer a quiet life, but I enjoy the simple things. I don’t do much travelling these days, aside from this cruise, which is rather exciting! I eat regular meals, mostly home-cooked, and I try to get a good night's sleep. I wouldn't say I have any particularly stressful habits, although I do worry about my cat sometimes – he’s a bit of a wanderer!
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Velda. A full and active life, which is wonderful. Now, to complete the picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a look in your ears and throat. It will just take a few moments.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand. A quick check is sensible. Please, go ahead. I’m quite used to doctors, I’ve always looked after my health, you see. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let’s take a look at your ears and throat… Overall, everything sounds and looks good. Your heart and lungs are healthy, and there are no immediate concerns. Do you have any specific concerns you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very reassuring, Doctor, thank you. No, I don’t think I have any specific concerns, not really. I suppose I was just a little bit anxious about whether I was fit enough for all the walking and sightseeing on the cruise. But you’ve put my mind at rest, thankfully. I’m very grateful. Would you be able to sign the form, then? The cruise line sent it, and it needs to be completed by a medical professional.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Velda. I'm happy to hear that I've put your mind at rest. Based on my assessment, you appear to be in good health and fit for travel. Here you are. I've noted that your blood pressure was slightly elevated, likely due to pre-travel anxiety. I recommend staying hydrated during your cruise and avoiding excessive sun exposure. And please, if you experience any concerning symptoms during your trip, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful, thank you so much, Doctor. Everything looks perfect. I appreciate you being so thorough. No, I don’t think I have any further questions. You’ve been very kind and helpful. I’m much more confident about the cruise now. Thank you again for everything. I think that will be all. I shall leave you to your work.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Velda. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you a wonderful and safe cruise! Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns in the future. Have a lovely day!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. And thank you again for everything.
