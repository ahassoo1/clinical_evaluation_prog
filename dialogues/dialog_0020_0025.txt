DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Beinborn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I want to… how you say… find out more about where my family come from. My people, long time ago. I hear you can do test, with spit, to know this?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can do that. It's a genetic ancestry test, often done with a saliva sample. It can give you information about your ethnic origins, tracing back generations. It’s not always…precise, and it won’t tell you everything, but it can be a good starting point. To help me understand what you’re hoping to learn, could you tell me a little more about what you already know about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… not much, really. I grow up Marshall Islands. My grandpa, he tell stories. About the canoes, and the stars. But… names, and where before the islands… that I don’t know. I just want to know more. Is okay if it not perfect, just… a little bit more to understand. Like filling in the empty places.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's wonderful you have those stories from your grandfather. Those are important, even without specific names and dates. So, you're interested in exploring your ancestry through a genetic test to fill in some of those gaps. Before we proceed, I want to make sure you understand what the test involves, what it can and can't tell us, and potential limitations. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything like that?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never have. Just… old bones. What does the test… do, exactly? You take my spit, and then…? Is like reading a book about my people?
DOCTOR: That’s a good way to think of it – like reading a book, but a very complex one! We’ll collect a saliva sample – it’s a simple procedure, just spitting into a tube. That sample goes to a lab, where they analyze your DNA. DNA is like a code that carries information about your origins. They look for patterns in your code that are common in different populations around the world. This can give us an estimate of your ethnic background, and sometimes even suggest connections to specific regions. It's important to remember it's an estimate. The further back you go, the less precise it becomes. It won't tell you exactly where your ancestors came from, but can provide clues. And it may not include all populations, so the results aren’t comprehensive. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, I think so. Like looking at puzzle pieces, and trying to fit them together. But some pieces missing, maybe? And maybe some pieces from the wrong puzzle? Is expensive, this test? I don't have much money. I live on… what you say… fixed income. Medicare?
DOCTOR: Exactly! That’s a perfect way to put it. Puzzle pieces, some missing, some potentially from the wrong set. And yes, cost can be a concern. Let me check if genetic ancestry testing is covered by Medicare. I don’t believe it is typically covered routinely, but we can explore options. Sometimes, there are financial assistance programs available, or we could discuss a more limited test that focuses on specific regions, which might be less expensive. Just one moment while I look into this for you…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Take your time. I am not in a hurry. Is good to know what is possible. Thank you for checking. I… I always wanted to know more about where I come from. Even just a little bit.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Scobie. It’s a very natural desire to want to know your roots. Okay, so it appears that Medicare generally does not cover genetic ancestry testing when it’s done for informational purposes. However, there are a few labs that offer the test at a reduced cost, and I’ve found a couple of programs that may offer financial assistance based on income. One lab, “Ancestry Insights,” has a basic test for around $99, and another, “Roots Revealed,” offers a slightly more comprehensive test for $149. Both offer payment plans. Would you like me to provide you with information on those options, including contact information and details on the assistance programs?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be very helpful. $99… I think I can manage that. Payment plan… good. Is good to have options. Thank you. Maybe I can finally learn something about my great-grandparents. Or… their parents. It would mean a lot.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad we could explore some options. These brochures have all the contact information and details on payment plans and financial assistance. Take your time to review them, and if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Before we finish, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You been very helpful. Thank you again. I go now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was my pleasure. Please take your time getting up, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or need anything at all. Have a wonderful day as well. And I sincerely hope you discover some interesting information about your family history. .
