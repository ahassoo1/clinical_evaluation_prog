DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Bombara! Well, it's my blood pressure. It's been a little high lately, and my sister said I should really get it checked out. She worries about me, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very wise of her. High blood pressure is something we definitely want to keep an eye on. It’s good you’re being proactive. Okay, so you’ve noticed it's been a little high lately. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, "lately"... probably the last couple of months, maybe? I haven't really been measuring it myself, if that makes sense. I just feel a bit… off sometimes. Like a little headache-y, and tired. Nothing major, honestly. I just figured it was stress, you know? Work's been a bit hectic.
DOCTOR: I understand. "A bit off" and feeling tired… those can be subtle signs. And stress certainly plays a role. Okay, so no formal measurements, but you’ve been feeling headache-y and fatigued for roughly the last couple of months. Do you recall any other symptoms happening around the same time?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh! Sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, but it goes away pretty quickly. It's not all the time, just… now and then when I'm really focused on something, like reading a small print on a label or something. And sometimes, but not often, I feel a bit dizzy when I stand up too fast. That doesn’t happen a lot though.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and dizziness upon standing... okay. Those are good things to mention. It’s helpful to get the full picture. When you say blurry vision, is it in one eye or both?
PATIENT: It’s both eyes, I think. It's hard to say for sure, but if I close one eye and then the other, it seems the same in both. It’s not like one eye is worse than the other, just… everything gets a bit fuzzy for a few seconds. And the dizziness... it’s not a spinning dizziness, just a light-headed feeling, you know? Like I might stumble if I don’t hold onto something.
DOCTOR: Okay, that helps. Both eyes, temporary blurriness, and a light-headedness when standing quickly. Now, before we do a quick check of your blood pressure, let's go over some other things. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, nothing serious. I had a bad bout of the flu a couple of years back, but I recovered fine. And I used to have asthma when I was a little girl, but I haven't needed an inhaler since I was maybe ten or eleven. Other than that, I'm pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat good and I walk most days.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the childhood asthma. It's helpful to have that background. And it’s great that you’re staying active and eating well. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mykeisha?
PATIENT: Nope, never had surgery. I've been lucky, never needed any! Just the usual doctor's visits, you know, check-ups and things. And I had all my vaccinations when I was younger, of course. My mother always made sure of that. She was a nurse, so she was very particular about things like that.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. It sounds like you’ve been well cared for. A mother who's a nurse - that’s a good thing! Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother's still alive, she’s 82 and doing pretty well, living on the island. I have one brother, he lives in the States, but I don't see him too often. And my father… he passed away about ten years ago. He had… heart trouble, I think. That’s probably why my sister's so worried about my blood pressure, now that I think about it. He had to have a lot of tests and things.
DOCTOR: I see. Heart trouble in your father… that’s definitely something to be aware of, and your sister is right to encourage you to get it checked. Do you know what specifically was going on with his heart?
PATIENT: Not exactly. My mother always talked about it in medical terms that went right over my head! I think he had something to do with his valves, and he had trouble breathing a lot. He was always tired. And he had a lot of swelling in his ankles and feet towards the end. It was… sad. But he was a good man. He always made sure we were taken care of. I just remember a lot of doctor's appointments and hospital visits. And pills. Lots of pills.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a difficult time, and it’s natural to be concerned given his history. Okay, so heart trouble in your father, with breathing difficulties, swelling in his legs, and numerous medical interventions. Now, just to round things out, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, take any medicine… never had a problem. I’ve never even had poison ivy! Lucky me, I guess. I’ve always been pretty good with food too, I don't go trying a lot of new things but I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent, no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every day. Nothing else. I figured it couldn’t hurt, you know, to get a little extra boost. It’s just a basic one, nothing fancy. And sometimes I take a little fish oil, but not every day, just when I remember. I’m not very good at keeping up with things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin daily and fish oil occasionally. That’s good to know. Alright, Mykeisha, that gives me a good starting point. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to take a quick look at your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, just to see where we're at. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. I'm ready whenever you are. I just want to know if everything is okay, you know? I'm a little nervous, but I trust you.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Please, have a seat and I'll get started. Just relax and try to take some deep breaths. I'm going to start by checking your blood pressure in both arms, then listen to your heart and lungs. It’s a quick exam, and we’ll take it one step at a time. Hmm, okay. And now the right arm. Alright. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 152 over 90. Now let’s listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. And now, let's listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds on both sides. So, everything sounds good with your heart and lungs, but your blood pressure is higher than we'd like. I’m going to want to run some tests to get a better picture of what’s going on. Are you able to give me a quick urine sample?
PATIENT: Okay. That’s… not good, is it? About my blood pressure, I mean. I was hoping it was just nerves. Yes, I can give a urine sample. Where should I go? I’m not sure where the bathroom is.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s good we’re checking it out. And you’re right, it’s often best to be thorough. The bathroom is right down the hall, just to your left. There's a little cup in there. Just a small sample is fine. Take your time. I’ll be right here when you’re done.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. Hopefully it won’t take me too long to find it. I don't like hospitals, you know? Or clinics. They always make me nervous.
DOCTOR: Just a little elevated, and we’ll figure it out. Just a little elevated...
PATIENT: Here you go. I hope that’s enough. I tried to… you know, fill it up properly.
DOCTOR: Perfect, thank you, Mykeisha. That’s plenty. I’m going to send this off to the lab, and we should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I'd like to order a few blood tests, just to get a more complete picture of your health. It’s a standard panel – cholesterol, kidney function, blood sugar, and a few others. These tests will help us rule out any other potential causes for your elevated blood pressure and give us a better idea of how to proceed. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Blood tests… just normal blood tests, right? Are they going to hurt? I don’t like needles, you know. I always get a little faint.
DOCTOR: Yes, just standard blood tests. And I understand your apprehension about needles. It’s very common. The phlebotomist who will be drawing your blood is excellent, very gentle. And we’ll make sure you’re comfortable. You can lie down if you like while they’re drawing the blood, just to avoid feeling faint. We can also have a nurse stay with you if that would make you feel more at ease. It's a quick procedure, and we'll take all the necessary precautions to make sure you're comfortable. Would you like me to have a nurse come in with us?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… really helpful. Just having someone there… I think that would make me feel a lot better. I’m sorry for being so… difficult.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all, Mykeisha. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about these things, and we're here to help you feel comfortable. Let me call the nurse right away. It will just be a moment. "Hi, Sarah?
