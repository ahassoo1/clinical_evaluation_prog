DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Versace. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am here today regarding a matter with my work. It concerns the masks they are now requiring. I am a Protective Service Worker, and…well, I have some difficulties with them. I'm hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps alternative arrangements.
DOCTOR: Protective Services…right. And what specific difficulties are you experiencing with the masks, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's not that I can’t wear one, exactly. It’s more… a discomfort, a feeling of being…restricted. It makes it difficult to breathe deeply, and it causes a good deal of anxiety, truthfully. It feels like… being held back. I understand the need for safety, of course, and I want to do my part, but wearing a mask all day feels… impossible. I’ve tried different kinds, but none seem to make much difference.
DOCTOR: “Difficult to breathe deeply” and “anxiety”. Right. And has this been a recent development, or something you've experienced for some time?
PATIENT: It's become much more pronounced since they started requiring them, Doctor. Before that, I didn't mind wearing them occasionally, if it was necessary. But now, with it being all day, every day… that's when the trouble began. Before that, it wasn’t nearly so bad. Just a little…uncomfortable. Now it’s… well, it affects my work, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it sounds like a psychological component is at play here. Have you ever been diagnosed with, or treated for, any anxiety disorders, panic attacks, or similar conditions, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Never been diagnosed with anything of that sort. I've always been a fairly… sturdy individual. I've faced challenges in my life, of course – being Lakota, growing up as I did – but I've always handled them directly. This feeling… it’s new. It’s not something I’ve experienced before, and I didn’t anticipate it would be such a struggle. It’s frustrating, to be honest. It doesn’t feel like anxiety, not in the way I understand it, but if that's what it is, then I suppose I must consider that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to clarify, when you say it "doesn't feel like anxiety", can you describe what it does feel like?
PATIENT: That's a… difficult question, Doctor. It’s a sort of… tightness in the chest, a shortness of breath even before the mask is on. A feeling of being… hemmed in. It reminds me of times when I was younger, traveling with family, and encountering… less welcoming places. A sense of being… watched, restricted. It's not a fear, precisely, but more a deep unease. And the mask… it just amplifies that feeling. Like it’s a physical manifestation of that restriction. It feels… suffocating, even though logically, I know it isn't. It's a difficult sensation to explain, truthfully. A feeling… a presence. I hope that makes some sense.
DOCTOR: Right. And you mentioned this started when the mask mandate began at work. Has anything else changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing significant. My work remains the same - assisting those in need, ensuring their safety. I've continued my traditional practices, spending time with family. No major life events, no new stresses… aside from this mask issue, things have been remarkably stable. Perhaps too stable. But no, nothing else has changed that I can think of. I've been… very routine-oriented for some time now, and I find comfort in that consistency. It’s… unexpected, this whole situation. It's unsettling, to feel this way over something so…simple.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Knabenshue, it sounds as though you’re experiencing a significant amount of… distress related to a perceived restriction. To rule out any underlying physical cause, I'd like to do a quick examination. We'll listen to your lungs, check your oxygen saturation, and take your blood pressure. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly acceptable. I understand the need to rule out any physical causes, and I'm happy to cooperate fully. I wouldn't want to cause any unnecessary concern. It's good to be thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I’m ready whenever you are. I trust your judgment, and I hope we can get to the bottom of this. Perhaps it is simply my imagination, but it's best to be certain.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat on the examination table. We'll start with your oxygen saturation. Just relax, and breathe normally. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. . I will do my best to relax. It can be… difficult sometimes, but I will try. I appreciate your patience. I’ve always been…sensitive to confinement, I suppose, but never to this extent. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Oxygen saturation is… 98%. Within normal limits. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, slightly elevated but not concerning given the setting. Lungs are clear bilaterally. No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi detected. So, physically, everything appears normal. This leads me to believe your symptoms are primarily psychological in nature. While I cannot provide a medical exemption for mask wearing based on these findings, I can offer a referral to a mental health professional for evaluation and potential treatment. Perhaps cognitive behavioral therapy could be helpful. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. It is…disappointing to hear, naturally, but I appreciate your thoroughness. I suspected as much, truthfully. To be clear, you are saying there is no physical reason preventing me from wearing a mask, and that the discomfort is rooted in my… psychological state? . A referral to a mental health professional… Yes, that sounds…reasonable. I’ve never considered such a thing before, but if that’s the course of action you recommend, I am willing to explore it. Cognitive behavioral therapy… I'm unfamiliar with it, but I am open to learning more. Could you perhaps provide me with a list of qualified practitioners in the area? And… would this be covered by Medicare?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover cognitive behavioral therapy with a referral. Let me pull up a list of providers who accept Medicare and specialize in anxiety and related disorders. Here. This list includes contact information and a brief description of each practitioner’s specialties. I’ve highlighted those who are closest to your location. I will also document our conversation and the referral in your electronic health record. It's important to note that this discomfort, while subjectively distressing, does not present a medical contraindication to mask wearing. However, I understand your concerns and hope this referral will provide you with some strategies to manage them. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Versace. This is very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. . I will review these options and contact someone soon. I understand your position, and I respect that. Perhaps…just one question, if you don’t mind. . This discomfort… is it something that could worsen over time, if left unaddressed? Is it possible this could escalate into a more… debilitating condition? I’m simply trying to gauge the… severity of the situation, and the urgency with which I should seek treatment. I’m not seeking reassurance, merely… information.
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to predict the course of any psychological condition without a proper evaluation, Mr. Knabenshue. However, unaddressed anxiety can escalate over time, leading to increased distress and functional impairment. It is possible your discomfort could worsen, impacting your ability to perform your duties at work and affecting your overall quality of life. Therefore, I strongly recommend scheduling an appointment with one of these practitioners as soon as possible. Early intervention is generally more effective. Do you have any other questions, or can I finalize the referral and proceed with documenting everything?
PATIENT: You are right, Doctor. It’s best to be proactive. You’ve convinced me to take this seriously. Early intervention is a wise course of action, as you say. . No, I believe that is all my questions. Thank you again for your time, your patience, and your honest assessment. Please, proceed with finalizing the referral and documenting everything. I’ll take it from here. . I appreciate your assistance.
DOCTOR: Very well. I am finalizing the referral now. You will receive a notification through the patient portal once it is complete. I wish you all the best, Mr. Knabenshue. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
