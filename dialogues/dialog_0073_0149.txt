DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Dr. Korrell, is it? Well, it's about this…fuss they’re trying to make over my feet. Honestly, all this poking and prodding…it’s just not necessary. I’ve lived a long life, you know. A long life. And my feet have gotten me everywhere just fine.
DOCTOR: “Fuss,” you say. Alright. And what specifically is this “fuss” about?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s that nice young man, the one who did the…the pictures. Said something about needing…procedures. Something about the bones. Honestly, it all went over my head. And frankly, I don’t want anything done. I just want to be left alone to enjoy my days. It’s my body, isn’t it? They shouldn't be telling me what to do with it.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you had some imaging done…likely X-rays, I presume…and someone suggested a procedure based on those results. And you're not interested in pursuing that. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s…yes, that’s exactly right. All this talk about bones shifting and…and what was it…arthritis? Sounds dreadful. And unnecessary. I’ve had a little ache here and there, always have. It’s just…old age, dear. You’d think they’d understand that. I don’t need them cutting and poking. Just leave well enough alone, that's what I always say. Is it so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Well, “leaving well enough alone” can sometimes allow problems to worsen, Wynell. While some aches and pains are simply part of aging, it’s important to rule out anything serious. Do you recall where exactly on your feet you’re experiencing this ache?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, I suppose. It’s hard to say. Mostly…down there, where you stand. The balls of my feet, maybe? And…and my heels ache sometimes. But it comes and goes, you know? It's not a constant thing. Honestly, it's probably just my shoes. I’ve had these lovely pumps for…well, a long time. They’re comfortable enough, though. Or they used to be.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long have you been noticing this… discomfort, and has it been getting progressively worse?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, that’s a hard question. Years, I suppose. A long time. It’s…come and gone, like I said. I haven't really paid it much mind, to be honest. It’s just…a part of getting older. I wouldn’t say it’s gotten worse, exactly. Just…present. Always been a little something. I can still walk, you know. I get around just fine. Still manage my garden. Doesn't that count for something?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at your medical history here… I see some notes from Dr. Ramirez about potential osteoarthritis, and some imaging reports. It appears the X-rays do show some changes in the joints of your feet. Now, I understand you're reluctant to pursue treatment, but it would be negligent of me not to assess the severity and impact this is having on your daily life. Would you mind if I took a quick look at your feet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More poking and prodding? Honestly, dear, I really don't see the point. I've already told you, I can walk, I can garden, I can live. What more do you need to know? But…alright. If you must. But be gentle, please. And don't expect me to tell you anything you don’t already know. It aches, sometimes. That's all there is to it. A little ache. A harmless little ache. But I’m telling you now, I’m not changing my mind about any…procedures.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s just have a look, then. Please sit back and relax. I'll start with a visual inspection, and then I'll gently palpate your feet to assess tenderness and range of motion. Okay, I’m noting some visible calluses and mild swelling around the metatarsal heads. Palpation reveals tenderness to the touch over the first metatarsophalangeal joint on both feet. Range of motion appears slightly limited, but not significantly so. Dorsiflexion and plantarflexion are intact, though a little uncomfortable for you, I imagine. Ankle reflexes are present and equal bilaterally. Skin temperature is normal, and capillary refill is within normal limits.
