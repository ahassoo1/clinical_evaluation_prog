DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lonell Bahta. I am here today… let me see… ah, yes. I need to get something signed, a paper, for help at home. Something about… hospice, or health at home? My daughter arranged this visit. She said I need a doctor to say it’s okay.
DOCTOR: Right. So your daughter set up this appointment for some kind of home health assistance, possibly related to hospice?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. She explained it quickly, and… well, I am not always the best at remembering details. She said it would allow someone to come to the house to… help. With things. And that a doctor needs to… approve it, officially. Is that correct? I apologize if I am being unclear.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Bahta, no need to apologize. It sounds like she’s trying to get you set up with some in-home care, and I need to assess whether that’s medically appropriate. To start, can you tell me what kind of help you need around the house?
PATIENT: That is a very good question. Honestly, Doctor, it is… difficult to say precisely. I am still quite independent. But… things are becoming more challenging. Simple things, like cleaning, and cooking. And… remembering to take my medications at the correct times. My daughter worries about that last one, particularly. She says I sometimes… forget. And I suppose she is right, on occasion. It is not a major issue, but it is… a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, assistance with housework, meal preparation, and medication reminders are the primary concerns. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions that might be contributing to these difficulties?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease approximately five years ago. It has been… progressing slowly, thankfully. But it does affect my movement, and… my thinking sometimes. It is not constant, but there are days when… things are more difficult. I also have some… arthritis in my hands, which makes cleaning and cooking rather painful. I see a neurologist regularly for the Parkinson’s. His name is Dr. Moreau.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s helpful to know. And when was your last appointment with Dr. Moreau?
PATIENT: Let me think… ah, yes. It was on June 12th of this year. He adjusted my medication slightly. He said it was important to stay consistent with it, but… as I mentioned, I sometimes forget. He also discussed the possibility of a… a physical therapist, but I declined. I did not think it was necessary at the time. Perhaps I was incorrect.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications for your Parkinson’s, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am taking Carbidopa-Levodopa three times a day. It helps with the… stiffness and tremors. I also take Naproxen for the arthritis pain, as needed. Usually, that is two tablets in the morning, but sometimes I need another one in the evening. And… occasionally, I take a sleeping pill if I cannot fall asleep. Temazepam, I believe it is called. But only when absolutely necessary. My daughter keeps a list of everything, actually. It is very helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good your daughter is keeping track of that. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have no known allergies. I have never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I am aware. I have… a slight sensitivity to dust, but it is merely a sneeze or two. Nothing serious. My mother was allergic to pollen, but I did not inherit that particular affliction. I apologize for rambling. I sometimes… get carried away with details.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Bahta. The details are helpful. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'd like to take a look at your hands and assess your range of motion. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Please, proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgment entirely. I understand these things are necessary. I will do my best to remain still and cooperate. Just… please be gentle with my hands, if you would be so kind. The arthritis can be quite… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bahta. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. I noticed some diminished breath sounds on your left side, which we can discuss later. And your hands show signs of arthritis, as you mentioned, with some swelling and limited movement. I'm also observing some tremor in your hands, even at rest. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. It is… a little difficult, but I can manage. The tremor is… more pronounced when I am nervous. Or tired. Perhaps it is both, in this instance. Is there something… wrong? I apologize for my apprehension. I do not often visit doctors.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Bahta. No need to apologize at all. I’m just assessing your overall condition. Your gait is a little slower than usual, and you have a slight tremor, but that is consistent with your Parkinson's diagnosis. It appears you are still capable of ambulating safely with a normal gait. I will not make any judgements. Now, just to complete the assessment, can you tell me if you have been experiencing any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Well, let me think… I have been feeling… rather fatigued recently. More so than usual. And… my sleep has been disrupted. I wake up several times during the night. And… occasionally, I feel a little… lightheaded. Especially when I stand up quickly. It is not frequent, but it is… unsettling. I also have noticed some… difficulty concentrating. It is becoming harder to focus on tasks. And… my daughter says I repeat myself sometimes, but I do not always realize it. I apologize for the lengthy list. I seem to be remembering more as we speak.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bahta. Thank you for sharing all of that. Fatigue, disrupted sleep, occasional lightheadedness, difficulty concentrating, and some memory lapses. Those symptoms, combined with your existing Parkinson’s and arthritis, are certainly something to address. Based on everything you’ve told me, and the physical exam, I believe you would benefit from in-home assistance. We can start with a basic level of care, including help with housework, meal preparation, and medication reminders. We can also explore the possibility of a physical therapist to help with your balance and gait. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… most agreeable. I believe my daughter would be very pleased to hear that. A little help around the house would be… a great relief. And perhaps the physical therapist could… prevent me from falling. I do not wish to become… a burden. So, yes. That sounds… perfect. What is the next step, if you please? I suppose there are forms to be filled out? I trust my daughter has all the necessary insurance information.
DOCTOR: Yes, there are some forms to be completed, mostly paperwork for the home health agency. Your daughter is right to have the insurance information ready. I will also write a referral for a physical therapist, and I’ll include some notes about your specific needs. I also recommend a follow-up appointment with your neurologist, Dr. Moreau, to discuss these new symptoms and ensure your medication regimen is still optimal. To summarize, we’re arranging in-home assistance for housework, meal preparation, and medication reminders. I’m referring you to a physical therapist, and I recommend a follow-up with Dr. Moreau. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not believe so. You have been… most thorough and patient. I appreciate your time and attention. You have alleviated much of my anxiety. Perhaps… one question, if I may. Will this assistance be available… quickly? My daughter is returning from a trip next week, and I would like her to… be reassured that everything is in order. Is there a typical timeframe for such things? I apologize for asking. I am merely… eager to have some… peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bahta, I understand your eagerness. The home health agency typically has a waiting list, but given your symptoms and my referral, they usually prioritize cases like yours. I would estimate you should receive a call from them within 2-3 business days to schedule an initial assessment. It may take a week or so after that to get everything fully set up, but it shouldn't be a prolonged wait. I will also send a copy of my notes to your daughter directly, so she is informed throughout the process. Here is the referral. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Bahta. .
