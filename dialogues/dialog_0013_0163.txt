DOCTOR: Hi Jarvis, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. A pleasure to make your acquaintance as well. Well, to be perfectly frank, it's about a rather… ill-advised dietary experiment I’ve been undertaking. I’m rather concerned about it now, and thought it best to have a professional opinion. It involves a great deal of… celery, and very little else.
DOCTOR: Celery, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Quite a lot of celery. A friend – a rather enthusiastic young man involved in… motion capture, actually – suggested it as a way to rapidly shed a few pounds before a rather important gala. He claimed it “detoxifies” and all sorts of things. I’ve been at it for nearly a week now, and I’m beginning to feel… remarkably unsubstantial. And rather cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jarvis. A week of mostly celery… I see. And when you say "unsubstantial," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s not as though I’m wasting away, you understand. I assure you, I’m still a perfectly respectable six feet tall. But my energy levels are… diminished. And I find myself rather preoccupied with the logistics of obtaining sufficient celery. It’s a surprisingly demanding vegetable, when one consumes it to the exclusion of almost everything else. And, truthfully, I’ve begun to suspect my complexion has taken on a faintly greenish hue. Though that might be the lighting in my drawing room.
DOCTOR: Right, diminished energy, preoccupation with celery intake, and potentially a greenish tinge to the skin. Let's talk about what you've been eating besides the celery, even if it's just a small amount. Anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Goodness, I haven’t been entirely deprived. A small black coffee in the mornings, naturally. And a rather modest portion of smoked salmon on toast – perhaps two days ago. And… let me see… a single biscuit with my coffee yesterday. A digestive, if you must know. A rather good one, actually. But aside from that, it’s been predominantly Apium graveolens. Which, I believe, is the botanical name for celery. I do like to be precise, you see.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your precision, Jarvis. Okay, so coffee, a small amount of salmon a couple of days ago, and one digestive biscuit. That’s… quite a restricted diet. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements since starting this celery experiment?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes. A rather… accelerated transit time, shall we say? It’s… efficient. Perhaps too efficient. And… well, it lacks substance. Forgive my bluntness, Doctor, but it’s not a comfortable situation. It's rather like trying to polish brass with sandpaper – something happens, but it’s not entirely satisfactory. And, frankly, it's beginning to disrupt my schedule. I have a model train layout to complete, you see, and… well, let’s just say it requires a degree of concentration.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jarvis. Accelerated transit time… and impacting your ability to focus on your train layout. That gives me a clearer picture. Have you experienced any dizziness, lightheadedness, or muscle cramps at all?
PATIENT: No dizziness, thankfully. Though I did stumble slightly whilst retrieving a particularly fine piece of scale scenery – a miniature Victorian lamppost, you see – but I attributed that to a rather uneven rug. And no muscle cramps, no. Though my fingers are feeling rather… stiff. I suspect it’s the cold. One does tend to get chilly when one subsists on little more than a fibrous green stalk. It’s hardly a nourishing diet, is it? And I do have rather delicate work to undertake. The detailing on the signal boxes is… exacting.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness or cramps, but some stiffness in your fingers. And you've mentioned being cold. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I'll just take a quick look at your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Quite alright, Doctor. Proceed as you see fit. I confess, I've always been rather fascinated by medical instruments. Though I’ve never been on the receiving end of a great many of them, thankfully. I did assist a friend once with the rigging of a rather elaborate prosthetic limb for a film, you see, so I have a passing familiarity with the… mechanics of the process. Do let me know if I need to remove anything. Though I’m rather attached to my tweed jacket. It’s been with me for years.
DOCTOR: No need to remove your jacket, Jarvis. It looks very comfortable. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… that’s good. Okay, your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, which isn't entirely surprising given your diet. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, just a quick look at your skin. I do notice a slightly pale complexion, and your skin does feel a little dry. And yes, there is a faint greenish tinge, though it's subtle. It could be related to the celery, or it could be the lighting, as you mentioned. Overall, you appear somewhat dehydrated and a bit weak. It’s not a serious condition right now, but it's definitely concerning.
PATIENT: Well, that's… reassuring, I suppose, to hear it's not "serious," Doctor. Though I confess, I was rather hoping for a more enthusiastic endorsement of my dietary choices. Though, in retrospect, that was rather foolish of me. A greenish tinge, you say? Perhaps I should invest in some more effective lighting. Though, truthfully, I suspect the celery is the more likely culprit. It's a rather… dominant colour, is it not? And I have been drinking rather less tea than usual, preoccupied as I am with obtaining sufficient quantities of the aforementioned Apium graveolens. What would you advise, Doctor? Should I cease this… experiment immediately? And if so, what sort of restorative measures would you recommend? I have a rather important model train exhibition in three weeks, you see. It wouldn’t do to collapse mid-demonstration.
DOCTOR: Yes, Jarvis, I strongly recommend stopping the celery experiment immediately. It's simply not providing your body with the nutrients it needs. And you're right, the lack of tea isn't helping with hydration. Let’s focus on rehydrating and getting some proper nutrition back into your system. I’d like you to start with small, frequent meals. Things that are easy to digest. Broth-based soups, oatmeal, yogurt, things like that. And, crucially, plenty of fluids. Water, herbal teas – not just black tea. Electrolyte solutions would also be helpful to replenish what you’ve lost. I also want to rule out any potential electrolyte imbalances or vitamin deficiencies. I’d like to order some blood tests. Nothing too extensive, just a basic panel to give us a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds eminently sensible. Small, frequent meals, plenty of fluids… and the cessation of the aforementioned Apium graveolens. I shall abandon the experiment forthwith. The thought of abandoning it is, frankly, rather relieving. I had begun to suspect it was a folly. Blood tests… yes, perfectly alright. Whatever is necessary to restore me to a state of robust health. I trust they won’t interfere unduly with my train layout. I’m currently working on a rather ambitious section depicting the Highland Railway, you see, and it requires a degree of concentration. And just one more question, if you don’t mind. Is there any possibility that prolonged exposure to celery can result in… a permanent greenish hue to the skin? It’s a purely academic question, of course. But one likes to be prepared.
DOCTOR: No, Jarvis, I don’t believe prolonged celery consumption will result in a permanent greenish hue. The slight tinge you’re experiencing is likely temporary and will resolve once you reintroduce a more balanced diet. It’s due to the pigments in the celery, and it’s not something to be worried about. Here’s the requisition form for the blood tests. You can take this to any lab. They’ll need a sample, and it usually takes a few days to get the results back. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the results are in, so we can discuss them and create a plan to get you back on track. In the meantime, focus on hydration, small meals, and rest. And perhaps steer clear of any further dietary experiments. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You have been most reassuring, and I am deeply grateful for your guidance. I shall abandon the celery forthwith, focus on hydration and small meals, and refrain from any further… adventurous culinary pursuits. And I shall certainly inform my friend – the motion capture enthusiast – that his suggestions are not to be taken lightly. Though, in fairness, he does have a rather unusual constitution. Thank you again, Doctor. And please, do let me know if you encounter any further patients experimenting with extreme diets. Perhaps a warning leaflet might be in order. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jarvis. I’m glad I could help. And yes, I’ll certainly keep an eye out for any other extreme dieters. A warning leaflet might be a good idea! Get some rest and focus on your train layout. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
