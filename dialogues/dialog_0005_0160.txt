DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day for this. It’s this tiredness. Just… dragging. And it’s gotten worse. Plus, and don’t look at me like that, I’ve been… eating dirt. Clay, mostly. It sounds ridiculous, I know it does. Don't judge. It just… feels good going down.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Eating dirt," you say. Clay, specifically. And it helps… how?
PATIENT: Helps? Well, not helps helps. It just… takes the edge off. A little. Like when you have a craving, you know? Only it's… earth. I don’t know why I do it. It's not like I'm out there digging up fancy pottery clay, mind you. It's just… regular dirt. From the garden, mostly. And I feel awful admitting this to a doctor, honestly. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's good you're telling me. We need to figure out why you're having this craving, Candis. And the tiredness, of course. How long has this been going on – both the tiredness and the… dirt eating?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… The tiredness… probably a good six months, maybe longer? It’s been building, slow-like. The dirt… not as long. Maybe three months? Four? It started with just a little pinch, when nobody was looking. Now… well, now I have to make sure I don’t run out. And don’t tell me it’s a vitamin thing. I eat perfectly fine. I always have.
DOCTOR: "Eating perfectly fine," you say. Okay. Can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? This is what doctors do? Asking about food? Fine. Toast with a little jam for breakfast. Not the sugary kind, mind you. A sensible spread. Lunch is usually a salad – lots of greens, some chicken. And dinner… well, dinner varies. Fish, sometimes. Vegetables, always. I don’t eat junk food. Never have. I make everything from scratch. It's just… I supplement it with a little dirt now and then. Happy now?
DOCTOR: I'm trying to understand the whole picture, Candis. And yes, it is helpful. You said "a little dirt". How much are we talking about, roughly?
PATIENT: Honestly? It varies. A spoonful? Maybe two? Some days less, some days… a little more. I don't weigh it, if that’s what you're getting at. It’s not like I’m making a recipe. It’s just… a handful. Okay? It’s not a lot. It’s just… enough to feel… better. And please, don’t make me explain this again. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Right. A spoonful or two, occasionally. And you feel… better how?
PATIENT: Well, less… empty, I guess. It's hard to explain. Like something's missing, and the dirt fills it. It's not a good feeling, not exactly, but it's better than the alternative. The tiredness is still there, of course, but… it's like it takes the edge off the… restlessness. And don't look at me like I'm crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand it's difficult to explain. Now, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Besides being tired and… supplementing my diet? What kind of changes are you asking about? My hands ache a bit, now that you mention it. But I’m old! Everyone’s hands ache. And… I don’t sleep as well as I used to. But honestly, who does? Don’t make a big deal out of nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hand pain, difficulty sleeping. And, just to be thorough, have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Nothing like that. I told you, I’m perfectly healthy. My stomach is fine. It's the tiredness that's the problem, and this… unfortunate habit. And it's not unfortunate if it helps! Honestly, you're making me feel worse just asking these questions. It's embarrassing enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. I understand your frustration. However, this… dirt eating, it’s called geophagy. It can sometimes indicate an underlying nutritional deficiency, even if you feel you eat a healthy diet. It can also, sometimes, be related to other medical conditions. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam and order some blood work. Just routine things, to rule things out. Can we start with checking your vital signs?
PATIENT: Ugh. Blood work. Of course. Look, I’m not paying for a fancy battery of tests. I’m on a fixed income, you know. And I’m telling you, it’s not a deficiency. I eat perfectly well. But fine. Do your vital signs. Get it over with. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And if you find nothing, I want a full refund.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. We’ll start with the basics, just to be sure. I understand your concerns about cost, and we'll only order what's necessary. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Can you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. And don’t squeeze it too tight, alright? My circulation isn’t what it used to be. Honestly, this whole thing is just… a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure is 142 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Honestly, you’re going to find nothing wrong. Perfectly healthy, I tell you. Except for the tiredness, of course. And the… situation. But that's not a medical problem. It’s just… a thing I do.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we’ll want to investigate further. Now, I’m going to check your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Ouch! That’s… a little tender there. On the left side. But honestly, it's probably just gas. I ate a bit of cabbage yesterday. That always does it. Don't make a fuss over nothing. It’s perfectly normal.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little tenderness on the left side. I’m also noting some slight… guarding. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. And, given the tenderness you’re describing, I’d like to order an abdominal ultrasound as well. It’s the best way to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I understand your concerns about cost, and we can discuss options if needed. But I feel it's important to investigate this further. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No! I'm perfectly healthy! Look, this is getting ridiculous. An ultrasound? For a little tenderness? Honestly, you doctors are just trying to run up the bill. But fine. Do your tests. But if you don’t find anything, I expect a full refund. And don’t tell me it’s “for my own good.” It’s a waste of my money. And no, I don't have any allergies. Just… common sense. Which apparently, you're lacking.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. I understand your frustration, Candis. I assure you, I'm not trying to run up the bill. I’m simply trying to get to the bottom of what's causing your symptoms and the tenderness you’re experiencing. The geophagy is also concerning, and we need to rule out any underlying causes. I'll have the lab draw the blood now, and we can schedule the ultrasound for sometime next week. In the meantime, please try to avoid eating the dirt, if possible. It may be causing some digestive upset. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: “Avoid eating the dirt”? Seriously? You want me to stop doing something that makes me feel better? That's just… insensitive. But fine. I'll try. But no promises. And medications? No! I don't poison myself with pills. I believe in natural remedies. Mostly, just… common sense. And a little dirt now and then. Honestly, you’re making me feel worse just talking to you. Now, can I go?
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. No medications. I understand your concerns, and I respect your choices. I've ordered the blood work and the ultrasound. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss them further. I’ll also give you a printout with information about iron deficiency anemia, just in case. And a list of local resources for affordable healthcare. For now, I suggest you rest, and try to avoid the dirt. We will follow up with you next week after the ultrasound. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I’ve wasted enough of my time here. Just get me out of here. And don't bother calling me with bad news. I know my own body. And it's telling me to go home. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Candis. And please, do reach out if anything changes. The lab will be in touch regarding the blood work. .
