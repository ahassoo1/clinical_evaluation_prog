DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Right. Yes. Well, frankly, it shouldn't be a consultation. I've already told the nurse. I'm here for the paperwork so I can get this… thing… scheduled. A little lift, that's all. Don't see what all the fuss is about, honestly. A man wants to look presentable. It’s not like I’m asking for a whole new face.
DOCTOR: A “lift,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a face lift. Honestly, Doctor, are we going to spend all day on semantics? I'm 81 years old, not senile. I know what I want. It's the skin around my neck, mostly. It's… drooping. Makes me look older than I am, which is ridiculous. It’s just… bothersome. And my daughter insisted on this whole process. Said I needed a 'clearance.' Whatever that means.
DOCTOR: A “clearance,” as you put it, is simply a medical evaluation to ensure you are a suitable candidate for elective surgery. It's standard procedure, Mr. Orwin. Now, to proceed, I do need some information from you. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant? Goodness. Let me see… I had a touch of the flu, oh, five years ago maybe? Nothing serious. And my blood pressure, it sometimes runs a little high, but nothing a little less salt doesn’t fix. I don’t do medicines, if I can help it. All those chemicals. I prefer to keep things natural. I was a working man my whole life, you know. Terrazzo work. Very physical. Kept me fit. Still do a little, when the weather’s nice. Though my daughter… she worries.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hm. Let me think. No, not really. I broke my wrist once, when I was a young man, falling off a roof. But that was… ages ago. They set it, put a cast on it. That was it. No fancy operations. Just good old-fashioned plaster. I don't believe in all these newfangled procedures unless absolutely necessary. This… this face thing… it’s hardly a necessity. My daughter’s idea, really. She said I looked “tired.” Can you imagine?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My father had… something with his heart, I think. Died young, he did. And my mother… she had arthritis, bad in her hands. Couldn't knit anymore, poor woman. But that was a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, are we going to go through the whole lineage? I barely remember what I had for breakfast. It's all rather… unnecessary. I just want to know if I can have this done and get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. However, this information is important to assess your risk. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I haven't got allergies. I eat everything. Steak, potatoes, a little bit of everything. Never had a problem. Dust bothers me a bit, but who doesn’t? I worked with stone all my life, you know. Lots of dust. Built a tolerance, I expect. Honestly, I think people make too much fuss about allergies these days. Back in my day, you just toughened up. A little sniffle never hurt anyone. I really don't see what this has to do with a little face lift.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Like I said, I don’t do medicines. All chemicals, you know. My daughter keeps trying to get me to take something for my blood pressure, but I refuse. A little less salt, that’s all I need. I believe in keeping things natural. And I certainly don’t go around taking pills for every little ache and pain. That's for… well, that's for people who aren't strong. I’ve been perfectly healthy my whole life, thank you very much. Now, can we please get on with this? I have a golf game later.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I'll need to check your vital signs and take a look at the area of concern. Then we can discuss any potential risks or benefits. Do you have any objections to a quick examination?
PATIENT: Examination? Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? I’ve been examined by plenty of people in my life. For insurance, for work… I’m a perfectly healthy man! But… fine. If you must. Just don’t take too long. My golf partner will be getting impatient. And try not to poke and prod too much. I’m not a particularly delicate flower, you know. Just get it over with quickly.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a look at your neck. Please remove your shirt and tie. And please, try to relax. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148/85. Pulse is 78 and regular. Respirations are 16. Heart sounds are normal, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There is some laxity of the skin on the anterior neck, consistent with age-related changes. Some mild wrinkling is present. There is no evidence of any masses or lymphadenopathy. Skin turgor is slightly diminished. Alright, Mr. Orwin. That will be all for the examination.
PATIENT: Well? What did you find? Is it something serious? I told you, I’m perfectly healthy. Just a little drooping. Can we just get this scheduled already? I haven’t got all day. Honestly, Doctor, I expected more efficiency. A man’s time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, while you appear generally healthy for your age, your blood pressure is somewhat elevated and your skin turgor is diminished. These are not necessarily dealbreakers, but they do increase the potential risks associated with any surgical procedure. The laxity of the skin on your neck is consistent with your age, and a face lift could improve your appearance. However, I would like to discuss these risks with you in detail before proceeding. We would also need to obtain a clearance from your primary care physician to ensure your blood pressure is adequately controlled. And frankly, I'm concerned about your reluctance to acknowledge any potential health concerns. Surgery is not without risks, and it’s imperative that we proceed with caution.
PATIENT: Clearance from another doctor? This is ridiculous! I've told you, I'm fine. A little bit of salt, a little bit of dust, a little bit of drooping… it's not a crisis. And honestly, Doctor, I don’t need a lecture. I've lived a long life, I know my own body. And I certainly don't need you telling me what I can and can't do. My daughter will be furious if I don't get this done. She’s the one who made this whole appointment, you know. She thinks I look “tired.” Can you believe that? Look, just tell me if you can do it or not. Yes or no. I haven't got time for a debate with three doctors and a health lecture.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with all due respect, your dismissive attitude is concerning. I am ethically obligated to ensure your safety and well-being, and proceeding with surgery without addressing your elevated blood pressure and obtaining clearance from your primary care physician would be irresponsible. I can perform the face lift, but I will not do so until these concerns are addressed. I recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss your blood pressure and obtain a medical clearance. I also strongly advise you to consider the potential risks associated with any surgical procedure, and to discuss these risks with your daughter. Until I receive confirmation from your primary care physician that you are medically cleared, I am unable to proceed with the surgery. I understand this may be frustrating, but your health is my primary concern.
PATIENT: This is… unacceptable. Utterly unacceptable. I’ve wasted an entire morning on this nonsense. And you’re telling me you won’t even look at it until I get permission from another doctor? My daughter is going to be furious. Absolutely furious! Fine. Do you know what? Forget it. I don’t need this aggravation. I’ll find another doctor. One who isn’t so… difficult. This is a waste of my time. A complete waste.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. I wish you the best of luck in finding a physician who will meet your expectations. However, I strongly advise you to prioritize your health and address your elevated blood pressure before proceeding with any surgical procedure. Patient refused recommendations for medical clearance and declined further evaluation. Discharged with instructions to consult with primary care physician. .
