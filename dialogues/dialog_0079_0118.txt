DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Though I must say, I find these forms rather… extensive. One feels as though one is being interrogated, not assisted. But, as I understand it, I’m here for a… certification, yes? Something to do with my work, naturally. It’s a requirement, you see. Though the specifics… escape me at the moment.
DOCTOR: A certification… yes. That does seem to be the note here. Frankly, these forms are rather thorough, but necessary for a comprehensive medical assessment. It’s for your employment, I understand. Perhaps a return-to-work or continued-employment physical?
PATIENT: Return to work… continued employment… those phrases sound vaguely familiar. It is something to do with maintaining my… qualifications. I’ve been in the field a long time, you understand. Healthcare… technical work. It’s all rather tedious, honestly. A great deal of paperwork for… well, for very little actual doing. Is this examination going to take very long? I have a rather pressing appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Oriley, we will be as efficient as possible. However, a proper assessment requires a certain level of detail. To begin, could you elaborate on this “technical work” in healthcare?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s…complicated. Various instruments, calibrations, readings…things of that nature. I’ve been doing it for decades, really. There isn't much point in dwelling on the minutiae. It involves precision, naturally. And a great deal of responsibility. Though the younger generation… well, let’s just say they lack the dedication. Is this going to involve any…prodding? I’m not particularly fond of being prodded.
DOCTOR: “Various instruments…” I appreciate your…brevity, Mr. Oriley. However, to ensure I can accurately complete this certification, I do require some specifics. Are you regularly lifting heavy objects as part of your work?
PATIENT: Lifting? Good heavens, no. Certainly not regularly. Perhaps a small instrument case now and then. Nothing strenuous, I assure you. My work is primarily…intellectual. A great deal of thought, calculation...analysis. Though I suppose one uses one’s hands for calibration. But lifting? No. Decidedly not. Are we to discuss my physical capabilities all afternoon, Doctor? I fail to see the relevance.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Mr. Oriley, as this certification requires me to assess your physical fitness for continued employment. Let’s move on to other aspects of your health. Do you currently experience any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? At my age, Doctor, one always experiences some degree of discomfort. A twinge here, a creak there… it’s the natural order of things. But significant pain? No, nothing I would consider…troubling. Though my lower back does sometimes ache after sitting for extended periods. But then again, who doesn't experience that? Are you planning a full skeletal examination? Because I assure you, it is entirely unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Lower back discomfort… noted. And no, a full skeletal examination is not required. Do you have any history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant medical conditions… hmm. That’s… difficult to say. I’ve had the usual ailments, I suppose. A cold now and then, the flu… I think I had a bout of bronchitis once, many years ago. But nothing…serious. I always prided myself on my robust constitution. My mother always said I had strong Scandinavian genes. Though… I believe I had my tonsils removed as a child. Does that count? It was a very long time ago, naturally. A different era entirely.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy… noted. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me see. I believe I had a slight reaction to penicillin once, decades ago. A rash, I think. But it was so long ago, I can scarcely remember. And… I’m not particularly fond of shellfish, if that counts. It doesn't agree with me, shall we say. But an allergy… I wouldn't go that far. Are you making a list of everything I dislike, Doctor? This is becoming rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: Shellfish intolerance, possible penicillin reaction… noted. Do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, goodness… let me see. I think… yes. I take a small tablet for my blood pressure, occasionally. But only when it gets a bit high. And… I sometimes take something for my digestion, if I’ve eaten something…rich. A small, brown pill. But it’s nothing regular, you understand. My doctor prescribed them, years ago. I have a rather poor memory for these things, I confess. Is it necessary to list every single remedy I’ve ever consumed, Doctor? I assure you, it’s a rather extensive catalogue.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, occasional digestive aid… noted. Very well, Mr. Oriley. Now, if you would permit me, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and a few basic neurological tests. Just to ensure everything is in working order, as it were. May I ask you to please remove your jacket?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must say, I find this entire process rather… unnecessary. But if it’s required for this certification, I suppose I have no choice. Just please be gentle. I'm not particularly fond of being… prodded. And please don’t take too long. My appointment, you see… it’s rather important. Now, get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not concerning given your stated occasional medication use. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Strength appears normal in upper and lower extremities. Now, if you could stand for me, please. I just want to check your gait and balance.
PATIENT: My gait is perfectly normal, Doctor. I may walk with a certain…dignity, but that is hardly a medical condition. I've always been rather coordinated, thank you very much. Though I do sometimes stumble on uneven surfaces. But that’s more a matter of poor footing than a neurological deficit. Are you looking for a disability, Doctor? Because I assure you, I am perfectly capable. Now, can we please expedite this process? I have a rather pressing engagement, you understand.
DOCTOR: Gait is slightly unsteady, mild balance impairment. Compensates with wider stance. Reflexes intact, but diminished. Mr. Oriley, I assure you I am not looking for a disability. I am simply performing a routine physical examination as required for this certification. Based on this brief assessment, your blood pressure is somewhat elevated and you exhibit some mild balance issues. It would be prudent to schedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician to further investigate these findings. Do you have the name and contact information for your doctor?
PATIENT: My primary care physician? Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t seen a doctor in years. I prefer to manage my own health, thank you very much. I have a robust constitution, as I mentioned before. Besides, I’m quite certain these findings are merely… age-related. A slight unsteadiness, a bit of elevated pressure… perfectly normal for a man of my… vintage. No, I don’t have the name of a primary care physician. And frankly, I don’t want one. Now, can we please conclude this examination? I have a rather important appointment to attend to. Is there anything else you require? Or are we finally finished?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Oriley. Based on your refusal of further investigation and your stated preference for self-management, I will complete this certification with the following recommendations: Monitor your blood pressure regularly. Avoid strenuous activity. And maintain a balanced diet. However, please understand that I am obligated to advise you that ignoring these minor impairments could lead to more serious health complications in the future. I will document your refusal of follow-up care. Do you have any questions before I conclude?
PATIENT: Monitor blood pressure… balanced diet… Really, Doctor, I've heard it all before. I assure you, I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself. And I hardly need a lecture from a…well, never mind. No, I have no further questions. And if you’ll excuse me, I believe this examination has run quite long enough. Now, if you'll just hand me my jacket… .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Oriley. Here is your jacket. I wish you a pleasant day. .
