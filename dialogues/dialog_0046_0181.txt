DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It's August 2nd, 2025. I see you're 74 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Glowka. It’s a pleasure to meet you. As I mentioned to the receptionist, I simply requested a general wellness check. I like to keep tabs on things, you understand? I find it’s best to be proactive. A little preventative care goes a long way, I always say. I just want to see the results of the lab work and discuss them with you, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Mombrun. That's a very wise approach to healthcare – proactive care is excellent. I completely agree. Let me pull up your file here… Okay, I see your recent lab results are available. Before we dive into those, though, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. Ask away. I’m an open book, as they say. Though, I must warn you, my life has been… full. But I’ll do my best to be concise. Perhaps we should start with what’s most important? I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you, Mr. Mombrun. We’ll take things at your pace. “Most important” is a great place to start. To begin, could you tell me about any current symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, thankfully, not much at all. I’m quite fortunate, actually. I have a little stiffness in my knees when the weather turns cold, which I attribute to… well, age, naturally. And occasionally, my back will ache after a particularly long day in the garden. But nothing debilitating, nothing that a little rest and some stretching doesn’t fix. Otherwise, I feel quite strong and energetic for my age, if I may say so myself. I still do a good deal of work, you see. Construction, as you know. It keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear you’re so active, Mr. Mombrun. Staying active is incredibly beneficial. And it's good that the stiffness is manageable with rest and stretching. Just to clarify, when you say “cold weather,” is it specifically related to changes in temperature, or humidity as well?
PATIENT: Ah, a good question, Doctor. It’s definitely the temperature, I believe. The humidity doesn’t seem to bother me as much. It’s when the barometric pressure drops, and the air gets crisp – that’s when the knees really protest. It's a familiar feeling after all these years. My wife always says it’s because I can predict a storm with my joints! Though I suspect she's teasing.
DOCTOR: That’s a very astute observation, Mr. Mombrun. Changes in barometric pressure can certainly affect joint pain. It's not uncommon. Now, let's move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see… In my younger days, I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia, but I recovered fully. About fifteen years ago, the doctor mentioned my cholesterol was a little high, but it came down with diet and exercise – thankfully. No diabetes, no heart disease, and I’ve never been diagnosed with arthritis, despite the occasional stiffness, you see. I’ve always been a healthy eater, plenty of fruits and vegetables, and, as I said, I try to stay active. My wife is very particular about my diet, bless her heart. She won't allow me to eat anything unhealthy!
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Mombrun. It sounds like you've been very diligent about your health. And a supportive wife is a true blessing! Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the pneumonia we discussed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing else. No surgeries, no other hospital stays. I’ve been fortunate in that regard as well. I broke my arm as a boy, climbing a mango tree, of course – a foolish adventure. But it healed cleanly, and I haven’t had any trouble with it since. Otherwise, I’ve managed to stay out of the doctor’s office and the hospital, as much as possible. I believe a good, strong constitution and a bit of common sense go a long way.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Mombrun. It sounds like you’ve lived a very healthy life. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: That's a bit of a complicated question, Doctor. My family is…large. And spread out across Venezuela. My mother’s side, I know, had a tendency towards high blood pressure, and a few instances of heart trouble as they aged. My father’s side…well, I didn’t know him very well. He passed away when I was young. I believe there was some talk of diabetes in his family, but I don’t have specifics. It was a long time ago, and records weren’t as meticulously kept, you understand. And with so many cousins and aunts and uncles…it’s difficult to say for certain. I can tell you my grandmother lived to be ninety-five, so there’s good genetics on my mother’s side, at least.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Mombrun. It’s common for family medical histories to be incomplete, especially with large and geographically dispersed families. Knowing about the hypertension and the possibility of diabetes is a good starting point. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’ve been married to my wonderful wife, Elena, for forty-eight years. We have three grown children, all happily married with children of their own. I have seven grandchildren, who are the light of my life. I retired from construction about five years ago, but I still do some light work around the house and in the garden. I enjoy reading, listening to music – mostly Latin American folk music – and spending time with my family. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. We attend church every Sunday, and I’m involved in several community organizations. A simple life, Doctor, but a good one. I believe keeping busy and surrounded by loved ones is the key to a long and happy life.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very full and rewarding life, Mr. Mombrun. It’s wonderful to hear you’re so engaged and have such a strong support system. Now, just to complete the picture, are there any allergies you have – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully, none that I’m aware of. I’ve always been able to eat anything put in front of me, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. My wife always checks when she fills my prescriptions, just to be safe, of course, but I’ve never had any issues. I’ve always considered myself quite fortunate in that regard as well. It seems I’ve been blessed with good health all around.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Mombrun. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of lisinopril, Doctor, for blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it a few years back, as a precaution. And occasionally, I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not regularly. Otherwise, no supplements, no vitamins, nothing else. I prefer to get my nutrients from whole foods, as much as possible. My wife insists on it! She's a firm believer in a natural approach to health.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Mombrun. Thank you for providing such a thorough history. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment completely. I've always found a good physical exam to be reassuring. Go right ahead. I'm ready when you are. I hope my knees don’t object too much to getting up from this chair!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not overly concerning given your activity level. Heart rate is 72, regular rhythm. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezes or crackles. Ear canals are clear, tympanic membranes are normal. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Nasal passages are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Pulses are strong and equal in all extremities. Eye movements are normal. Grip strength is normal. Gait is steady, no apparent neurological deficits. Everything sounds and looks good, Mr. Mombrun. Your exam is largely normal. Your knees sound a bit creaky, but that’s consistent with what you’ve described. I’d like to review your lab results with you now, if you’re ready.
PATIENT: That's very reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you for the thorough examination. The creaky knees are just a part of getting older, I suppose! Yes, please, let’s review the lab results. I'm eager to hear your assessment. I trust your professional opinion, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so carefully.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Mombrun. Let's start with your complete blood count. Your red blood cell count, white blood cell count, and platelet count are all within normal limits, which is excellent. This indicates you don’t have any signs of anemia or infection. Your kidney function is normal, and your liver enzymes are also within normal limits. Your electrolytes are slightly low, specifically potassium, but that could be due to your diet or medication. Your total cholesterol is 210, which is slightly elevated. Your LDL cholesterol – the “bad” cholesterol – is 140, which is above the optimal range. Your HDL cholesterol – the “good” cholesterol – is 45, which is a bit low. And your triglycerides are 180, which is normal. Overall, your lab results are largely normal, but your cholesterol levels are a little elevated. This is something we should address, but it's not an immediate emergency. We can start with some lifestyle modifications – diet and exercise – and see if that helps lower your levels. Do you have any questions so far, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's a very clear explanation. I suspected as much about the cholesterol, to be honest. My wife has been nagging me about cutting back on red meat for years! And you’re right, I do enjoy my food a bit too much, perhaps. Lifestyle modifications sound reasonable. I’m quite willing to make some changes, especially if it means staying healthy. What specifically would you recommend? I’m a bit old-fashioned, you see, and I prefer practical advice. And perhaps we can discuss medication as a last resort, if necessary?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Mombrun. Practical advice is exactly what I aim for. Let’s start with diet. Reducing your intake of saturated and trans fats is key. That means cutting back on red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. Increasing your intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is also important. And incorporating more fiber into your diet can help lower your cholesterol. As for exercise, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Walking, swimming, or cycling are all good options. Even gardening counts! The goal is to get your heart rate up and improve your cardiovascular health. I’d like to see you come back in three months for another cholesterol check. If your levels haven’t improved with lifestyle modifications, then we can discuss medication options. Statins are the most common type of medication used to lower cholesterol, and they are generally very effective. However, they do have potential side effects, so we would weigh the risks and benefits carefully. Do you have any questions about that, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: That all sounds very manageable, Doctor. I can certainly cut back on the red meat, and I enjoy gardening immensely. More walking wouldn’t hurt either, though my knees might protest a bit initially! I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I think I’m a little unclear about the potential side effects of the statins, though. What exactly should I be looking out for? And is there anything else I should be aware of while trying to lower my cholesterol, besides diet and exercise? Perhaps certain foods I should avoid altogether?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Mombrun. It’s important to be fully informed. The most common side effects of statins are muscle aches and pains. These are usually mild and go away on their own, but in rare cases, they can be more severe. We would monitor your creatine kinase levels with a blood test to check for muscle damage. Other less common side effects include liver problems and an increased risk of diabetes. As for foods to avoid, in addition to red meat and processed foods, you should also limit your intake of foods high in cholesterol, such as egg yolks, organ meats, and shellfish. And avoid trans fats altogether, as they raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your HDL cholesterol. There are also some foods that can help lower your cholesterol, such as oatmeal, beans, nuts, and fatty fish. And incorporating more soluble fiber into your diet can also be beneficial. I’m going to print out a handout with a list of cholesterol-lowering foods and a sample meal plan for you. And I’ll also give you a referral to a registered dietitian who can help you create a personalized diet plan. Do you have any other questions at this time, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: That's incredibly helpful, Doctor. The handout and the referral to a dietitian are greatly appreciated. I think that covers everything for now. You’ve been very thorough and patient with my questions, and I feel much more informed and confident about managing my cholesterol. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I’ll be sure to schedule a follow-up appointment in three months, and I’ll try my best to follow your recommendations. I suspect my wife will be thrilled!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. I'm glad I could help. And I’m sure your wife will be thrilled to hear you’re taking such proactive steps to improve your health! Remember, lifestyle modifications take time and effort, so don’t get discouraged if you don’t see results immediately. And if you experience any side effects or have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call my office. Here are the handouts and the referral to the dietitian. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Mombrun, and I look forward to seeing you in three months. Please let the receptionist know if you need help scheduling your follow-up appointment.
