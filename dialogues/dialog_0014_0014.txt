DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Osterholm, is it? Yes, yes. Well, it’s… paperwork, I think. My wife, she handles most of this sort of thing, but something about needing… time off? Or maybe… something official for my work? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I work with the church, you see. Religious activities and education… that’s me. And I think it has to do with… needing forms filled out. For… well, I forget the name of it now. Something about leave?
DOCTOR: Right. Forms. Yes. Well, let’s try to untangle this. You said something about needing time off work?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Time off… or maybe I need something to allow me time off? It's all very confusing. I’ve been feeling… not quite myself lately, you see. A little tired, mostly. Nothing major, but enough that work… well, it’s hard to concentrate sometimes. My wife thought it would be best to get something official, just in case. She’s very practical, my wife. It’s probably about that… FMLA thing? Is that right? Or disability? Honestly, I’m just… drawing a blank.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, fatigue is the main issue, and your wife is concerned about possible leave options. Let’s start with the fatigue. When did you first start noticing it?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did I first notice it? That’s a good question. It… gradually crept up on me, I think. Not a sudden thing. Maybe… six months ago? Around Easter, perhaps? It’s hard to say for sure. I’ve always been a busy man, lots of activities with the church, you see. But it started feeling… harder to get through the day. Like I was dragging myself around. And then I started forgetting things… like names, or where I put my glasses. Which is why I’m here, I suppose. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Six months, around Easter. Gradual onset of fatigue and some forgetfulness. And is this forgetfulness impacting your daily activities?
PATIENT: Yes, it is, I think. It's mostly small things, you know? Misplacing things, like I said. Forgetting appointments. Sometimes I have trouble following a conversation, and have to ask people to repeat themselves. It’s… embarrassing, to be honest. And it makes it hard to do my work. I lead a lot of discussions, and I need to be sharp, you see. It’s… unsettling, not being able to recall things. It's not like me. My wife worries about it a lot. She says I need to slow down, but… well, I enjoy my work. It’s important to me.
DOCTOR: Right. So, fatigue, forgetfulness impacting daily activities… Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, appetite… I don’t think so. My wife does most of the cooking, and I always eat a good portion. I like my food. Weight… hmm. Maybe a little? I haven’t weighed myself in a while. I'm a tall man, you see - six foot two, I think - and I’ve always been… lean. But maybe I've lost a few pounds. Nothing drastic, I don’t think. It’s hard to say. I mostly just feel… tired. That’s the biggest thing. And a little… foggy, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. Foggy. And no significant appetite or weight changes. Now, have you noticed any difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: Sleeping… That’s another thing, actually. I used to sleep like a log, but lately… I wake up a lot during the night. Not every night, but… often enough to feel it the next day. I toss and turn, and sometimes I just lie there for ages, staring at the ceiling. My wife says I snore, too. She’s a light sleeper, so it bothers her. I haven’t really thought much about it, to be honest. Just assumed it was part of getting older. But maybe it’s connected to everything else?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fatigue, forgetfulness, disrupted sleep, and snoring. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can do that. Just… give me a moment. Everything feels a bit… wobbly today, I must say. I don't usually feel this… off balance. Is this what you need? Just tell me what to do, Doctor. My wife always says I'm better when I follow instructions.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just stand still. I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Reflexes are a little slow on both sides. Balance is a little unsteady, as you mentioned. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90. Blood pressure is slightly elevated. Well, it seems you're a bit run down, and your blood pressure is higher than it should be. It's probably just stress and not getting enough rest. We should probably start you on a low-sodium diet and encourage more rest.
PATIENT: Low sodium, you say? My wife is a wonderful cook, but she loves her salt! I don't know how she’ll take that. But… alright. If it helps. More rest… that's easier said than done, with everything going on at the church. But I’ll try. Does this… does this mean I need tests? Or… medication? I don't really like taking pills, if I’m honest. And I'm a bit worried about what all this means… Is this something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Honestly, Mr. Limtiaco, you're probably just overworked and stressed. We can run some blood tests to rule out anything major, but I doubt it’s anything serious. A simple change in diet and a bit more relaxation is probably all you need. As for medication, let's hold off on that for now. We'll see what the blood tests say first. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We'll also check your vitamin D levels. The lab results should be back in a few days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment then. Try to take it easy in the meantime. And seriously, cut back on the salt. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… Tests… alright. My wife will be relieved to hear that you're looking into it. She's always been very cautious. Vitamin D… I do spend most of my time indoors, working with the church. Oh! The paperwork! That's what I came for. The forms… for my work. The… FMLA or disability, or whatever it was called? Do you think… could you fill those out, Doctor? Just in case I need them? It's… a bit complicated, with everything going on. My wife handles all the details, but she needs you to sign the forms. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Right, the forms. Of course. Everyone wants paperwork. Let me see… FMLA, disability… Yes, here we are. I'll just indicate fatigue and potential stress as the reasons for leave. I can’t make any definitive statements about disability without knowing the results of the tests, of course. Here you go. Fill in the rest of the details and bring it back to me when you're done. And don’t worry too much about it. I'm sure everything will be fine. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Details… yes, my wife will help with the details. She’s very organized. No, I don’t think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. And… for the tests. You wouldn’t happen to have any suggestions for… for helping me sleep, would you? Just something… simple? My wife suggested chamomile tea, but… it doesn’t seem to work.
DOCTOR: Honestly, Mr. Limtiaco, I'm a doctor, not a miracle worker. Try a warm bath before bed. Avoid caffeine and alcohol. And try to relax. That's all I can tell you. I really must get to my next patient. Is there anything else before I go?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Warm bath… yes, my wife says I should try that. Thank you again, Doctor. For your time. I’ll… I’ll see you at the follow-up appointment. .
