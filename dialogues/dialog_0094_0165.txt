DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide. Been havin' this fever come and go. It's been… well, a couple of weeks now, I guess. It ain't nothin' major, usually just a little warm, but it’s botherin' me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide, a couple of weeks of on-and-off fever. That is worth checking out. Can you tell me a little more about the fever?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts in the afternoon, feels like a regular ol' fever, you know? Not super high, I haven’t taken my temperature exactly, but I can tell. Then it usually breaks by the next morning. Happens every few days, nothin’ consistent. I just wanna make sure it ain't somethin' serious. My wife, Elena, she gets worried.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you're paying attention to it, and Elena sounds like a very caring wife. Not having a consistent pattern can be a little tricky, but we'll figure it out. When the fever is present, do you experience any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a little tired, achy, like I got a little flu. No cough, no sniffles. Mostly just the warm feeling and the tiredness. And… now that I think about it, maybe a little bit of a headache sometimes, but not always. It’s hard to say, Doctor. Old age, you know? Things always achin' one way or another.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be difficult to pinpoint things when you have some baseline aches and pains. Okay, so fatigue, body aches, and occasional headaches when the fever is present. No cough or sniffles. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Nah, appetite's been normal. Elena keeps me fed, that woman! And I ain’t lost any weight, thankfully. Still the same size… maybe a little more size if I’m bein’ honest, with all Elena’s cookin’! But no, no weight loss. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! It’s wonderful you have a good appetite, and Elena sounds like an excellent cook. Let’s talk about your medical history a bit, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. Just the usual ol’ aches and pains. High blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on a pill for it and it’s been alright ever since. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothin’ major. And I haven’t been to the hospital for anything serious in… well, I couldn’t even tell you when. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, otherwise generally healthy. Do you recall the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… Elena handles all that stuff, she’s good with remembering things. I think it’s… Lisinopril? Yeah, Lisinopril, I think that’s it. Small white pill. I take one every morning with breakfast. She makes sure I don't miss it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. Good. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, not a single one. Never been under the knife. I try to stay healthy, you know? Avoid those things if I can. Never had the need for it, thankfully. Just a few stitches here and there when I was a kid, fallin’ off my bike and such, but nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had… diabetes, I think. And my father, he had heart problems later in life. Both gone now, unfortunately. Elena’s side, her mother was healthy as a horse, but her father… he had some trouble with his lungs when he got older. Nothing real specific, I don't know all the details. It was a long time ago, and we weren’t real close to her family.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your father, and lung issues in Elena’s father. Now, let’s talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life, Doctor. Elena wouldn't allow it! She's real strict about that. Always said it was a bad habit. And I gotta say, she’s right. No smokin’ here. Drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. Nothing heavy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No smoking, and only occasional wine. Now, I'm going to ask you about any allergies you may have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat just about anything, thankfully. Elena's a great cook, and I enjoy trying new things. No hives, no swelling, no trouble breathin'... nothin'. She’s always askin’ me if somethin’ tastes funny before I eat it, just to be sure, but I’ve never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's excellent. Now, let’s get back to this fever for a moment. You said it's been a couple of weeks. Has anything changed in your life recently that might be contributing to it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, Doctor. Same routine as always. Wake up, eat breakfast with Elena, maybe a little walk in the park, watch some TV. We went to visit my niece in Florida last month, but that was a couple of weeks ago. No travel since then, no changes at work… Just the usual. Maybe the weather's been a little hotter than usual, but that’s about it. It's been real humid too, but I ain’t been feelin’ sick during the heat, just the fever comin’ and goin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent significant changes in your life. That’s helpful to know. I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your temperature, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat. Just standard things, to get a better idea of what's going on.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just gettin’ old, I guess, gotta get poked and prodded. Go ahead, do what you gotta do. I’ll just sit here and try not to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. Let’s start with your temperature. Your temperature is 100.4 Fahrenheit. That's a low-grade fever. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. No swollen tonsils or white patches. Lymph nodes are not significantly enlarged. Everything seems relatively normal so far, Clide, but the fever is still present. It could be a mild viral infection, or something else. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order some blood work. It’ll help us rule out anything serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems smart. Whatever you think is best. I ain’t real fond of needles, but if it gets to the bottom of things, I’m all for it. Just tell me what I gotta do, and I’ll get it done. Is it gonna be expensive? I ain't got insurance, you see… Elena and I, we're on a fixed income.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Clide. It’s good you asked. We'll try to keep it as affordable as possible. The basic blood work I'm ordering – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – should be around $150-$200. I’ll also check a CRP to see if there’s any inflammation. We can discuss payment options at the front desk, and they may have programs available for patients without insurance. Now, for the blood work, you’ll just need to have a few vials of blood drawn from your arm. It’s a quick procedure, and the phlebotomist will be very gentle. It will take about 10-15 minutes. Would you like me to give you a lab order now?
PATIENT: $150-$200, huh? That's… manageable. We can swing that, I guess. Elena'll be relieved it ain't worse. Yeah, go ahead and give me the order, Doctor. Let’s get this over with. I just wanna feel normal again, you know? And Elena's worried sick. She's a good woman. Just tell me where to go to get it done. I'll get right over there.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Clide. I understand. Here’s the lab order. The lab is just across the street, at 123 Main Street. You’ll want to tell them you're here for blood work ordered by Dr. Gegan. They’re open until 5 PM today. Once the results are back – usually within 24-48 hours – you can have them faxed directly to the clinic at 555-123-4567, or you can pick them up and bring them in. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions about the lab order or the follow-up process?
PATIENT: No, that’s clear enough, Doctor. Across the street, 123 Main Street. Fax them to 555-123-4567. Got it. I think that covers everything. I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly. And thanks for not makin’ a fuss about the insurance thing. A lot of doctors give you the runaround about that. Alright, I guess I'll be headin’ out then. Hopefully, the results come back soon. Tell Elena I said hello, and I'll see you when I see you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Clide. It’s my pleasure. And please give Elena my regards as well. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. .
