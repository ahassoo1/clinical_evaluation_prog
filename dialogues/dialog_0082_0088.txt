DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jaylyne. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s this ringing in my ears. It’s been… annoying, to say the least. It started a few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Ringing in the ears, alright. A few weeks ago… hmm. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it's not constant. It comes and goes. Sometimes it's a high-pitched whine, other times it’s more like a buzzing. It's hard to describe. It's definitely worse when it’s quiet, like when I’m trying to sleep. Makes it hard to get a good night’s rest, you know? I work shifts, being a waiter, so… it’s not ideal.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent ringing, varying in pitch… worse with quiet and impacting sleep. And you mentioned shift work. Do you find it’s related to being at work at all?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. The restaurant gets really loud, lots of chatter, music playing… I feel like it gets worse after a busy shift. Like, I'll be fine during, but then when I get home and it’s quiet… bam. It’s louder then. Not sure if that makes sense. I haven’t really noticed it getting worse during work, just afterwards.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Jaylyne. Loud environment at work, followed by ringing when it’s quiet. It sounds like it could be related to noise exposure. Now, have you ever been exposed to any really loud noises outside of work?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I can recall, really. Maybe fireworks once or twice, but nothing consistent. I used to listen to music pretty loud with headphones, but I stopped doing that a while ago. It was probably a bad habit, looking back on it. I’m trying to think of anything else… nothing springs to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially some past noise exposure with the headphones. Let's talk about your ears themselves. Have you ever had any ear infections?
PATIENT: No, not that I remember. Never had any trouble with ear infections. Or, well, nothing I needed to see a doctor for anyway. I get the occasional blocked feeling when I fly, but that goes away pretty quickly. I’ve never had any pain or discharge or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Good. No history of infections, no pain or discharge. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I try to stay healthy, you know? Just basic vitamins sometimes, but that’s it. I don't really like taking pills unless I have to.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No medications. Now, before we do a quick examination of your ears, have you noticed any dizziness, hearing loss, or fullness in your ears besides the blocked feeling when you fly?
PATIENT: No dizziness, thankfully. And my hearing seems okay, as far as I can tell. I can hear people talking, the TV… nothing seems muffled or anything. The fullness when I fly is just that – a bit of pressure, it doesn’t last long. The ringing is the main problem, really. It’s just… persistent when it happens.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jaylyne. No dizziness, hearing seems intact, and the main issue is this intermittent ringing. Let's just take a quick look at your ears to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. I just want to figure out what’s causing it, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to take a look inside your ears with this instrument. It won’t hurt, but let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Alright… externally, your ears look normal. The ear canals are clear. The tympanic membranes… appear intact. No signs of infection, fluid, or perforation. Everything looks normal, which is good. It doesn’t seem to be a structural issue causing the ringing. It’s likely related to what you’ve described – noise exposure, perhaps. Given your history, it sounds like you may be experiencing tinnitus, which is ringing or buzzing in the ears. It can be caused by a variety of factors, and noise exposure is a common one.
PATIENT: Tinnitus… okay. So, there’s a name for it, that's good to know. Is it… serious? Like, is it something I need to worry about? I mean, will it get worse? I just don’t want to end up completely deaf or something.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Jaylyne. The good news is, tinnitus itself is rarely a sign of a serious underlying condition. It can be quite bothersome, and sometimes frustrating, but it doesn’t usually lead to deafness. In your case, given your history, it's most likely related to temporary damage to the tiny hair cells in your inner ear from noise exposure. However, we always want to rule out other potential causes, just to be safe. I’m going to recommend a hearing test – an audiogram – just to get a baseline assessment of your hearing levels and confirm there’s no significant hearing loss. That’s standard procedure with tinnitus. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, a hearing test sounds good. Better safe than sorry, right? If that’s what you recommend, then let’s do it. When can I get it done? And… is it expensive? I don’t have the best insurance, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Jaylyne. It’s always best to be thorough. We can schedule the hearing test right here at the clinic. Let me see… We have an opening next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00 PM should be fine. Yeah, that works perfectly. And about the cost… how much is it, roughly? I just need to know what I’m looking at.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me check… With your insurance, the cost will be approximately $75. However, I'll have the billing department verify the exact amount for you based on your specific plan. They can call you with a more precise estimate. Now, while we wait for the results of the hearing test, I recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible. If you are exposed to loud environments, wear earplugs or earmuffs. Also, managing stress can sometimes help with tinnitus. Do you have any hobbies or activities that you find relaxing?
PATIENT: Okay, $75 sounds manageable. Thanks for checking. And yeah, good advice about the noise. I'll definitely try to be more careful. As for relaxing… I like fishing, when I have the time. And I try to spend time with my daughter. It’s not always easy, with work and everything, but that helps me unwind.
DOCTOR: Fishing and spending time with your daughter… those are excellent ways to manage stress, Jaylyne. That’s great. We'll schedule that hearing test for Tuesday at 2:00 PM, and once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, if the ringing gets significantly worse, or if you experience any dizziness, hearing loss, or pain, please call the clinic right away. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been really helpful, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen and explain things. I feel a bit better just knowing what it might be and having a plan to check it out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. That’s what I’m here for. We’ll get this checked out and hopefully get you some relief. Here’s a summary of our discussion and your hearing test appointment information. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and enjoy your time with your daughter.
PATIENT: Thanks again, Doctor. You too. .
