DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. My name is Dr. Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, if you don't mind getting straight to it. I'm pretty busy, and I'm hoping it's nothing major.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I appreciate your directness. Let me pull up your records… Yes, here we are. You came in on July 18th with complaints of fatigue and some intermittent abdominal discomfort, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Fatigue mostly, honestly. The stomach thing was… occasional. Not a big deal, really. Like, after certain foods, maybe. I don't remember exactly what foods, though. It was a while ago. Is the fatigue something serious? That's what I'm really worried about.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the fatigue, Ms. Kovtun. It's always best to investigate the cause. The initial bloodwork showed slightly low iron levels and vitamin D deficiency. We also ran a comprehensive metabolic panel and a complete blood count. The metabolic panel was within normal limits, but your complete blood count revealed a mild anemia. To clarify, could you describe the fatigue a bit more?
PATIENT: Okay, low iron, that… explains a lot, probably. I’m always tired. Like, always. It's not just after a long day, it’s waking up tired, feeling drained all the time, even if I get eight hours of sleep. Makes it hard to concentrate, too. And I feel cold a lot, even when it's warm. Does that make sense? I don’t know what details you need, exactly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Feeling tired despite adequate sleep, difficulty concentrating, and feeling cold frequently are all consistent with iron deficiency anemia. It's good you're describing this so thoroughly. To get a better understanding of the potential cause of the iron deficiency, could you tell me a bit about your diet?
PATIENT: Ugh, my diet? Honestly, it’s probably not the best. I work long hours, so it’s a lot of quick things. Takeout, sandwiches, whatever’s easy. I try to eat fruit sometimes, but I definitely don’t get enough… anything, really. I don’t eat a lot of red meat. I used to, but… I don't know, just stopped. Is that a problem? I'm not a big cook.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Kovtun. A diet lacking in iron-rich foods, particularly red meat, can certainly contribute to iron deficiency. It’s also important to consider how well your body is absorbing iron. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, even occasionally?
PATIENT: Blood in my stool? No, not that I've seen. I… pay attention to that sort of thing, I guess? Not regularly, but I’d definitely notice something like that. No, definitely not. I mean, I haven’t seen anything. Is that a sign of something bad? You’re starting to worry me a little, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re attentive to your body, Ms. Kovtun, and it's perfectly normal to feel concerned when we’re exploring potential causes. I was simply asking to rule out any potential sources of blood loss. Now, let's talk about your menstrual cycle. Are you currently menstruating?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Um… no, not currently. And, well, they're… irregular. Sometimes they're pretty normal, sometimes they're really light, sometimes they're… longer. It’s never been consistent, honestly. Never really bothered me enough to mention it to a doctor before. It’s just… how it’s always been. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That is relevant, Ms. Kovtun. Irregular menstrual cycles can sometimes contribute to iron deficiency due to heavier or prolonged bleeding. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing chronic. I’ve had the usual colds, flu, that kind of thing. Broken a wrist when I was a kid, but that healed fine. Nothing major, ever. I’m generally pretty healthy, besides this tiredness. Seriously. I just want to figure out what's making me so exhausted.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And no surgeries, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Definitely not. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I guess. Look, Doctor, can we just get to what I need to do about this tiredness? Are we talking pills? Changes to my diet? I have a really busy week.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kovtun. We're getting there. Based on your symptoms and the lab results, the most likely cause of your fatigue is iron deficiency anemia, likely related to dietary factors and potentially irregular menstrual cycles. To confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity, I’d like to order a few additional tests: a ferritin level to get a more accurate measure of your iron stores, and a Vitamin B12 level to rule out another potential cause of fatigue. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ferritin and B12... Okay, fine. Whatever tests you need. Just tell me how long it'll take to get the results, and if they require me to come back here. I really need to get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kovtun. The lab usually takes 3-5 business days to return the results. I will have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they are available. If the results show a significant deficiency, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss treatment options, which could include iron supplementation and dietary changes. In the meantime, you might consider incorporating more iron-rich foods into your diet, such as leafy green vegetables, lean meats, and fortified cereals. However, please do not start taking any iron supplements before we discuss the results, as excessive iron can be harmful. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
