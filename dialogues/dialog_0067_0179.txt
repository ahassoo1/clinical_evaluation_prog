DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… very nice to meet you too. Hmm. What brings me in… yes. It is… the words. They… do not come so easy now. It is difficult. I forget… what I want to say, sometimes. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with word-finding and memory, and that it's causing you some frustration. That’s a valid concern. Can you tell me a little more about when you first started noticing this?
PATIENT: Hmm. When… that is a good question. It feels… like a long time now. Perhaps… six months? Or more? It is… not a sudden thing. Just… slowly getting worse, I think. I do not… remember a specific day, if that makes sense. It is… vague.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. It’s very common for these things to come on gradually. So, over the past six months or so, you've noticed a slow decline in your ability to find the right words, and your memory feels… less sharp?
PATIENT: Yes. Less sharp is… a good way to put it. Like… a photograph that is not in focus. I know the word is there… somewhere… but it… slips away. And sometimes… I forget… what I was doing. Small things, mostly. Like… where I put my glasses. Or… the name of a… flower. It is… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Sherrell. It’s definitely concerning when you notice changes in your memory and thinking. And comparing it to a blurry photograph is a very helpful way to describe it. Now, are these memory slips happening all the time, or are there specific times of day, or situations, when they seem to be worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specific times… let me think. It is… worse when I am tired, I think. And… if there is a lot of noise. If people are talking all at once, it is… very difficult to concentrate. Then the words… they hide even more. And… when I am stressed. Yes. Stress is… not good for the words.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, noise, and stress seem to be triggers that make it more difficult. That's helpful to know. Now, outside of the difficulty with word-finding and memory, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me see. I… do not feel as… energetic as I used to. I tire more easily, even without the… the word trouble. And… sometimes I feel a little… sad. Not all the time, but… more often than before. My wife… she passed away two years ago. It is… still hard.
DOCTOR: I am so sorry to hear about your wife. Losing someone you love is incredibly difficult, and it's perfectly natural to still be grieving after two years. It sounds like you've been through a lot. And thank you for sharing about the fatigue. That’s important information. Just to clarify, is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I think. Some days are better than others. But… it is always there, a little bit. Even on good days, I cannot do… as much as I used to. I used to… garden a lot. Now… I can only do a little bit at a time. I have to sit down… often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the fatigue is present most days, but fluctuates in intensity. It’s affecting your ability to do activities you used to enjoy, like gardening. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… alright. Hmm. Medical conditions… let me think. I had… high blood pressure, for many years. But… the doctor put me on medicine. It is… controlled now, I think. And… I had a little problem with my heart, a long time ago. But… they fixed it. Surgery, many years ago. I do not… see that doctor anymore. It was… successful, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, currently controlled with medication, and a heart condition that was surgically corrected some time ago. Do you remember approximately when you had the heart surgery?
PATIENT: Hmm. When… that is difficult. It was… a long time ago. Perhaps… twenty years? Or more? It was… before my wife… became very ill. Before… 2010, I think. Yes. Before 2010. It was… a big operation. I was… very sick. But… I recovered well.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately before 2010. That's helpful. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… yes. I take… something for my arthritis. In my hands. It makes them… ache. And… something for my stomach. Sometimes… I have trouble with… indigestion. And… the blood pressure medicine, of course. I think… that is all.
DOCTOR: Alright. To get a better picture of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, and neurological function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… alright. A quick exam… that sounds… good. I hope… it does not take too long. I do not… like to be poked and prodded too much. But… if it helps, then… yes. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148/85, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Neurologically, your reflexes are normal, and your coordination seems good. I don’t see any obvious focal deficits. Now, given your symptoms, and your medical history, I'd like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid function, vitamin B12 levels, and a complete blood count. These tests can help rule out some common causes of memory problems and fatigue. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… sensible. Blood tests… to check the thyroid and… the vitamins. To rule things out. Yes. That is… good. If it helps… find out what is wrong. Please. I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Sherrell. I appreciate your trust. I'll also order a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes. And, given your concerns about memory, I'd like to do a brief cognitive assessment – just a few simple questions to get a baseline. It's a quick, non-invasive test. If the blood tests are normal and the cognitive assessment raises any concerns, we may need to consider further evaluation, such as a brain scan. But let's start with these tests and see what they show. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… very reasonable. A reasonable plan is… good. Kidney function and… electrolytes. And the cognitive assessment. Questions… to get a baseline. That is… sensible. I trust you, Doctor. If you think it is necessary… then I agree. I just… want to know what is happening. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand, Sherrell. It is unsettling when you're experiencing changes you can't explain. That’s why we’re doing these tests – to get some answers and provide you with the best possible care. I'll have the lab order sent over, and they'll contact you to schedule an appointment. It will likely be a fasting blood draw, so it’s best to avoid eating or drinking anything for 8-12 hours beforehand. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and trying to manage your stress levels. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I do not think so. You have… explained everything very clearly. Rest and… hydration. Manage the stress. Yes. I will… try. Thank you, Doctor. For… listening. And for… taking the time. It is… very much appreciated.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. I’m glad I could help. We'll get these tests scheduled as soon as possible, and we'll discuss the results as soon as they're available. Here’s a copy of the lab order and a summary of our discussion today. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, Sherrell. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll figure this out together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will… try not to worry. It is… good to know I am in good hands.
