DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailia. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though, I must say, this waiting room wasn't terribly…refined. But never mind that. I am here because I’ve been experiencing quite a bit of fatigue lately, and, rather disturbingly, I’ve been waking up soaked in sweat most nights. And, naturally, I am hoping to lose some weight. It's simply…unbecoming.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and night sweats… and you’d like to discuss weight loss as well. I understand. It's good you're addressing these concerns. Let’s start with the fatigue and night sweats. Can you tell me a little more about when these started?
PATIENT: Well, it began approximately… let me see… about three months ago, I believe. It was rather gradual at first, just feeling a little more tired than usual. But it has steadily worsened. The night sweats… they started a little after that, perhaps two months ago. It’s quite disruptive, I assure you. And rather unpleasant. I have always maintained a very strict routine, and this is… decidedly not part of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three months of increasing fatigue, night sweats for about two months. And this is a change from your usual routine. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and sweats?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I've been…slightly less hungry than usual. Not a complete loss of appetite, mind you, but I don’t find myself craving things as I once did. And, if I am being perfectly honest, I've noticed a rather bothersome, intermittent aching in my joints. It's not constant, thankfully, but it’s…unsettling. It feels rather…old-fashioned, if that makes any sense. Like something my grandmother would complain about.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite and intermittent joint aches… okay. And where are you experiencing the joint aches specifically?
PATIENT: Primarily in my knees, Doctor. And sometimes in my wrists. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. And it seems to be worse in the mornings, or after I’ve been sitting for an extended period. I do spend a great deal of time at my workstation, you understand. Graphic design requires a considerable amount of focus, and therefore, stillness. It’s hardly a sedentary lifestyle, but it’s…particular.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and wrists, worse in the mornings and after sitting. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I pride myself on maintaining excellent health. I’ve never had any serious illnesses or surgeries. A few minor colds, naturally, but nothing of consequence. I have always been very careful about my diet and exercise, and I avoid unnecessary risks. My family has a history of…robust health, generally speaking. Though my aunt did have a rather unfortunate incident with a sprained ankle, but that was entirely her own fault. She was attempting a particularly daring yoga pose.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. No major medical history. And you said your family is generally healthy. Any history of autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, in your family?
PATIENT: That is…a rather direct question, Doctor. Are you suggesting something untoward? However, to answer you directly, no. As far as I am aware, there is no history of such ailments in my family. My mother always stressed the importance of a strong constitution. She was quite adamant about it, actually. Though my cousin’s husband did have a rather persistent rash once, but it was attributed to…allergic reaction to shellfish. A rather unfortunate incident at a seaside resort. It hardly seems relevant.
DOCTOR: No known autoimmune diseases in the family. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I maintain a very natural lifestyle. I believe in obtaining all necessary nutrients from a balanced diet. I find that most medications have…undesirable side effects. And I prefer to avoid unnecessary interventions. A bit of turmeric in my tea, perhaps, on occasion. For its…anti-inflammatory properties. But nothing of any significance. I assure you.
DOCTOR: No regular medications or supplements, just occasional turmeric. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve never experienced any allergic reactions. I am quite…careful about what I consume. And I avoid potential irritants whenever possible. I have a rather sensitive constitution, you understand. Though, I once had a minor reaction to a particular brand of hair dye, but that was merely a cosmetic inconvenience. It hardly qualifies as a true allergy. It was a rather garish shade of crimson, actually. A regrettable decision.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your lymph nodes, and examine your joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly acceptable. Though I must confess, I do find medical examinations…somewhat intrusive. But I understand it is necessary for a proper diagnosis. Please proceed. I shall endeavor to remain…stoic. And I do hope your instruments are…sterilized. One cannot be too careful, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Everything is sterilized. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your lymph nodes… Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Now, let’s examine your joints. Can you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Very well. There. Though I must say, it’s not entirely comfortable. As you can see, there is a…slight resistance. And a faint creaking sound. Hardly alarming, but noticeable nonetheless. I do try to maintain my flexibility, but graphic design does not lend itself to vigorous exercise, you understand. It requires…precision, not exertion.
DOCTOR: I notice a slight limitation in range of motion, and a little tenderness when I bend them. No visible swelling, though. Now, let’s look at your wrists. Can you rotate them for me, both ways?
PATIENT: There. It’s…not as fluid as it once was. And I detect a slight…aching sensation. It’s more pronounced on my left wrist, I believe. I do spend an inordinate amount of time manipulating the mouse, you understand. It’s a rather demanding instrument, despite its diminutive size. And I insist on maintaining a very precise grip. It’s essential for my work.
DOCTOR: I feel some tenderness on the left wrist, and a little stiffness in both. Okay. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing fatigue, night sweats, and some joint aches, primarily in your knees and wrists. The decreased appetite is also something to consider. Given your age and symptoms, we need to rule out a few things. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, an inflammatory marker called an ESR or CRP, and a rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibody to check for rheumatoid arthritis. We should also test for Vitamin D levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, you say? It’s…rather invasive, isn’t it? However, if it is necessary for a proper diagnosis, I suppose I have no objection. Rheumatoid arthritis… the very thought. It sounds…dreadful. But if it must be ruled out, then so be it. Vitamin D levels… I do spend a considerable amount of time indoors, you understand. My workstation is rather…conducive to prolonged concentration. But please, Doctor, do expedite the process. I have deadlines to meet. And I do hope the results are…discreet.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll make sure everything is expedited and your privacy is maintained. The lab is just down the hall, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. We’ll get the results back within a few business days. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen—especially if you develop a fever, severe pain, or swelling in your joints—please contact us immediately. We can also discuss some over-the-counter options for pain relief while we await the results, like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you’d like. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen…naproxen… I’ve always been rather…wary of such medications. The side effects, you know. I prefer a more…natural approach. Perhaps a warm compress? A bit of turmeric tea? However, I shall consider the over-the-counter options as a last resort. No, Doctor, I believe that is all for now. I trust you will keep me informed of the results promptly? And I do hope this does not interfere with my schedule too much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll contact you as soon as the results are available. I’ll also send a message through the patient portal. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to call. I’ve given the lab a request to prioritize the tests, and we will do our best to get you answers as quickly as possible. Here’s a lab requisition form. The lab is just down the hall to your left. Thank you for coming in today, Jailia.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall proceed to the laboratory immediately. And I trust you will be in touch soon. Thank you for your time. .
