DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I've been thinking… I’m interested in learning about mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I keep hearing good things, and honestly, life feels a bit… much sometimes. I thought maybe you could point me in the right direction?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sugino. It’s quite common to feel overwhelmed these days. Mindfulness and meditation can be very helpful tools for managing stress and improving overall well-being. While not traditionally a medical intervention, I absolutely support exploring these avenues as part of a holistic approach to health. To help me understand your situation a little better, could you describe what specifically feels “much”?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it’s not any one thing, really. It's my job, mostly. Signal and track repair… it’s important work, don’t get me wrong, but it’s… stressful. Lots of responsibility, you know? Making sure everything is safe. And then, just… life. Being single, trying to keep up with everything, making sure the house is okay… It just adds up, I guess. I find myself worrying a lot, even when things are okay. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sugino, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you’re carrying a significant amount of responsibility and experiencing a degree of anxiety as a result. It’s admirable that you’re proactively seeking ways to manage this. Before we discuss mindfulness programs specifically, I’d like to briefly explore your symptoms a little further, if you don't mind. This will help me rule out any underlying medical contributions to your feelings of stress and anxiety. Have you noticed any physical symptoms accompanying these feelings – perhaps difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, muscle tension, or increased heart rate?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. The sleep… that’s the worst. I toss and turn a lot, even when I’m tired. And my appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I don’t feel hungry at all, and other days I just… eat. Not even because I want to, just… to feel something, maybe? And my shoulders are always tense. My neighbor, she keeps telling me I look like I’m carrying the weight of the world! She's probably right. My heart… I haven’t really noticed it racing, but I do feel… jittery sometimes, like I need to move.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sugino. That’s helpful information. Difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, muscle tension, and feeling jittery… these can all be associated with stress and anxiety, but it’s important to consider other possibilities as well. Have you experienced any significant life events recently that might be contributing to these feelings?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Nothing major, anyway. My cousin moved away last year, which was sad, but we still talk on the phone. And, um… there was a small issue at work a few months ago with a faulty switch, but we got it fixed quickly. It just… worried me, you know? I’m responsible for safety. It's silly, really. I probably just worry too much about everything. I just want to feel… calmer.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Ms. Sugino. Your concern for safety is commendable, and it’s understandable that even a quickly resolved issue would cause you stress, given your role. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to briefly review your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or any other mental health concerns?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. I get my regular checkups, of course, and my doctor always says my blood pressure is a little high, but he just tells me to watch my salt intake. Nothing serious. I've never really felt like I needed to see a specialist or anything. I just… get worried. Is it okay if I ask what you think this could be? I'm probably just making a fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Sugino. It's perfectly reasonable to ask. Based on what you’ve described – the persistent worry, difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, muscle tension, and a family history of hypertension – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with generalized anxiety. However, it's important to emphasize that I cannot make a definitive diagnosis without further evaluation. It's good that you've been monitoring your blood pressure. While elevated blood pressure can contribute to feelings of anxiety, it's also important to rule out other potential causes. To proceed, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, focusing on your heart and lungs, and I will also check your reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. A physical exam is good. I like knowing things are being checked properly. It’s just… all this worrying makes me jumpy, sometimes. I hope it’s not anything serious. But I appreciate you taking the time to listen, Doctor. It helps just talking about it, really.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. That's quite common. And you're right, sometimes just talking about it is helpful. If you'll please have a seat on the examination table, we'll get started. I will listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. It shouldn’t take long. First, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Certainly. I always feel a little nervous when getting my blood pressure taken. It probably goes up just thinking about it! But go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Ms. Sugino. It's quite common to experience some anxiety during blood pressure measurement, which can temporarily elevate the reading. We’ll take a few readings to get a more accurate assessment. Your blood pressure is 148/92. Your pulse is 88. Let’s take another reading in a few moments. While we wait, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Your heart sounds regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Lung sounds remain clear. Now, let’s take your blood pressure again. Your second reading is 152/90. Your pulse is still 88. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Given your history and these readings, it’s important to rule out any secondary causes of hypertension and assess your overall cardiovascular risk.
PATIENT: Oh. Slightly elevated… That doesn’t sound good, does it? I knew it. I always worry too much. Is that… serious? Should I be worried? I knew I should have cut back on the salt! What does this mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sugino, please try not to worry. “Slightly elevated” doesn't automatically mean anything serious. It simply means we need to investigate further. Elevated blood pressure, if left untreated, can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke, but we’re catching it now, and that’s a positive step. Your anxiety about it is actually contributing to the higher readings, so we’ll try to account for that. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some routine blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, lipid profile, and thyroid-stimulating hormone level. This will help rule out any underlying medical conditions contributing to your blood pressure and assess your overall health. I also recommend a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor. This device will measure your blood pressure at regular intervals throughout the day and night, providing a more accurate assessment of your average blood pressure. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work and… a monitor? Okay. A 24-hour monitor sounds a little inconvenient, but if it helps, then yes. I just want to know what’s going on, and what I can do about it. I’m just… tired of worrying all the time. Will the tests tell me if it’s my anxiety causing it? Or if there’s something else wrong?
DOCTOR: Yes, those tests will help us determine the cause of your elevated blood pressure. The blood work can identify any underlying medical conditions, such as thyroid problems or kidney issues, that might be contributing to it. The 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor will help us assess whether your blood pressure remains elevated even when you’re relaxed and not thinking about it. If your blood pressure is consistently high even during sleep, it’s more likely that it’s related to an underlying medical condition. If it’s only elevated when you’re awake, it’s more likely related to stress and anxiety. I'll also send you home with a questionnaire to assess your level of stress and anxiety. We'll review the results of all these tests together and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. In the meantime, I recommend trying some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation, to help manage your stress. And please, continue to monitor your salt intake. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and not dismissing my worries as just… me being anxious. It’s good to know we’re going to get to the bottom of this. When will I hear about the test results? And where do I go to get the monitor fitted?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sugino. It's important to me that you feel heard and understood. The lab results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back. My office will call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment. For the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor, we can fit it right here in the office. It's a simple, non-invasive procedure. A technician will attach a small, cuff-like device to your upper arm and explain how to wear it and record your activities throughout the day. We'll schedule that appointment now. How does tomorrow afternoon sound?
PATIENT: Tomorrow afternoon would be perfect, Doctor. That gives me time to think about what you've said, and maybe try some of those breathing exercises. Thank you again. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I'm glad I came in today.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have the technician schedule you for tomorrow at 2:00 PM. Here's a pamphlet on stress management techniques to get you started. And please, don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll see you tomorrow. Have a good day. .
