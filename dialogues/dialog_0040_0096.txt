DOCTOR: Right, Arbin Komarov. 32… Ghanaian, yes. Look, I’m quite busy today, so let’s just get straight to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Osga. It’s this light thing, you know? I’m getting really bothered by bright light. It’s… well, it just hurts my eyes, and sometimes gives me a headache. It’s been happening for a few months now, and it's getting worse, especially in the sun.
DOCTOR: A few months, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, started maybe around February, I think. It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little squinting, but now… even being inside with the curtains open is sometimes too much. It’s making it hard to get things done, honestly. I work, you know, as a dental assistant, and bright lights are kind of part of the job.
DOCTOR: A dental assistant… figures. And you’ve just… been dealing with it?
PATIENT: Well, I tried sunglasses, of course. And I try to avoid being in the sun as much as possible, but it's Ghana, right? It's always sunny! I thought maybe it was just stress at first, but it hasn’t gotten any better, and it’s starting to worry me. That's why I finally came in. I didn’t want to bother anyone if it was something small, but… it's really impacting things.
DOCTOR: Right. Stress. Everyone thinks it’s stress. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. My vision feels okay – I can see clearly, I think. No blurry spots or anything. Sometimes my eyes feel a little dry, but I figured that was from staring at computer screens all day at work. Oh! And maybe a little tired sometimes, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days? Does that make sense? I'm trying to think of everything...
DOCTOR: Alright. Any past medical problems?
PATIENT: Not really. I was pretty healthy, always. No major illnesses or anything. I did have the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, you know – but nothing serious. I lost my wife a couple of years ago, but that was… well, that wasn’t a medical thing. Just… a very sad thing. And I’ve had the standard vaccinations, I think. Does that help? Should I be remembering something else? I’m good with details normally, so this is a bit frustrating.
DOCTOR: Lost your wife… yes, well. Alright. Surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had any. Just the usual check-ups with the dentist, of course, since I work with teeth all day! I'm pretty careful with my own teeth, you know? And nothing else, honestly. No broken bones, no big accidents, nothing that would need a surgery. It’s all been pretty straightforward, health-wise, up until this light sensitivity thing. I hope it isn’t anything too serious.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Let me think. My mother, she had high blood pressure, but she lived to be 85, so it didn’t bother her too much. My father was healthy as a horse, always working in the garden. No real history of eye problems on either side of the family, as far as I know. My wife’s family… I didn’t know them very well, to be honest, so I don’t really know their medical history. Is that okay? I’m trying to remember everything, but it’s been a while since I thought about family history.
DOCTOR: Alright. Social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Hmm. I don’t really… party much. I mostly just work and try to relax at home when I can. I don’t smoke, and I hardly ever drink alcohol – maybe a beer with dinner once in a while. I live alone now, like I said, lost my wife. I used to go to church regularly, but… it’s been hard since she passed. Nothing too exciting, honestly. Just a quiet life. Does that… cover it?
DOCTOR: Allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything – food, medicine, pollen, anything. I can eat whatever, take most medicines without problems. I've always been pretty lucky that way, actually. No hives, no swelling, no trouble breathing… Nothing. Is that… unusual? Should I be checking for hidden allergies? I just haven’t ever had any.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at your eyes. Come over here. I need to check your pupils and do a quick visual assessment. Don't worry, it won't take long.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I'm a bit nervous about bright lights, but I'll try my best. Just let me know if it's going to be really intense, yeah? I'll close my eyes if I need to.
DOCTOR: Pupils are… normal. Tracking is okay. Visual acuity… 20/20. Hmm. No obvious abnormalities in the retina. Eyes are… dry, as you said. Okay. It could be simple eye strain. Or… something else. We’ll do some tests just to be safe. I’m going to order a visual field test and a basic blood panel.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. A visual field test and a blood panel. Is that going to take long? And is it expensive? I’m on Medicare, so I worry about things like that. I'm just trying to figure out what's next, you know? And if it's something serious...
DOCTOR: The tests aren’t that expensive, on Medicare. The visual field test will take about half an hour, and the blood panel… well, you’ll need to go to the lab downstairs. They’ll tell you the fasting requirements. Look, it’s probably just dry eyes. I'll prescribe some artificial tears. Use them four times a day. If it doesn’t improve in two weeks, come back and we’ll revisit it. Here. Don't worry too much. It's likely nothing serious. Next patient.
PATIENT: Okay… artificial tears, four times a day. And come back in two weeks if it doesn’t get better. Right. Thank you, Doctor Osga. I appreciate you seeing me. I’ll… go get the eye drops, then. .
