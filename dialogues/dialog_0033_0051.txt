DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Nini, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. NINI. Darl NINI. Though… everyone just calls me Darl. It’s a bit of a long story, really. I think it was a nickname from… well, a long time ago. Do you need me to spell it? My mind isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: No, no, that’s alright. Darl Nini. Yes. Let's not get bogged down in formalities. Now, you're here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, right! The blood. Yes. My… a friend, I think it was, suggested I get it checked. Something about… knowing what type I am. For… emergencies. Honestly, I can't quite recall why exactly, but it sounded important. I suppose it’s good to be prepared, isn't it? I just… don’t remember ever having it done before.
DOCTOR: Blood type. Yes. A sensible precaution, I suppose, even at your age. Although, frankly, most people don't need to know their blood type unless they're donating or… well, having a transfusion. Alright. Have you experienced any unusual bleeding recently?
PATIENT: Unusual bleeding… hmm. Let me think. Not that I recall. A few scrapes and bruises, naturally, for an old woman who still likes to… well, I used to do things. Fixing things, mostly. Rigging, you see. But nothing… unusual. No, I don't think so. Does a little nosebleed count? I get those sometimes, especially when it’s dry. But those are hardly… unusual, are they?
DOCTOR: No, a minor nosebleed isn’t concerning. Are you currently taking any medications, Mrs. Nini?
PATIENT: Medications… oh dear. Let me see… I take something for my knees, I think. And… something for my water pills, the doctor gave me a while back. Oh, and a little something to help me sleep sometimes. But I can't remember the names of any of them! They're all in little bottles. Do you need me to list them all? It might take a while… and I'm not sure I have them all with me right now. It's all a bit… disorganized, you see.
DOCTOR: Disorganized is… putting it mildly. Alright. We’ll figure it out. Do you have a list anywhere?
PATIENT: A list… hmm. I used to keep one in my… my little book. But where that is now… goodness knows! My granddaughter, she’s very good with things like that. She keeps track of things for me. But she’s away on holiday at the moment. I really should write things down, I know. But it just… slips my mind. Is it terribly important to know the names right this minute? I mean, I haven't felt any ill effects, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s preferable, Mrs. Nini. Medication interactions are a serious concern. Especially given your… age. I’ll ask you a few basic questions then, if you don't mind. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, let me think. Yes, I had my gallbladder out. A long, long time ago. And… and I think I had something done on my knee, when I was younger. I used to be very active, you see. Lots of climbing and… rigging. But that was ages ago. I can’t recall exactly when or what they did. It all feels like a dream, really. They fixed it, though! It worked for years. Until… well, until it started to bother me again. Is that helpful? I wish my memory were better. It’s terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Now that's a good question. I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but that's probably just dust. And I used to sneeze a bit in the spring, but everyone does, don't they? I don't think I've ever had a serious allergic reaction. No swelling or trouble breathing or anything like that. Just a little… sniffles, maybe. I'm not sure that counts. Do you need a specific allergy? Like to penicillin or something? I really don't know.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright. We'll proceed. Now, Mrs. Nini, I’m going to perform a quick physical examination, just to get a baseline. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical… yes, that's fine. As long as it’s not too… strenuous. My bones aren't what they used to be, you see. And please, be gentle with my shoulder. It aches sometimes. I used to carry a lot of heavy things… rigging, mostly. It’s alright, I suppose. Just… be careful. And don't mind if I wince a bit. It's just an old woman's aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85. Slightly elevated, but not alarming for your age. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear, although a little diminished breath sound. Now, I'll check your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished, as expected. Finally, I’ll just palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. A little… distention, perhaps, but nothing of major concern.
PATIENT: Distention… Is that bad? I do get a bit… bloated sometimes. It’s probably just the gas. I eat a lot of beans, you see. My granddaughter makes a lovely bean stew. It's very filling. But if it's something serious, you must tell me! I don't want any surprises. And… and is my blood pressure really elevated? Should I be worried? Perhaps I should cut back on the salt. Or maybe the beans… Oh dear.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nini, please. It’s a mild elevation. Easily managed with diet and monitoring. And no, I didn't say it was caused by the beans. It's simply an observation. Now, given your age and the fact that you haven’t had a comprehensive blood workup recently, I recommend a basic panel to assess your kidney function, liver function, and complete blood count. It will also help to rule out any underlying anemia. Do you agree?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s best. I trust your judgment, dear. Blood work… Yes, alright. Will it hurt? I don't like needles, you see. Not at all. But if it’s necessary… then I suppose I can be brave. And you'll tell me everything, won't you? No medical jargon, please. Just… plain English. And if it's something bad, you'll be honest with me, right? I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Nini. I’ll be honest. The blood draw itself will be a momentary pinch, nothing more. And I'll explain the results in plain English, as you requested. I'll order the panel now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of you. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A follow-up appointment. Good. I suppose I should… go to the lab now, then? Is there anything else I need to do? Or bring? And… and will the results take long? I have a friend coming to visit next week, and I don't want to be worried about… anything when she arrives. It’s just… I like to be prepared, you see. Even if I can’t remember what I’m preparing for.
DOCTOR: No, nothing else is required. Just go to the lab, tell them Dr. Dechene ordered a comprehensive blood panel, and they'll take care of it. The results typically take 2-3 business days. I’ll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for you then. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh. No, I… I think that's everything. Thank you, dear. You've been very… patient with me. It’s just… my memory, you see. I suppose I'll just… go to the lab now. 2-3 business days. Right. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well. .
