DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. NEPL. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Venna, please. Well, my blood pressure's been actin' up, that's what the lady on the phone said anyway. It's been high, and I figured I best get it checked before it gets worse. I ain't one for lingerin' in doctors' offices if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Venna. I understand. High blood pressure is certainly something we want to address promptly. And I appreciate you coming in to get it checked. To begin, can you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed this issue with your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. Honestly, I don't rightly remember when I first noticed. The nurse took it last week when I was gettin' a flu shot and she said it was high then. Before that… not sure. I don't usually pay attention to numbers, just how I feel. Been feelin' alright, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but at my age, ain't that just normal?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Venna. It’s common not to notice changes unless they’re causing a problem. And you’re right, some fatigue is quite common as we get older. So, the nurse noted the high reading last week during your flu shot. Have you had any symptoms along with the fatigue – like dizziness, headaches, shortness of breath, or any vision changes?
PATIENT: No, not really. No dizziness, no headaches to speak of. Maybe a little out of breath when I'm bakin' a lot of bread and runnin' around the kitchen, but that’s just from the work, I reckon. My vision… well, it ain’t what it used to be, but it hasn't gotten worse lately. Just old age, I guess. I mostly just need brighter lights these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the shortness of breath is related to activity, which is good to know. And it’s common for vision to change as we age. Now, let's talk about your overall health history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past – like diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, my hips have been botherin' me for years, arthritis, the doctor said. And I had a gallbladder out when I was younger, that was… oh, goodness, must be forty years ago now. Other than that, I've been pretty lucky, knock on wood. I don’t have no sugar problems, and my heart's always beat strong as a drum, far as I know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Venna. It sounds like you’ve been quite resilient. Arthritis and a gallbladder removal are significant, but it's good that you haven't had many other medical issues. And you mentioned you’ve had a strong heart “as far as you know”. Have you ever had any heart tests done – like an EKG or echocardiogram?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Never had any reason to, I suppose. The doctors always just listened to my chest with that thing… you know, the stethoscope? Said it sounded good. That was years ago though, back when my late husband was still around. He always took me to the appointments, and I just let him handle all that medical talk. I never was one for askin' questions.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Venna. It’s common to rely on loved ones for those things. And a normal stethoscope exam is reassuring, though it doesn’t give us a complete picture. Let’s move on to your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, or children – has had problems with high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well, my mama, she had high blood pressure when she got older. She was a Cherokee woman, strong as an oak, but it got to her in the end. My daddy, he had a bad heart, I think. He died young, workin' in the fields. My brother, he was healthy as a horse, never a sick day in his life. And I never had any children, so… that’s about it, far as I know. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venna. That's helpful information. A family history of high blood pressure and heart disease does increase your risk. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your daily habits. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Lord, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked a little when he was younger, but I wouldn't allow it in the house. Bad for your health, and I always said so. I like my air clean, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Venna. Avoiding smoking is one of the best things you can do for your health. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little wine with supper sometimes. A glass, maybe two, on special occasions. I like a little red wine with my fish. That's about it. Don't go for any of that hard liquor, though. Too strong for my taste. And I don’t drink every day, just now and then.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Venna. Moderate alcohol consumption is generally considered acceptable. Now, let's talk about your diet and exercise. Could you describe what a typical day of eating looks like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I do a lot of bakin', so there's always somethin' sweet around. But I try to eat healthy too. I like my vegetables, greens mostly – collard greens, turnip greens, that sort of thing. And fish, I eat a lot of fish. Fried mostly, I reckon, but still good for you. I try to use fresh ingredients when I can, from the garden. And I make my own bread, whole wheat, usually. I don't eat a lot of red meat, not anymore. It just doesn’t sit right. I reckon I eat pretty well, for an old woman.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very wholesome diet, Venna. And gardening is wonderful exercise! Now, regarding exercise, do you do any regular physical activity – like walking, gardening, or housework – and if so, for how long each day?
PATIENT: Well, I do a lot of walkin' around the kitchen, bakin' and such. And I spend a good bit of time in the garden, bendin' and hoen', pickin' vegetables. It keeps me movin', I reckon. I don't go for fancy exercise or nothin', just stay busy. I don't time it or nothin', just do what I need to do. Maybe an hour or two a day, movin' around. It ain’t much, I suppose, but it's better than sittin' in a chair all day.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Venna. Staying active is very important, and it sounds like you do a good job of that. One last question about daily habits, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a little somethin' for my arthritis, the doctor gave it to me years ago. I don’t rightly remember the name, somethin' fancy. And I take a vitamin D pill in the winter, the nurse told me to. Helps with the bones, she said. Other than that, no. I don't go for a lot of pills if I can help it. I prefer natural remedies when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, I would like to do a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Get it over with, I say. I got things to do, you know. But hurry it up a bit, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Venna. I'll be as efficient as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart rate is a little elevated at 88 beats per minute, and I hear a normal rhythm. Your lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Next, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 162/94, which is elevated. Now, I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Your ears and nose appear normal. Your throat is clear. Finally, I’ll check your reflexes and feel your pulses. Your reflexes are normal, and your pulses are strong. Overall, your physical exam is relatively normal, but your elevated blood pressure is a concern. It confirms what the nurse noted last week.
PATIENT: Well, that ain't good, is it? I figured somethin' was wrong. 162… that sounds awful high. What does that mean exactly? And what do we do about it? I don't want to be takin' a lot of pills if I can help it. I just want to keep bakin' and livin' my life.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Venna. 162/94 is elevated. It means your heart is working harder than it should to pump blood through your arteries. Prolonged high blood pressure can increase your risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney problems, and other serious health issues. However, it’s important not to panic. We have several options for managing it, and we'll work together to find the best approach for you. Before we discuss treatment, I’d like to order some blood tests and a urine test to get a better understanding of your overall health and to rule out any underlying causes for your high blood pressure. These tests will check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and electrolytes. We can discuss lifestyle modifications as well, which can often help lower blood pressure without medication. These include: Diet: Reducing your sodium intake, eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and limiting processed foods and saturated fats. Exercise: Aiming for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Weight Management: Maintaining a healthy weight. Stress Reduction: Finding ways to manage stress, such as yoga, meditation, or spending time in nature. Depending on the results of your tests and how well you respond to lifestyle changes, we may consider medication. There are many different types of blood pressure medications available, and we’ll choose one that’s right for you, with the fewest side effects. Does that sound like a reasonable plan, Venna?
PATIENT: That sounds… alright, I reckon. Tests ain’t my favorite, but I understand we gotta know what’s goin’ on. I can try the eatin' better and movin’ around a bit more. I already do a good bit of walkin', just need to maybe pay more attention to what I'm shovelin’ in my mouth. But I don’t want no fancy diets or nothin’. Just sensible eatin’, you hear? And I ain’t one for stress. I’m a pretty calm woman, mostly. So, tests first, then see what happens. And hold off on the pills as long as we can, okay? I just want to get this sorted out and get back to my bakin'.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. We’ll take things one step at a time and focus on sensible approaches. No fancy diets, I promise. Just mindful eating and a bit more attention to your overall health. And we will definitely hold off on medication as long as possible. I’ll write you an order for the blood tests and urine test. You can have them done at the lab across the street. They’ll need a sample of your blood and a urine sample. The results should be back in a few days. Once I have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a personalized plan for managing your blood pressure. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headaches, or vision changes, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Venna?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds… manageable. Just get the tests done and see what they say. I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clear, Doctor. You seem like a sensible man. And thank you for not rushin’ to give me a bunch of pills right away. That makes me feel a whole lot better. I reckon I'll be seein' you again soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. It’s my pleasure. I believe in a collaborative approach to healthcare, and I want you to feel comfortable and involved in your own care. I will have the lab order printed for you now. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I look forward to seeing you again soon. Have a good day, Venna, and enjoy your bakin'!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. And I might just bring you a loaf of bread if I feel up to it!
