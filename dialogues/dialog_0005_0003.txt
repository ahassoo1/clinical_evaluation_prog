DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Good to meet you. So, you're here today… why don’t you tell me what brought you in?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? It’s this shaking. My hand… it just trembles. It’s annoying, you know? Makes things difficult. Can we just get this over with? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Right, the shaking. Okay. And it’s just the hand, or are you noticing it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Just the hand, mostly. Though… now that you mention it, sometimes my leg feels a little… jittery. But I figured that was just old age, you know? Everything’s falling apart. Not a big deal.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when did you first notice this shaking, Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I notice it? Honestly, it comes and goes. A few months, maybe? Longer? It's hard to say. I don't keep track of these things. It's not like it started yesterday, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, changed? I'm old, everything changes! My wife… she passed a few years back. That changed things. But what are you getting at? Is this gonna take long?
DOCTOR: Just trying to get a complete picture, Mr. Baide. Any new medications, new foods in your diet, any recent illnesses, falls…anything at all that might be relevant. We need to rule things out.
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. The heart pill, of course. And something for my blood pressure. Oh, and the little blue one… but not as much anymore. Diet? I eat what my daughter brings over. She tries to be healthy, I guess. No falls, thankfully. I'm careful. Look, is this shaking dangerous? That's what I want to know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said a "heart pill" and something for blood pressure. Do you happen to know the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Names? Oh, for goodness sake. No! My daughter handles all that. She fills those little bottles. I just… take them. Honestly, you’re asking me to remember things I haven’t the slightest clue about. It's all a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, I'm going to take a quick look at your records here. Give me one moment. Ah, here we go. Lisinopril for blood pressure, Digoxin for… atrial fibrillation. And you are still prescribed Digoxin, despite…well, never mind. So, you've been on Digoxin for some time. Digoxin can sometimes cause tremors. Are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Tremors? Vision? What are you getting at now? Nausea… sometimes. Old age, you know? Everything makes me a little queasy. I'm not sure what that has to do with my hand shaking! My daughter always says I need to drink more water. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I'm asking questions to understand the cause of your shaking. Digoxin toxicity – meaning too much Digoxin in your system – can cause tremors, nausea, and changes in vision. It's important to rule this out. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Can you hold your arms out in front of you?
PATIENT: Ugh, physical exam? Really? I just told you my wife passed. I'm not exactly feeling up to… flexing for you. Is there any other way? Can't you just give me something for the shaking? I don't need a whole examination. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand you're not feeling well, and I apologize for your loss. However, it is crucial to assess your condition properly. A quick exam will help me determine if further testing is needed. It won't be extensive, just a neurological assessment to check your reflexes and coordination. Please, just hold your arms out. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't expect much. This is going to be a waste of time. There. Happy now? This is probably just old age, you know. Everything's falling apart.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you tap your thumb to each of your fingers, one at a time?
PATIENT: This is… difficult. My hands aren't what they used to be. See? This proves nothing. It's just… arthritis, probably. Or old age. Look, can we just get this over with? I have a bridge game later.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during the exam, there's a definite tremor present, and some difficulty with coordination. Given your medication list, specifically the Digoxin, and your symptoms, I want to order a blood test to check your Digoxin levels, as well as your electrolytes and kidney function. It’s essential to rule out Digoxin toxicity. I’m also going to order a thyroid panel, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause tremors. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you temporarily reduce your Digoxin dosage by half – only do this after speaking with your daughter or the pharmacist, to ensure it's safe. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Reduce my dosage? Now you're telling me to change my medication? I don't like this. My wife always said, never change your medication without talking to the doctor. Wait a minute, you are the doctor! This is all very confusing. Look, I'm going to need to think about this. Can I talk to my daughter first? I don’t want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You should always discuss medication changes with your daughter or pharmacist. That’s very wise of you. I'm simply suggesting it as a precaution while we await the blood test results. I’ll write down the instructions for the blood tests, and a note recommending you discuss reducing the Digoxin dosage with your daughter or pharmacist. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results come back, so we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's enough for now. Just… try not to give me too many tests, alright? And hurry up with the results. I've got a life to live. Can I just go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can go. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours. The nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Please, do be sure to discuss the Digoxin dosage with your daughter or pharmacist as soon as possible. Next patient. .
