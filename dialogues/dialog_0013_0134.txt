DOCTOR: Hi Raymonde, it's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Land sakes, where do I begin? It’s… my stomach, mostly. It just hasn't been right for a little while now. I get sick to my stomach a lot, and I don't even feel hungry after just a few bites of food. It's… frustrating, mostly. I used to love to eat, you know? Especially after a long day with the animals.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds really upsetting to have your appetite affected like that, especially when you used to enjoy eating so much. “Sick to your stomach” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it is. It just… comes on. Not always right after I eat, sometimes just… randomly. It’s not a bad pain, exactly, more like a… queasy feeling. And then, well, I throw up. Not every time, thankfully. But enough that it worries me. And like I said, even when I do manage to eat something, I just… don't want any more after a few bites. It’s just… not appealing, you know? I don't remember ever feeling this way before, not like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a queasy feeling that sometimes leads to vomiting, and it happens both after eating and randomly, and it's significantly decreased your appetite. And you haven't experienced this like this before. About how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. Time… it just seems to slip away from me these days. Let me think… It feels like… maybe a couple of months? Perhaps three? It started gradually, I think. Just not feeling quite as hungry, then a little bit of nausea now and then. Then it got worse, more frequent. I really couldn’t say for certain. My memory ain’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, it's perfectly alright if you're not sure on the exact timing. A couple of months is helpful. And it sounds like it's been a gradual worsening. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the nausea and vomiting?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Other symptoms… Well, I've been feeling… tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And… I’ve lost a little bit of weight, I think. My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven't actually weighed myself recently. My granddaughter, Sarah, she mentioned I looked a little thin last time she visited, but… she always worries. She's a good girl. Oh! And… sometimes I just feel… weak. Like I don't have much energy. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Raymonde. So, fatigue, some weight loss, and feeling weak along with the nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Okay. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh my. That's a tough one. I've lived a long life, seen a lot of doctors over the years. I remember having… the usual things, you know? The flu, a bad cold here and there. And… oh, years ago, I had some trouble with my gallbladder. They took it out, I think. But that was… a long time ago. And… well, I was diagnosed with… something. A few years back. Cancer, they said. But… it wasn't anything too serious, they told me. They did some treatments, and I felt alright for a long time after that. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details. It was a confusing time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of gallbladder removal, and a previous cancer diagnosis that was treated. It's alright if you don't remember the specifics of the cancer – we can look that up in your records. Do you recall what kind of cancer it was, or where it was located?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I really don't. It was… something to do with my insides, I think. They did a lot of tests, scans and such. It was in my stomach area, maybe? Or… somewhere close to it. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a blur. I just remember being grateful they caught it and were able to do something about it. I mostly focused on getting better and getting back to my animals. Sarah would be able to tell you more, I reckon. She kept track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. We'll definitely check your records to get the specifics of your previous cancer diagnosis and treatment. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I take a little pill for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white one. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it's acting up. It’s a cream, mostly. I don’t really take much else. I try to stay natural, you know? I don't like filling my body with a lot of chemicals if I can help it. And I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor told me I was low on it. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a blood pressure medication, a topical cream for arthritis, and a vitamin D supplement. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I might be a little sensitive to pollen sometimes, but nothing serious. Just a little sneezing and a runny nose in the spring. Nothing that requires a doctor or anything. I've always been pretty lucky that way, I suppose. I haven’t had any problems with medications or foods that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. It will just take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I do have a bit of arthritis, you know, so some things might be a little tender. But I’m a tough old bird, don’t you worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde, I'm just checking your abdomen. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… that spot. Right there… it’s a little sore. Not painful, exactly, more like… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. I haven’t really said anything about it because it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s not there at all, and other times it feels like… well, like someone’s pressing on it. It hasn’t been too bad, I just figured it was my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That tenderness in the upper right quadrant is good to know. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90, but that could be due to some anxiety, or just a normal fluctuation. I’m also noting your weight is 56 kilograms, which represents some weight loss from previous measurements. Now, based on what you've told me – the nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, fatigue, weight loss, previous cancer diagnosis, and the tenderness in your upper right quadrant – I want to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal ultrasound. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds like a lot of tests. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I trust you. Whatever you need to do to figure out what’s going on. I just want to feel better. I miss being able to enjoy my animals, and I worry about not being able to care for them properly. So, yes. That sounds okay. Just… let me know if any of them are unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde. I understand. We'll take things one step at a time. The blood tests are just a simple draw, and the abdominal ultrasound is non-invasive – we'll just use a gel and a probe to look at the images on a screen. I'm also going to write you a prescription for an anti-nausea medication to help with the sickness, and I suggest you drink clear fluids and eat small, bland meals. I'll order the tests now, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s kind of you to prescribe something for the nausea. That would be a big help. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. Let me see… Questions… Hmm. Will the tests take long to get back? I have a little appointment with Sarah next week, and I’d like to know what’s going on before then, if possible. And… will the medication interact with my blood pressure pills? I just want to make sure everything’s safe.
DOCTOR: Those are both excellent questions, Raymonde. The lab usually takes about 3-5 business days to get the results back, so hopefully, we’ll have them before your appointment with Sarah. I'll make a note to call you as soon as they are available. And yes, you’re right to ask about interactions. The anti-nausea medication can sometimes interact with blood pressure pills, so I’m going to prescribe a low dose and advise you to monitor your blood pressure at home if you have a monitor. If your blood pressure drops significantly, stop taking the anti-nausea medication and contact me immediately. Do you currently monitor your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don’t. I used to, a few years ago, when the doctor first prescribed the pills. But I haven’t really kept up with it. It’s just… another thing to remember, you know? I think Sarah might have one, though. She’s always worried about my health, and she likes to keep track of things. I'll ask her. So, just watch for feeling dizzy or faint, then? And stop the pill if that happens?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Watch for dizziness, lightheadedness, or feeling faint. If you experience any of those symptoms, stop taking the anti-nausea medication and contact me right away. We can also discuss getting you a blood pressure monitor if you don’t have one available. I'm also going to send a referral to a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive health – as a precaution. They may want to do further testing to get a more definitive diagnosis. It’s better to be thorough, especially given your history. I’ve written everything down for you – the prescriptions, the referral information, and instructions on what to watch for. Do you have any other questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: Oh, a specialist. That sounds… serious. But I suppose it’s best to get everything checked out properly. I appreciate you thinking ahead, Doctor. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. You’ve explained everything so clearly, and you’ve been very patient with my… forgetfulness. I just want to thank you for taking the time to listen to me and for being so kind. I reckon I'll just take things one step at a time, and I'll let you know if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Raymonde. It's my pleasure. And don’t worry about your memory – it’s perfectly normal as we get older. And you're right, let's take things one step at a time. I’ll be in touch as soon as the test results are back. Here’s the information again. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns, even if they seem small. Take care of yourself, and I hope you feel better soon. I look forward to hearing from you.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
