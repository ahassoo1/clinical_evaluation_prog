DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Lovely to meet you as well. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… goodness, I’d say about three days now. Just won't stop. It's quite irritating, really. Not painful, just…constant.
DOCTOR: Three days, that’s a bit longer than usual for hiccups. Constant hiccups can be quite disruptive, I understand. Could you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, they’re… regular, I suppose. Not huge, forceful ones, just little… hic… little jolts. Like someone gave my insides a tiny nudge. They come every few seconds, maybe? I haven't really kept track, to be honest. I just know they’re there. It doesn’t hurt, like I said, but it makes it hard to concentrate, you know? And it’s tiring, all that… jumping.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can imagine that would be tiring. "Jumping" is a good way to describe it. And you haven't noticed anything that seems to trigger them – anything you were doing or eating before they started, or any particular time of day they’re worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Now, I was having lunch with Elsie – she's a friend from church – on Monday, and we both had the fish special at the diner. That was the day they started, come to think of it. But Elsie hasn’t said a thing about hiccups. And no, I don’t think there’s a particular time of day they’re worse. They just… are. All the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, the fish special is good information. It’s possible, though not certain, that there’s a connection there. Now, besides the hiccups, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, no other symptoms. Nothing at all. Just the hiccups. I feel perfectly fine otherwise. A little…frustrated, maybe! But no fever, no tummy trouble, no heartburn, nothing like that. I've been eating and sleeping normally. And I haven’t felt dizzy or anything. Really, it’s just these pesky hiccups. They’re just…annoying, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, "pesky" is a good word for them! Let's go through a quick review of your medical history, just to be thorough. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about your past health?
PATIENT: Not at all, dear. Go right ahead. I’ve got nothing to hide! I’ve seen a fair few doctors in my time, you know. Lived a long life, so naturally there’s been a thing or two along the way. Ask away!
DOCTOR: Wonderful. First, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… years ago, the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high, but it was a long time ago. He put me on a little pill for a while, but I stopped taking it after a few months, and he said it was alright. It hasn't bothered me since. As for diabetes or heart problems… no, never anything like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I do have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, now managed, and some arthritis. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Yes, actually. A long time ago, I had my gallbladder removed. And… oh, and I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, but that was… goodness, over fifty years ago now! Besides those two, nothing else. No broken bones or anything dramatic like that, thankfully. I was always a bit clumsy as a girl, but I managed to avoid any serious injuries, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy many years ago. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I haven't ever had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t had any trouble with medications. I used to be a bit worried about penicillin, like a lot of people, but I've taken it a few times when I’ve been sick and been perfectly fine. I’m a pretty lucky one, when it comes to allergies, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of glucosamine for my knees. The arthritis bothers me a bit more when it’s cold, so I take one tablet a day. And sometimes, if I’m feeling a bit run down, I’ll take a vitamin C tablet. But that’s it, really. Nothing else. I try to eat a healthy diet, so I don't rely on too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, glucosamine and occasional vitamin C. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a bit of a complicated one. My mother lived to be 92, and she was perfectly healthy right up until the end. My father… he had a bit of heart trouble, but he smoked a lot, so it wasn’t surprising. My sister… she had diabetes, unfortunately. And my brother… he had high blood pressure, just like me. So, a bit of everything, really. Heart trouble, diabetes, high blood pressure… the usual things. I try not to worry about it too much, though. Everyone’s different.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were terrible for you, and I listened to her. I always preferred a good cup of tea, myself! And I always encouraged my friends and family to stay away from them as well. A bad habit, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how much alcohol do you drink, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, very little, dear. Just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing heavy, you understand. I’m not much of a drinker, really. A little bit of red wine is supposed to be good for your heart, though, so I allow myself a little bit now and then. But mostly, I prefer a nice cup of tea!
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional small glass of wine. And finally, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I was married for… oh, must be sixty years, but we divorced a long time ago. No children, unfortunately. Always wanted them, but it just wasn’t meant to be. I live alone now, but I have a lovely group of friends from church, and we get together regularly. I keep busy with church activities, and I enjoy gardening and reading. I’m not lonely, you understand. I have a full and happy life, despite everything. It’s just… these hiccups!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mirriam. That gives me a good overall picture of your health. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, dear. Go right ahead. I don’t mind at all. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, you know. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear, good air movement bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, not tender to the touch. No masses or organomegaly detected. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular. Everything seems normal on initial examination. Now, I'd like to review some possible causes for hiccups. Often, they're benign and resolve on their own. But persistent hiccups, like yours, warrant investigation. Have you tried any remedies – holding your breath, drinking water quickly, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, I’ve tried all sorts, dear! Holding my breath, that’s the first thing everyone tells you, isn’t it? Drinking water upside down… I made a terrible mess trying that one! Elsie suggested a spoonful of sugar, but that didn't work either. I even tried getting someone to scare me, but I just laughed! Honestly, I’ve tried everything I could think of. That’s why I came to see you. It’s been three days now, and they just won't stop. It's really quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration completely. Since the hiccups are persistent and home remedies haven't been effective, I’d like to order a few blood tests just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We’ll check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count. Also, given the duration, it might be wise to consider a chest X-ray to rule out anything in your lungs that could be causing irritation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Blood tests and an X-ray… alright. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare. I don't mind a bit of poking and prodding if it means finding out what’s causing these pesky hiccups! And thank you for taking me seriously, Doctor. It’s nice to feel like someone is finally listening.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. I'm happy to help. The blood tests require no preparation, just a routine fasting sample in the morning. For the chest X-ray, you’ll just need to remove any jewelry around your neck and chest. The order for the tests will be sent to the lab and radiology department. They’ll contact you directly to schedule the appointments. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if the hiccups become significantly worse, or if you experience any new symptoms, like shortness of breath or chest pain, please don't hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, dear. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and running those tests. It gives me peace of mind, knowing we’re trying to figure it out. Thank you again, Doctor. I suppose I’ll just have to live with these hiccups for a bit longer, then. Hopefully, the tests will shed some light on things.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. I agree, let's see what the tests reveal. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Here's a printed summary of the tests ordered, and the contact information for the lab and radiology department. Have a good rest of your day, and I’ll see you again once the results are available.
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You too. I appreciate your kindness. It's good to know there are still doctors who take the time to listen. .
DOCTOR: You’re very kind to say so, Mirriam. It’s a pleasure to care for patients like you. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon. .
