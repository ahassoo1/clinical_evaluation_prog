DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I am Dr. Yackey. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s about my breathing. It gets…difficult when I try to lie flat. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, I’d say. It’s not comfortable, not at all.
DOCTOR: Several weeks, you say. And it’s specifically when lying flat?
PATIENT: Yes, specifically. When I’m sitting up, or even leaning back a little, I’m alright. But the moment I try to get comfortable flat… that’s when it starts. It feels like… like something is pressing on my chest, almost. Not painful, exactly, just…tight.
DOCTOR: Tightness upon reclining… I see. And has this gradually worsened over these weeks, or has it been relatively consistent?
PATIENT: It's gotten a little worse, I think. At first, I could just use an extra pillow and be okay. Now… now I need two pillows, and even then it isn’t very good. It keeps me up at night, mostly. It's a nuisance, really. A very bothersome nuisance.
DOCTOR: Two pillows now… Alright. And, just to clarify, is this accompanied by any coughing?
PATIENT: Coughing? Not really. No, I wouldn't say so. Maybe a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothing that would wake anyone up. It's the breathing that's the problem, not a cough. I haven’t been sick, haven’t had a cold or anything.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm. Let me think… I don't believe so. My feet sometimes feel a little tired at the end of the day, but that’s just from being on them so much. I work at the library, you see. Lots of walking and standing. But no, no swelling that I’ve noticed. I wear sensible shoes, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any chest pain, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I already said it isn’t painful. It’s a tightness, like something is pressing on me. Not a sharp pain, not a hurting feeling. Just… uncomfortable. Are you asking about something different? It's very confusing asking about pain when I've told you it isn't painful.
DOCTOR: My apologies. Just attempting to rule things out. And have you had any history of heart problems?
PATIENT: No, never. My mother had high blood pressure, but that was it. I’ve always been quite healthy, really. I eat my vegetables and walk every day. I don’t understand why this is happening. Is it serious, Doctor? I'd like to know.
DOCTOR: We will determine that, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But… it will be difficult to lie flat, you know. Perhaps I can use a couple of pillows? I don’t want to make things worse just trying to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Just lie as comfortably as you can. We’ll make do. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Good. A few crackles bilaterally. And your heart sounds… a little distant. Blood pressure is 140/90.
PATIENT: Distant? Crackles? Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? Is that…serious? I don't like the sound of "distant" and "crackles." What does that mean, Doctor? Please, tell me plainly. I'm not a medical person, you see.
DOCTOR: It suggests some fluid buildup. It could be a number of things, Ms. Vanderwiele. We need to rule out heart failure, and possibly pneumonia. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. And a blood test to check your BNP level.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. X-rays and blood tests. Is this… is this going to be expensive? I'm on Medicare, you see, and I don't want any surprises. And…heart failure? That sounds very frightening. Will I have to stay in the hospital? I really don’t want to stay in the hospital. Is there anything else I can tell you that might help?
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover the majority of it. As for the tests, they are necessary to determine the cause. We'll discuss hospitalization if the results warrant it. Now, have you had any recent travel?
PATIENT: Recent travel? No, not at all. I haven’t left town in… oh, goodness, it must be five years now. I went to visit my niece in Albuquerque, but that was in 2020. I mostly just go to the library and tend to my garden. I don't do much traveling. Is that important? It feels like you’re asking a lot of questions that don’t have anything to do with my breathing. I just want to be able to lie flat without feeling like I’m suffocating.
DOCTOR: It’s important to consider all possibilities, Ms. Vanderwiele. A travel history helps rule out certain infections. We’ll send you to radiology for the X-ray and then draw some blood. The nurse will explain everything. I'll have the results sent to me as soon as they are available. We’ll discuss a plan then. Is there anything else you wish to add?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. I just hope it isn’t anything too serious. It’s very unsettling, all these tests. Please, just let me know as soon as you know something. And…could you perhaps explain what a “BNP level” is? Just so I know what you’re looking for. I'm ready to go to radiology whenever you are. This has been rather stressful, if I may say so. .
DOCTOR: The nurse will explain the BNP level in detail. It’s a blood test that helps assess your heart function. Follow me, and I'll have the nurse escort you to radiology. I have other patients waiting.
