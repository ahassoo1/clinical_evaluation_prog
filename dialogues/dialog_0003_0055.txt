DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. I must say, this establishment isn't quite what I expected. But never mind that. I'm here because I’ve heard… things… about obtaining a certificate for medicinal marijuana. My daughter – bless her heart, she means well – suggested it for my arthritis. Though I've always considered such things… rather uncouth.
DOCTOR: A certificate for…marijuana, you say?
PATIENT: Precisely. It’s just… the pain is becoming rather bothersome. I’ve always managed with a bit of liniment and a strong will, but lately… it's not quite enough. And honestly, I’d rather not resort to those… powerful pharmaceuticals if I can avoid it. All those side effects, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. And you believe… this alternative treatment will be… suitable?
PATIENT: Well, that’s what I’m hoping you can determine, Doctor. I wouldn’t simply come here if I hadn’t heard some… positive accounts. My neighbor, Mrs. Abernathy – a perfectly respectable woman, though a bit too fond of floral prints, if you ask me – claims it’s done wonders for her rheumatism. I’m not saying I believe everything she tells me, but it prompted me to inquire.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Abernathy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Mrs. Abernathy. Lives just two doors down, the house with the… rather excessive garden gnomes. She’s been quite vocal about its benefits. Though I do question her judgment at times. Really, gnomes! But that’s beside the point. The point is, she insists it's a far more… civilized solution than those dreadful pills. And frankly, Doctor, I'm simply looking for a little relief. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a basic assessment. Now, tell me, where specifically is this arthritis causing you trouble?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, primarily in my hands, you see. Makes it quite difficult to manage my embroidery, which is… a rather cherished pastime. And my knees, of course. Especially when the weather turns damp. Though, I suppose that's to be expected at my age. But the hands are the true nuisance. Makes it awfully hard to hold the needle, you understand. A delicate art, embroidery is. Requires a steady hand.
DOCTOR: And for how long have you been experiencing these… difficulties with your hands and knees?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It comes and goes, you see. But I'd say… truly bothersome for at least five years now. Though I've always had a bit of stiffness, naturally. A woman of my age accumulates certain… wear and tear. But the last couple of years have been noticeably worse. It interferes with my… social engagements, frankly. Difficult to properly greet one's acquaintances with a painful hand. A dreadful situation, really.
DOCTOR: Do you experience any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, a bit of swelling, on occasion. Not terribly dramatic, mind you. And… a general ache, you see. A dull throbbing that seems to worsen with the humidity. And occasionally… a bit of difficulty gripping things. Small things, mostly. Like doorknobs, or… the handles of my teacups. It's rather… inconvenient, frankly. A lady shouldn’t have to struggle with a teacup.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried any other treatments for this, besides the liniment you mentioned?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I had a course of physical therapy a few years ago. Dreadfully boring, if you ask me. All those stretching exercises… and the young man kept insisting I needed to “build core strength”. Honestly! And I’ve tried some of those over-the-counter pain relievers, but they simply don’t seem to… penetrate the problem, you see. And I’m rather wary of stronger medications, as I mentioned. All those warnings about side effects… it's all rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but that’s been… managed. And a touch of… indigestion, if I eat anything too rich. Nothing serious, mind you. And a rather nasty bout of the flu last winter, but I recovered nicely, thank you very much. I’ve always prided myself on my constitution, you see. A sturdy Dominican build, if I may say so myself. It's served me well. Though even sturdy builds have their limitations, apparently.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications for any of these conditions?
PATIENT: No, not currently. The blood pressure has been quite stable, thank you very much. I simply watch my salt intake. And the indigestion… well, a little bicarbonate of soda usually does the trick. I prefer to avoid pharmaceuticals whenever possible. Too many unpleasant side effects, you see. A simple life, with simple remedies… that’s always been my motto. Though, admittedly, this arthritis is proving rather… resistant to simple remedies.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a quick physical examination. Please extend your arms for me.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Be gentle, Doctor. These old joints aren’t quite as supple as they used to be. And do try not to take too long. I have a luncheon appointment this afternoon, you see. Mrs. Abernathy is hosting, naturally. Though I suspect it’s merely an excuse to boast about the wonders of… that treatment. Still, one must maintain social graces, you understand.
DOCTOR: Range of motion appears… limited. Some crepitus noted on both hands. Mild swelling present in the metacarpophalangeal joints. Strength is… adequate, though slightly diminished. Now, let me check your knees. Please bend them for me.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. There we go. Bit of a twinge, you see. It’s always worse first thing in the morning. And especially on damp days, as I mentioned. One feels every ache and pain. I do try to stay active, you understand. A bit of gardening, a gentle stroll… but it's becoming increasingly difficult, frankly. And I do dislike complaining, you see. A lady shouldn’t have to discuss such… unpleasant matters. But it’s simply become… unavoidable, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Some crepitus in both knees. Mild effusion noted. Range of motion… restricted. Pain reported on flexion. Alright. I’ve reviewed your history and performed a basic examination. It appears you have osteoarthritis, most likely. Now, regarding your request for a certificate for medicinal marijuana...
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… that’s what I suspected, I suppose. And what does that… entail, Doctor? Regarding the certificate, you see. Is it simply a matter of filling out some paperwork? And will it truly alleviate this… discomfort? I do hope it doesn't involve… unpleasant side effects. I’ve heard such mixed reports, you understand. And I must say, I’d rather not become… reliant on anything, if I can avoid it. A lady maintains her dignity, you see.
DOCTOR: While I acknowledge your discomfort, and the… desire for alternative treatment, I must be frank. The evidence supporting the efficacy of medicinal marijuana for osteoarthritis is… limited, at best. And given your age and medical history, I have concerns about potential interactions and side effects. While I am not entirely opposed to exploring all avenues, I would recommend a more conventional approach initially: physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and potentially a referral to a rheumatologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. I will not be issuing a certificate for medicinal marijuana at this time.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I… I must say, Doctor, I am rather disappointed. I had hoped for a more… understanding approach. Mrs. Abernathy has found it quite beneficial, you see. And I hardly think it’s unreasonable to explore all options, especially if conventional methods have proven… inadequate. A rheumatologist, you say? More appointments, more examinations… It's all rather… exhausting. And frankly, I'm not convinced it's necessary. A simple certificate, Doctor, that's all I'm requesting. Is that truly too much to ask? And what exactly are your concerns, if you don't mind me asking? Specifically. It's my body, after all.
DOCTOR: The primary concern, Ms. Ranells, is the potential for drug interactions given your age and the fact that you are not currently under the close supervision of a specialist. Medicinal marijuana can interact with other medications, and your cardiovascular history necessitates caution. Additionally, the cognitive effects, even if mild, could pose a risk. And frankly, I have concerns about the… recreational potential. I understand your desire for relief, but I am ethically obligated to prioritize your safety and recommend evidence-based treatments. A referral to a rheumatologist would allow for a more thorough evaluation and a tailored treatment plan. I can provide you with a list of qualified specialists in the area. We can discuss pain management options and explore alternative therapies in the meantime.
PATIENT: Recreational potential? Doctor, I assure you, I have no interest in… frivolous pursuits. I simply wish to alleviate the discomfort in my joints. And frankly, I find your insinuations rather… condescending. My neighbor, Mrs. Abernathy, is a perfectly respectable woman, and she has found it immensely helpful. I fail to see why my situation should be any different. Very well. A rheumatologist, you say? I suppose I have little choice. But I must say, I remain unconvinced. And I expect a thorough explanation of all potential treatments, with a clear outline of the risks and benefits. And I certainly won’t be subjected to any further… condescending remarks. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe it's time we conclude this… unsatisfactory consultation. Perhaps you could simply provide me with that list of specialists? And then, I believe I’ll be on my way. I have a luncheon engagement, you see.
DOCTOR: Here is a list of qualified rheumatologists in the area. I have also included some information on alternative pain management techniques. As I stated before, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with a specialist as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Though I must say, this has been… a rather disappointing experience. I had hoped for a more compassionate and understanding approach. Very well. I shall consult with a specialist, as you suggest. But I remain skeptical. Thank you… I suppose.
