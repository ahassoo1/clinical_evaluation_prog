DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Albino. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my back... it’s been bothering me. Lower back, mostly. It’s just… achy, you know? Not a sharp pain, just a dull ache. It's been getting worse lately.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Albino. A dull ache in the lower back that’s been worsening… I understand. Could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? It was just a little thing then, after I helped my grandson move some boxes. He’s a strong boy, but boxes are heavy! I didn't think much of it, just thought I pulled something. But it… hasn't gone away. And now, it's more than just after lifting. Even just sitting for a long time, it gets bad.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, after helping your grandson move boxes. And it’s progressed beyond just exertion, now bothering you even with prolonged sitting. That’s helpful information. Can you describe the pain a little further?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, it’s not sharp. It’s… a heavy feeling. Like someone is sitting on my lower back. Sometimes it feels like it goes down my legs a little bit, but not always. And it’s worse in the mornings, when I get out of bed. Getting up is… a process. I have to roll over slow and then just… ease myself up. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: A heavy feeling, sometimes radiating down your legs, and worse in the mornings upon waking. That sounds quite uncomfortable, Albino. When you say it radiates down your legs, could you tell me where specifically you feel that sensation?
PATIENT: It’s mostly down the back of my legs. Not all the way to my feet, thankfully. More like… from my hips down to just above my knees. And it’s not always both legs. Sometimes it's just the left one, sometimes the right. It depends, I think. On how much I moved around the day before, maybe. It's funny, you know? I used to be so active.
DOCTOR: From your hips down to just above your knees, and it seems to fluctuate depending on your activity level. It’s understandable that it’s frustrating to have your activity level impacted. Now, aside from the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Sometimes my legs feel… tingly. Not numb, exactly, but like… pins and needles. That doesn’t happen every day, but when the pain is really bad, I get that. And I feel… weaker, maybe. Not like I can’t walk, but I tire out easier. I used to walk to the store every day. Now I have to take a taxi more often. It’s just… getting old, I guess.
DOCTOR: Tingling sensations and some weakness… I understand. That’s important information. Have you experienced any bowel or bladder changes?
PATIENT: Bowel or bladder… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. Everything seems normal there. No trouble going to the bathroom, no… accidents or anything like that. I eat pretty regularly, too. Not much has changed in that department.
DOCTOR: Good. That's reassuring. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as arthritis or diabetes?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. I had high blood pressure for a while, but they got it under control with medicine. I had a bad fall when I was younger, broke my wrist, but that healed up fine. Oh, and the doctor told me… a few years ago… that my bones weren’t as strong as they should be. Something about… losing density? I forget the name of it.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, a past broken wrist, and a mention of decreased bone density… That’s helpful. Do you recall what the doctor called the condition affecting your bone density?
PATIENT: It was… osteoporosis! That’s it. Osteoporosis. He said it’s common when you get older. He told me to take some calcium and vitamin D, but I… haven’t been very good about it, to be honest. It’s hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Osteoporosis… thank you. And you’ve been inconsistent with the calcium and vitamin D. Do you take any other medications currently, Albino?
PATIENT: Just the medicine for my blood pressure. A small white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes, if my arthritis acts up, I take some over-the-counter pain reliever. Like ibuprofen. But not very often. Mostly just when it's really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, thankfully. My wife, God rest her soul, was a wonderful cook. I miss her cooking. But no allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife didn't like it. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven't had a drink in… oh, maybe ten years? And I certainly don't do any of… that other stuff.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Albino. That completes my questions for now. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination, if you don’t mind. This will involve checking your back, legs, and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything hurts. I'm an old man, so things might creak a little.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be gentle. Please lie face down on the examination table for me. Okay, Albino, I’m going to gently press on your back here. Tell me if you feel any pain or tenderness. There's some tenderness here, along the lumbar spine. Now, I'd like you to gently bend forward and touch your toes, if you’re able. Limited range of motion with forward flexion, and reports of mild discomfort. Now, let's try bending backwards. Also limited in backward flexion, and reports mild discomfort. Let's check your reflexes now. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Now, I’d like you to push against my hand with your legs. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally in both legs. Finally, let's check sensation. Can you tell me when you feel me touching your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's alright. It's a little uncomfortable bending backwards, but not too bad. Feels… stiff, you know? Like rusty hinges. And yes, I can feel you touching my legs. Everything feels… normal there. Maybe a little tingly sometimes, like I mentioned before, but mostly okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Albino. Everything feels normal aside from the reported tingling. Based on the history and physical examination, and considering your age and osteoporosis diagnosis, it appears you are experiencing lumbar spinal stenosis, likely with some associated muscle strain. The narrowing of the spinal canal is causing pressure on the nerves, leading to the pain, tingling, and weakness you've been experiencing. The stiffness and limited range of motion are likely due to muscle strain and possibly some arthritic changes as well. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, I would like to order some imaging studies. I recommend an MRI of the lumbar spine. It will give us a detailed view of the spinal canal and nerves. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: MRI… that sounds… serious. Is it painful? And expensive? I don't have insurance, you see. My wife… she took care of all that. I'm a bit worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Albino. An MRI is not painful at all. You will lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it takes about 30-40 minutes. You’ll need to lie very still. As for the cost, I understand you do not have insurance. Let me see what options are available to you. We have a financial counseling department that can help you explore payment plans or potential assistance programs. I will also speak with the radiology department to see if they offer any discounts for self-pay patients. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend the following: Over-the-counter pain relievers: Continue taking ibuprofen as needed, but be mindful of the dosage and potential side effects. Heat or ice: Apply heat or ice to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time. Gentle exercise: Avoid strenuous activities, but try to stay active with gentle exercises like walking or swimming. Physical therapy: I believe physical therapy would be very beneficial in strengthening your back muscles and improving your range of motion. We can discuss a referral to a physical therapist once we have the MRI results. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. Walking I can do, I think. And the heat and ice… my wife used to say that helps too. Physical therapy… that sounds good, if I can afford it. What about… those shots people get? For their back? Would that help? My neighbor said they worked wonders for him.
DOCTOR: You're referring to corticosteroid injections, often called epidural steroid injections. They can provide temporary relief from back pain by reducing inflammation around the nerves. However, they are not a long-term solution and have potential side effects. They're typically used when pain is severe and interfering with your daily activities, and in conjunction with other treatments like physical therapy. In your case, Albino, given your osteoporosis and the potential for side effects, I would like to reserve this as a last resort. We first need to determine the cause of your pain with the MRI and see how you respond to conservative treatments like pain relievers, heat/ice, and physical therapy. Would you like me to go ahead and order the MRI and a referral to a physical therapist?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Let’s do the MRI. And the physical therapy… yes, that sounds good. I want to be able to walk to the store again. It's just… lonely at home all the time. Just… please, let me know about the cost before you do anything. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Albino. I will personally ensure you receive a clear estimate of the costs for both the MRI and physical therapy before proceeding. I’ll have my assistant contact you with that information as soon as possible. We’ll schedule the MRI for you at the imaging center closest to your home. And I’ll provide you with a list of qualified physical therapists in your area. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as severe pain, numbness, or weakness. We are here to help. Do you have any other questions for me today, Albino?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. And patient with an old man. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Albino. It was my pleasure. Remember, we're here to support you. We’ll get those costs to you shortly and schedule your appointments. Please, take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. It was lovely meeting you.
