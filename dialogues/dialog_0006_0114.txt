DOCTOR: Alright, good morning. Maribeth, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Good morning to you as well, Doctor… Gorga, isn’t it? I appreciate you seeing me. I’d like to get this sorted out if we could, please.
DOCTOR: Gorga, yes, that's right. Look, things… slip my mind sometimes. It's been a long day already. So, what brings you in today, Maribeth?
PATIENT: Well, it's my breathing. When I lie flat, it gets… difficult. Like something is pressing on my chest. It doesn’t bother me when I’m sitting up, or even standing, but the moment I try to recline… it’s uncomfortable, to say the least. It's been going on for, oh, maybe a month now? Perhaps a little longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing trouble when lying flat… a month or so. Any pain with the difficulty breathing, or just… discomfort?
PATIENT: It's not a sharp pain, Doctor. More like… a heaviness. A pressure. And sometimes, a little bit of… fluttering, I suppose you’d call it. It doesn't radiate anywhere, it just stays right here, in my chest. <points to her chest> It’s quite bothersome when I'm trying to sleep, naturally.
DOCTOR: Heaviness and pressure, no radiating pain… fluttering. Alright. Any cough associated with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No cough at all. I haven't been sick, not even a little cold. That’s what’s so strange about it. I feel perfectly alright when I'm upright. It's just… this breathing when I try to lie down. Do you think it could be something serious? I'd really prefer to not have a lot of tests, if we could avoid them.
DOCTOR: Avoiding tests is… preferable, certainly. Let's see… No cough, that's good. Okay. Do you have any history of heart problems, Maribeth?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I am aware of. My father had high blood pressure, but he lived to be eighty-seven, so I suppose it wasn’t too bad. I've never been told I had any trouble with my heart. I used to walk quite a bit, you know, before my knees started acting up. Nothing serious, just… old age, I presume. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. <adjusts her dress>
DOCTOR: Alright, no known heart problems, father had high blood pressure… knees are acting up. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’ve noticed. I check them occasionally, since my sister had some trouble with that a few years back, but mine seem perfectly normal. They haven't been puffy or anything. Just… knees. They ache, mostly when the weather changes. Do you need to know anything else about my medical history? I’m trying to remember if there’s anything relevant, but it’s been a long time since I was truly unwell.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick listen to your lungs and heart, just to be sure. Then we can talk about possibilities. Just a routine check, nothing to worry about. If you could just lie back on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. <starts to slowly rise from the chair> I suppose a quick listen is reasonable. Though I do find lying flat… is there a way to prop my head up a bit? It’s much more comfortable that way. Perhaps with a pillow?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We can adjust the table, or I have pillows here. Let's try raising the head of the table first. <adjusts the table to a slightly reclined position> Is that any better?
PATIENT: Yes, that's much better, thank you. <lies back carefully, arranging herself on the table> That's a good deal more comfortable. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I’m hoping it’s nothing too serious. I do have a book club meeting this afternoon, you see. <smiles faintly> It would be dreadful to miss it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. And again… Okay. Sounds… a little congested, but nothing alarming. Heart sounds are regular, though a bit faint. <pauses, then checks Maribeth’s pulse> Pulse is a bit on the slower side, but within normal limits. Let's check your oxygen saturation just to be safe. <attaches a pulse oximeter to Maribeth’s finger>
PATIENT: Very well. A bit congested, you say? Is that from… allergies, perhaps? I haven't been around any dust or anything, but the pollen count has been rather high lately. It's just… I don't usually have trouble breathing. It's primarily this issue when I lie down. I hope it’s nothing that requires a lot of medication. I try to keep things simple, you see. <fidgets slightly>
DOCTOR: Oxygen saturation is 94%, which is acceptable. But…congestion with breathing difficulty only when lying flat…and a slightly slower pulse... Hmm. It could be allergies, yes, but that doesn't fully explain the positional aspect. Do you take any medications currently, Maribeth?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis in my hands, Doctor. It’s naproxen, 220 milligrams, once a day. Nothing else. And I take a vitamin D supplement, since I don't get out in the sun much anymore. That’s it, I assure you. I try to avoid medications whenever possible. My mother always said they do more harm than good. <adjusts the pillow under her head> Is that relevant? Perhaps I should mention I have a bit of trouble sleeping, though not every night.
DOCTOR: Naproxen and vitamin D… trouble sleeping. Okay. And you mentioned your mother thought medications do more harm than good… Are you hesitant to take medications in general, Maribeth?
PATIENT: Well, yes, Doctor, I suppose I am. I’m not opposed to them entirely, but I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. A warm cup of tea, a good book… things like that. My mother was very… cautious about things. She lived to be ninety-three, and she rarely saw a doctor. She always said fresh air and a positive attitude were the best medicine. <smiles faintly> I try to follow her example, although I confess my knees aren't cooperating as well as I’d like. Is that… unhelpful? I don’t mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: No, not unhelpful at all. It’s good to be mindful of your health and prefer natural approaches. But sometimes, a little help is needed. Given your history, the positional breathing difficulty, and the faint heart sounds… I think we should do a chest X-ray just to rule out anything serious. It’s a quick procedure, and it will give us a clearer picture. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… <frowns slightly> Oh dear. I really wasn’t hoping for that. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I’ve always been… rather sensitive to radiation. And I’m not fond of hospitals, to be perfectly honest. I do trust your judgment, of course, but is there no other way to determine the cause? Perhaps a different test? Or… could it simply be allergies, after all? It has been a very pollen-heavy season.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Maribeth. We can certainly discuss alternatives, but with your symptoms, it's important to rule out things like fluid in the lungs or heart enlargement. While allergies are possible, the positional aspect is concerning, and an X-ray is the quickest way to get a definitive answer. The radiation exposure is minimal, far less than many people realize. However, if you're truly averse, we could try a course of stronger allergy medication and a close follow-up appointment. But if your symptoms worsen, or don't improve within a week, we would need to proceed with the X-ray regardless. How does that sound as a compromise?
PATIENT: A compromise… that sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Stronger allergy medication and a close follow-up… yes, I suppose that’s acceptable. I do trust your expertise, and I understand your concerns. But I’d really prefer to avoid the X-ray if possible. And a close follow-up is certainly agreeable. What kind of allergy medication are you thinking of? And how closely are we talking? I have that book club meeting on Thursday… <adjusts herself slightly on the table> It would be dreadful to miss that, as well.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. I’ll prescribe loratadine, 10 milligrams daily, and a nasal steroid spray, fluticasone, one spray in each nostril daily. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today. If your symptoms haven’t improved, or if they worsen at all, call the office immediately, and we'll schedule that X-ray. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly clear. Loratadine and fluticasone… daily. And a follow-up appointment next week. And to call immediately if anything worsens. Thank you, Doctor Gorga. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I do hope it’s simply allergies, after all. <starts to slowly sit up> Perhaps I can get a good night’s sleep now. Is there anything else I need to know before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, Maribeth. Just follow the medication instructions carefully, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. The nurse will give you a prescription and schedule your follow-up appointment. <pauses, then offers a small, slightly distracted smile> Get some rest, and enjoy your book club meeting. And if the symptoms persist, we’ll revisit the X-ray. Is there a work note that you need?
PATIENT: Oh, a work note would be most helpful, Doctor. I do some light clerical work at the library, and I’d like to let them know I might need to take things easy for a few days. Just something simple, stating that I’m under medical care. <smiles faintly> Thank you again for your kindness and attention, Doctor Gorga. I truly appreciate it. <starts to gather her purse and coat> I believe that is everything. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Here you go. “Maribeth Vanderwiele is under my care for respiratory symptoms. May require reduced workload for a few days.” That should suffice. And you have a good day as well, Maribeth. <pauses, then glances at the door> Feel better. .
