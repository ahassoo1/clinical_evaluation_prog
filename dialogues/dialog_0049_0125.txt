DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, well, I requested a test for… you know. HIV. Just want to get it checked, really. No need to make a fuss, I’m sure it’s nothing. Just being sensible, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Sensible is always good. Alright. And have you had any… specific concerns that led you to request this test now, or is this just part of a routine check-up, so to speak?
PATIENT: Routine? No, not exactly. It’s just… my wife and I, we’ve been… exploring a few new things, let's say. And I figured it’s best to be sure, you know? Better safe than sorry and all that. Though honestly, I doubt it’ll be anything. She’s… very careful.
DOCTOR: I see. Exploring new things… right. And when did this… exploration begin?
PATIENT: About three months ago, give or take. We went on holiday to Thailand, and… well, things escalated. It was a bit of a spontaneous trip, actually. She surprised me with it. Not that I’m complaining, but… you can imagine. It's not like back home, is it?
DOCTOR: Thailand…Right. And were precautions taken during these… activities?
PATIENT: Precautions? Of course. Condoms, mostly. Though... I admit, sometimes things get a little... heated. You know how it is. It's not like we planned for anything to go wrong. Honestly, I just want a quick test and a piece of mind. Is that too much to ask? It's not like I'm the reckless one here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, it's important to be forthright about these things. A lapse in protection, even once, can be significant. We need to be accurate with our assessment. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been tested for sexually transmitted infections before this?
PATIENT: Look, I already told you we used protection. A few times. I'm not reckless. And frankly, I find your tone a little condescending. I'm a grown man, I know about safe sex. And no, I haven't had any tests before. Why would I? I've been married for ten years, and before that... well, it wasn’t exactly a wild youth. Is that what you're implying? It's a little insulting, really.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I’m not implying anything. It’s standard procedure to gather a complete history. It’s for your benefit. However, if you prefer to simply proceed with the test without providing further information, that is your prerogative. But please understand, a negative test result now does not necessarily rule out future concerns. Now, have you experienced any symptoms at all – anything unusual, such as fever, fatigue, rash, swollen lymph nodes, or any… gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine. No, I haven’t had any… “symptoms.” A bit tired, maybe. But I work long hours, so that’s hardly surprising, is it? And no rash, no swollen anything, no… gastrointestinal issues. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. Can we just get this over with? I have a very busy schedule, you know. This is taking far too long. It's just a blood test, right? Simple. In and out. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll proceed with the HIV antibody test. It’s a simple blood draw, as you said. However, given your recent travel to Thailand, and the… activities you’ve described, I also recommend a panel of other STIs – syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, hepatitis B and C. It’s more comprehensive, and can give us a clearer picture. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I just want the HIV test. I'm not paying for a whole load of tests I don’t need. I told you, I use protection. It's very simple. I don't understand why you're trying to upsell me on things I don't want. It's a waste of my time and money. Just the HIV test, please. Is that so difficult? It's my body, my money, and frankly, your judgment is getting rather irritating. I just want to be sure about one thing. Stop trying to scare me with a list of horrible diseases I probably don’t have.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I am not attempting to “scare” you. I am providing medically sound advice, based on your stated activities and risk factors. However, you are an adult and have the right to refuse any tests you do not wish to undergo. Very well. We will proceed with the HIV antibody test only. Please be aware that it can take several weeks for antibodies to develop after exposure, so a negative result at this time does not definitively rule out infection. We can repeat the test in three months if you wish. Now, let’s get the blood draw. I’ll have the nurse come in.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Three months, you say? Right. I’ll remember that. Though I highly doubt it’ll be necessary. Honestly, this whole experience has been rather… unpleasant. Just… hurry up, please. I have things to do. And try to be a little less judgmental next time, alright? It's not appreciated.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll inform the nurse. Nurse! Blood draw for Mr. Belan, please. STAT. The nurse will be with you shortly. Thank you for your time, Mr. Belan. .
