DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're a new patient to our clinic. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Shely, you say? A… nice name. I am here because… well, my daughter, she thinks I need a little… encouragement. A card from a real doctor, she said. Something to show I am… getting better. Not that I need it, you understand. But she worries. A lot.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your daughter’s thoughtfulness, Mr. Kammer. It’s wonderful to have family support. So, if I understand correctly, you're here for a general check-up, perhaps to reassure your daughter about your overall health?
PATIENT: Reassure? No, no. I am fine. Perfectly fine. I just… I run the boilers down at the plant, you see? Big responsibility. A man needs to appear healthy when he's in charge of something like that. Folks get nervous if they think the boiler man is… fragile. A card would be… professional. That’s all. Not a check-up. Definitely not a check-up.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. You'd like a note documenting your good health for your work. We can certainly do that. To provide the most accurate documentation, could you tell me a little bit about your general health history?
PATIENT: History? What kind of history? I… I work with boilers, not books! I mean, I've had a few aches and pains, like any man my age. Back goes out sometimes when I’m bending over the pipes. And my knees… well, they aren't what they used to be. But who’s knees are at my age? I don't go to doctors for every little thing. Weakens a man, all that poking and prodding. I just need the card, Doctor. A simple “Mr. Kammer is in good health” will do nicely. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Kammer. We can certainly provide that. However, even for a simple note, it's helpful to have a little more information to ensure accuracy. Perhaps we can frame it as simply documenting your ability to perform your job duties safely?
PATIENT: Safely? Of course, I work safely! I've been working with boilers for thirty years! Never had an accident. Not a single one. Folks down at the plant trust me with their lives, practically. They depend on me to keep the heat on, keep the lights on. I know those boilers inside and out. So, what do you need to know? But make it quick, please. I have a shift to get back to. Don’t need to be gone all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Just a few quick questions then. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High… what was it? Pressure? No. Never had that. Always been… regular. A little heartburn sometimes, after a spicy meal. But that’s not a condition, Doctor. Just… food. And the heart… well, it beats, doesn't it? As far as I know. Never had any trouble with it. I keep myself busy, you see? Always moving, always working. That's good for the heart, I figure. Don't sit around all day like some folks. That’s what causes trouble.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Mr. Kammer. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never. I fix things, Doctor, I don’t go to places to get fixed. Had a bad cut on my hand once, working on a pipe. Needed a few stitches from old man Henderson, the plant medic. But that wasn’t a hospital. Just a little bandage and a strong word about being careful. That's it. Never been under the knife, never been stuck in one of those… places. Don’t like hospitals. Smells like… sickness.
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Kammer. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or vitamins?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Nothing. I eat good food, get a little sleep when I can, and that’s that. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache. But that’s not a medication, Doctor. That’s just… relief. Old man Henderson always said too much medicine is worse than too little. And I tend to agree with him. He was a smart man, that Henderson. Seen a lot, he had. Not like these young doctors these days. Always with the pills and the potions… No, I don’t take anything. Just keep working. That’s my medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Let me think. No. I don't think so. Maybe a little sniffle when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that’s just the season changing, not an allergy. I eat everything. My wife used to make a wonderful coq au vin, spicy and rich, never bothered me a bit. And I’ve handled all sorts of chemicals down at the plant, never had a reaction. No, no allergies. I’m a pretty sturdy man, Doctor. Sturdy. Now, about that card… is it almost ready? My shift starts in a few hours.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you are indeed a very sturdy man. Based on what you’ve told me, and to document your statement of good health and ability to perform your duties at the plant, I am happy to provide a note for your employer. Before I do, though, it would be prudent to conduct a brief physical exam, just to confirm some of what you’ve described. A quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a few basic neurological tests. It'll only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Now hold on just a minute, Doctor. You said you were going to write the card. I told you everything you needed to know! Thirty years running boilers, never a sick day, sturdy as they come. You don’t need to poke and prod me like some… experiment. I came here for a card, not a check-up! My daughter… she shouldn't have sent me here. Just write the card, Doctor. That’s all I ask. And make it professional. You understand? Professional. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have a plant to get back to. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your reluctance. However, as a physician, I have a responsibility to ensure I have a complete understanding of your health status before providing any documentation, even a simple note. A brief exam isn’t to contradict your statements, but to fulfill my professional obligations. Given your concerns, and to honor your wishes as much as possible, I will limit the exam to a basic assessment: blood pressure, pulse, and a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be acceptable?
