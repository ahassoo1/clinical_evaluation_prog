DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s been hard to, uh, empty my bladder lately. Like it doesn't all come out, you know? It’s a little embarrassing to talk about, but it's been happening more and more.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's perfectly alright to talk about these things – that’s what I’m here for. It’s good you brought it up. So, just to clarify, you're saying you feel like you're not completely emptying your bladder when you urinate?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Not completely. Like… there’s still some left in there, even after I try. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… uncomfortable. And I gotta go back and try again pretty soon after, which… well, it's not good when I’m out fishing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I guess, maybe… three, four months ago? It wasn't too bad at first, just now and then. But the last month or so it's gotten worse, like I said. More frequent, and harder to… get everything out. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months, gradually worsening. And is there any pain while you're urinating?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. Like I said, it’s just… a feeling of not being finished. And sometimes, a little bit of strain, trying to push it out. It doesn't hurt to strain, just… effort. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. No pain with urination, but a sensation of incomplete emptying and some straining. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… hmm. I haven’t really paid much attention, to be honest. It looks… normal, I guess? The usual color. I haven’t seen any blood, and it doesn't smell different than usual. I haven’t really looked closely, if you know what I mean. I’m not one for checking those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no noticeable changes in the urine itself. Alright. Now, have you been experiencing any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I have been getting up a little more at night to go. Not every night, but more than I used to. And I feel like I’m a little… more tired lately, but I’m getting older, so… could just be that. I don’t know. Nothing else I can think of, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased nighttime urination and some increased fatigue. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don't mind. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder taken out maybe ten years ago. And I’ve got a little bit of high blood pressure, but I take a pill for that every day. Other than that, I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood. My wife… she passed away five years ago. That was hard. That’s about it, really. Medicare covers everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, high blood pressure managed with medication. I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Hilber. And yes, Medicare is helpful. Any family history of similar urinary issues, or kidney problems, that you know of?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had some trouble with her bladder when she got older. I remember her going to the doctor a few times for it. Not sure exactly what it was, though. My father was healthy as a horse. He never had any trouble. And my wife… I don't recall her having any bladder problems. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one pill for the blood pressure. Every morning. And a little vitamin D in the winter, 'cause we don't get much sun here. That's it. I don’t like taking too many pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication and a little vitamin D. Now, let’s talk about your social habits, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. My wife didn’t like it, and I didn't want to start. And I don't drink much. A beer with dinner sometimes, that’s about it. I mostly just like to fish. And I’m retired, so I don't do a lot of heavy lifting anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol, retired and no heavy lifting. Okay, Mr. Hilber, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright with you. I'll need to check your abdomen and do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. That’ll help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh. A… a rectal exam? Well… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… is it necessary? It sounds… unpleasant. I don’t want to be rude, Doctor, but I wasn't expecting that.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It’s not the most comfortable exam, you’re right, but it’s a very important part of evaluating these types of symptoms, particularly in men. It allows me to feel the size and consistency of your prostate gland, which can often tell me a lot about what’s going on. We can discuss alternatives, but without it, it’s harder to get a clear picture. I'll explain everything as I go, and we’ll go as quickly and gently as possible. It’s a routine procedure and very important for ruling things out. Would you like a moment to consider it?
PATIENT: Well… if it's really important. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… I don't like surprises, you know? If you say it's necessary to figure out what’s wrong, then go ahead. But please… be gentle. And explain everything, like you said. I’m not a fan of doctors, if you get my meaning.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber, I appreciate your trust. I will absolutely explain everything as I go, and I promise to be as gentle as possible. We’ll take it slow, and if at any point you feel uncomfortable, just let me know, and we’ll stop. If you'd like, you can lie down on your side. We'll start with an abdominal exam, just listening to your belly and feeling for any tenderness. Then we'll move on to the rectal exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. I suppose so. Listening to my belly sounds… less bad. Just… try not to poke too much, okay? And tell me what you're doing as you go, like you promised. This is all new to me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Hilber. I will explain everything as I go. I’m just listening to your abdomen now, checking for any unusual sounds. And I’m gently pressing on your belly to feel for any tenderness or masses. Do you feel any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little pressure, but no pain. It feels… normal, I guess. Like you’re just pushing on my stomach. It’s not comfortable, but it’s not hurting. Just… aware of you touching me, if you know what I mean. Are you finding anything?
DOCTOR: No, everything feels normal so far. Your abdomen is soft and there’s no tenderness or masses. That's good. Alright. Now, to get a better look at your prostate, I'm going to need to do a digital rectal exam. I’m going to ask you to bend over and take a deep breath. I’ll apply some lubrication and gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This will allow me to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. It’s important to relax as much as possible. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh boy. Okay. Relax, you said? It’s hard to relax when… well, never mind. Just get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the better. Just… try to be quick, Doctor. And tell me what you’re feeling, like you promised. This is… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber, I’m just gently feeling your prostate now. Take some deep breaths. Your prostate feels… slightly enlarged. It’s also a little bit firm, but not overly hard. There are no obvious nodules or areas of tenderness. Okay, that’s all done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Well… that wasn't pleasant, I can tell you that. A little uncomfortable, and… a bit of a strange sensation. Enlarged, you say? What does that mean? Is it serious? Is something wrong with me? I don't like the sound of "enlarged."
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hilber. An enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, is very common as men get older. It doesn't necessarily mean something serious is wrong. The prostate gland tends to grow larger with age, which can press on the urethra and cause some of the symptoms you’ve been experiencing – difficulty emptying your bladder, frequent urination, and straining. However, it's important to rule out other potential causes, such as prostatitis, which is inflammation of the prostate, or even prostate cancer, though that’s less likely given your exam findings. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests: a urine analysis to check for infection or other abnormalities, a PSA blood test to assess your prostate-specific antigen levels, and potentially a kidney function test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. I don't like the sound of all this. Cancer? You said cancer? I just want to be able to go fishing without worrying about it. What does the PSA test do exactly? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m not a fan of waiting around. And if it is something serious… what then?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Hilber. It’s natural to be concerned when you hear the word cancer. The PSA test is a blood test that measures the level of prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by the prostate gland. A higher PSA level can be indicative of prostate cancer, but it can also be elevated due to other conditions, such as BPH or prostatitis. It’s just one piece of the puzzle. We’re not jumping to any conclusions here. I want to rule out all possibilities, and these tests will help us do that. I’ll write you a lab order now. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll draw a little bit of blood. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once I have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. If the results are concerning, we may need to consider further testing, such as an ultrasound or, in some cases, a biopsy. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, which can irritate the bladder. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: Ultrasound… biopsy… That sounds… unpleasant, to say the least. Hydrate, avoid caffeine… I can do that. It's just… it’s a lot to take in. I was hoping for a simple answer. What’s the chance it’s just the enlarged prostate? Is that common? And… how long do I have to wait for these results? A few days? Like, two or three days? I need to get back to fishing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hilber. It's rarely a simple answer with these things, unfortunately. BPH is very common, especially as men age. It affects a significant percentage of men by the time they reach their 50s and 60s. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it’s certainly a possibility. The tests will help us determine the likelihood of that being the sole cause. The lab usually gets the results back within 3-5 business days. I'll have the nurse call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. It’s important to gather all the information before making any decisions. Focus on staying hydrated and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. And if you experience any fever, chills, or difficulty urinating, please contact the office immediately. Do you feel comfortable with this plan?
PATIENT: 3-5 days… alright. I suppose so. It's not ideal, but… what choice do I have? I'll try not to worry, like you say. And I’ll stay hydrated, avoid caffeine… and I'll contact you if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. I’ll go get the blood work done now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could explain everything. Take your time getting the blood work done, and don’t hesitate to ask the lab staff if you have any questions. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and try to relax.
