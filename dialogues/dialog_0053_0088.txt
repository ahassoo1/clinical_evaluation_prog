DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s this ringing in my ears. It’s been… well, it’s been annoying me for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, about three or four weeks, I think. It started kinda quiet, just a high-pitched whine, but it's gotten louder, especially at night. Makes it hard to sleep, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. And is it constant, this ringing?
PATIENT: No, not always. Sometimes it’s quiet enough I don’t notice it, especially if there’s a lot of noise around. But when it’s quiet… that’s when it really gets to me. Like right now, actually. You probably don’t hear it.
DOCTOR: Most people don’t, until it’s quite prominent. Now, have you been exposed to any particularly loud noises recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I can think of. I work at the restaurant, and it can get a bit busy, but nothing really loud. We don't have music blasting or anything. I did go to a wedding a month ago, maybe? There was a DJ there, but I wasn’t right next to the speakers or anything. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Possibly. It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without more information. Have you noticed any hearing loss, or any dizziness or balance issues accompanying the ringing?
PATIENT: No dizziness or anything like that. My hearing… I haven't really noticed it being worse, exactly. Things sound normal, I guess. But I haven't really been trying to listen for it either, you know? Just trying to ignore the ringing, mostly. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a quick listen to your ears, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you think is best. Just… try not to poke anything too far in there, alright? I’m a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: It's a standard otoscopic examination, Mr. Dhanoa. Perfectly safe. Just relax. Now, tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. Alright, left ear… hmm. And the right ear… Yes, there's a little cerumen buildup in both ears. Nothing alarming, but it could be contributing to the issue. I’m going to run a quick Weber and Rinne test to assess your bone and air conduction.
PATIENT: Okay… Weber and Rinne, right. Sounds… complicated. Just let me know if it’s gonna be… pokey. Seriously. I hate anything near my ears. I’m really just trying to get this ringing to stop, you know? It's driving me crazy. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Mr. Dhanoa. Most commonly, it's something relatively minor. But we need to rule out anything more significant. Now, focus on this tuning fork… do you hear it equally in both ears?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, I think so. It’s kinda hard to tell. It’s… a vibrating sound, right? Both ears feel like they’re getting it. Maybe the left is a little bit stronger? Or is that just because I’m focusing on it more? This is confusing. Can you just tell me if it's bad news or not? I really don’t have a lot of time today.
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to give you a definitive answer without a more thorough evaluation, Mr. Dhanoa. Now, for the Rinne test... I’m going to place this tuning fork on your mastoid bone, behind your ear. Tell me when you can no longer hear it, then I’ll move it closer to your ear canal. Just focus, and let me know exactly when you can’t hear it anymore.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Behind the ear… right. I can hear it… yeah, still hearing it… it’s… getting quieter… uh… almost gone… now. I can't hear it anymore. Is that good or bad? Look, can we just skip to the part where you tell me what's wrong and what I need to do about it? I have an appointment I need to get to. Honestly, this is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: The results are… inconclusive, Mr. Dhanoa. It suggests some conductive hearing loss, likely due to the cerumen buildup, but it's not significant enough to definitively diagnose anything at this stage. We can remove the wax to see if that resolves the ringing. If it persists, we may need to consider further testing – an audiogram, perhaps. But let's start with the wax removal, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, wax removal sounds… good. Less poking, right? As long as it doesn't take too long. Just… hurry, please? I really do have to go. And how much is this going to cost me? I don’t have a lot of extra money. .
DOCTOR: The cerumen removal is a relatively quick procedure, Mr. Dhanoa. As for the cost, it depends on your insurance coverage. The billing department can provide you with a detailed estimate. Now, if you could just lean back and relax… and try to remain still. This may feel a little cool. Do you have any allergies to eardrops?
