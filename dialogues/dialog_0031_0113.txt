DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Rakosky, was it? Yes, yes. Well, it's this... business with the, uh, waterworks. Been going quite a bit lately, you see. More than usual. It's a bother, really. Especially when I'm trying to… well, never you mind what I’m trying to do. Just more often than it should be, that's the truth of it.
DOCTOR: I understand. You're experiencing increased frequency of urination. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Increased… what now? Look, I just go to the bathroom more. That’s all. More often. Day and night, really. Though… night is worse, I suppose. Waking up... it's not pleasant. My wife complains, you know. Says I'm disturbing her sleep. Honestly, I don’t remember when it started exactly. A while ago, certainly. Months, maybe? It just sort of... crept up on me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so increased frequency, particularly at night, disrupting your wife's sleep. And it's been going on for months. Have you noticed any other changes along with this?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm... Let me think. Well, I suppose I drink a fair bit of tea. Always have. And maybe I’m a bit thirstier than I used to be, now that you mention it. But that could just be the summer heat, couldn’t it? And… no, I don’t think so. No, wait. Sometimes, when I try to go, it takes a bit longer to… start, you see? A little hesitation. Not a big deal, usually. I just… wait a moment. Though sometimes it feels like it doesn’t all come out, if you catch my meaning.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased tea consumption, some increased thirst, hesitation starting urination, and a sensation of incomplete emptying. Do you have any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. A little discomfort, maybe. Like a… a mild strain, after. But no burning, thank goodness. I had a cousin, years ago, with… well, it wasn’t pleasant. Definitely no burning. Just… a little tiredness afterwards, like I’ve had to push a bit. And sometimes, a little dribble afterwards, you see? It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand that can be concerning, Mr. Segretto. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Well, my wife keeps track of all that. I try not to bother with too much fuss. But let me think. I had a bit of trouble with my heart years back, but the doctor said it was just a… a flutter. Nothing serious. High blood pressure, maybe? She’s always telling me to watch my salt. And… I don’t know about diabetes. I eat a fair amount of sweets, I must admit, but I’ve always been… robust, you see? Never been a small man. Medicare covers everything, so I don’t really pay attention to the details.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me see what Medicare has on file... It appears here you were diagnosed with hypertension approximately ten years ago, and you were briefly evaluated for atrial fibrillation, which was considered paroxysmal, meaning intermittent. No mention of diabetes, but your BMI is consistent with obesity. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! Yes. Appendicitis, when I was a young man. Ages ago, back in the old country, actually. And… a hernia, I think? A bit of poking out, and they fixed it. That was… oh, must be thirty years ago now. And my wife made me get my wisdom teeth out, too. Said they were causing trouble. Honestly, I don’t remember much about them. I mostly just remember the after-pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy, hernia repair, and wisdom teeth removal. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but it doesn't seem to bother me. My wife handles the pills, mostly. She keeps track of everything. I think… no, I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with any medicine. I used to take something for my arthritis, years ago, but that was a long time ago, and it didn't seem to help much. Mostly just rubbed some cream on my joints.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Given your symptoms – increased frequency, particularly at night, hesitation starting urination, a feeling of incomplete emptying, and your history of hypertension – it would be best to do a quick physical exam and a couple of tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. Well, I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. I'm not overly fond of doctors poking and prodding, you understand. But if it will tell us what's going on… yes, alright. Just be gentle, if you could, Doctor. And try not to take too long, eh? My wife is expecting me home for supper.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and we'll try to be quick. First, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll do a brief abdominal exam. After that, I'd like to do a digital rectal exam – that’s where I check your prostate – and collect a urine sample for analysis. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A… digital what now? Oh dear, oh dear. Look, Doctor, I'm an old man. I’ve lived a good life, but I don’t see the need for… poking around down there. Is that absolutely necessary? Can’t you just give me a pill or something? My wife will have my hide if I’m late for supper, and I’d rather not have you… down there. Honestly, it feels a bit… intrusive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I understand your reluctance, and I wouldn't suggest anything unless I felt it was important. A digital rectal exam is a quick and relatively painless way to check the size and texture of your prostate. In men your age, an enlarged prostate is a common cause of the symptoms you’re experiencing – the frequent urination, hesitation, and incomplete emptying. It's not about looking for something wrong, but ruling out something serious. Furthermore, it allows me to assess for any abnormalities. It's a standard part of a urological evaluation and helps me determine the best course of action. We can discuss alternatives, but without this assessment, it’s difficult to know what’s causing your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment. Would you be willing to reconsider, knowing it will help me better understand your condition?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. You make a good point, I suppose. An enlarged… prostate. Sounds unpleasant. And I don't want to make things worse. My wife always says I leave things too long before seeing a doctor, and she's probably right. Very well, Doctor. Do what you have to do. But be quick about it, eh? And… gentle, as you promised. And no funny business, mind you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. I appreciate your willingness. As I mentioned, it’s a quick exam. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to have you lie on your side. I will put on a glove and apply some lubricant. I’ll gently insert a finger into your rectum to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. It may cause some mild discomfort, but it shouldn’t be painful. And I assure you, it's a standard medical procedure and I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. After that, we will collect a urine sample. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable… I suppose. Just get it over with, Doctor. The sooner it's done, the better. I don’t relish the thought of… all that. And try not to make a fuss, eh? I’m a bit of a modest man, you see. Just be professional. And quick. Very quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. Professionalism is paramount. Please lie down on your left side with your knees drawn up towards your chest. I’ll explain each step as I go, and we’ll be done shortly.
PATIENT: Well, here goes nothing, I suppose. Don’t poke too hard, Doctor. And please hurry. My supper is getting cold, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I’m just going to apply a little lubricant to the glove now. This will make everything more comfortable. I’m going to gently insert a finger into your rectum. Take a few deep breaths and try to relax. Alright, that’s done. I felt a slightly enlarged prostate, which is common for men your age, and it feels relatively smooth. No immediately concerning nodules. Now, if you could just provide me with a urine sample, that would be helpful. There's a specimen cup in the bathroom. I’ll give you a few moments of privacy.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t too bad, I suppose. A bit undignified, perhaps, but not painful. Just… uncomfortable. Yes. Alright, a urine sample, you say? Very well. Let me just… get my bearings.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. Now, we’ll send this off to the lab for analysis. This will help us rule out any infection or other underlying causes for your symptoms. It typically takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, I’d like to discuss some potential causes and treatment options.
PATIENT: Good, good. Get it over with. So, what does all this mean, Doctor? Is it serious? And will I need… operations? My wife will be beside herself if I need operations.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, it's too early to say definitively. The most likely explanation for your symptoms is Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland. It's very common as men age. The lab results will help us rule out other causes, like a urinary tract infection. As for operations, not necessarily. Many cases of BPH can be managed with lifestyle modifications and medication. We can start with those and see how you respond. Lifestyle changes include reducing fluid intake before bed, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and double voiding – that’s making sure you fully empty your bladder each time you go. If those aren’t enough, we can discuss medications to help relax the muscles in your prostate or shrink the gland. Surgery is usually reserved for more severe cases that don’t respond to other treatments. We'll proceed step-by-step. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… Well, I can certainly try that. No caffeine before bed, you say? My wife will be pleased to hear that. She’s always nagging me about my tea. And medications… I suppose that’s better than operations. So, no cutting? Good. Yes, that sounds… acceptable. What kind of medications are we talking about? Any side effects? I don’t want to be… incapacitated.
DOCTOR: There are a couple of different types of medications we could consider. Alpha-blockers can help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder neck, which makes it easier to urinate. They can sometimes cause a slight drop in blood pressure or dizziness, so we’d start with a low dose and monitor you closely. The other option is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, which shrinks the prostate gland over time. These can sometimes cause sexual side effects, although they’re not common. We would discuss the potential benefits and risks of each medication and decide which one is best for you. It's also important to know that it may take a few weeks or months to see the full effects of the medication. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the lab results and discuss your progress. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms, like fever, chills, or inability to urinate, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm. Sexual side effects… Well, that's not ideal. I suppose a slight drop in blood pressure is preferable. My wife will have a fit if… never mind. So, let's start with the one that won't… interfere with things. And you'll monitor me closely, you say? Good. Yes, that sounds… sensible. Two weeks, you say? Alright. And if things get worse, I contact the office. Yes, I understand. No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for… explaining everything. It's reassuring to know there are options.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. I'm glad I could reassure you. I'll put in the orders for the lab tests and medication. The nurse will review the instructions with you before you leave. We'll take things one step at a time. Remember, it's important to be patient and communicate any concerns you have along the way. Here's a handout with more information about BPH and the medications we discussed. I'll see you in two weeks. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Have a good day, Mr. Segretto. And try to get some rest. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Yes, thank you. I appreciate your help. And I will try to get some rest… although my wife has other plans, I suspect. Goodbye to you too, Doctor Rakosky. And thank you again. .
