DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in… yes. It is… the words. They do not come so easily now. I have trouble… finding them. It is very frustrating, you understand. I… I forget what I want to say, mid-sentence, sometimes. It's… difficult.
DOCTOR: I see. That is frustrating, Sherrell. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with word-finding – aphasia, perhaps. And it’s relatively recent, correct?
PATIENT: Aphasia? I… I do not know that word, Doctor. Is that… bad? And… recent? Yes, I think so. It is not… always been this way. It started… hmm… maybe six months ago? Or was it eight? Time… it slips my mind sometimes. It is getting… more frequent, I think. It makes… conversations difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. Aphasia simply means difficulty with language – understanding or expressing it. It’s not necessarily “bad,” but it can be a sign of something that needs to be investigated. Six to eight months… that’s helpful. And it’s becoming more frequent – can you give me an example of a situation where you've noticed it recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… an example… let me think. Just yesterday, I was speaking with Frau Schmidt… the baker. Very nice woman. I wanted to ask her about… the bread. The rye bread, specifically. But… the word for “rye”… it just wouldn’t come. I… I said “the dark bread,” and she looked very confused! Then… then I had to… point at it. It was… embarrassing. And this happens… more and more.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pointing instead of using the word… that gives me a clearer picture. And it sounds like you're very aware of the difficulty. Have you noticed any difficulty understanding what people say to you, or is it mostly with finding the right words when you speak?
PATIENT: Mostly… when I speak, yes. Understanding… usually I can follow along. Sometimes… if someone uses a… complicated word, I must ask them to repeat it. But it’s not… a constant problem. It is the… getting the words out that is the trouble. It feels like… they are just… stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell, that’s very helpful. So, primarily expressive aphasia – difficulty with speaking – and it sounds like your comprehension is mostly intact. Now, let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this language difficulty?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. I… I have been a little more tired lately, perhaps. Not… terribly so, but I need… more naps. And… my hand. Sometimes it… shakes a little. Just a small tremor, mostly when I am trying to write. I… I thought it was just old age, you understand. My wife… she passed away two years ago, and… well, things have not been quite the same since.
DOCTOR: I understand, Sherrell. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and grief can certainly manifest in many ways. The tiredness and the tremor are both important things to mention. When did you first notice the hand tremor?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is… kind of you to say so. The tremor… hmm. It started around the same time as the… the trouble with the words, I think. Perhaps six or seven months ago. It is… not constant. It is more noticeable when I try to… to write a letter, or… to eat with a fork. It’s a small shake, you understand. Nothing… dramatic. But it bothers me, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. So, tremor and language difficulties both starting around the same time, six to seven months ago. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure… yes, the doctor told me, many years ago. I… I take pills for it. A small white pill, every morning. Diabetes… no, I do not think so. And… heart problems… no. I had a… a check-up last year, and the doctor said my heart was… strong. I… I try to eat healthy, you understand. Mostly vegetables and… fish.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. High blood pressure, managed with medication. That’s important to know. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… a good question. I… I do not remember the name. My wife… she handled all the medications. She… she was very organized. I just… take the little white pill, every morning, as she told me. I… I can ask Frau Schmidt, perhaps? She is very good with… things like that.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Sherrell. We can look it up in your records if you’d like. I see here you’ve been prescribed Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, daily. Have you been taking it consistently?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes, that sounds… familiar. Yes, I believe so. I… I try to take it every morning, with my breakfast. Sometimes… sometimes I forget, and take it with lunch instead. But… mostly I am consistent, yes. I… I do not like to miss my pills, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. Lisinopril, mostly consistent. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Yes… many years ago, I had my appendix removed. When I was a young man. And… yes, I had a… a knee replacement, about ten years ago. The left knee. It… it bothers me sometimes, especially when it is cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. Appendectomy and a left knee replacement. Now, can you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Family medical history… hmm. My mother… she had… heart trouble, I believe. She passed away when I was quite young. And my father… he had… I think it was diabetes. Yes, that sounds right. And… my sister… she had some trouble with her… memory, later in life. She… she forgot things, quite often.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. Heart trouble in your mother, diabetes in your father, and memory issues in your sister. Now, regarding your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I… I do not smoke. Never have. And… I do not drink alcohol, either. My wife… she did not approve. And… I do not use any… recreational drugs. I… I am a simple man. I like to garden, and read… and visit with Frau Schmidt.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. Non-smoker, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, Doctor. I do not believe so. I have never had a… a reaction to any medications. I… I can eat anything. I… I like strawberries very much. And… cats. I like cats, too. Although, my wife… she was allergic.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. No known allergies. Thank you for providing me with all this information. Now, I would like to do a brief physical exam to assess your condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. I… I trust your judgement. Please, do what you need to do. I… I am a patient man.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 142/88, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6. A bit elevated, the blood pressure, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Now, I'll check your neurological function. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? Yes, I can see it. It is… a little difficult to focus sometimes, but I am trying.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to check your strength and reflexes. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that… strong enough? It’s… a little difficult, my hands are not as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. It feels good. Now, I'm going to gently tap your knees with this reflex hammer. Okay, good reflexes on both sides. Now, I want to check your gait. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? I… I am a little unsteady on my feet sometimes, you understand. The knee… it bothers me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Sherrell. Your gait is slightly unsteady, and I notice a mild limp on your left side, likely from the knee replacement. Based on everything we’ve discussed – the language difficulties, tiredness, hand tremor, and the physical exam findings – I'm concerned about a few possibilities. The elevation in blood pressure is also something we need to address. I want to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and I think an MRI of your brain would be helpful to look for any structural abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: MRI… of the brain? That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. Is it… necessary? I… I understand you are the expert, but… is it something to worry about? Blood tests… yes, I suppose that is alright. But the MRI… it frightens me a little.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherrell. It is a bit daunting, I agree. An MRI is very safe, though. It uses magnetic waves to create detailed images of your brain, and it doesn't involve any radiation. It's not necessarily to worry about, but more to investigate what might be causing your symptoms. It will help us rule out things like stroke, tumors, or other neurological conditions that could be contributing to the language difficulties and tremor. It’s the most thorough way to get answers. We can discuss the details of the procedure at length, and you can ask any questions you have. Would you like to proceed with the blood tests first, and we can then talk about the MRI in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. The blood tests… yes, that sounds… sensible. Perhaps… if we have the results, it will make the MRI… less frightening. I… I trust your judgement, you understand. I just… I am a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Of course, Sherrell. It's perfectly normal to be nervous. I will order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. These tests will give us a good baseline understanding of your overall health. We’ll also need to schedule that MRI. I’ll have my assistant, Ingrid, help you with that. She’s very good at explaining the procedure and answering questions. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, I want to address your blood pressure. I'm going to prescribe a low dose of Amlodipine to help lower it. It's important to take it as prescribed. Do you have any questions about any of this so far?
PATIENT: Amlodipine… for the blood pressure. Yes, I… I can write that down. Ingrid… will help with the MRI. That is… good. So, blood tests, and this pill… and then we see what the results say? I… I think I understand. But… will these tests tell us why I am having trouble finding the words? That is… what I worry about the most.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Sherrell. The tests won’t necessarily give us a definitive answer on their own. They will help us rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or other medical conditions. If the tests come back normal, it’s more likely that the language difficulties and tremor are neurological in nature, and the MRI will help us pinpoint the cause within the brain. We also need to consider the possibility of early-stage dementia, although it’s too early to say for certain. The MRI and further neurological evaluation, if needed, will help us clarify the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. I understand this is a lot of information, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take it one step at a time. Now, I’m going to write you a prescription for the Amlodipine and a lab order for the blood tests. Ingrid will schedule the MRI for you and answer any questions you may have. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: Dementia… you said dementia? Oh dear. That… that frightens me even more than the MRI. I… I hope it is not that. I… I still enjoy my garden, and reading. And talking with Frau Schmidt. I… I don’t want to lose that.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Sherrell. It's natural to be concerned when you hear that word. I said it as a possibility, a remote possibility, that we need to rule out. It’s far too early to make any definitive conclusions. Many things can cause language difficulties and tremors, and dementia is just one of them. A lot of people experience temporary memory lapses or difficulty finding words, especially as they get older. But it's important to investigate and rule out any serious underlying causes. We're not jumping to any conclusions. We are simply gathering information, and the MRI will be a crucial step in that process. It’s important to remember that even if it were something like dementia, there are treatments and therapies available to help manage the symptoms and maintain your quality of life. Let's focus on getting the tests done first, and then we'll discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions about the MRI procedure itself?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. It is… a picture. Of the brain. No radiation. And Ingrid will explain it better. I… I will try not to worry too much. Thank you, Doctor. You have… been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. It’s my job. And it’s perfectly alright to feel anxious. Take your time, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. Ingrid is excellent, and she'll make sure you're well-informed and comfortable. I’m confident we can get to the bottom of this. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, take care of yourself, and try to focus on the things you enjoy. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… all. Thank you again. I believe… I will go home now.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let Ingrid know if you have trouble scheduling the MRI, and don’t hesitate to call the office if anything comes up. Take care, Sherrell. .
PATIENT: .
