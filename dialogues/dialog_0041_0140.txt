DOCTOR: Hi Antoine, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I haven't got all day. It's… a bit of a nuisance, really. Something in my mouth. White patches. My wife said I should come, but honestly, I doubt it’s anything serious. Just get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll try to be as quick as we can while still figuring out what's going on. White patches, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, white patches. On my tongue mostly, and… inside my cheeks, I suppose. It’s not painful, exactly. Just… unpleasant. And it’s embarrassing, frankly. I’m a professional man, Doctor. I don’t have time for… mouth problems.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Not painful, just unpleasant and embarrassing. And it's mostly on your tongue and the inside of your cheeks. When did you first notice these patches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A week? Maybe ten days. It's hard to say. I don't spend my days inspecting my mouth, Doctor. It just… appeared. Probably from something I ate. I travel a lot, you see, and the food isn't always… up to standard.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about a week to ten days. And you travel frequently, so potentially related to something you ate while traveling. Have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Like what? I haven’t suddenly grown a second head, if that’s what you’re asking. No, nothing else. Perhaps a little… difficulty tasting things properly, but that could be my imagination. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a medical professional. I don’t know what to look for. It's just a white film, and it’s irritating.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little difficulty tasting things, and mostly just irritation from the white film. Have you had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms at all, even a slight sore throat or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Fever? Doctor, I’ve been perfectly fine. No chills, no sore throat, nothing. I told you, it’s not serious. I eat well, I sleep well, I’m a reasonably healthy man. It's probably just a bit of… a coating, that’s all. Are we going to get to the point, or are you just going to keep asking me about things I don’t have?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, sore throat, or difficulty swallowing. I just want to rule things out, Antoine. Have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve always had a strong constitution. My wife… she worries too much. I suspect she read something online and decided I was dying of some exotic disease. I assure you, Doctor, this is not a medical emergency.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications. Not a fan of pills, if I’m honest. Allergies… well, I’m not fond of cats, if that counts. But I don’t have any actual allergies, no. Nothing that requires an EpiPen, I can assure you. Now, can we please get on with examining this… nuisance? I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or allergies. Let's take a quick look then. If you don’t mind, could you open your mouth wide for me?
PATIENT: Just get it over with, please. I haven't got all day to spend with my mouth open. And try not to poke around too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the patches you're talking about. They do look a bit irregular. And they wipe off fairly easily, which is good. No obvious sores or bleeding. I don’t see any swelling or redness. Have you been using any new mouthwashes or toothpastes recently?
PATIENT: No. I’ve used the same toothpaste for twenty years, Doctor. Sensodyne, if you must know. And I certainly haven’t been experimenting with mouthwashes. I brush twice a day, like a sensible person, and that’s it. Honestly, I find all this questioning rather… unnecessary. Is it something contagious, perhaps? My wife is rather particular about hygiene.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t appear to be contagious based on what I see. The most likely explanation, given your history and the fact that it wipes off easily, is oral thrush, also known as candidiasis. It’s a fungal infection that can happen when there’s an imbalance of bacteria in your mouth. It’s not usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable. Does that sound like anything you've heard of?
PATIENT: Thrush? Like the bird? You’re telling me I have a bird… in my mouth? Doctor, with all due respect, that sounds preposterous. I’ve never had any problems with fungal infections before. I maintain a perfectly healthy lifestyle. And I certainly haven't been near any birds. Is it… dangerous? Do I need… antibiotics? I haven’t got time for a prolonged illness.
DOCTOR: No, no, not a literal thrush, like the bird! It’s named after the whitish appearance, similar to the bird’s colour. It’s a common fungal infection caused by Candida, a type of yeast that naturally lives in your mouth. It usually isn’t dangerous, but it can be unpleasant. It's often caused by something as simple as a recent course of antibiotics, but you haven't mentioned taking any. Sometimes it happens with a bit of dryness in the mouth, or with certain medical conditions. We don't necessarily need antibiotics, as it's a fungal infection. We usually treat it with an antifungal mouthwash or lozenge. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Antifungal… mouthwash. Very well. As long as it doesn’t taste awful and it doesn’t require me to spend hours gargling. And as long as it’s a quick solution. I have a reputation to maintain, Doctor. I can’t be seen cancelling meetings because of… mouthwash. What’s involved? And how long will this… treatment take?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It's usually a fairly straightforward treatment. I can prescribe a mouthwash called Nystatin. You swish it around in your mouth for about a minute, a few times a day, after meals. It doesn’t taste fantastic, admittedly, a bit sweet and chalky, but it's manageable. Typically, you’ll need to use it for about seven to ten days. It should start to improve within a few days. I'll also recommend staying well hydrated and avoiding sugary drinks, as that can feed the yeast. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Seven to ten days. No sugary drinks. I suppose I can manage that. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my wine consumption. And is there anything else I should be aware of? Any side effects? I don’t want to suddenly develop a rash or something equally… inconvenient. Just write the prescription, Doctor. I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. There are very few side effects. Some people experience mild nausea or stomach upset, but it's rare. And it shouldn't interfere with your wine consumption in moderation. Here you go. I'll also give you a handout with more information about oral thrush and how to use the mouthwash. If it doesn't improve after a week, or if you develop any new symptoms, please give the clinic a call to schedule a follow-up. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just get rid of this… thrush, as you call it. And thank you for your time, Doctor. Though, frankly, I could have spent the afternoon more productively. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Antoine. Get well soon. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
