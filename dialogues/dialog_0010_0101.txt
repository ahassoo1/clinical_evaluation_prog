DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t you have a seat, and tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Pleasure’s all mine. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been havin’. Right at the back of me head. Been botherin’ me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head. And how long is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Started, I’d say, maybe three weeks ago? Not constant, you understand. Comes and goes. Mostly in the evenin’s, after I've been on me feet all day. Workin’ with hands, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, three weeks of intermittent headaches, primarily in the evenings after physical work. Can you describe the headache itself?
PATIENT: It’s not a sharp pain, Doctor. More of a… a dull ache, really. Like a heavy weight sittin’ right at the base of me skull. Sometimes it spreads a bit up the back of me neck too. Nothin’ that makes me wanna scream, but it’s definitely noticeable. And it makes it hard to relax, y’know? Especially after a long day workin’ on people's nails.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull, heavy ache at the base of the skull, sometimes radiating up the neck. Not sharp, but interferes with relaxation. You mentioned working on people’s nails – is that your occupation?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Manicurist and pedicurist. Been doin’ it for… goodness, almost fifty years now! It’s good work, keeps me busy, but it is a lot of bendin’ and reachin’, and holdin’ people’s hands just so. I suppose that could have somethin' to do with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, fifty years as a manicurist and pedicurist. That's a long time! Bending, reaching, and precise hand movements – we’ll definitely keep that in mind. Besides the headache, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Now that you mention it, me eyesight's been a little blurry sometimes, especially at the end of the day. I just figured it was me age, to be honest. And maybe a little tiredness. But I haven't felt sick or anything, no fever, no dizziness. Just the ache and the blurry vision, now that I think on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision alongside the headache, particularly at the end of the day. No fever, no dizziness, no other systemic symptoms. Have you made any changes to your diet or medication recently?
PATIENT: No changes to me diet, Doctor. I eat pretty much the same things I always have – mostly Jamaican food, you know? Ackee and saltfish, rice and peas, that sort of thing. And I don’t take any medication regularly. Just the occasional painkiller if me arthritis flares up, but I haven’t needed any for the headache. I try to avoid takin' pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, consistent diet, no regular medications. We'll note the occasional painkiller for arthritis. Now, have you ever had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: No, not like this. I get the occasional tension headache, you know, from stress or if I'm tired, but those are usually all over me head, and a bit easier to deal with. This one's different. It’s localized, right at the back, and it feels… deeper, somehow. More persistent. It’s definitely somethin’ new.
DOCTOR: Okay, this headache is different from your usual tension headaches – localized to the back of the head and more persistent. Do you have any family history of headaches, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Me mother used to get terrible migraines when she was younger, awful things. Couldn't do nothin' when one of those came on. But that was her, not anyone else in the family, as far as I know. No one else had headaches like that or anythin' about the nerves, not that I'm aware of. We didn't talk about those things much back then, y’know?
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of migraines in your mother, but no other known family history of neurological conditions. Just to get a full picture, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor, not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anythin'. And I’ve never had any problems with medicine, even the strong stuff when I had me arthritis flare-ups. I’m a pretty healthy man, all things considered. Besides this headache, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Go right ahead. I’m ready when you are. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to have you gently turn your head side to side and look up and down. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort while doing that. Is there tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little bit, Doctor. Not sharp pain, but a definite ache when I go over to the left. Feels… tight, like the muscle’s all knotted up. It’s worse when you press right there. And yes, it is a little tight. I usually rub it myself, but it doesn’t seem to help much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness and tightness in the left side of the neck at the base of the skull. Your reflexes are normal, strength is equal on both sides, and sensation is intact. Now, I'm going to check your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. The retina appears normal, though I do notice some slight clouding of the lens, which is common at your age. Based on the exam, it seems like you likely have a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by muscle strain in your neck. The clouding of your lens isn't likely contributing to the headache, but it's something to keep an eye on. However, given your age and the recent onset of blurry vision, I'd like to be cautious. I'm going to recommend a CT scan of your head to rule out any other potential causes, just to be sure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan… yes, alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. Better safe than sorry, as they say. So, it could be just muscle strain? From workin’ too hard? That would explain a lot. But the blurry vision… that’s what worries me. I just want to get to the bottom of it, you know? It's hard to work when you're constantly achin' and can't see properly. So yes, let’s do the scan. Tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your concerns. The blurry vision is definitely something we need to investigate further. It could be related to the muscle strain, or it could be something else entirely, and that's why the CT scan is important. I’ll write you a referral for the scan. You'll need to schedule an appointment at the imaging center – I can give you the number and address. They'll need to know you're getting a CT scan of the head with and without contrast. In the meantime, I recommend taking an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed, and applying heat to your neck muscles. Try to take breaks during work to stretch and avoid prolonged bending or straining. I'll also give you a prescription for a muscle relaxant – cyclobenzaprine – to help ease the tension in your neck. Start with one 10mg tablet at bedtime. We’ll get the results of the scan back within a few days, and I’ll call you to discuss them and make a plan. Does that all sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. Thank you. So, ibuprofen, heat, muscle relaxant, and the scan. And then you'll call me with the results. I appreciate you takin’ it seriously. Can I still work while I’m takin’ the muscle relaxant? I don't wanna lose income, you know? And will those pills make me sleepy? I try to stay sharp when I'm doin' people's nails.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. Cyclobenzaprine can cause drowsiness, so you'll want to be cautious. I recommend avoiding tasks that require a lot of concentration or operate heavy machinery while you're taking it, especially in the beginning. If you find it’s making you too sleepy, reduce the dose to half a tablet at bedtime, or stop taking it altogether. As for working, it depends on how you feel. If you can comfortably perform your job without feeling drowsy or impaired, it’s probably okay. But prioritize your safety and the safety of your clients. If you’re even slightly unsure, it’s best to take a day off. Here’s the referral for the CT scan and the prescription for the muscle relaxant. The imaging center number is 555-123-4567. If you have any questions about the scan itself, don’t hesitate to call them. And please, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – severe headache, dizziness, weakness, changes in vision – call my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate you explainin’ it all so clearly. I’ll schedule the scan first thing tomorrow, and I’ll be careful with the pills. Thank you again. I hope it’s just a little muscle strain, but it’s good to know we’re gettin’ it checked out. Have a good day, Doctor Annesley.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And I hope it is just muscle strain as well. Take care of yourself, and I’ll talk to you soon. .
