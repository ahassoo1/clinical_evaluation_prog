DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Try to be concise, if you would. My schedule is rather…packed.
PATIENT: Umm... hi. It’s my nails. They look… funny. Not good funny. They changed. I don’t remember how they changed, exactly. Just… different. I saw a thing on the TV about nails, and figured I should get it checked. Don’t wanna lose ‘em, ya know?
DOCTOR: “Changed,” you say. A rather vague description, I must admit. Can you elaborate at all on how they have changed?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? How am I supposed to describe a nail change? They’re… kinda yellow now, I think. And maybe thicker? Not super thick, just… not as smooth. And one of ‘em is kinda… peeling? I don’t know! It’s a nail thing. You're the doctor! You tell me what's wrong with ‘em. It's been a few months, I guess. Maybe longer. Time kinda…blurs.
DOCTOR: A few months…blurring time. Yes, well. Yellow discoloration and thickening…peeling, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, peeling. Like… a little bit chipped off at the end. It’s not a big peel, just… noticeable. And the yellow is… kinda gross, if I’m being honest. Makes me feel like I never clean. Which I do! Mostly. It’s just… there. On my nails. Is it serious? You think it’s a fungus? I read about those. Really scary pictures.
DOCTOR: Let’s see… Ms. Thut, you are 40 years of age, height 154 cm, weight 141 kg, insured with Medicare. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Umm… I don’t think so. I mean, I get a little sniffly sometimes with the dust, but that’s just normal, right? Everyone gets sniffly. Not a real allergy, like peanuts or bees. Just…dust. I don't take any pills, ‘cept for a little something for my knee, sometimes. But that's not an allergy. Does that answer your question? Or do you need a long list? ‘Cause I really don’t have one.
DOCTOR: Dust is irrelevant. Any medications for your knee, you said?
PATIENT: Oh! Right. Just when it flares up. It’s… a cream. Dr. Habib gave it to me, years ago. I don't even remember the name. It’s white and comes in a little tube. I don’t use it all the time. Just when I walk too much. It helps the pain. I don’t think it has anything to do with my nails, though. That’s knee stuff. This is nail stuff. You’re making me think really hard now!
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a look at these nails then, shall we?
PATIENT: Here. Go ahead. Don’t be gentle, I guess. They’re not exactly… delicate. And try not to stare too much, okay? It's kinda embarrassing. They are pretty bad, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes. Discoloration is present, as you mentioned. There is some thickening, and on one nail…subungual hyperkeratosis. It appears to be fairly localized. And some slight distal onycholysis. Do you recall any recent trauma to the nails?
PATIENT: Trauma? What’s trauma? Like, did I hurt ‘em? I don’t… I don’t think so. I do a little gardening, but I wear gloves. And I definitely haven't, like, slammed ‘em in a door or anything. Maybe I stubbed a toe a few weeks ago, but that wasn't the nail toe, if that makes sense. It was the big one. Does gardening count as trauma? It’s pretty gentle gardening, mostly. Mostly flowers.
DOCTOR: Gardening is unlikely to be the cause. Ms. Thut, this appears to be a fungal infection of the nails, also known as onychomycosis. It is…common, particularly in individuals with…certain medical conditions. Now, we can confirm this with a laboratory test – a nail clipping for analysis. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Fungus?! Oh, great. Just what I needed. A fungus. Is it… contagious? Am I gonna give it to everyone? I just touched the grocery cart! Ugh. And a test? You gotta clip my nails? Can’t you just… tell by looking at them? It looks like fungus to me, too. Isn't that enough? I don’t like clipping. Especially not now.
DOCTOR: While a visual examination can be suggestive, Ms. Thut, a laboratory test is necessary for definitive diagnosis. We need to identify the specific fungus present to determine the appropriate course of treatment. As for contagiousness…yes, it is possible to spread it, though not highly so. And yes, precautions should be taken. Now, about the clipping…it's a very small sample. Necessary. I will arrange for it now.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. And be quick about it, okay? I have… things to do. And don't stare! Seriously. This is humiliating. Are you sure you can't just… give me a cream? Like the one for my knee? Maybe that’ll work?
DOCTOR: There. That wasn’t so bad, was it?
PATIENT: It was awful! You just… snipped it off! It’s gonna hurt later, I just know it. And now what? I gotta walk around with a missing piece of nail? This is ridiculous. How long does this… test thing take? And what if it isn't fungus? What then? Will you just keep clipping my nails forever?
DOCTOR: The laboratory typically takes approximately two weeks for results. If it is not fungus, we will re-evaluate. Now, I will write a requisition for the lab. I would advise you to keep the nails clean and dry in the meantime, and avoid any trauma to them. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Clean and dry? That's it? That doesn’t sound very helpful. And what about… polish? Can I still wear polish? It makes me feel better. And what about… my shoes? Do I need special shoes? This fungus sounds really serious. You should tell me everything I need to know, not just “clean and dry.” I want a list. A proper list, with instructions. And maybe some pictures. Pictures of what not to do. You're the doctor!
DOCTOR: Very well. I will prepare a brief informational sheet. It will outline basic hygiene practices, limitations on nail polish use, and suggestions regarding footwear. I assure you, Ms. Thut, it is not as dire as you seem to believe. Here. This should address your concerns. Now, if that is all… I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: "Avoid tight-fitting shoes?" What kind of shoes can I wear then? This is useless! And what kind of fungus is it likely to be? There are so many types of fungus! It doesn't even say anything about pictures! You really didn’t explain anything. I feel worse now than I did before I came in here. This is… disappointing. Fine. I’ll… go home and read this. But I still think you should have pictures. Fungus… honestly.
