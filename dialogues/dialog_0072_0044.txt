DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Sachar. I'm Dr. Hembrey. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I received a letter about being assessed for… home health, was it? Or hospice eligibility? I’m not entirely sure, to be honest. I was hoping you could explain it a bit more and see if it’s something I qualify for.
DOCTOR: Home health or hospice…yes. It seems there’s been some…miscommunication. Those are very different services, Ms. Sachar. And usually, one doesn't simply receive a letter offering eligibility. Did a case manager or another physician refer you?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That doesn’t sound good. No, no one referred me, Doctor. The letter just…arrived in the mail. It had the clinic’s name and said something about assessing my needs for care at home. I thought it might be something to help with… well, things have been a bit difficult lately, and I figured it couldn't hurt to check. I really don’t know anything beyond that, honestly. Perhaps it was a mistake?
DOCTOR: A letter arriving unsolicited…yes, that is unusual. And frankly, a bit concerning. It suggests a lack of proper protocol. Regardless, we need to determine the basis for this assessment. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Chronic illnesses… hmm. Let me think. I have high blood pressure, Doctor. It’s been managed with medication for about five years now. And I was diagnosed with arthritis in my hands a couple of years ago. It flares up sometimes, makes it difficult to… well, to do things with my hands. That’s why I’m a presser, you know? It’s not as demanding. But other than that… nothing major, I don’t think. I had pneumonia last year, but that cleared up completely.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure and arthritis. And you had pneumonia last year. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms related to either of those conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My arthritis has been particularly bad these last few months. My hands are very swollen and painful, especially in the mornings. It makes it hard to get dressed, cook, even hold a cup of tea. And my blood pressure… well, I’ve been feeling a bit more tired lately, a little dizzy sometimes. I try to take my medication regularly, but… it hasn't felt quite right. I haven’t wanted to bother the doctor with it if the medication is working, you understand? Just hoping it's a phase.
DOCTOR: “A phase.” Right. And how would you rate your pain, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult one. On a good day, maybe a three or four. But on a bad day… when it's really flared up, it gets to be an eight, easily. It’s a throbbing, aching pain, mostly in my knuckles and wrists. It just makes everything so difficult. Makes me want to just stay in bed all day, you know? It keeps me from doing things I enjoy.
DOCTOR: An eight, consistently. And how has this pain impacted your daily activities – beyond the difficulty with dressing and cooking?
PATIENT: Well, I work, of course. But I've had to reduce my hours. It's hard to stand for long periods, and the presser work requires a lot of fine motor skills. It's becoming harder and harder. I used to enjoy gardening, but I can barely hold the tools now. And… honestly, Doctor? I've been neglecting things. The house is a mess, I haven't been seeing my friends as much. I just don’t have the energy, or the… well, the will, sometimes. I feel… useless, I suppose. It’s silly, I know. But it’s the truth.
DOCTOR: “Silly” is not the appropriate term, Ms. Sachar. However, attributing emotional distress solely to physical discomfort is…simplistic. Now, let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than the pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been hospitalized before, besides for the pneumonia last year. I’ve always been a pretty healthy person, honestly. I eat okay, I try to get some exercise when I can… before the arthritis got so bad. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox… nothing serious. No surgeries, no major accidents. Just the high blood pressure and the arthritis, and now… this exhaustion. It’s just wearing me down. It's really unlike me to feel this way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, too, Doctor. And she had some arthritis in her hands when she got older. She passed away a few years ago, from a heart attack. My father… he was healthy as a horse, actually. Never had any serious illnesses. He passed away when I was young, a car accident. I don't really know much about his family history, to be honest. We weren't very close. But I don't recall any other major illnesses running in the family, if that helps. Mostly just… normal wear and tear, I suppose.
DOCTOR: And finally, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother was very strict about that. And I'm glad she was, to be honest. I don't drink much either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I live alone, in a small apartment. I used to be very active in the community, volunteering at the local library, but… like I said, I haven't been doing much lately. It’s just… difficult to get out and about, with everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take ibuprofen for the arthritis pain, when it gets really bad. It helps a little, but not as much as it used to. And I take a multivitamin, just to try and stay healthy. That’s it, really. Nothing else. I used to use a cream for my hands, but it didn't seem to make much difference, so I stopped using it. I mostly just try to rest when I can, but… that’s not always easy, you know? It feels like there's always something I should be doing.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sachar, while I appreciate your willingness to share this information, I must be frank. Your presentation is…complex. The unsolicited letter regarding home health or hospice is concerning. Your fatigue, coupled with poorly controlled arthritis and consistent pain levels of eight, warrants a thorough investigation. Before we proceed, are you experiencing any shortness of breath, chest pain, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No shortness of breath, and no chest pain. My appetite hasn’t been great lately, I’ll admit. I think it’s just the exhaustion, I haven’t been feeling hungry. I haven’t weighed myself recently, so I don’t know about unexplained weight loss, but I haven’t lost a significant amount of weight, if that helps. It’s just… everything feels heavy, you know? Physically and… emotionally. But no, no shortness of breath or chest pain. Is that a bad sign, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's good that you aren’t experiencing shortness of breath or chest pain. However, your fatigue and persistent pain require a systematic approach. Your blood pressure is elevated, 150/90. Not ideal, but not immediately alarming. Pulse is slightly elevated at 88. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Significant swelling and tenderness in both hands and wrists, consistent with arthritis. I also note some limited range of motion. I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions or other causes for your fatigue. We will also need to assess your kidney function and check for anemia. I also recommend a referral to a rheumatologist for further evaluation of your arthritis.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. I appreciate that. Blood work and a rheumatologist… that sounds sensible. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? I’m just tired of feeling… like this. What about the letter, though? The one about home health or hospice? Should I just ignore it? It’s all a bit confusing. And… will this be expensive? I don’t have insurance, Doctor. That’s another worry.
DOCTOR: The letter is, frankly, unacceptable. I will make a note to investigate the source of that communication. It appears to be a clerical error, or a miscommunication, but we must address it to prevent further confusion. Regarding the cost… that is a valid concern. Without insurance, the blood work and rheumatology consultation will be your responsibility. However, my office can explore potential financial assistance programs and discuss a payment plan with you. It is important to prioritize your health, Ms. Sachar, and we will do our best to make that affordable. I’m issuing orders for a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and C-reactive protein. I will also generate a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly regarded rheumatologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, continue to take your blood pressure medication as prescribed. And if you experience any worsening symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, or severe swelling – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and… investigate everything. And thank you for looking into the financial assistance programs. That’s a huge weight off my mind, honestly. I feel a little better just knowing we have a plan. Thank you again, Doctor Hembrey. I'll wait for Dr. Vance’s office to contact me.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sachar. I expect you to contact my office immediately if you experience any concerning changes in your condition. We will follow up with you after you have seen Dr. Vance. Please have a seat in the waiting room, and the nurse will provide you with the lab requisitions and referral information. Take care.
