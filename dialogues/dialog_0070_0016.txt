DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s about my bruising. It’s just…more than usual, you understand? I’ve been on this blood thinner for a while now, since…well, since my wife passed, and it usually keeps things stable. But lately, I’ve been knocking into things and…well, little bumps turn into these huge purple spots. It’s quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re experiencing increased bruising despite being on a blood thinner that previously managed things well. That is concerning, and good you're bringing it to my attention. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this change?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's hard to pinpoint exactly. Probably…oh, within the last month or so. At first, I just thought I was being clumsier, you know? Old age creeping up. But it’s…persistent. It’s not like I suddenly started falling down stairs. Just…more noticeable. I bumped my shin on the coffee table about a week ago, and it’s still looking quite black. It shouldn't be this bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so within the last month, a noticeable increase in bruising severity even with minor impacts, and this has persisted. And you mentioned a bruise on your shin a week ago that is still quite dark. Now, just to clarify, when you say “blood thinner,” which medication are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Warfarin, Doctor. That’s what they prescribed after…well, after everything. I’ve been very diligent about taking it, same time every evening, and I get my levels checked regularly, like they tell me to. I’m usually very good about keeping up with things, you understand? It’s just…this bruising is starting to worry me. It feels…off.
DOCTOR: Yes, Warfarin. And you're diligent with your medication and regular level checks—that's excellent. It's good you’re proactive about that. “Feels off” is a good way to put it. We need to investigate this further. Besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…other symptoms? Let me think. Not really. No…I haven't felt particularly weak. No dizziness. No…bleeding gums or anything like that. Just the bruising, and frankly, a bit of anxiety about it. It’s…unsettling, you understand? I don’t want to end up in the hospital. This blood thinner is supposed to prevent things, not cause them.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety completely, Mr. Farson. It's certainly concerning when a medication meant to help seems to be causing problems. The lack of other symptoms like weakness or bleeding is reassuring, but we still need to figure out what's going on. Let’s review your medical history a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions besides what might have led to starting the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had a…a rather unfortunate incident a few years back. Atrial fibrillation, that’s what they called it. That’s what led to the Warfarin, of course. Other than that…high blood pressure, but it’s usually well-controlled with medication. And…arthritis, the usual old man aches and pains, nothing serious. I try to stay active, you understand? Don't want to just sit around and rot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of atrial fibrillation, for which you’re taking Warfarin, and well-controlled hypertension and arthritis. Good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see…yes, actually. Years ago – probably twenty years now – I had my appendix removed. And…a rather nasty bout of pneumonia when I was traveling in Guatemala, back when my wife was still with me. That required a stay in the hospital, but nothing since then, really. Mostly just routine checkups and…well, keeping up with things, you understand? A man has to stay on top of these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and a past hospitalization for pneumonia. And you mentioned you were traveling in Guatemala – do you have any family there, or did you grow up there?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am Guatemalan. Born and raised. My wife and I moved here – to the States – about thirty years ago. We…had opportunities here. But we always kept close ties to our family back home. I still have several cousins and nieces and nephews there. It’s…difficult now, of course. Not easy to travel back and forth. Especially…alone. But I try to send money when I can, you understand? Family is important. Though, frankly, this bruising is starting to make me worry about being able to travel at all soon. It’s just…unpredictable.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and maintaining ties to family back home is admirable. And your concern about travel is valid, given the unpredictable bruising. Now, regarding your family history – are there any bleeding disorders or unusual bruising tendencies that run in your family, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. To my knowledge, no. No one that I’m aware of. My family…they were mostly healthy people, hard workers. Farmers, mostly. No one ever talked about bleeding problems or anything like that. My wife…her side of the family, same thing. Very…robust people, you understand? Which is why this is so concerning. It’s not like I have a family history of this sort of thing. It just…appeared.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of bleeding disorders. Let’s talk about medications. Besides Warfarin and the medication for your blood pressure, are you taking any other prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the usual, Doctor. A little vitamin D in the winter, because I don't get much sun. And…sometimes I take ibuprofen for my arthritis when it’s really acting up. But nothing regularly, you understand? I try to avoid taking too many pills. It feels…unhealthy, loading up on things. That’s all. Vitamin D and occasional ibuprofen. Honestly, I’m very careful about what I put in my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, Vitamin D and occasional ibuprofen. Good. We're getting a good picture here. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve always been…rather lucky that way, you understand? No allergies. Which is why this bruising is so puzzling. It’s not like I’m having an allergic reaction, is it? It’s just…appearing, with no explanation. It's quite frustrating, frankly.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright, Mr. Farson, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I think it's time to do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a closer look at these bruises. We'll start with your blood pressure, if you don't mind.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m trusting your expertise here. It’s just…I’d like to get to the bottom of this, you understand? It’s unsettling, not knowing what’s going on. Go ahead, take my blood pressure. I’ll just sit here and…try to relax. Easier said than done, of course. But I’ll try.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. It's within the range we expect, considering you mentioned taking medication for hypertension. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Finally, let's take a closer look at these bruises. Could you point to the most prominent ones for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. The worst one is…here, on my shin, as I mentioned. It’s still quite dark, even after a week. And here, on my forearm – I bumped it against the doorframe yesterday, and it’s already starting to turn purple. And…a few smaller ones on my thighs, but those aren't as noticeable. Honestly, it's starting to feel ridiculous. I’m like an old piece of fruit, bruising at the slightest touch. It's quite worrying, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. The bruise on your shin is quite extensive, and it does appear darker than I’d expect for a week old. The one on your forearm is developing rapidly, and those smaller ones on your thighs are also concerning. They do seem more pronounced than what we'd typically see with minor trauma. Based on what you’ve told me, and this physical exam, it does appear you are experiencing more bruising than expected, despite being on Warfarin and having regular monitoring. Now, to get a clearer picture of what's going on, I'd like to order some blood work. We need to check your INR – that's the test that measures how well your blood is clotting – to make sure your Warfarin dose is appropriate. We'll also check a complete blood count to rule out any other underlying issues, like a low platelet count. And I’ll order a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds…thorough. Absolutely. I trust your judgment. Anything to get to the bottom of this. Check everything. INR, complete blood count, whatever you think is necessary. I just want to know what’s going on, you understand? It’s unsettling, not knowing. So, yes, order the tests. The more information, the better. Though, frankly, I hope it’s nothing serious. I don’t want to end up…confined to a hospital bed.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Farson, and I agree – more information is best. We're going to get to the bottom of this. Okay, I’ve just ordered the blood work. The lab technician will come up shortly to draw the samples. It usually takes a few hours to get the results back, and we can discuss them as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I want to be cautious. I'm going to recommend avoiding any activities that could lead to injury. Be careful, and let someone know if you’re feeling unwell. Also, avoid taking any medications that can thin your blood further, such as ibuprofen, until we have the results back. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything. No ibuprofen…understood. And be careful…well, I’ll try. It’s just…difficult, being an old man. But I’ll be careful. I appreciate you taking this seriously. Frankly, I was starting to worry I was just being overly sensitive. But you've put my mind at ease, a little. Just…let me know as soon as you have the results, will you? I'd like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. I don't want this lingering. And thank you, Doctor. Truly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Farson. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your worries. And you're not being overly sensitive at all. It's always best to investigate unexplained symptoms, and I’m here to help. I’ll let you know as soon as the results are back. We'll go over them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual bleeding, severe pain, dizziness, or weakness, please go to the emergency room immediately. I'll have the nurse come in and provide you with instructions for post-blood work and a copy of the order. Do you have any further questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. Just…thank you again. You've been very…reassuring. I appreciate your time and attention. I'll wait for the results, and I'll be careful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Farson. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. .
