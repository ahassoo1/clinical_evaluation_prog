DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing to talk about, but a friend suggested I come in and ask about… well, a pill to help prevent HIV. She said it's a good idea to be careful, even if you're… you know… not currently very active. Is that something you can help with?
DOCTOR: I see. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis. Yes, that's certainly something we can discuss. It's prudent to be proactive about your health, regardless of current activity levels. Let’s start with some basics. Have you had any prior testing for HIV?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A few times, actually. Mostly when I was younger, and… when relationships didn’t work out. The last time was… let me think… probably about five years ago. Everything was clear then, as far as I know. I always went to the clinic downtown for those tests. Do you need the dates or anything specific from those results? I might have some paperwork somewhere, but it’ll take me a while to dig it up.
DOCTOR: Downtown, hm. Well, that’s… adequate. While I appreciate the offer, retrieving those records isn’t essential right now. We’ll need to perform a new test here, regardless, to establish a baseline. It’s standard procedure. Before we do that, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’m pretty healthy, actually, for my age. A little achy sometimes, you know, the usual getting-older stuff. But no diagnosed conditions. I have Medicare, so I get regular check-ups, and they haven’t mentioned anything serious. I try to walk every day, and I eat… well, I try to eat healthy, though I do have a sweet tooth. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: “Try” is… not a medical term, Ms. Trefren. But I understand. And yes, your diet can matter, particularly if we're considering long-term medication. We'll need to check your kidney function before starting PrEP, as some medications can affect that. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I take something for my blood pressure, just a small dose, the doctor prescribed it about a year ago. It's… Lisinopril, I think? And sometimes I take ibuprofen for the aches, when they're really bad. Nothing else regularly, though. I used to take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but I ran out a few months ago. Should I be telling you about everything, even the little things? I don’t want to forget anything important.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Trefren, everything is important. Lisinopril is… relevant. And occasional ibuprofen use is noted. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My mother was allergic to penicillin, but I don’t seem to have inherited that. I've had a few scrapes and bruises over the years, and the doctors always gave me something for the pain, and I was always fine. Honestly, I’m pretty lucky in that department. This whole thing is a bit strange, you know? I've never had to plan for something like this before. It just feels… different.
DOCTOR: "Lucky" is… an imprecise term, Ms. Trefren. It implies a lack of diligence. Now, let’s move on. Have you had any recent surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, nothing recent. The last time I was in the hospital… oh, goodness, let me think… it was probably when I broke my wrist, years ago. That was… maybe twenty years ago? It wasn’t a bad break, just a cast for a few weeks. And no surgeries ever. Just the usual check-ups and… a dentist visit last month. Is that enough information? I’m trying to be thorough, I promise. It’s just… a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, kidney problems, HIV, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My mother had heart problems, she died of a stroke when she was in her seventies. My father was healthy as a horse, lived until he was ninety. And… my brother has diabetes, type two, but that’s about it, really. No one on either side of the family has ever… you know… mentioned anything about HIV. It was just… not something people talked about back then. Does that help? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Finally, let’s address social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. It wasn’t doing me any good, and frankly, I didn’t really enjoy it that much. And no, absolutely no recreational drugs. I’ve never been interested in any of that. I'm a pretty straightforward person, doctor. I like my routine, and I prefer to keep things simple. Is there anything else I should be telling you? This is starting to feel like an interrogation.
DOCTOR: It's a thorough medical history, Ms. Trefren, not an interrogation. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, I need to inform you that PrEP requires regular blood tests to monitor your kidney function and screen for sexually transmitted infections. Are you prepared for that commitment?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I understand. Regular tests are fine. Whatever it takes. I just want to be safe, and if that means blood tests every few months, then so be it. I’m not afraid of a little needle. I’ve had plenty of those in my life. Let's just get it done, doctor. I have an appointment this afternoon, and I don't want to be late. Can we hurry things along a bit?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat. We’ll start with a basic physical exam – blood pressure, pulse, weight, and a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Then we'll take a blood sample. Please undress from the waist up and I will knock before returning.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, doctor. I’ll just… get changed. I hope this doesn't take too long. .
