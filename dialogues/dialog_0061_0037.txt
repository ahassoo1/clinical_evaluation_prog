DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Margret. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. I… I have been having trouble breathing. A whistling sound, when I breathe. Especially at night. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble breathing, and a whistling sound, especially at night. That does sound concerning, and we'll definitely figure out what's going on. To start, can you tell me a little more about this trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not always trouble. Sometimes I feel okay. But when I walk up the stairs, or if I try to carry something heavy… then I get short of breath. And the whistling… it is like a tea kettle, you know? Inside my chest. It has been getting worse for maybe one month now. I don’t know why.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it comes and goes, is worse with exertion like walking stairs or carrying things, and you describe it as a whistling sound, like a tea kettle, that's been worsening over the past month. That’s helpful. Do you notice anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Let me see… When I sit very still, it gets better. And if I use my special breathing… the kind my mother taught me when I was a little girl in Bhutan… it helps a little. Slow, deep breaths. But it does not make it go away completely, you understand? Just… a little bit easier.
DOCTOR: I do understand. So resting and a specific breathing technique you learned from your mother help to a degree. That's good to know. Now, besides the breathing trouble and the whistling, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, sometimes I feel very tired. More tired than usual, even after sleeping. And… oh! My chest feels tight. Not always, but sometimes it feels like someone is squeezing it. And… I have been coughing a little bit. Not a bad cough, but it is there. Especially in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've noticed fatigue, chest tightness, and a cough, especially in the mornings. That gives me a bit more to work with. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, COPD, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been very healthy my whole life, I think. I did have a bad fall last year, broke my wrist, but that is all. No other sicknesses. My mother always said fresh air and exercise are the best medicine. I worked hard as an athletic trainer, always running and helping others. I don’t understand why this is happening now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no prior medical diagnoses besides the broken wrist last year. That’s good information. And you’ve been generally healthy, very active. Did you have any surgeries related to the broken wrist?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. They had to put in a metal… a plate, I think they called it. To fix the bone. It was a long time ago, and it healed very well. The doctor said it was a good job. It does not bother me anymore. Not usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you had a surgery to repair the broken wrist with a plate being inserted. It healed well and doesn’t usually cause you trouble. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My mother had a weak heart, I think. She was very old when she passed away. And my brother… he had problems with his lungs. He smoked many cigarettes, you know? But no one else… I don’t think so. My family is small, and we did not talk much about sickness. It was not polite.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems in your mother and lung issues in your brother, linked to smoking. That's helpful to know. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None. I can eat anything. And I have never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I am very careful what I put in my body. My mother taught me that too. Everything in moderation.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. And finally, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Just this. For my arthritis. It is not a strong medicine, just something for the pain in my hands. I only take it when I really need to, maybe two or three times a week. It is called… let me see… Ibuprofen. That is the name, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Good to know. Now, Margret, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… please be gentle. My chest feels a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Okay, if you could please take a deep breath in through your mouth, and then slowly exhale… Wonderful. Now, another deep breath… and out. I'm hearing some wheezing in your lungs, especially when you exhale. That explains some of the whistling sound you described. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 88. That’s a little elevated, but not overly concerning. I also notice some mild swelling in your hands, which is likely related to the arthritis you mentioned. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m hearing now, it sounds like you might be experiencing some symptoms of asthma, potentially triggered by something. Or, it could be something else causing similar symptoms. To be sure, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a simple blood test to check for any inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Asthma? Oh dear. I have never had asthma before. But… if that is what it is, then I want to know. A chest X-ray and a blood test… yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Will the X-ray be… painful? And the blood test… I do not like needles.
DOCTOR: No, the chest X-ray isn’t painful at all. You’ll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture. And the blood test… I understand you don’t like needles. It will be a quick pinch, and we'll be as gentle as possible. I'll let the phlebotomist know you're a bit anxious, and they're very good at making people comfortable. We’ll get those tests ordered right away. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler. It will help to open up your airways and relieve some of the wheezing. It's a common medication, and many people find it very helpful. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A bronchodilator… an inhaler? Yes, that sounds… good. If it will help me breathe easier, then yes. What does it look like? And how do I use it? I want to make sure I do it correctly. And… will it interact with my arthritis medicine? I always worry about mixing things.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it's important to be cautious. This is what the inhaler looks like. It's a small plastic device. You shake it well, then you put it in your mouth, take a deep breath, and press down on the canister to release the medication. It’s very important to exhale completely before you inhale. We'll have the nurse demonstrate it to you before you leave, and you can practice with her. And yes, the bronchodilator is safe to use with Ibuprofen. There are no known interactions between the two medications. Okay, I've sent the prescription to your pharmacy. It should be ready within the hour. I’ll also schedule you for a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results of the X-ray and blood test and see how you’re responding to the inhaler. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: One week… yes, that is fine. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. And the nurse will show me how to use the inhaler… that is good. I am still a little worried, but I feel… better knowing what is going on. Will the X-ray tell us if it is asthma for sure? And what if it is something else?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Margret. I'm glad I could ease your worries a bit. The chest X-ray will help us rule out other potential causes of your symptoms, like pneumonia or heart problems. It won't definitely diagnose asthma, as asthma is diagnosed primarily based on how you respond to treatment – like the inhaler. However, it can give us valuable information. If the X-ray shows something else, we’ll discuss the findings and may need to order further tests or refer you to a specialist. We’ll take things one step at a time and figure out what's going on. For now, focus on using the inhaler as directed and let me know if you experience any side effects. And remember, if your breathing suddenly gets worse, or you feel any chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have answered everything. Thank you for being so patient with an old woman. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I will try the inhaler and see how it goes. I will remember to go to the emergency room if I feel worse. Thank you again, Doctor Kimm. Bula vinaka.
