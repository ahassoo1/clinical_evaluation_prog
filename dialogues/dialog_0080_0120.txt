DOCTOR: Hi Carmaleta, welcome! I’m Dr. Rosanova. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get right to it. I want to… have a baby. And I want it to be easy. My husband… well, he passed, and I don’t want any trouble getting pregnant now. I’m not getting any younger, you know. Is that… possible?
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. It’s completely reasonable to want to get straight to the point, and I assure you, we’ll do everything we can to make this process as smooth as possible. And yes, it is absolutely possible. It’s wonderful you’re considering this. Let me pull up your chart quickly… Okay, I see you're 43 years old. And I understand you’ve lost your husband recently – I’m very sorry for your loss. To get a better understanding of what options might be best for you, and to ensure everything goes smoothly, I’ll need to ask a few questions. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, questions. Fine, whatever. Just… not too many, please. And don't make me explain things repeatedly. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand. I have excellent recall, so you won’t need to repeat yourself. We’ll start with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Honestly? I… vaguely remember a tonsillectomy when I was little. And… something with my appendix, maybe? It was a long time ago. And I had the usual childhood things, you know, chickenpox, measles… I don’t really keep track of all that. Is it really important?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and possible appendectomy, childhood illnesses... good to know. It is helpful to have that information, just to be thorough. Now, do you have any current medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’m generally healthy, I think. I eat okay, mostly. And I don't go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. Honestly, doctors always make a fuss over nothing. I just want a baby, not a lecture on kale.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I promise no lectures on kale! We’ll focus on what you need. Do you take any medications regularly – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. And… occasionally something for my sinuses when the weather changes. It’s nothing fancy, just whatever they sell at the drugstore. Really, I’m very low maintenance.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, occasional sinus medication… good. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. I think I was itchy once after eating shrimp, but it could have been anything. And… I don’t like penicillin, if that counts. It tastes awful. But I don’t think I’m allergic allergic.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible reaction to shrimp, and aversion to penicillin. We’ll make a note of that. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Honestly, it’s a mess. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. And my aunt had cancer, but that was a long time ago. Everyone on both sides has something, if that makes sense. It’s not like anyone lives to be 100, you know? And frankly, I didn't pay much attention to their doctors' visits.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s quite common, and it’s not your responsibility to remember everything. Okay. And lastly, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you want to know? I work. I eat. I sleep. It’s not very exciting. I don’t smoke, if that’s what you’re asking. And I have a glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. That’s helpful information. Do you have any regular physical activity, like exercise or walking?
PATIENT: Exercise? Not really. I walk around at work, sometimes. And I used to go dancing, but… well, that was with my husband. I haven't really felt like it since. It's… pointless now, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s perfectly alright. Okay, Carmaleta. Thank you for that information. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a general sense of your overall health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, get it over with. Just… don’t poke around too much. And be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. If you could change into this gown, that would be great. I’ll start with your blood pressure and weight. Alright, your blood pressure is 128/76, which is good. Your weight is 130 pounds, and your height is 164 centimeters. That puts your BMI at 24.2, which is in the healthy range. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Ears and throat look normal. Everything seems to be within normal limits so far. Now, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your hormone levels, thyroid function, and general health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ugh, more poking. Fine. If it gets me a baby, I’ll do it. Just… tell me where to go, and how long it’ll take. I don’t have all day. And I hope they don’t make me drink that awful sugary stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm printing out the lab requisition now. It’s just a standard blood draw. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes at the lab. And no, it doesn’t require the sugary drink – just a few vials of blood. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They're expecting you. Once you have the results, they’ll automatically send them to me. It usually takes a few days. Then, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… don't make me wait weeks to hear back. I'm not getting any younger, you know. And tell me exactly what I need to do if… if something’s wrong. I don’t want vague answers.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your concerns, and I will make sure you don't have to wait unnecessarily. I'll personally review the results as soon as they come in, and my nurse will contact you within 48 hours to schedule a follow-up. If the results show any concerning issues, we’ll discuss them thoroughly, and I’ll refer you to the appropriate specialist if needed. If it's something serious, we'll discuss all the options and create a plan together. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here’s my card, with the clinic’s number. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Carmaleta?
PATIENT: No. I think that's everything. Just… get me a baby. That’s all I want. And please, don’t waste my time.
DOCTOR: I understand, and I assure you, I will do my very best to help you achieve that goal. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll keep you informed every step of the way. Thank you for coming in today, Carmaleta. I wish you all the best.
