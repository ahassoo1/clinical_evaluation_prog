DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. I… need check for… referee. For fitness. They want me to get checked. I do sports… repair work. Not playing, but… need to be okay to watch games, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You need a physical exam to make sure you're cleared for… observing sports activities, and your work related to them. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yes. Exactly. Not… strong work. More… watching. Making sure things safe. They want paper. From doctor. About my… heart, I think? And… breathing? I forget. Just need paper. Fast.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it sounds like they're requesting a general fitness evaluation, with a focus on your cardiovascular and respiratory health. We can definitely do that. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: History? Um… I… my wife… she… passed away. Two years ago. Before that… mostly okay. No big problems. I had… flu, sometimes. Usual things. Nothing… serious. I don’t… remember much else. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Shanor. That must have been incredibly difficult. And it's perfectly okay that you don't remember everything. We'll take things slowly. Just to clarify, when you say “mostly okay,” have you had any ongoing medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. No high… pressure. No sugar… problem. And… heart… no. Doctor always said… strong heart. Before… you know. Just… regular check-ups. Nothing wrong. I think. Is this… important? Can we just… do the test? I have work.
DOCTOR: It is important to get a good understanding of your history, even if it seems straightforward, to make sure we're doing the right tests and interpreting them correctly. But I understand you're pressed for time. Let's do this quickly. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgery. No… hospital. Just… cold. Maybe once. When I was little. Nothing… big. Just… rest. Drink tea. That’s all. Can we… check my heart now? I need to go back to work. Games start soon.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. And you’ve had the usual colds. Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I… eat everything. No… problem. Sometimes… dust. Makes me… sneeze. But not… allergy. Just… dust. Is that… enough? Can we… start? I’m okay. Just want to make sure I’m good to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're just wanting to confirm you're healthy enough to observe sports activities. Let's move on to a quick physical exam then. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Sounds… fast enough. You… check quickly? I have… things to do. Games… you know. Okay. Just… hurry. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Shanor. Your blood pressure is 128/78, which is good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Ears, nose, and throat look normal. I’m not detecting anything concerning right now. Do you have any current medications you're taking?
PATIENT: No. No medicine. Never take… anything. Just… tea. When I’m cold. That’s all. No pills. No… shots. Nothing. Just… strong heart. I think. Is that… good enough? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. That’s good to know. To be thorough, and since this is for a fitness evaluation, I’d like to check your pulse and oxygen saturation. It’s a quick non-invasive test. And then I'll write up a note for you. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Quick? Very quick? Pulse… is that… finger thing? Okay. If… very quick. I need to… tell people. About games. Okay. Just… fast. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, your pulse is 72 and your oxygen saturation is 98%, which are both excellent. Everything looks good. I'm going to write a brief note stating that you’ve had a physical examination today, and your cardiovascular and respiratory systems appear healthy. I'll also note your blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturation levels. Just one moment. Okay, here you go. This note says you are cleared for light activity and observation duties. It also advises you to seek medical attention if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Thank you, Doctor. Very fast. Very good. I… need to go now. Games… waiting. Thank you. Goodbye.
