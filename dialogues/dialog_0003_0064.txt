DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I am Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Yackey. It’s my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It feels like… a tight squeezing, mostly.
DOCTOR: Right. Chest pain. A rather… nonspecific complaint, I must say. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Maybe… two weeks now? It started slow, just a little uncomfortable after I walked up the hill to the store. But yesterday, it was… worse. Even when I was sitting. It scared my husband. He made me come right away.
DOCTOR: Very well. And can you describe the pain in more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, like I said, squeezing. Like someone is… hugging my chest too tight. And it goes up into my shoulder, a little bit, on this side. <points to left shoulder> Not a sharp pain, not really. Just… heavy and uncomfortable. It doesn’t go away completely, even when I rest, but it’s better. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate. And does anything specifically bring it on, besides exertion, as you’ve mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Cold air, maybe? Yesterday morning was chilly, and it felt worse then. And… when I get upset. My grandson, he… he had a little trouble at school, and I was talking to my daughter on the phone about it, and it started up then too. It's strange. It’s not like a regular pain, you know? It feels… connected to how I feel, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Connected to how you feel… Yes, I understand. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my blood pressure… it gets a little high sometimes. The doctor put me on a little pill for it, a long time ago. And I had… gallbladder trouble, years and years ago. They took it out. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat good, you know? And I walk when I can. I have Medicare, so I see the doctor regular, but nothing big ever happened.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just the one for the blood pressure. It’s a little white pill. I take it every morning with my coffee. I can’t remember the name, though! My husband brings it for me, and I just take it. He knows everything, that one. <chuckles softly> I don’t bother with names, too much trouble to remember.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My mother always said I had a cast iron stomach! I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Sometimes I get a little itchy in the spring, with the flowers, but that's all. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, regarding your family history… are there any instances of heart disease, stroke, or other significant medical problems in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. My father… he had a bad heart. He was a smoker, you see, and he had a lot of trouble with it when he got older. He had… they called it angina, I think? He had to take pills, like me. And my mother… she had diabetes, when she got older too. That’s about it, I think. My siblings are pretty healthy, as far as I know. They don’t tell me much, those two. <shrugs>
DOCTOR: Right. Now, I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your chest. <pauses> Please remove your blouse, and I'll provide a gown.
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, dear. That sounds… thorough. <looks around nervously> Are you sure you need to hear my lungs? I haven’t been coughing or anything. And… I don’t really like taking my blouse off. Is there any way you can just listen to my heart, maybe? I get cold easily, you know. It’s not very warm in here.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, a thorough examination is necessary to properly assess your condition. Listening to your lungs is a standard part of evaluating chest pain. It’s a non-invasive procedure and will provide me with valuable information. I assure you, it's a routine part of the process. Please, if you would. We must rule out potential causes. If you'd prefer, I can provide an additional blanket. But please understand, I need to perform a complete assessment.
PATIENT: Oh… well, alright. If you need to. But please be quick, Doctor. And… maybe the blanket would be nice. It is a little chilly. <begins slowly unbuttoning her blouse, looking embarrassed> My husband always says I worry too much. But it just feels… strange, you know? Having a stranger listen to my chest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me... and exhale slowly. Another one... good. Now I’m going to listen to your back. Please turn over… slightly uncomfortable, I imagine. <listens intently for a brief period> Your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90. Slightly elevated, but not concerning given your recent stress. Heart rate is regular. <palpates chest wall> Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It just feels… tight. Like a band around my chest. <winces slightly> When you press there… it feels a little worse, maybe? But it’s not a sharp pain. It's just… uncomfortable. It feels like this has been going on forever. Is something wrong, Doctor? I’m getting worried now. My father… he had a lot of trouble, you know. <voice trembles slightly>
DOCTOR: It’s…possible your discomfort is musculoskeletal in origin. However, given your family history and the nature of your symptoms, we cannot rule out cardiac involvement. I'm going to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart’s electrical activity. And a chest X-ray to visualize your lungs and heart structure. We need to have definitive data. <pauses> The nurse will be in shortly to take you to the radiology department. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. An X-ray? And… a what-did-you-call-it? Sounds… serious. Is it going to hurt? And… will I be exposed to something bad? I’ve heard things about those machines. My daughter… she works with them, at the hospital, and she says you have to be careful. <fidgets with the paper gown> Is this because of my heart? Am I having a heart attack? I feel a little dizzy all of a sudden.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, please. It is standard procedure to order these tests when evaluating chest pain. The EKG is completely painless, and the chest X-ray involves minimal radiation exposure – far less than a transcontinental flight. We are simply gathering information to ensure accurate diagnosis. And no, you are not necessarily having a heart attack. However, we must rule it out. <pauses, types rapidly> The nurse will explain the procedure. I'll review the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, try to remain calm. Stress will only exacerbate your symptoms. <pauses, avoids eye contact> Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I guess not. Just… please be quick. And tell my daughter I said hello, would you? She works in radiology, you know. Maybe you’ll see her. And… could I have another blanket? I’m still cold. <huddles slightly> It’s just… I don’t like hospitals. They always make me nervous.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be with you momentarily, Ms. Chelberg. She will provide another blanket and escort you to radiology. I have documented your concerns. <types furiously> Please, if your symptoms worsen while you wait, inform the nurse immediately. .
