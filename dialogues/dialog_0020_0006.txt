DOCTOR: Good morning, Jeannemarie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um... I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me a little, so I thought I should come see someone. It’s not a lot of blood, but... enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is definitely something we should investigate. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It started... maybe three days ago? At first, it was just a tiny bit, like streaks in the mucus. But yesterday, it was a little more. Not a lot, but... noticeable. It happens mostly in the morning, when I first wake up. I don’t think it’s from a nosebleed, because… it doesn’t feel like it comes from my nose. And it doesn't hurt, really. Just… surprising.
DOCTOR: Okay, three days ago, starting with streaks and progressing to a noticeable amount, primarily in the morning… and no associated pain. That's helpful. Do you have any other symptoms along with the coughing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been a little tired, maybe more tired than usual. But I thought that was just because of the heat. And… I think I have a little bit of a cough even when I’m not coughing up the blood. It’s not a bad cough, just… a tickle in my throat. Oh, and I might have a slight fever, but I haven’t taken my temperature to be sure. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A little more tired than usual, a tickle in your throat, and possibly a slight fever. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger the coughing, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That is a good question. I… I don’t think so. It just seems to happen. I haven’t been doing anything different, really. I do a lot of walking, for exercise. And I garden a little bit. But I haven't been lifting anything heavy or anything like that. I haven’t been around anyone who is sick, that I know of. Maybe… when the air is dry it feels a little worse, but I can’t be certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no clear triggers, potentially a little worse in dry air. Now, let's go over some other things. Do you have any past medical problems – any conditions you've been diagnosed with or treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Yes. Um… I had pneumonia when I was younger, maybe ten years ago. I was in the hospital for a few days. And I have… high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. I take a pill every morning. Other than that… I don’t think so. I’ve been generally healthy, until this. Oh! And I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia ten years ago, controlled high blood pressure, and gallbladder removal fifteen years ago. Yes, that’s all important information, thank you. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. I’ve taken a lot of different medications over the years, for small things, and nothing has ever bothered me. My husband… my late husband… he had a shellfish allergy, but I do not. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. No known allergies. And what medications are you currently taking, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure. It’s called… Lisinopril, I think? It’s a small white pill. I take ten milligrams every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes… just sometimes… I take a pain reliever for a headache, but that’s very rare. Usually just ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril ten milligrams daily, and ibuprofen as needed for headaches. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I’m ready whenever you are. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a little gardening I’d like to get back to, but this is more important, of course.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you’ll just have a seat here, and I’ll get started. It shouldn’t take long. Take a deep breath in... and out... good. Okay, and again... Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the lower right side, but not significantly. I'll listen to your heart now. Regular rhythm, no murmurs detected. Now, let’s check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen level is 96%, which is good. Your temperature is 98.9 Fahrenheit, so that slight fever you mentioned isn’t showing up right now. I'm going to palpate your lymph nodes now. No swelling detected.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. It didn’t feel too bad. So, what do you think? Is it something serious? My husband… he always worried when I coughed. He passed away three years ago, you see. It’s just… I don’t want to be sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jeannemarie, and I'm sorry to hear about your husband. It's natural to worry, especially given your history. The diminished breathing sound on the lower right side is what I'm focusing on right now. It could be several things, and it's too early to say definitively without some further investigation. Given the blood you’ve been coughing up, even a small amount, and the slightly diminished breathing, I think we need to get a chest X-ray to see what’s going on in your lungs. It will help us rule out things like pneumonia, bronchitis, or something more serious. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. An X-ray sounds good. If it will help figure out what’s wrong, then yes, please. I just want to know what I’m dealing with. Will it be… painful? And will it take long? I have a volunteer shift at the garden center on Thursday. I don’t want to miss that, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: No, an X-ray isn't painful at all. You'll just stand or sit while a technician takes a picture of your chest. It should only take a few minutes. We can get you scheduled for one today, if that works for you. As for missing your volunteer shift, let’s see what the X-ray shows first. Hopefully, it's something minor, and you won't have to miss it. We'll have the results back within a few hours, and then we can discuss them and decide on a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Thank you. Today would be perfect, if possible. And I appreciate you trying to make sure I don’t miss my shift. It means a lot. Just… knowing we’re trying to figure it out is a relief. So, where do I go for the X-ray?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. The radiology department is just down the hall, room 203. The technician will need this slip from me. They’re expecting you. After the X-ray, they’ll send the results directly to me. I’ll review them as soon as I receive them and call you with the findings. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as increased bleeding, fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that, or about anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That is very clear, thank you, Doctor. Room 203, and call you if anything gets worse. I think I can remember that. You’ve been very kind and helpful, Doctor Beinborn. I feel much better just knowing what’s happening. Thank you again. I think… I think I will go do the X-ray now.
