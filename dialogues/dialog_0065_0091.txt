DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ziccarelli. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, lately...I does be feelin' really thirsty, all the time. And hungry, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just…not normal, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Thirst and increased hunger, even after eating. How long has this been going on, Ms. Ziccarelli?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. I think it start maybe... a month or so ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little more water than usual. But now…now I really does have to drink a lot. And I eat, and then I feel hungry again quick-quick. It worryin' me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: A month. And has anything else changed besides the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Well…now that you ask…I does be goin’ to the bathroom more often. To pee, you know? Especially at night. I have to get up, sometimes two, three times! My husband sayin’ I keep him awake. It not nice. I also feelin' a little tired, but I does work hard, so I thought that was just from the work. I pump water all day, Doctor, it’s a heavy job.
DOCTOR: Increased urination, especially at night, and some fatigue… Okay. And when you urinate, is there any pain or burning sensation?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burnin'. Just…more of it. It doesn’t hurt, it just…comes more often, that’s all. Like a tap left runnin', you know? A little bit at a time, but more times in the day. And at night, it really botherin' me. I used to sleep right through, now I wake up all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me what a typical day of eating looks like for you, Ms. Ziccarelli?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat good. For breakfast, I does have some porridge, maybe with a little fruit. Lunch is usually a big plate of rice and beans with some chicken or fish, depending on what my husband catch. And for dinner…same kinda thing, rice and beans with some meat. I does like a little dumpling too, if he make it. I drink a lot of water with my meals, and in between too, cause of the thirst, you know? I does try to eat healthy, but I does have a sweet tooth sometimes...a little biscuit with my tea.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any medical problems that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I does have a little trouble with my pressure sometimes, the doctor tell me it goes up and down. But I don't take no pills for it, he say I just have to watch what I eat. Apart from that…nothing much. I used to have bad headaches when I was younger, but they gone now. No serious sicknesses, thank God.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries, Ms. Ziccarelli?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had no surgery. Everything natural. My mother always say I was strong like a mule! No need for cuttin' and stitchin', she used to say. I always took good care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm…my mother, she had the pressure too, same as me. And my grandfather, he had something with his sugar, my auntie tell me. She say he was always tired and drinkin' a lot of water. I don’t know what she call it, some kind of sickness with the sugar in the blood. He didn’t live long, my grandfather. And my father…he was always healthy, strong as an ox. No sicknesses in his family, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: And just to be thorough, Ms. Ziccarelli, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have no allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I could eat anything, and never have no problem. My husband always tease me, sayin’ I have a cast iron stomach! I does get bitten by mosquito plenty though, but that ain’t an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Ziccarelli, mosquito bites are not an allergy. Good. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take no pills at all. I don't like takin’ medication if I could help it. I prefer to drink a little bush tea if I feelin’ sick, or just rest. My husband sometimes give me a little vitamin C, when I get a cold, but that's all. I does try to stay natural, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ziccarelli. Thank you for that detailed information. Based on what you've told me—the increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and family history—I’m concerned about the possibility of diabetes. To confirm this, we need to do some tests. I’d like to order a blood sugar test, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urine analysis. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear. My grandfather…that’s what he had, wasn’t it? I feel a little worried now. If you think it’s best, Doctor, yes, I would like to do the tests. Whatever you think is best to find out what’s happenin’ with me. I just want to feel normal again, you know? And not have to keep runnin’ to the bathroom all the time!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Ziccarelli. It's good we're getting this checked out. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood, and we'll collect a urine sample as well. We can do that right here in the office. While we wait for the results, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. My blood pressure been a little funny lately, so you should check that good and proper. And if you could just tell me what’s happenin’ with me, as simple as you can, I would really appreciate it. I don’t understand all the fancy doctor talk. Just tell me what it is, and what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ziccarelli. I will explain everything in plain language, I promise. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat on the exam table. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That’s a little elevated, which is consistent with what you’ve been experiencing. Your heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are intact, and sensation is normal. I’m not detecting any other obvious abnormalities. Now, we'll wait for the lab results. It will take about 15-20 minutes. Once we have those, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I’d advise you to continue drinking plenty of water, but try not to overdo it until we know more. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. Water is no problem for me, I does drink plenty anyway! But not too much, until you tell me what’s happenin’. I just hope it ain’t nothin’ too serious. My husband would be so worried. Thank you, Doctor, for takin’ care of me. I’ll just sit here and wait for the results then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Ziccarelli. We'll get to the bottom of this. I will be right here as soon as the results come in. Please just relax, and let me know if you need anything at all.
