DOCTOR: Hi Louine, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about time someone got around to seeing me. It's my foot. It's been bothering me for… oh, must be close to three months now. A sore, really. A nasty one. And it won't heal. I've tried everything, or what I think is everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months of a sore on your foot that isn’t healing. I understand that’s frustrating. Let's try to figure out what's going on. Could you tell me a little more about the sore itself?
PATIENT: Oh, don't tell me what's frustrating. It’s frustrating having to come here. But, alright. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my heel. It started small, just a little red spot, I thought it was a blister from my shoes. But it got bigger. Now it's… well, it's open. And it’s deep. Not bleeding constantly, but it looks awful. And it hurts when I walk. Especially first thing in the morning. Honestly, it feels like walking on a stone sometimes. I keep it covered, naturally. Don’t want everyone staring.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's on the bottom of your foot near your heel, started small like a blister, got bigger and is now an open sore that’s painful with walking, especially in the morning. You're keeping it covered, which is good. When you say “deep,” can you give me an estimate of how deep?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How deep... Honestly? Deeper than it should be. It’s not just a surface scrape. You could fit… oh, I don't know... a pencil eraser in it, maybe? Perhaps a little bigger. I haven’t measured it, you know. I’m not a nurse. It’s definitely gone past the skin. And there’s… some discoloration around it. A bit red, a bit… grayish? It's not a pretty sight, I assure you. My grandson tried to look at it last week, said it looked “infected” but what does he know? He's always on that computer.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s deep enough to fit a pencil eraser in it, and you've noticed some redness and grayish discoloration around the sore. Your grandson mentioned it looking infected. That’s good he’s observant, and we’ll definitely take that into consideration. Now, have you noticed any drainage coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Well… yes. Sometimes. Not a lot, mind you. It's not gushing. It’s more of a… a dampness, really. A bit yellowish. And sometimes, when I change the bandage, there's a little bit of… white stuff. Like cream cheese, only… not as pleasant. I always clean it very carefully, of course. I don't want it getting worse. It smells a bit, too. Not terribly, but you can tell something isn't right. My late husband always said I had a good nose. He could smell a burnt toast from a mile away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re noticing yellowish drainage and some white, cream cheese-like discharge, and a slight odor. You're cleaning it carefully, which is good. Let’s talk about your overall health a bit. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or problems with circulation?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, yes. Type 2. Been managing it for… well, too long to remember exactly. Decades, certainly. I take my pills, usually. Sometimes I forget, I'm getting older, you know. And my doctor – the one before this one, back in town – he said something about my circulation not being the best. Something about the blood not getting where it needs to go. He gave me a lecture about walking more, as if I wasn’t already trying! Honestly, doctors these days… always telling you what you should be doing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have Type 2 diabetes that you manage with medication, and you’ve been told you have some circulation issues. That’s important information, as both of those things can affect wound healing. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I've taken all sorts of things over the years. Penicillin, I think, when I was a girl. Didn't react to it, as far as I can recall. But that was… oh, goodness, seventy years ago! I don’t remember much from then. And I've had all the shots they offered, back in the day. I keep up with things, mostly. I have a very good memory, you know. Except for names, of course. Can never remember names these days. Though I do remember every doctor I’ve ever seen and exactly what they told me. It’s a curse, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known medication allergies, although you may have had penicillin as a child with no reaction. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Could you tell me what medications you're taking regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's… complicated. Let me see. There’s the one for the diabetes. Met… something. Starts with an ‘M’. And there’s a little white pill for my blood pressure. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take Ibuprofen. But not every day, only when I need it. And… oh, yes! A vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. Honestly, I just take whatever they tell me to take. I have a bag full of pills. It’s quite the collection, really. I'll have to get my grandson to help me sort it out sometime. He’s good with computers, perhaps he can make a list.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re taking medication for diabetes , a little white pill for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and a Vitamin D supplement. Let’s take a look at your foot now. Would you mind if I examine it?
PATIENT: Go ahead. But be gentle. It’s quite sensitive, you know. And please, don’t make a face. I can tell when people are disgusted, and I don’t appreciate it. I’ve seen better days, but it’s still my foot.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see the sore on your heel. It's approximately 2 centimeters in diameter, and it does appear to be deep, as you described. There's some surrounding redness, and I note some grayish discoloration. I also see some drainage present. There's some warmth to the area, and it is tender to the touch. I don't feel any palpable lymph nodes in your lower leg or ankle at this time. Based on what you've told me and my examination, this wound is concerning. The depth, the discoloration, the drainage, and your history of diabetes and circulation issues all raise suspicion for a possible infection. We'll need to investigate further to confirm.
PATIENT: Infection? Oh, dear. That's what my grandson said. He’s not entirely useless, that boy. But what does that mean? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don’t want to go to the hospital. They’re always so busy, and the food is terrible. Is it serious? Don't tell me it's going to have to be… amputated. I’ve seen what happens to people with diabetes. Please tell me it's not that bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I want to assure you we're going to do everything we can to figure this out and get you the best possible care. Let's not jump to conclusions about amputation just yet. That's a very rare outcome, and we're far from that point. However, an infection, especially with diabetes, needs to be taken seriously. It can lead to complications if left untreated. To determine the extent of the infection, we'll need to do some testing. I'd like to order a wound culture to identify any bacteria present, and a blood test to check for signs of infection in your body. We may also consider an X-ray to rule out any bone infection. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials that I should be aware of before we proceed with the testing?
PATIENT: Latex? Hmm… I don't think so. I used to wear rubber gloves when I did the dishes, and I never had a reaction. But that was ages ago. Maybe I'm sensitive to something else? I do have rather sensitive skin, you know. It gets easily irritated. And… now that you mention it, sometimes my hands get a bit itchy after washing them with certain soaps. But it's probably just the soap. I don’t want to make a fuss. Just… be careful, alright? And don’t use anything too strong. I have a very delicate constitution, you know. And please, tell me what you're doing before you do it. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll definitely take your sensitive skin into consideration. We’ll use latex-free gloves and gentle techniques. And I will absolutely explain everything before I do it. No surprises, I promise. First, I’m going to gently clean the wound with a mild saline solution. Then, I’ll use a sterile swab to collect a sample of the drainage for the wound culture. This will tell us what type of bacteria, if any, are present. Finally, I’ll draw a small sample of blood for the blood tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. As long as you explain everything beforehand, and you're gentle. And don’t poke too much. It does hurt, you know. And please, try not to make a mess. I don’t like things being messy. Is it going to take long? I have a bridge game this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want to be late. Agnes gets very cross when I’m not on time. She's a stickler for punctuality. Honestly, some people...
DOCTOR: It won’t take long, Louine. The blood draw and wound culture should only take about 10-15 minutes total. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll get the results back in a few days, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, it’s important to keep the wound clean and covered. I'm going to give you a special dressing to use, and I'll give you instructions on how to change it. Please avoid putting any creams or ointments on the wound unless I specifically tell you to. Do you have anyone who can help you with the dressing changes at home?
PATIENT: A dressing? Oh. Well… my grandson, sometimes. But he’s always on that computer. He’s a good boy, really, but he’s easily distracted. And Agnes helps out occasionally, but she’s very particular about how things are done. She likes everything just so. Honestly, sometimes it’s easier to do it myself. But it’s getting harder, you know, bending over and reaching my foot. That’s why I'm here, isn't it? Is this dressing complicated? I don’t want to have to bother anyone. And I certainly don’t want to mess it up. I've always been very good at following instructions, though. As long as they're clear.
DOCTOR: The dressing isn’t complicated at all, Louine. It’s just a special type of bandage that helps keep the wound clean and promotes healing. I'll walk you through the steps carefully, and I'll give you a written handout with pictures. We can also schedule a visit with a home health nurse if you'd prefer. They can come to your home and help with the dressing changes, and they can also monitor your foot for any signs of infection. If your grandson is willing, he could also watch me demonstrate the dressing change, so he can help out if needed. Let’s focus on getting the wound culture and blood tests done first, and then we can discuss the best plan for you and your situation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A nurse? Oh, dear. I don't want a stranger poking around my foot. And I certainly don’t want to bother anyone. My grandson is… helpful, sometimes. Perhaps he could watch you demonstrate it. Yes, that would be best. As long as he’s not distracted by that computer, of course. Alright. Let’s get this over with then. But be quick, alright? And gentle. And explain everything beforehand. I hate surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take our time and go through everything step-by-step. I'll explain each step before I do it, and I'll make sure your grandson is paying attention. First, I'm going to clean the area around the wound with a mild saline solution. This will remove any dirt or debris. Then, I’ll use a sterile swab to collect the sample for the wound culture. It might feel a little bit uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Finally, I’ll draw a small sample of blood from your arm. Before I start, do you have a preferred arm that you'd like me to use for the blood draw?
PATIENT: Hmm… my left arm. Yes, my left arm is better. I think. It doesn’t bruise as easily, or something like that. I don’t really pay attention to those things. Just… be careful, alright? I don't like needles. And please, don't poke around too much. I’ve always been a bit squeamish.
DOCTOR: Alright, your left arm it is. I’ll use a small needle, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. I'll clean the area with an alcohol swab, and then I’ll quickly insert the needle and collect the sample. You might feel a brief pinch, but it will be over quickly. I’ll let you know when I’m inserting the needle, so you're not surprised. Before I start, can you make a fist with your left hand?
PATIENT: Alright. Just… hurry up, alright? This is making me nervous. And please, don't tell me horror stories about blood draws. I’ve heard enough of those in my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, almost done. You might feel a little coldness as the alcohol evaporates. Now, I'm going to quickly insert the needle. It will just feel like a brief pinch. There we go. All done. You can relax your hand now. And that's it. Just keep that bandage on for about 15-20 minutes to prevent any bleeding. Now, let's move on to the wound culture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright… that wasn’t too bad. A little pinch, but I've survived worse. Yes, let’s get this over with then. The wound culture. But be gentle, alright? And explain everything before you do it. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain each step before I do it, and I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to gently clean the wound with a saline solution. This will remove any dirt or debris that might be present. Then, I'll use a sterile swab to collect a sample from the wound. It might feel a little bit uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Okay, almost done with the cleaning. Now, I’m going to use this swab to collect a small sample from the wound. There we go. All done. And that's it. I've collected the sample for the wound culture. Just keep that bandage clean and dry, and change it once a day, or if it gets wet or dirty. We've now collected the samples we need. We’ll send them to the lab for analysis, and we should have the results back in a few days. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Alright… that wasn’t so bad either. A little poking, but I’ve survived worse. Honestly, you're very gentle. I’ve had doctors in the past who were much rougher. No, I don’t think so. Just… what happens next? How long will it take to get the results? And what if it is infected? Will I have to take antibiotics? I don’t want to take too many pills. They upset my stomach. And please, don’t tell me I have to go to the hospital.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, and I'm glad I could make the process as comfortable as possible. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. If the results confirm an infection, we'll likely prescribe antibiotics to help clear it up. We'll start with a mild antibiotic and see how you respond. If that doesn’t work, we can adjust the medication as needed. We’ll also discuss ways to manage any potential side effects, like upset stomach. And don't worry, we'll do everything we can to avoid a hospital stay. We can usually treat most infections with oral antibiotics at home. For now, it’s important to keep the wound clean and dry, and to monitor it for any signs of worsening infection, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, or pus. If you notice any of these symptoms, please contact me right away. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: Alright… that’s good to hear. No hospital stay. And you'll monitor it closely. That’s reassuring. Hmm… well, what about my bridge game? Can I still play? I wouldn’t want to miss it. Agnes would be furious. And is it okay to walk? I have to get to the bridge club, you know. It’s quite a walk. And… what should I tell my grandson? He’s always asking questions. He’ll want to know all the details. But I don’t want to worry him unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern! Regarding your bridge game, you can likely still play, but I would recommend limiting your walking as much as possible and avoiding any strenuous activity. It’s important to allow your foot to rest and heal. If you experience any increased pain or discomfort during the game, please stop and rest. As for walking, you can walk short distances, but avoid prolonged walking or standing. We'll discuss this in more detail at your follow-up appointment once we have the lab results. As for what to tell your grandson, you can simply tell him that you've seen the doctor and they’re running some tests to determine the cause of the sore on your foot. You can reassure him that you’re being taken care of and that you’ll let him know the results once you have them. You don’t need to go into too much detail, as that might worry him unnecessarily. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: Alright… that sounds reasonable. Limiting my walking and avoiding strenuous activity. And just tell my grandson that I’m getting tests. Hmm… well, I think that’s all for now. You’ve answered all my questions. You’re a very patient doctor, you know. And gentle. I appreciate that. Thank you for your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Louine. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if you experience any increased pain, redness, swelling, or pus, please contact me right away. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the lab results. In the meantime, take care of yourself and try to rest as much as possible. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day!
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. And thank you again for your patience. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. I'll see you soon.
