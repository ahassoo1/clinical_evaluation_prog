DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. Uh, it’s my ears, really. They’ve been ringing. It's been happening for a few weeks now, and it’s… well, annoying is an understatement. It's just there, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. That can certainly be disruptive. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, about three or four weeks now. It comes and goes, but lately it’s been pretty constant. It’s like… a high-pitched whine, mostly. Sometimes it’s just in my left ear, sometimes both. It doesn’t hurt, just… really bothersome. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. Constant is good to know. And it fluctuates between one ear and both… alright. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, to be honest. I work as a waiter, so it’s pretty loud in the restaurant most nights. Maybe that? But it sometimes happens when it’s quiet too, like at home. I used to listen to music pretty loud with headphones, but I stopped that a while back. I really don’t know. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of loud noise exposure, both occupationally and recreationally… that's useful information. And it’s not consistently linked to the noise now?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, it happens even when it's quiet. It’s just… random, I guess. It's making it hard to concentrate, you know? Especially at work. I keep asking people to repeat themselves. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any ear infections as a child or adult?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, I think so. When I was a kid, I had a few really bad ear infections. I remember being sick a lot. As an adult, not so much, maybe one or two, but nothing major. I don't really remember them being that bad, honestly. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It can. Previous infections can sometimes contribute to these types of issues. And just to be thorough, any history of head trauma or injuries?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No big bumps to the head or anything. I'm pretty clumsy, but haven't had a serious fall or anything. Just the usual scrapes and bruises. I was never much of a sporty person, so I haven't had any sports injuries either. Is this taking a long time? I have to get back to work later.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. We're making good progress. Just a few more questions. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a bit, but it’s been under control with medication for the last year or so. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I guess. And, uh, I’m divorced, if that matters. It’s been a few years now. It was stressful, but I’m okay. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Stress can certainly play a role in things. And good that your blood pressure is managed. Do you take any other medications besides the one for blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one. A small dose, thankfully. Nothing else. I try to stay healthy, eat reasonably well, you know? I don't want to be on a whole bunch of pills if I can avoid it. Is this all you need to know? I'm starting to worry about being late for my shift.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And I understand your concern about being late. Let's do a quick physical exam of your ears. It won't take long. I’ll need to look inside with an otoscope. Just lean forward a little.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just let me know if it's uncomfortable or anything. I don't like things poking around in my ears, to be honest. Hopefully it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, left ear looks clear. A little bit of cerumen – earwax – but nothing unusual. Right ear is also clear, similar amount of cerumen. Eardrums look intact. No signs of infection or fluid. Now, I’m going to listen to your hearing with a tuning fork. I’ll place it on your forehead and then behind your ear. Just tell me when you can’t hear it anymore.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I’ll try my best. My hearing isn’t the greatest, so don't be surprised if I can't hear it very well. I used to work in a really loud kitchen, so I think it’s gotten worse over the years. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weber test shows it lateralizes to the right ear, and the Rinne test is positive bilaterally, but slightly diminished on the left. That means the sound transmits better through bone than air on the left side. Based on the exam and your history, it sounds like you likely have tinnitus, possibly with a mild conductive hearing loss in the left ear. The tinnitus is the ringing, and the slight hearing loss could explain why it’s more noticeable at times. The positive Rinne and lateralization on the Weber suggest it's not a nerve issue.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s a lot of words. So, what does that mean? Is it serious? Will it go away? And what can I do about it? I really need to know if I can keep working. This job is important to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s break it down. Tinnitus itself isn’t usually a sign of a serious underlying condition, but it can be bothersome. The mild conductive hearing loss likely contributes to it. Conductive hearing loss means sound isn’t traveling efficiently to your inner ear, possibly due to some fluid or minor blockage. It’s not severe, which is good. Will it go away?
PATIENT: Okay, good to know it's not serious. That's a relief. But... what are my chances of it just going away? And what about the hearing loss? Should I be worried about that getting worse? And is there anything I can do to help it? I really appreciate you explaining it to me like that, Doctor. It’s less scary when I understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I’m glad I can help. As for it going away, it’s hard to say. Sometimes tinnitus resolves on its own, especially if it's related to temporary exposure to loud noise. However, given it’s been a few weeks and you’ve had some prior noise exposure, it’s more likely to be chronic. That doesn’t mean we can’t manage it. Regarding the hearing loss, it’s currently mild. However, continued exposure to loud noise could worsen it. That’s why protecting your hearing is important. Here’s what I recommend: first, avoid loud noises as much as possible. If you can’t, wear earplugs. Second, we can try some tinnitus retraining therapy, which is a way of retraining your brain to filter out the ringing. We can also consider a hearing aid for the left ear, which can mask the tinnitus and improve your hearing. I'm going to give you a referral to an audiologist for a full hearing test and to discuss these options in more detail. Would you like me to write that out for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be great. An audiologist… okay. I guess I’ll need to get that scheduled. I really don’t want to have to quit my job. So earplugs, and then see the audiologist. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like… any lifestyle changes? Or medications? I just want to make sure I’m doing everything I can. And how long does it usually take to see an audiologist? I really need to know if this is going to interfere with my work schedule. I have limited time off.
DOCTOR: Here's the referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, she’s excellent. As for lifestyle changes, reducing stress can help. Easier said than done, I know, but things like regular exercise, good sleep hygiene, and a healthy diet can all make a difference. Medication isn’t usually the first line of treatment for tinnitus, but if it’s severely impacting your sleep or causing anxiety, we can discuss options. As for the audiologist, appointments usually take about an hour. They'll do a comprehensive hearing test and discuss the results with you. They should be able to get you in within a week or two. I'm going to write a note on the referral to request an expedited appointment, given your concerns about your work schedule. For now, try to avoid loud noises, protect your ears when you can’t, and see the audiologist as soon as possible. I’m also going to document everything in your chart. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been really helpful and explained everything so clearly. I feel a lot better now, knowing what's going on and what I can do about it. I’ll schedule an appointment with the audiologist as soon as I get home. And I’ll definitely invest in some earplugs for work. Thanks again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. And remember to protect your hearing. Have a good day to you as well, and I hope you find some relief soon. .
