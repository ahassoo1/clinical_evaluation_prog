DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. My name is Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's…fine. Look, my mother…she had a lot of problems. Heart stuff, mostly. And her sister, my aunt, same thing. I'm just…I want to make sure I'm okay, you know? It's probably nothing, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's very sensible to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart problems. We'll definitely get to the bottom of things. So, to start, can you tell me a little more about what’s been concerning you specifically?
PATIENT: Concerning me? Well, I haven’t felt anything, exactly. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, nothing like that. It's just…a general anxiety, I suppose. I keep reading things online – you know, about preventative care – and it just makes me worry. My ex-wife always said I obsessed too much. Probably right. But still, I'd like to get some tests done, just to be sure. Is that…possible?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that's very reasonable. And it’s good you're thinking about preventative care. It's much better to address concerns early. It sounds like you're experiencing some anxiety related to your family history, and wanting reassurance through testing, which is perfectly valid. Before we discuss specific tests, let me get a more complete picture of your overall health. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: Uh…not really. I mean, I had one when I was in the military, ages ago. Before the divorce. And maybe one through my employer, a few years back. But nothing recent. I generally feel pretty good, honestly. I eat okay, try to walk when I can, and I definitely don’t smoke. I just…don’t like going to doctors. It always feels like a waste of time, if everything’s fine. Though, if you insist…
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. We want to make sure this visit is worthwhile for you. Okay, so military physical some time ago and one through your employer a few years back. Good to know. And you mentioned eating okay and walking—that’s a great start. To help me understand things better, could you tell me a little more about your family history on your mother’s side?
PATIENT: Fine. My mother…she was diagnosed with…something called atrial fibrillation. A lot of irregular heartbeat. Had to take pills for it. And her sister, my aunt, she had a heart attack. A pretty bad one. She's…still alive, but she's not doing well. Lots of complications. My grandfather, on that side, he died young. Something with his…cholesterol, I think? My grandmother lived to be old, though, so…there’s that. It just feels like a lot of heart problems, all on one side of the family. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A family history of atrial fibrillation, a heart attack, and early death potentially related to cholesterol is significant. We’ll definitely take that into consideration. Now, just to get a comprehensive picture, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or high cholesterol yourself?
PATIENT: No. Never. I mean, doctors always said I was perfectly healthy. A little skinny, maybe. But healthy. I haven’t really needed to see a doctor much, honestly. That’s why I’m…a bit skeptical about all this preventative stuff. Seems like everyone's trying to get you to take pills for something that might not even happen. But my sister keeps telling me I need to be more responsible. She's a nurse, so…she thinks she knows everything.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been fortunate to be healthy up until now, and it’s understandable to be skeptical when you’re feeling well. It’s good you have a sister who cares, though! Okay. Before we get to the tests, let’s quickly go over a few things. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Seriously. I can eat shellfish, take any kind of antibiotic, whatever. I’m pretty…robust, I guess you could say. I don’t even get mosquito bites. It’s annoying, actually, when everyone else is getting eaten alive and I'm just fine. But, no allergies. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And you're currently not taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: Correct. Absolutely nothing. I’ve always avoided them if I could. My ex-wife was the pill-popper. She had anxiety, you see. Needed something for everything. I, on the other hand, prefer to deal with things on my own. Though, I suppose that's what got me into trouble in the first place. But still, no pills. None. And I intend to keep it that way, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health status, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and weight. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. I have things to do, you know. This is already taking up half my day. But, yeah. Do your thing. Just…try to be quick about it. And don’t tell me I need to lose weight. I’m already a bit self-conscious about it. Though, I suppose it’s not your fault I have a fast metabolism. It's just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll keep it as brief as possible, and I assure you, I won't make any assumptions about your weight. If you could just step on the scale for me, please. Okay, 60 kilograms. And your height is listed as 181 centimeters, which is perfect. Now, could you please sit here on the exam table?
PATIENT: There. Happy? I feel ridiculous sitting here, like a child at the doctor's office. Honestly, I'm perfectly fine. I probably don't even need a check-up. My sister is just being overprotective. Though, I suppose it's better to humor her…and you. Just get it over with, okay? I have a…very important email I need to respond to. It’s about…a project. A very important project.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just relaxing, breathing normally. I’m listening to your heart now. And now I’m listening to your lungs. Take a deep breath in…and out…again… Your heart rate is 72 beats per minute, which is within the normal range. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 118 over 78, also within a healthy range. Your pulse is regular and strong. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Everything sounds and feels normal, which is good. However, given your family history, I do recommend a few tests, just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. If it gets you to stop poking and prodding me, sure. Tests. Go ahead. But I'm telling you, it’s a waste of time and money. But…do what you need to do. Just…keep it brief, okay? And don't tell me I need to change my diet. I already know what I’m doing. Honestly. It's just…convenient. Is that what you want to hear? I eat perfectly fine. For a skinny person.
DOCTOR: No, I'm not here to tell you what to do. We're simply gathering information to ensure your continued good health. I understand your concerns. I’d like to order an EKG to assess your heart's electrical activity, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a lipid panel to evaluate your cholesterol levels. We'll also do a complete blood count. These are standard tests, relatively quick and painless. Would you be comfortable with those?
PATIENT: Fine. All of them. Just…get it over with. Honestly, this is ridiculous. A complete waste of my time. But…if it makes you happy. And my sister happy. Yes. Do all the tests. Just…promise me you’ll tell me the results quickly. I don’t want to spend weeks worrying about it. And don’t give me a lecture about preventative care. I get it. I have a family history. It’s not like I haven’t heard it before. Now…where do we start? And how long will this take? I have that email…a very important email.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and I promise to expedite the results as much as possible. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes. I'll have the results sent to me within a few days. While we’re waiting for the lab results, let's talk about your lifestyle a bit more. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Seriously? You’re still asking these questions? No. Absolutely not. I told you, I don’t even get mosquito bites. Do you really think I’d be ruining my perfectly healthy body with…that stuff? No smoking. No alcohol. No drugs. Nothing. I’m perfectly clean. Honestly, I’m probably the healthiest person you’ve seen all day. It’s just…this family history thing. It's driving me crazy. So, can we please just skip the lifestyle questions and get this over with? I really need to respond to that email. It's about a project. A very important project. Is that what you want to hear? It’s vital to my career.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty and I completely understand your eagerness to get back to your important project. I apologize if I’m repeating questions that seem unnecessary. It’s simply standard protocol to gather a complete medical history. Since you mentioned this project is vital to your career, is it a particularly stressful endeavor?
PATIENT: Stressful? You have no idea. It’s…a lot of responsibility. A lot of pressure. And my boss…well, let’s just say he’s not the most understanding person. He expects perfection. Immediately. And if things don’t go according to plan…let’s just say it’s not a pleasant experience. It’s…consuming, actually. It takes up all my time. All my energy. And frankly, it’s exhausting. But I have to do it. It’s important. Very important. It's about my…future. Is that what you want to hear? It’s the only thing that matters right now. Seriously. The project. It’s everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly demanding. High levels of stress can certainly impact your health, even if you're otherwise healthy. We'll keep that in mind as we review your results. While you're waiting for the lab, I'd like to ask about your sleep. How many hours do you typically sleep each night?
PATIENT: Sleep? What is sleep? Honestly, I barely have time for it. Maybe five hours, if I’m lucky. Usually less. I’m always working. Always thinking about the project. Always worrying about deadlines. My brain just won’t shut off. It’s…exhausting. And then I wake up feeling tired. And the cycle just repeats itself. It’s…terrible. And then I have to drink coffee to stay awake. Which makes it even harder to sleep. It’s…a vicious cycle. Honestly, I’m surprised I’m still functioning. But I have to. The project…it requires it. Is that what you want to hear? I function on caffeine and sheer willpower. It’s not healthy, I know. But what else can I do?
DOCTOR: That does sound incredibly draining. Chronic sleep deprivation can have a significant impact on your health, both physically and mentally. It's good you're aware of it. Okay. It sounds like we have a clear picture of your overall health and lifestyle. Let's focus on getting these lab results back. I'll have the nurse draw your blood now. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Honestly, I just want to get this over with. Get the tests done, get the results, and get back to my project. That’s all I want. But…if the tests do show something…what then? What if I have…something serious? Will I have to…slow down? Will my boss understand? Will I lose my job? It's a very important job. Frankly, I don’t even want to think about it. Just…do the tests. And try to be quick about it, okay? And don't tell me to relax. I can't relax. The project…it won't allow it. Now, let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Blain. We'll take things one step at a time. We'll review the results thoroughly, and if anything concerning is found, we'll discuss all your options and create a plan together. I will be honest and upfront with you. And we'll address your concerns about work as well. I'll have the nurse come in now to draw your blood. It will only take a few minutes. I'll be right outside when you're done.
