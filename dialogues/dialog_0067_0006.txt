DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jeannemarie. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Pfennig. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’ve been coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come get it checked. It’s… not a lot, but it’s definitely there.
DOCTOR: Okay, coughing up blood is definitely something we need to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. When did it start? It was… maybe a week ago? At first, I just thought it was a bad cough, you know? But then I noticed the… red. It happens mostly in the mornings, when I first wake up. Not every morning, but… often. It’s… bright red. And it’s mixed with the mucus. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Bright red blood, mixed with mucus, and mostly in the mornings… okay. About how much blood are we talking about?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. It’s not like a lot, Doctor. Not enough to fill a… a cup, certainly. Maybe… a teaspoon? Sometimes less. It’s hard to say exactly. I try not to look too closely, if you understand. It makes me nervous. But it’s enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Even a small amount of blood is concerning, and it’s good you came in to have it checked. Has the amount changed at all over the past week – has it been getting more or less?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it was a little more at first. Maybe two or three days ago? Then it seemed to calm down a bit. But this morning… it was… about the same as the first day, I think. It’s hard to remember exactly. It’s all very upsetting. I just want to know what is wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it was a bit more a few days ago, and this morning was similar to the initial amount. Besides the blood, have you been experiencing any other symptoms – like a fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, or weight loss?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. I haven’t really had any chest pain. My breathing… maybe a little short sometimes, but I do a lot of walking for my work, so I thought that was just from that. And no, I haven’t lost any weight. I eat normally. I do feel a little tired lately, but… I am a little older now, so maybe that is just age? I’m not sure. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, chest pain, or weight loss. Some shortness of breath, which you attribute to work, and some fatigue. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or tuberculosis?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had pneumonia once, many years ago. When I was quite young, maybe ten years old. And… no, not asthma or bronchitis. I had a very bad flu last winter, but that’s it. Oh! And my husband… my late husband… he had tuberculosis, but I was tested and everything was fine. It was a long time ago, though. Before we were married. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia as a child, and your late husband had tuberculosis, but you were tested and negative. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: No surgeries. And… not really hospitalized. Except… when I gave birth to my son, of course. That was many years ago, and everything went well. I've always been quite healthy, until this. I don’t understand why this is happening now. It's frightening. I keep thinking it's something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, hospitalization only for childbirth. It's understandable to be worried. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like lung disease, cancer, or bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he smoked a lot, when he was younger. He had some problems with his lungs, later in life, but I don’t know exactly what. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about those things much. I don't think anyone else in my family had… serious lung problems. My brother is very healthy, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had high blood pressure, your father had lung problems related to smoking. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never smoked a single cigarette in my life. My husband smoked, but I always made him smoke outside. I always thought it was very unhealthy. I try to be very careful with my health. This is why I am so worried. What could be causing this?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little. Sometimes a glass of wine with dinner. Not every night, though. Maybe a couple of times a week. It’s… relaxing. But I don’t drink very much. I don’t think it’s that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of glasses of wine a week. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. Every morning. And sometimes, if my muscles are sore from work, I take ibuprofen. But that's it. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills. I prefer to stay natural, if possible. Is this all helpful? I am trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is very helpful, thank you. One last question: do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat any kind of food. I haven't had any problems with pollen or dust or anything like that either. I think I am pretty lucky, usually. This… this is the first time I've had something like this happen. It's very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for all that information, Jeannemarie. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and sinuses. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds very sensible. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, and what we can do about it. I’m a little nervous, but I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's start with your lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… deep breath in… and out… Good. I’m listening carefully to both sides of your chest. Your breathing sounds a little wheezy, but not significantly. I'll also listen to your heart now. Your heart rate is normal, and I don't hear any murmurs. Now, I’m going to take a look at your throat and sinuses. Open your mouth wide and say "Ah…" Your throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. And your sinuses don’t seem particularly tender to the touch. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and a sputum sample to check for any infection. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. An X-ray and a sample? Yes, please. Whatever you need. I want to be sure. I just… I want this to be over with. I hope it’s nothing serious. When will I get the results? And… will it hurt? The X-ray, I mean. I’m a little worried about radiation.
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll get those ordered right away. The X-ray won’t hurt at all. You'll just stand or sit in front of the machine, and the technician will take a few pictures. The amount of radiation is very small, and the benefits of finding out what’s going on outweigh the risks. As for the sputum sample, you'll be asked to cough up a sample of mucus into a sterile container. It can be a little difficult to do, but the nurse will give you instructions. It usually takes a few hours to get the X-ray results, and the sputum sample takes a few days, as they need to grow the bacteria. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results, and we’ll discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, if you cough up a significant amount of blood – more than a teaspoon – or develop a fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. X-ray and sample, results in a few hours and a few days, call when ready… and emergency room if it gets worse. I will remember that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better, knowing what’s going to happen. Where do I go for the X-ray and the sample? Is it here, in the clinic?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could ease your mind a bit. Yes, the X-ray and sputum sample can both be done right here in the clinic. The nurse will escort you to the radiology department for the X-ray, and then we’ll collect the sputum sample in the exam room after that. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you started. Do you have any questions before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You've answered everything I was worried about. Just… thank you again, Doctor Pfennig. I appreciate your kindness. I was very frightened, but I feel much calmer now. I’m ready when the nurse is ready.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. That’s my job. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns later.
