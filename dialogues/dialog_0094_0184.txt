DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Good morning to you too. Look, I don't have all day. I want somethin' done about… well, about this. It's not what it used to be, and frankly, it's botherin' me. Just want it fixed. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Trendler. I understand you're experiencing some discomfort and want to get to the bottom of it. "Not what it used to be" is a good starting point. Could you tell me a little more about how it’s changed?
PATIENT: Changed? Changed how do you think it changed? It sagged, lady. It sagged! Used to be firm, you know? Like a good… like a good mango. Now? Now it’s all… loose. And it’s… embarrassing. I don't like lookin' at it, and I'm sure my wife… well, she woulda… never mind. Just fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’ve noticed a loss of firmness in your abdominal area, and it's causing you some distress. That’s perfectly valid, and we can certainly explore what’s going on. To help me understand better, has this change been gradual, or did it happen more suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, of course gradual! You think somethin' just poofs overnight? No, no. Years, maybe. Since… since my wife passed, I reckon. Not that I'm blamin' anyone, mind you. Just… years. Less exercise, more… comfort food. That's all. But I don't need a lecture 'bout eatin' right, alright? I want options, not advice.
DOCTOR: No lecture, I assure you, Mr. Trendler. We’re all human, and life changes impact us in many ways. Thank you for sharing that with me. So, to clarify, this gradual change in your abdomen has occurred over the last several years, coinciding with some lifestyle adjustments. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this change – like pain, bloating, changes in your bowel habits, or any difficulty with eating?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. A little discomfort sometimes, after a big meal, but nothin' a good lie-down can't fix. Bloatin'? Sometimes, yeah. Especially if I eat… cabbage. Don't ask. And… bowel habits? Look, lady, I don't discuss that with doctors! That’s private! Just the saggin', alright? Focus on the saggin'! Is there a way to fix the saggin' or not?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Trendler, and I respect your privacy. We don’t have to discuss anything you’re not comfortable with. Let’s focus on the abdominal change. While we’re talking about it, has there been any noticeable change in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Humph. A few pounds, maybe. Old age does that to you, you know? I used to be a strong man, pile drivin' all day. Now? Now I mostly sit. It’s not like I’m gettin' fat, mind you. Just… softer. And I can feel it, you know? This… this layer of stuff. It’s not muscle, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual weight gain along with a loss of muscle tone. That gives me a better picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently feel your abdomen to get a better sense of what’s going on there. It’s routine, and will help me determine the best course of action. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Examine me? Look, I ain't afraid of a little pokin' and proddin', but what good will that do? You gonna magic away the saggin' with your stethoscope? If you got a machine, some kinda thing that sucks it all up, that I’d be interested in. Otherwise… well, I ain’t wastin' my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Trendler. It's not about magic, but about gathering information to understand what's happening and explore all possible options. The exam helps me rule out other potential causes, and it's an important step before discussing any procedures. There are procedures that can address this, yes, but first we need to determine if you are a good candidate, and if there are any underlying health concerns we need to address first. I promise I'll be as efficient as possible. If you allow me to listen to your heart and lungs, and gently feel your abdomen, I can then share with you, based on my findings, what I think the best options are. If you still aren't satisfied, we can discuss referrals to specialists who offer those procedures. Would you be willing to let me proceed with a quick exam?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But make it quick, alright? I got things to do. And don’t go pokin' around too much. Just listen and feel, don't go diggin' for treasure or somethin'. Get it over with. And tell me if you find anythin' interesting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Hmm… I’m noting some softness throughout the abdomen, as you described, and a slight degree of fullness. There's no acute tenderness, which is good. I don't feel any masses or anything concerning. It does feel like there’s a layer of subcutaneous fat present, which is common with age and changes in lifestyle. Based on this quick exam, it seems like you're experiencing a combination of loss of muscle tone and increased subcutaneous fat. This is a common finding, and there are several options we can discuss. Would you like me to explain these options now?
PATIENT: Options? Finally. What options? You got somethin' that sucks it all up? Some kinda fancy machine? If you got somethin' like that, that's what I wanna hear about. Don't tell me 'bout diet and exercise, I ain't interested in that. Just the machines, lady. The machines.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler, let’s talk about the machines. There are several non-surgical options available that utilize different technologies to reduce fat and tighten skin. One is called CoolSculpting, which uses controlled cooling to freeze and eliminate fat cells. Another is radiofrequency treatments, which use energy waves to heat the skin and stimulate collagen production, leading to tightening. There’s also ultrasound treatments which can target deeper layers of fat. These all have varying degrees of effectiveness and downtime, and they typically require multiple sessions. The results aren't instant, but they can provide noticeable improvement. However, it's important to note that these procedures are best suited for individuals who are close to their ideal weight and have localized areas of fat. They aren’t a substitute for a healthy lifestyle. There are also surgical options like liposuction or abdominoplasty which provide more dramatic results, but involve more downtime and risk. Before we discuss which option might be best for you, I’d recommend a consultation with a plastic surgeon to get their expert opinion. They can assess your individual anatomy and goals, and help you make an informed decision. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a qualified plastic surgeon in the area?
PATIENT: Plastic surgeon? You want me to go see a surgeon for this? I just want the sag gone, not a whole operation! Look, lady, I ain’t interested in cuttin' and stitchin'. I thought you had machines! The fancy machines you were talkin' about! Are you tellin' me there ain't no machine that can just… suck it up? No magic wand that just… poof! This is a waste of my time. I'm goin' now. Don't call me. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, please, sit down for just one moment. I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I’ve given you the impression that surgery is the only option. It’s not. You're right, there are non-surgical options that utilize machines to reduce fat and tighten skin, as I mentioned before—CoolSculpting, radiofrequency, and ultrasound treatments. However, I recommended the plastic surgeon consultation because they can properly evaluate if those machines would be effective for you, given your specific body composition and goals. It’s important to know if you are a good candidate before investing time and money in a procedure. They can also discuss realistic expectations and potential risks and benefits. I don't want you to be disappointed, and I want to ensure you make an informed decision. I do have a list of reputable plastic surgeons in the area who specialize in these types of procedures. Would you at least like me to give you that list?
