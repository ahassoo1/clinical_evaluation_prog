DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. My name is Dr. Vodzak. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head, kinda feels like a tight band squeezin’ it. It’s been botherin’ me for… oh, maybe a week now? Not constant, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell, a headache for about a week, feeling like a tight band around the back of your head, and it’s not constant. That’s helpful to know. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when these headaches happen?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. It doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific, really. Sometimes it’s there when I wake up, sometimes in the afternoon… I was workin’ with a client yesterday afternoon and it flared up then, but I was also perfectly fine this morning when I got up. I haven't noticed it being worse with activity or anything. It just… is, when it decides to be. It’s kinda random, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Percell. Random onset, no clear triggers that you've noticed. And you said it wasn’t related to activity?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I've seen. I still get out and walk a good bit, do some gardening... nothing seems to make it worse. I even did a little bit of heavy lifting helpin’ my grandson with somethin’ last weekend, and it didn’t bother me then either. It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, kinda like pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull, pressure-like ache, not sharp, and doesn’t seem to be worsened by activity. That's good information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache – things like nausea, vision changes, dizziness, or any numbness or weakness?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t been feelin’ sick to my stomach or anything like that. My vision’s been fine, I think. I still read my newspaper every mornin’ without any trouble. No dizziness, and no numb spots or weakness. I might be a little more tired than usual lately, but I figured that’s just gettin’ older, you know? Everything's workin' a little slower these days.
DOCTOR: I understand, Percell. It’s good to be aware of changes, and fatigue can certainly come with age. Let's explore that a little further, but first, regarding the headache itself - has anything like this ever happened to you before?
PATIENT: You know, now that you mention it... I think so. A long time ago, maybe twenty years or so? It was similar, kinda like a tight band. It didn't last long though, just a few days. I didn’t bother with the doctor then, it just went away on its own. I don't remember anything special happenin’ at the time, no stress or anything I can recall. It’s been nothin’ like this for a long, long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a similar headache happened many years ago, resolved on its own, and nothing specific was associated with it at that time. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I used to go to the doctor every year for a check-up, but I haven't been in a while. I guess I just haven’t felt the need. My wife… well, my ex-wife, she was always good about keepin’ track of those things, but… ...let’s just say I’ve been on my own for a bit now and haven't kept up with it as well as I should. I take a couple of vitamins, that’s about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Percell. It’s common for things to fall by the wayside sometimes, and it’s good you’re addressing it now. No regular medical conditions diagnosed, just a couple of vitamins. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgery. Not even for somethin’ silly like my tonsils! I’ve always been lucky, I guess. Broke my arm when I was a kid climbin’ a tree, but they just put it in a cast. That’s it. Still got a bit of a crook in it, if you look close enough. But it doesn't bother me none.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, just a childhood broken arm that healed with a cast. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family… we didn't really talk much about health stuff when I was growin’ up. My dad… he died when I was pretty young, heart trouble, I think. But it was a long time ago, and nobody really talked specifics. My mom lived a long life, but she had some arthritis, mostly in her hands. And… my sister had high blood pressure, I think, but that’s about all I can remember. We weren’t a big family for doctor visits or sharin’ medical history, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Percell. Limited family medical history available. That’s alright, we can work with what we have. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle a little bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ like that. Never been much of a smoker, tried it once when I was a teenager and didn't care for it. I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes, but I haven't had one in… oh, must be ten years now? Just lost interest, I guess. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never been my style. I like my sleep too much for all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. That's good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I’m aware of. I can eat just about anything, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I haven't taken much medicine over the years, thankfully, but I’ve never had any problems when I have. I can’t think of anything I’m allergic to, really. Well… I don’t like licorice, but that’s a taste thing, not an allergy!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just a dislike for licorice! Thank you, Percell. That gives me a good overall picture of your health. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment – just to make sure everything is working as it should. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. I don't mind at all. I haven't had a good check-up in a while, so I’m sure it’s a good idea. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles. Blood pressure is 142/88 mmHg. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Sensation is intact. Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact. Everything seems to be within normal limits, Percell. Your neurological exam is normal, your heart and lungs sound good, and your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly concerning at this point. It's something we can monitor. Given your headache and slightly elevated blood pressure, I would like to order a basic blood workup - a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level - just to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work can't hurt, I suppose. Just let me know what I need to do, where to go, and when to get it done. I don't mind a little poke if it helps figure things out. Is there anything special I need to do before the blood draw - fast or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, good question, Percell. For the most accurate results, I would like you to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks – except for water – for 12 hours before your appointment. I’ll have the lab order sent to [Name of local lab] – it’s located at [Address of lab]. You can go any time during their business hours. Their phone number is [Phone number of lab], if you need to schedule an appointment. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen for your headache, as needed, and staying well-hydrated. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, 12-hour fast, [Name of local lab] at [Address of lab], phone number [Phone number of lab]. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the headache. Got it. I think I can manage that. Um… is there anything I should avoid besides food and drink during the fast? Like, strenuous exercise or anything like that? And what exactly are we lookin' for with this blood work? Just so I have some idea...
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Percell. It's always good to be informed. Yes, I would recommend avoiding strenuous exercise during the fast as well. Light activity is fine, but nothing that would significantly raise your heart rate or cause you to sweat. As for what we're looking for, the complete blood count will help us check for things like anemia or infection. The comprehensive metabolic panel will give us information about your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte levels. And the thyroid-stimulating hormone level will help us rule out any thyroid problems, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause headaches. Essentially, we're looking for any red flags that could be contributing to your headache, and ensuring there aren't any underlying medical conditions we need to address. Given your blood pressure reading, we'll also be looking at those levels closely. A single elevated reading isn't necessarily cause for concern, but it's important to monitor it. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. That all makes sense. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid… monitor my blood pressure. No strenuous exercise during the fast. I can write all that down, I suppose. Thank you for explainin' it so clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you takin' the time to answer all my questions. I'll get the blood work done as soon as I can and schedule a follow-up. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you then.
