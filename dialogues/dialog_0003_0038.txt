DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I am Dr. Yackey. So, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a bit difficult to explain precisely. I understand it has something to do with making sure my wishes are known, should… well, should I become unable to communicate them myself. Someone suggested I get some forms completed. An Advance Directive, I believe they called it? Or a POLST form? Honestly, the details are… rather hazy. I apologize for my lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Advance care planning. It's… sensible, I suppose, if one is prone to such anxieties. Though frankly, most people don't need to concern themselves with this until absolutely necessary. Still. A POLST form—Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment—is generally reserved for those with serious, life-limiting illnesses. An Advance Directive covers a broader range of scenarios. Do you have a specific medical condition that prompted this inquiry?
PATIENT: A medical condition… not that I’m aware of, Doctor. Truly. I… I’ve always been rather… forgetful. It’s worsened somewhat in recent years, I suppose. It's less a specific illness, and more a general… fading. That's what prompted this, I believe. My… ex-husband was quite insistent. He felt it was prudent, given my… tendencies. I don’t recall the exact details of why he felt so strongly, only that it involved making things easier for… someone. Possibly him. It’s all terribly confusing.
DOCTOR: “Tendencies.” Right. And this…forgetfulness, is it impacting your daily life?
PATIENT: Yes, it is, Doctor. It’s… frustrating, to say the least. Small things, mostly. Misplacing objects, forgetting appointments. But occasionally…larger gaps. I sometimes struggle to recall events from… not long ago. It doesn’t happen often, but it’s concerning. I rely heavily on notes and… reminders. My ex-husband managed most of the… practicalities towards the end. I’m attempting to be more independent now, but it’s… challenging. I worry about what would happen if I were to require significant care. That's why I thought these forms might be… helpful.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Let's review your medical history. According to this, no significant diagnoses. No neurological evaluations recorded. You mentioned this has worsened in recent years… can you quantify that?
PATIENT: Quantify…? I’m afraid I’m not certain I can, Doctor. It’s not as though I kept a precise log of my lapses in memory. It’s more a… creeping sensation. A gradual erosion, perhaps. Perhaps two or three years ago, it was just misplaced keys. Now… now I sometimes have difficulty remembering the names of acquaintances. Or the purpose of a room I’ve been in moments before. It's… unsettling. And I apologize again for my inability to provide a more concrete explanation. I wish I were better at recalling details.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's perform a brief cognitive assessment. It's a standard procedure, a few simple questions and tasks. It won’t be exhaustive, but it will give us a baseline. Just to rule out any… obvious causes. If you don’t mind.
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. Please, proceed. I… I understand the necessity of it. I just… I hope it won’t be too embarrassing if I struggle. I truly do apologize in advance for any… difficulties. I will endeavor to answer as truthfully and accurately as possible, given my… limitations.
DOCTOR: Quite alright. We'll start with something simple. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date…? Oh dear. Let me see… It's August… yes, definitely August. And… the second, I believe? August 2nd. Is that correct? I… I hope I haven’t made a mistake already. It feels right, but my confidence is rather low at the moment.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, can you spell “world”?
PATIENT: Oh… “world.” Let me think… W-O-R-L-D. Is that correct? I… I used to be quite adept at spelling. I fear my skills are… diminishing. It's rather disheartening, actually. I apologize if I’m not performing to an acceptable standard. It’s not for lack of effort, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Acceptable. Now, I’m going to name three words. I want you to repeat them back to me immediately. And then, I'll ask you to recall them after a short interval. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat after me.
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. Is that correct? I… I believe I have them. Apple, table, penny. I’m trying to commit them to memory. It feels… precarious, but I believe I have them for the moment. I shall attempt to retain them. Is there anything else I should be doing to aid my recall, Doctor? Perhaps repeating them silently?
DOCTOR: Just remain seated. We'll proceed with the test. Now, I'm going to ask you a simple question. What year is it?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. The year… That’s… that's a difficult one. Is it… 2023? No, that feels… wrong. Is it 2024? I… I truly am struggling. I believe it is 2025, isn't it? August 2nd, 2025? I apologize profoundly for my confusion, Doctor. I seem to be… losing track of time. It's quite alarming, actually.
DOCTOR: Yes. It is 2025. Ms. Buoniconti, while I appreciate your cooperation, this brief assessment is… inconclusive. We need further evaluation to determine the cause of your cognitive difficulties. I am referring you to a neurologist for a comprehensive neuropsychological examination. It will involve more detailed testing and potentially brain imaging.
PATIENT: A neurologist… and brain imaging? Oh dear. That sounds… rather serious, doesn't it? I… I hadn’t anticipated this. I was merely hoping to complete some forms to ensure my wishes are respected. Is it… is it likely to be something… grave, Doctor? I confess, I am becoming quite anxious. The thought of further testing… and potential… diagnoses… it’s overwhelming. Could you perhaps elaborate on what this examination entails? And… and what the potential implications might be?
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, I understand your anxiety. However, it's irresponsible to speculate on potential diagnoses without proper investigation. A neuropsychological examination will assess various cognitive functions – memory, attention, language, reasoning – to identify any specific deficits. Brain imaging—likely an MRI—will help rule out any structural abnormalities. It doesn't necessarily indicate a grave condition, but it is prudent to investigate these symptoms. I will provide you with a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly respected neurologist. Her office will schedule the necessary appointments and explain the procedures in detail. Now, are there any other medical concerns you would like to address today, or shall we proceed with the referral?
PATIENT: No… no, I believe that is all, Doctor. The neurologist will… explain everything further, I suppose. I… I am rather overwhelmed at the moment. Perhaps it is best to focus on the referral for now. Thank you for your time… and for attempting to assist me. I confess, I had hoped for a simpler solution. But… I understand the necessity of a thorough evaluation. Could you… could you perhaps provide me with a written summary of our conversation, including the referral information? It would be… helpful to have something to refer to later, given my… difficulties with recall.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will generate a summary of our discussion, including the referral information for Dr. Sharma. It will be available through the patient portal. You can also request a hard copy from the reception desk. And Ms. Buoniconti, I strongly advise you to schedule the appointment with Dr. Sharma as soon as possible. The sooner we have a clearer understanding of your condition, the better. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all. Thank you again for your time and assistance. I… I appreciate your patience. I will schedule the appointment with Dr. Sharma as soon as possible. Good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Buoniconti. .
