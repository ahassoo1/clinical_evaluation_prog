DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, really. It’s been going on for a bit now, all over. Not terrible, but… constant, you know? It’s just annoying, and I wanted to get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant itching can be very disruptive, even if it's not severely painful. "A bit now"... could you tell me roughly how long it's been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably around the end of May, I’d say. So, maybe two months now? It was very mild at first, I barely noticed it, just a little tickle here and there. But it’s definitely gotten more persistent over the last few weeks. I'm pretty good with dates, actually – my wife, God rest her, always said I had a good memory for things like that.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so precise with the timeline, Mr. Ferneding. And I’m very sorry for your loss. It’s good to remember those things. So, around the end of May, mild itching, gradually becoming more persistent. Is it all over your body, or are there specific areas that are more affected?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s… it’s been a while. And yes, it really is all over. My back is the worst, I think. It’s hard to reach, so I can’t really tell if it’s worse because it’s itchy or just because I can’t get to it! But my arms and legs itch too, and even my chest and stomach. Nothing’s really not itching, if that makes sense. It’s not raised or bumpy or anything, just… itchy skin. It’s driving me a bit mad, honestly.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Ferneding. Widespread itching without any visible rash can be quite perplexing. And incredibly frustrating, I imagine. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… I don’t think anything specifically makes it better, unfortunately. As for worse… hot showers definitely aggravate it. And if I get really stressed, it seems to flare up a bit more. I used to enjoy gardening, but even being out in the sun for too long makes it feel worse, though I’m careful to wear long sleeves when I’m out there now. Otherwise, it's pretty consistent, day in and day out.
DOCTOR: Okay, hot showers, stress, and prolonged sun exposure seem to be triggers. That’s helpful to know. And you’re smart to be protecting yourself from the sun. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been well-controlled with medication for years now. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. I used to be very active, but since my wife passed… well, I haven’t been as diligent about looking after myself, if I'm honest. But no major illnesses, and I don't take any medications besides the blood pressure pills.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ferneding. Losing a loved one can certainly impact all aspects of life. It's important to be kind to yourself. And well-controlled blood pressure is good news. What about allergies?
PATIENT: Ah, allergies. Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had any serious reactions to anything. A little bit of a runny nose during pollen season, maybe, but nothing a tissue couldn’t handle. I haven’t been stung by a bee or anything like that, and I don't have any known food allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. And finally, do you have any family history of skin conditions – eczema, psoriasis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had… well, she had dry skin, always complaining about it, especially in the winter. Not anything a doctor ever looked at, just dry, flaky skin. My father, he didn't have any skin problems that I know of. And my wife… no, she always had lovely skin. So, I guess just my mother’s dry skin. Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding, thank you for that thorough history. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical examination. I'll just take a look at your skin, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do, just let me know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit back and relax. I’m going to start by taking a look at your skin. Okay. I’m not seeing any obvious rash, hives, or lesions. Your skin does appear generally dry, particularly on your back and arms, as you mentioned. There’s no visible sign of excoriation—scratch marks—at this point, which is good. Your heart and lungs sound clear. And your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a bit elevated, but not drastically so. I'll note that for your primary care physician. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it sounds like we’re dealing with pruritus – generalized itching – without a clear underlying cause. Given the lack of visible skin changes, and the absence of systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss, it’s less likely to be something serious, but we still need to investigate further. I would like to order some blood tests to rule out some common causes of itching, such as thyroid problems, liver or kidney issues, and certain types of anemia. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood tests seem like a good idea to me. Anything to get to the bottom of this itching. It’s just… annoying, you know? But yes, please, go ahead with the tests.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Ferneding. "Annoying" is a very valid description! Okay, I’ve ordered a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. The lab should be able to draw the blood here in the clinic today. They’ll need you to be fasting for at least eight hours beforehand, so you might need to schedule the appointment for tomorrow morning. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to recommend a few things to help manage the itching. First, I’d like you to switch to a mild, fragrance-free soap and lotion. Avoid hot showers; lukewarm water is best. And consider an over-the-counter antihistamine at night, like diphenhydramine or loratadine, to help with the itching while you sleep. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Fragrance-free soap, lukewarm water, antihistamine… I can definitely do that. I actually used to use a fragrance-free soap years ago, so I can go back to that. And I think I have some loratadine at home, actually. So that’s good. Is there… anything I should be worried about? You said it doesn’t seem serious, but… you know, it's easy to get anxious.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Mr. Ferneding, and it’s good you’re asking. While the most likely scenario is a benign cause like dry skin or a mild allergic reaction, we always need to rule out more serious possibilities. The blood tests will help us look for things like liver disease, kidney problems, thyroid disorders, and certain types of cancer that can sometimes cause itching. However, these are relatively uncommon, and your symptoms don’t strongly suggest any of those conditions at this point. I want to emphasize that I’m not trying to scare you. I just want to be thorough and rule everything out. We’ll get the test results back within a few days, and then we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you develop any new symptoms—fever, weight loss, fatigue, jaundice—please contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, try the recommendations I made, and hopefully, you’ll start to feel some relief. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make sense, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. It’s good to know what you’re looking for, and I appreciate you being so thorough. And I will definitely contact you if anything new comes up. So, just schedule the blood tests, try the soap and antihistamine, and wait for the results. Right?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Schedule the blood tests, try the soap and antihistamine, and wait for the results. My assistant, Sarah, will be happy to schedule the blood tests for you before you leave. She’ll also give you a written summary of my recommendations, just to make sure you don’t forget anything. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing what’s going on, and I appreciate you taking my concerns seriously. I’ll see Sarah now, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Sarah is right outside; she’ll take good care of you. Have a good day, and try to relax. .
PATIENT: .
