DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, if you could just get straight to it, that’d be great. I’ve got a pretty packed day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kovtun. I understand you’d like to get straight to the results. Just to confirm, you’re referring to the blood work and urine analysis we collected on July 26th?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s the one. July 26th, yep. Any problems?
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take a look. The complete blood count came back within normal limits, which is good. Your basic metabolic panel was also within the expected range. However, there were a few things in the urine analysis that I’d like to discuss with you. Do you have any history of urinary tract infections, Ms. Kovtun?
PATIENT: Nope, never. Not that I know of, anyway. Is it bad? You're making me nervous. Just tell me what's up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kovtun, no need to be alarmed. It’s not necessarily “bad,” but the urinalysis showed a slightly elevated level of protein and a small amount of blood – what we call hematuria. The protein level isn't dramatically high, but it's enough to warrant some further investigation. The hematuria is also minimal, but we need to figure out the cause. Have you noticed any changes in your urine—color, odor, frequency, or any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Everything’s been… normal. Honestly, I don't pay that much attention to it, if you want the truth. Is it something serious? Like, kidney problems or something? I don’t have time for a whole thing, Doctor. I’ve got logistics to run.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Kovtun, and I appreciate your honesty. It's good you've noticed no changes in your urine. While it could be a sign of kidney problems, that's just one possibility. Other causes include a urinary tract infection – even if you aren’t experiencing typical symptoms – or even something as simple as strenuous exercise. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to start with a repeat urinalysis to confirm these findings. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, a repeat test. Whatever. But can we do it quickly? I can swing by first thing tomorrow if that works. I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kovtun. We can absolutely do that. I've scheduled you for a repeat urinalysis tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. That should give us enough time to process the results and discuss them with you later in the day. In the meantime, would you be able to increase your fluid intake over the next 24 hours?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can drink more water. No problem. Is that all I need to do? Drink water and come back tomorrow? I'm already thinking about the paperwork.
DOCTOR: Yes, for now, just increasing your fluid intake and keeping the appointment tomorrow. We'll get the results back quickly and discuss the next steps, if any are needed. As for paperwork, we can handle that quickly when you arrive. It should be a fairly standard process. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… try to be fast tomorrow, okay? I really appreciate it, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kovtun. I will do my best. We'll strive to be as efficient as possible. Thank you for coming in today, and I’ll see you tomorrow at 8:00 AM. Have a good rest of your day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any changes or have any concerns before then. .
