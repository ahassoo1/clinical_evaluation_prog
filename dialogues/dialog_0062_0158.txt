DOCTOR: Hi Deloris, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Decosta. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, nice to meet you too, Doctor... Decosta, was it? Hmm. Let me see… It’s about a letter. A letter for my… pet. Yes, that’s it. A pet ownership letter. Something about needing it for… well, it's just something I need to have, really. Don’t really remember why exactly, but the landlord… or someone… said I needed it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pet ownership letter. I understand. And you're not experiencing any health issues yourself that brought you in today?
PATIENT: Health issues? Oh, no, no. I'm perfectly fine. A bit tired, maybe. Everyone gets tired, don't they? It’s just… this letter. Honestly, all this paperwork these days. It’s ridiculous. It's about the… the little fella, that's all. I'm not one for complaining about my own health, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright, I hear you. So, just to be clear, you're here specifically to obtain documentation verifying pet ownership, not for any personal medical concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! That's it precisely. Though… what kind of documentation is this letter even supposed to be? I mean, I know I have a pet, obviously. It's not like I just… made him up! But I don't recall signing anything… or needing a special form… Honestly, all of this is very confusing. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: It sounds like there might be a bit of a misunderstanding about what this letter entails. Usually, a “pet ownership letter” from a doctor is requested when the pet provides some kind of medical support – like an Emotional Support Animal, or service animal. Is your pet providing support in that way?
PATIENT: Emotional… support? Oh, heavens no. He’s just a… companion. A very handsome companion, I'll grant you. But he doesn’t do anything, if you catch my drift. He eats, he sleeps, he sheds all over the furniture… It's certainly emotional trying to keep up with the shedding, but that's not the same thing, is it? I just need a piece of paper to show someone, that’s all. Why does it have to be so complicated?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you may have been misinformed about needing a letter from a doctor for general pet ownership. A doctor’s letter is generally reserved for animals that provide a documented medical service or emotional support, as it has legal implications. It's not standard practice to provide this kind of documentation simply to verify pet ownership. I'm not able to fulfill this request, as it doesn't fall within the scope of medical practice. Do you know who requested this letter from you?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. See? This is exactly what I mean. Bureaucracy. It was the landlord, I think. Or maybe the building manager? A very officious young man. Kept talking about "policies" and "documentation." I told him I have photos! Beautiful photos of Reginald… but he just looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language. Honestly, I don’t have the energy to deal with… Reginald is a perfectly well-behaved… mostly well-behaved… dog. Why does everything need so much paperwork these days? It’s utterly ridiculous. Perhaps I should just… ignore the young man?
DOCTOR: It certainly sounds frustrating, and I can understand why you’re upset. It’s not uncommon for landlords to have specific requirements, but a letter from a doctor isn’t typically one of them for general pet ownership. Ignoring the request might not be the best course of action, as it could lead to issues with your lease. Perhaps you could politely ask the building manager for clarification on why the letter is needed, and if there are alternative ways to demonstrate pet ownership – like providing vaccination records, a pet license, or the photos you mentioned. I'm happy to write a note stating that you are my patient and appear to be in good health, if that would be helpful, but I cannot provide a letter verifying pet ownership. Would that be something you’d like?
PATIENT: A note saying I'm in good health… Hmm. That's… something, I suppose. Although, what does my health have to do with Reginald? Honestly, the logic of these people. But… if it might appease the officious young man… yes, alright. Write a note. As long as it doesn’t mention Reginald. And it's not too long. I hate paperwork, you understand. Just a simple note. That'll do. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I can certainly do that. Just a brief note confirming you are my patient and in good health. No mention of Reginald. Here you go. It states: “To Whom It May Concern: Deloris Wrye is a patient in my care and appears to be in good health as of August 2, 2025.” Signed, Dr. Charisma Decosta. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, that will do nicely, I think. Simple and to the point. Thank you, Doctor. Though, I still don’t understand why this was necessary… No, that's all. Unless… you wouldn’t happen to have a spare dog biscuit, would you? Just a small one. Reginald gets very anxious when I'm at the doctor's. A little treat would calm him right down. But never mind, forget I asked. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very… patient. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Deloris. Unfortunately, I don't have any dog biscuits on hand, but I hope Reginald feels better soon. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment if you do have any health concerns in the future. Have a lovely day!
