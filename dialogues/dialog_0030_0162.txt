DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey, and I'm a Family Medicine physician. It's August 2nd, 2025. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't really have time for all this chatting. Just…bloating, okay? My stomach’s puffed up. It’s annoying, that’s it. Can we just figure out what's wrong and get it over with?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I understand you’re experiencing bloating and would like to get to the bottom of it quickly. I will certainly do my best to be efficient. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this bloating?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to say? It…feels full. Like I ate a Thanksgiving dinner and I didn’t. It happens…sometimes. I honestly don't keep track. It just is. Why does it matter when it happens? It's uncomfortable, is what it is. Look, I work hard, I don’t have time to be cataloging my insides.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize if I’m asking seemingly unnecessary questions. It is helpful to understand the pattern, if there is one, to help determine the cause. When you say it “happens sometimes,” roughly how often would you say that is – a few times a week, a few times a month, or something else?
PATIENT: Honestly? No clue. Maybe a couple times a week? Look, it fluctuates. It depends. I eat…stuff. I work. I sleep. It just…happens. I really don’t pay attention to it unless it’s actively bothering me, which it is now. Are we getting anywhere, or…?
DOCTOR: Okay, a few times a week when it’s bothersome. And you mentioned it fluctuates with what you eat. Can you think of any particular foods that seem to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Food? Seriously? Everything makes it worse, probably. I eat what I eat. Steak, chicken, beans…doesn’t matter. It all feels the same after a bit. Look, I'm not a chef, I just need to keep my strength up for work. I don't have allergies or anything, and I don't go looking for what foods “trigger” things. Is this really necessary? I'm a pile driver operator, not a food critic.
DOCTOR: I understand your point, Mr. Kristofik, and I’m trying to be as efficient as possible. Knowing what you typically eat helps rule out certain things. Since it seems to happen regardless of what you eat, that’s useful information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? Pain? Sometimes. Gas, definitely. It’s… unpleasant. I wouldn't call it debilitating, but it’s annoying. Look, my job’s physical, alright? I need to be functioning. Anything more than a little discomfort and I’m losing money. No, I haven't noticed anything else… I don't think. What kind of “other” symptoms are we talking about? You’re starting to sound like my ex-wife.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions are frustrating. I’m simply trying to gather enough information to understand what might be going on. By "other symptoms," I meant things like changes in your bowel habits - have you noticed any diarrhea, constipation, or changes in the color or consistency of your stool?
PATIENT: Look, are you seriously asking me about my… stool? This is ridiculous. I don’t analyze my… waste products. No, I haven't noticed anything unusual, alright? It goes in, it comes out. That's it. I'm a grown man, I don’t need to catalog every detail of my bodily functions for a doctor! I'm starting to regret coming in here. This is a waste of my time. Can we just give me something for the bloating and be done with it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable. It’s not my intention to pry, but sometimes these details are important. Given your description and the fact that it’s happening several times a week without clear relation to your diet, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen and gently pressing on it to check for tenderness. This may help me get a better idea of what’s going on. If that doesn’t give us enough information, we might need to consider some basic blood work to rule out certain conditions. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Look, fine. Get it over with. Just…don’t take forever. And don’t ask me about my stool again. Seriously. I have things to do. This whole thing is just… unnecessary. Pile drivers don't need a perfect digestive system, you know? Just tell me what’s wrong and how to fix it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I will be as efficient as possible. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It may be helpful if you take a few deep breaths. Okay. I’m not hearing any immediately concerning bowel sounds, but I do detect some… mild tympany, meaning there’s a bit more air in your abdomen than usual. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Is there any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: Mild tymp… whatever. Look, it feels… bloated, alright? It's not exactly a revelation. And yeah, it's a little tender when you poke around. Not excruciating, just… uncomfortable. Like you’re pressing on a balloon. Can we just skip the poking and get to the part where you give me something to fix it? Honestly, this feels like a waste of everyone’s time. I'm a strong guy, I can handle a little discomfort. I'm used to it.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Kristofik. Based on the exam findings – mild tympany and some tenderness to palpation – it sounds like you likely have some degree of intestinal gas and distension. Given your description and the fact that it's not associated with any other concerning symptoms, it's likely not a serious condition. However, it's still important to rule out other possibilities. Given your resistance to providing further details and the potential for underlying issues, I recommend a basic blood test to check for inflammation and rule out conditions like celiac disease, which can sometimes present with bloating. Would you be willing to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Celiac… what now? Look, I already told you, I eat whatever. Steak, chicken, beans…it doesn’t matter. You're going to take my blood over a little bloating? This is absurd. Fine. Take your blood. Get it over with. But if it turns out to be nothing, I expect a full refund for my time. This is ridiculous. Just…hurry up. And no more questions about my… eating habits. Honestly. This is starting to feel like harassment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, I'm not trying to harass you. The blood test is a precautionary measure to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and it will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. I'll draw a small sample of blood from your arm. It will only take a few minutes. Please relax your arm, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. Alright, all done. I'll send this sample to the lab, and we should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I can recommend a few over-the-counter medications to help relieve the bloating. Simethicone, which is often sold as Gas-X, can help break up the gas bubbles in your digestive tract. Also, a stool softener like docusate sodium could help prevent constipation, which can sometimes contribute to bloating. Would you like me to write you a prescription for those?
PATIENT: Fine. Gas-X and… whatever the other one is. Just… anything to get this over with. And don't bother calling me unless it's something serious. Honestly, I have work to do. I'm losing money just sitting here. Just… give me the paper and let me go. And no, I don't want to talk about it anymore. I'm done. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Here's a prescription for simethicone and docusate sodium. Please follow the instructions on the label carefully. If you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits – please seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, I'll contact you if the lab results indicate anything concerning. I appreciate your patience, Mr. Kristofik, and I hope you feel better soon. .
