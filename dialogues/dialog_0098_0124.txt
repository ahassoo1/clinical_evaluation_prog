DOCTOR: Good morning, Nykisha. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and my skin… it’s just gotten darker. Not like a tan, but… I don't know, just… different. It’s been worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and a change in skin color… I see. And when did you first start noticing these changes, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… maybe about three months ago? It started slowly, just feeling a bit more tired than usual. The skin thing… probably around the same time, but I didn’t really pay attention to it until recently. It just seemed to get more noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you describe the change in your skin a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… it’s hard to explain. It’s not patchy or anything. Just… overall darker, I guess. And maybe a little… grayish? Not a bright color, definitely not like a healthy tan. It's on my arms and face mostly, I think. And my hands. I don’t really know if it’s everywhere else, to be honest. I don’t check much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual darkening, grayish tone, mostly on your arms, face and hands... Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. I’ve been eating pretty much the same. No new medications. No big stresses or anything. Work’s been the same, which is good. I haven’t traveled anywhere. Oh! Wait. I did start taking a new vitamin a couple of months ago. Just a multivitamin, you know, to try and feel a little better with the tiredness. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that matters! What’s the name of the multivitamin?
PATIENT: Um… let me see… It’s… Nature’s Best Daily Boost. It has a lot of different things in it. Vitamin D, B vitamins, iron… all sorts of stuff. I just got it at the grocery store.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and skin changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes I feel a little cold, even when it’s warm. And I’ve been… I don’t know, a little more forgetful lately. Nothing major, just… misplacing things, forgetting little things. I figured it was just from being tired. Oh, and sometimes my muscles feel a bit weak. Like I don’t have as much energy to do things. It’s all kind of gradual, so I haven’t really said anything to anyone about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Cold intolerance, some forgetfulness, and muscle weakness… I appreciate you sharing all of this. It's good to have a complete picture. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood things, you know, chickenpox, measles… but nothing serious. I've never been told I have any… anything. I get regular checkups with my primary care doctor, but he usually just says I'm fine. I haven't seen him in about a year, though. I mostly just try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: No, none of that either. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Everything else has been just… normal. I really don’t get sick much. This tiredness is just… weird.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mom had… I think it was high blood pressure. And my dad… he had some problems with his heart, later in life. Nothing really serious when he was young. My grandparents… I don't really know, to be honest. We didn't talk about health much when I was growing up. It's hard to remember all of that. We didn't have much access to doctors when I was a kid, so we didn’t really talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, just the Nature’s Best Daily Boost. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to stay healthy naturally. That’s why I started the vitamins, hoping to feel better without having to go to the doctor. But… this isn’t working.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I'm not a picky eater. That's one less thing to worry about, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and taking a look at your skin. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. This tiredness is really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 130/85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your skin. I do notice some diffuse darkening, as you mentioned, and a slight grayish tone. No rashes or lesions. Your skin feels warm and dry. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. We need to do some blood work to rule things out.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work… that sounds serious. What are you thinking it could be? Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: It's good that we're investigating, Nykisha. The blood work will help us narrow things down. One possibility we need to rule out is iron deficiency anemia, which can cause fatigue and pale skin. Another is a thyroid issue, as that can affect energy levels. And we also want to check your vitamin D levels. While it’s unlikely, we also need to consider less common causes that present with similar symptoms. I don't want to alarm you, but it's important to be thorough. It could be something relatively simple, but we need the blood work to know for sure. I'll order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… iron, thyroid, vitamin D… That sounds like a lot. Will it take long to get the results? And… is it going to be expensive? I'm on Medicare, so I'm not sure what's covered. And… will I need more tests after that?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Nykisha. The lab usually gets the results back within 3-5 business days. As for cost, Medicare should cover most of these tests, but it's always best to check with your insurance provider to confirm your specific coverage and any potential out-of-pocket costs. I'll provide you with a lab requisition form with the appropriate billing codes to help with that process. As for further tests, it’s hard to say definitively at this point. It depends on what the blood work reveals. If anything is abnormal, we may need to order additional tests to get a clearer picture. But let's focus on getting these initial tests done first, and we’ll take it from there. I want to reassure you that we're doing everything we can to figure out what's going on and get you feeling better. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Dr. Bombara. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’ll go to the lab as soon as I can. And I’ll check with Medicare about the costs. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nykisha. I’m glad I could help. Here's the lab requisition form. Please let the lab know if you have any special instructions, and don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before or after your blood work. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. And please, try not to worry too much until we have more information. We will get to the bottom of this. Have a good day.
