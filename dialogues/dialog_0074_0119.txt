DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's a bit embarrassing, honestly. But I suppose that’s what you’re for. It’s about… a discharge. A gentleman friend, you see, and… there’s been something coming from him. It’s not… polite. And frankly, it’s worrisome.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright to be embarrassed, Ms. Wartick, and you’ve come to the right place. These things happen, and it’s important to address them. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Well, it's… yellowish, mostly. Sometimes a bit greenish, if I’m being truthful. Not terribly much of it, but enough to be… noticeable. And it smells… not good, Doctor. Not good at all. He doesn’t seem to be in any pain, thankfully. He just… well, he’s not as tidy as he should be, if you catch my drift. Is it something serious? He’s a respectable man, you know. I wouldn’t want this to… complicate things.
DOCTOR: I see. Yellowish or greenish discharge, with an odor, and no reported pain. Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Wartick. It's good you're addressing this. Based on what you’ve described, it certainly warrants investigation. It could be a number of things – a common infection, perhaps, but we need to rule out anything more serious. Just to be clear, this discharge is coming from your gentleman friend, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. From him. I should have been clearer. It's not… me. I just noticed it, naturally. I wouldn’t be coming to you if it were a problem with my person. Honestly, Doctor, the thought! I simply observed it and felt it prudent to inquire. He’s a bit… old-fashioned, you see. Doesn’t like doctors much. That's why I’m here, doing the asking. Is it catching? I wouldn't want to… you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand completely, Ms. Wartick. Thank you for clarifying. It’s good you’re thinking ahead and taking precautions. Given that the discharge is from your gentleman friend, and he’s reluctant to seek medical attention himself, we'll proceed with the understanding that I’m gathering information to the best of my ability through you. The possibility of it being “catching” – meaning infectious – is certainly a valid concern. Many causes of discharge are sexually transmitted, but not all. To help me determine the likelihood and potential causes, could you tell me a little more about his overall health?
PATIENT: Well… he’s… mostly healthy, I suppose. He’s a retired carpenter, so he’s always been active, physical work and all. He doesn’t complain much, which I always thought was a good sign. He has a bit of trouble with his knees, the arthritis, you know? And he… enjoys a good glass of brandy now and then. As for other illnesses… I don't recall anything specific. He’s not one for doctors, as I said, so I don't often hear about these things. He doesn't have… female complaints, obviously. Does that make sense? Is that helpful? I just don't know what details are important.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ms. Wartick. Knowing he's generally healthy, a retired carpenter with some arthritis and enjoys brandy is useful information. And yes, I understand perfectly about the “female complaints” – that's quite clear! To help narrow things down further, and keeping in mind he's reluctant to see a doctor directly, I'd like to ask a few more questions about his sexual history. This is important for ruling out sexually transmitted infections, which are a common cause of discharge. I understand this might be a sensitive topic, but any information you can provide will be kept confidential and will help me determine the best course of action. Would you be comfortable discussing this with me?
PATIENT: Goodness gracious, Doctor. Are you suggesting…? I… well, I hardly think that’s necessary. He’s a respectable man! We’ve been… companions for some time. It’s not as though he’s gallivanting about. That sort of question feels rather… intrusive, frankly. I understand you have a job to do, but I assure you, he’s not leading a… scandalous life. Must you ask about such things? It feels quite improper. Perhaps we could focus on other avenues of inquiry?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to express your concerns, Ms. Wartick, and I sincerely apologize if my line of questioning felt intrusive. It was not my intention to imply anything untoward, and I understand your discomfort completely. My intention was solely to gather sufficient information to help determine the cause of the discharge, and I realize I approached that topic insensitively. You are correct to prioritize his respectability, and I will refrain from asking further questions of that nature. In that case, let’s focus on other possibilities. Has he experienced any other symptoms recently – fever, chills, pain in his lower abdomen, or any changes in his urination?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. He’s a stoic man, you see. Doesn’t complain easily. He’s been a bit… tired lately, perhaps. But he’s been working in the garden, so I attributed it to that. No fever, no chills, no pain, and his… habits, shall we say, seem unchanged. He always makes sure to… properly hydrate. He’s a practical man, you see. He understands the importance of fluids. Is there anything else you need to know? I'm starting to feel quite flustered, Doctor. I truly hope we can reach a conclusion without further… personal inquiries.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Wartick, and I assure you I will respect your boundaries. No further personal inquiries. Fatigue, no other symptoms, and consistent hydration – that's helpful. Given his stoic nature and your reluctance to delve further, and without a more thorough examination, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the discharge. However, based on what you’ve described, several possibilities come to mind. It could be a non-sexually transmitted infection, such as a bacterial infection, or potentially an inflammation of the urethra. However, without a sample and further testing, it’s impossible to say for certain. The most responsible course of action would be to obtain a sample of the discharge for laboratory analysis. This will allow us to identify any bacteria or other organisms present and guide appropriate treatment. Would you be willing to attempt to collect a sample, and bring it to the clinic for testing?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor. Collect a sample? That sounds… terribly awkward. And I doubt he’d be amenable to the idea. He’s a private man, you see. Very private. I simply don’t think that’s possible. I’ve already been rather bold just discussing this with you. Asking me to… collect a sample is a step too far. Perhaps there’s another way? Some sort of… pill? Or cream? Surely there’s something less… invasive? I truly don’t know how I’d even begin to explain this to him. It’s simply out of the question, Doctor. Truly. I apologize, but that is not an option.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Wartick. Your discomfort, and his likely reluctance, are perfectly valid concerns. I certainly wouldn’t want to push you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. Given his stoicism and his aversion to medical intervention, and without a sample for testing, it's difficult to provide a definitive diagnosis or prescribe targeted treatment. However, we can consider a broader approach. While a precise diagnosis is preferable, there are some general treatments that might provide relief if it’s a simple bacterial infection. I could prescribe a course of antibiotics, a common one used for urinary tract infections, as a first step. It's not ideal, as it's a broad approach, but it could address a potential infection. However, I must emphasize that if the symptoms persist or worsen after completing the course of antibiotics, he absolutely needs to see a physician for a proper diagnosis and targeted treatment. Would you be comfortable with trying a course of antibiotics as a first step, with the understanding that it may not address the underlying cause and further evaluation is crucial if the symptoms don't improve?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… manageable. A pill is much less intrusive. As long as it’s not something complicated. And you’re right, if it doesn’t improve, I’ll… well, I’ll have to convince him to see someone. It won’t be easy, I assure you. But a simple pill… that I can manage. What sort of side effects should I be aware of? He doesn't react well to… stomach upset. And will it interact with his brandy? He does enjoy a small glass with dinner. Please, tell me everything. I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. I’ll prescribe a course of Ciprofloxacin, a commonly used antibiotic. It's generally well-tolerated, but as you mentioned, stomach upset is a possible side effect. I recommend taking it with food to minimize this risk. If he does experience nausea or diarrhea, stopping the medication and contacting me is important. Regarding interaction with brandy, alcohol can potentially exacerbate some side effects of antibiotics, such as dizziness or drowsiness. While a small glass of brandy with dinner is unlikely to cause a severe reaction, it's best to avoid alcohol entirely during the course of the medication to be on the safe side. I’ll also provide a handout with detailed information about Ciprofloxacin, including potential side effects and precautions. The course is for 7 days, twice daily. If there’s no improvement within 3 days, or if symptoms worsen at any point, it’s crucial he sees a physician for a proper diagnosis. Do you have any questions about this, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Seven days, twice daily, with food, and no brandy. I’ll make sure he understands. And I’ll… gently encourage him to see someone if it doesn't improve. You’ve been very understanding, Doctor. I appreciate your discretion. Thank you again for your help. I feel much better now that we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wartick. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if you have any concerns or questions at any point, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. We're here to support both of you. I'll have the nurse prepare the prescription and the handout for you. Take care, and I hope he feels better soon.
