DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctor… Duplichan, is it? Yes. Well, honestly, it's all this fussing. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. She says I need to see someone. Something about… well, I don’t rightly recall. They want me to do things, and I just… don’t want to. I've lived a good long life, you know? What’s the point of poking and prodding at this stage?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Gunasekara. However, your daughter clearly has some concerns, and it’s always best to address those. Even at 83, maintaining your health is important. Perhaps if you could tell me specifically what "fussing" she's referring to, or what things she wants you to do?
PATIENT: Oh, it was a whole ordeal. Something about… tests. And then… a specialist. A foot specialist! Can you imagine? I’ve had a bit of trouble with my feet, naturally, at my age, but I’ve always managed. Rubbed them with ointment, wore sensible shoes. That sort of thing. She keeps going on about circulation and… complications. Honestly, it sounds like a waste of time and money, if you ask me. And frankly, I don’t need strangers poking around down there.
DOCTOR: So, your daughter is concerned about potential circulation issues in your feet, and has suggested tests and a consultation with a podiatrist. You’ve been managing discomfort with ointment and sensible shoes, and are hesitant about further investigation. Is that a fair summary, Ms. Gunasekara?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s… mostly it. Though she makes it sound so much worse. Like I'm on the verge of losing a leg or something dramatic. I just want to be left alone to enjoy my days. I have my garden, you see. Roses are particularly fussy, need just the right amount of sun. It’s a lot more important than worrying about… blood flow, or whatever it is. Honestly, I don't even know why she's so worked up. She always was a bit of a worrier.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate you sharing that with me, Ms. Gunasekara, dismissing concerns simply because your daughter is a "worrier" isn’t the most prudent approach. We need to determine if there is a legitimate medical issue that needs addressing. Could you describe the trouble you've been having with your feet?
PATIENT: Oh, well… it’s just a bit of aching, you know? Especially at the end of the day. And sometimes my feet feel… cold. Not terribly cold, just… cooler than they used to be. And a little bit of swelling, I suppose. But nothing drastic. I’ve always been on my feet, gardening and such. It’s probably just old age catching up with me. Honestly, I doubt poking and prodding will fix that.
DOCTOR: I see. Aching, coolness, and some swelling. And you attribute it to being on your feet and age. Has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… it’s been… gradual, I suppose. Not like one day it was fine and the next it wasn’t. It's been happening over… months, maybe even a year. It’s hard to say exactly. Things just sort of… fade into each other when you get to be my age, you know? I don’t pay much attention to dates and timelines. Just that it's been slowly getting a little bit worse. Though, it could just be my imagination.
DOCTOR: I see some notes from your primary care physician documenting similar complaints, and some concern for peripheral artery disease. Do you recall seeing him about this?
PATIENT: Peripheral… artery… disease? Oh, my. That sounds… serious. He did mention something about my circulation a while back, when he was checking my blood pressure. I barely listened, to be honest. Doctors always have so many fancy terms. I just nodded and smiled, and he moved on to the next thing. He’s a nice young man, but… well, I don’t really understand half of what he says. And frankly, I didn’t want to understand. It’s better not to dwell on things, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to dwell on medical concerns. However, peripheral artery disease, or PAD, is a condition where there’s a narrowing of the arteries reducing blood flow to your limbs, usually your legs. It can cause pain, cramping, and fatigue, as you’ve described. And, if left untreated, it can lead to serious complications. Given your age and these symptoms, it’s important to get a proper assessment. Would you allow me to conduct a brief physical exam to check the pulses in your feet and ankles?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Complications… That’s what I was afraid of. Well… a brief exam, you say? I suppose… I suppose that’s alright. As long as it doesn’t involve needles. And no poking around with sharp instruments. I have a low tolerance for… intrusions, you might say. But I don’t want to sit here all day, either. Just get it over with, quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Gunasekara. This will be quick and non-invasive. I'll simply listen for the pulses in your feet and ankles, and use the Doppler to assess blood flow. Please lie back on the exam table, if you would.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Get on with it then. But be gentle, you hear? My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. I’m going to start by listening for the pulses in your feet with my stethoscope. This won’t be uncomfortable. Okay, I’m listening to the pulse in your right ankle… it's present, but quite faint. Now let's check the left ankle… also faint. The pulses in your feet are even weaker. Now I’m going to use this Doppler to check the blood flow in your arteries. It uses sound waves and won’t hurt, but it might feel a little cool. The blood flow in both of your ankles is significantly reduced. This supports concern for peripheral artery disease. I'm going to document these findings. Given these results, I recommend further investigation to assess the extent of the disease and determine the best course of treatment. This would likely involve an ankle-brachial index, or ABI, and possibly vascular ultrasound. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Significantly reduced, you say? That doesn’t sound good at all. Ankle… brachial… index? And vascular… whatever that is? Honestly, this is just getting more complicated by the minute. I told my daughter I didn’t want any fussing. I just want to be left alone to tend to my roses. I don't know. I really don't know. Is it absolutely necessary? What are the… consequences of not doing these tests? Will it involve… surgery? Because I absolutely do not want surgery. I just want to live what little life I have left in peace.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Gunasekara, and I certainly wouldn't recommend anything unnecessary. The ankle-brachial index is a simple, non-invasive test that compares the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms. It helps us determine the severity of the blood flow reduction. The vascular ultrasound is also non-invasive and provides images of your arteries to identify any blockages. As for consequences, untreated peripheral artery disease can lead to pain, cramping, and fatigue, making it difficult to walk. In severe cases, it can increase your risk of infection, amputation, and even heart attack or stroke. Surgery is not always necessary. Many people with PAD can be effectively managed with medication and lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, controlling blood sugar and cholesterol, and exercising. If surgery is considered, it would only be after a thorough evaluation and discussion of all your options. However, without further testing, we can't accurately assess your risk or determine the best course of treatment. I highly recommend we proceed with the ABI and vascular ultrasound. If you’re still hesitant, I can also consult with a vascular specialist who can discuss your concerns in more detail. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Amputation… That's what I was afraid of. My daughter would be beside herself. I just… I just don't want any drastic measures. Consult with a specialist, you say? Perhaps… perhaps that would be best. Someone who specializes in… all this. Maybe they can explain it better, tell me what my options are without scaring me half to death. Yes. Yes, I think I'd like to consult with a specialist before we do any more tests. Can you arrange that? But no promises. I still might not want any poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Gunasekara. I completely understand. I will arrange a consultation with Dr. Ramirez, a highly respected vascular specialist in the area. I’ll have his office contact you to schedule an appointment. He will review your medical history, explain your options in detail, and answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening pain in your legs, or notice any changes in the color or temperature of your feet, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you. For not dismissing me completely, and for arranging the consultation. And for not… scaring me too badly. I suppose I should go now. I have to tend to my roses, you know. They won’t water themselves. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. Tend to your roses. And please, don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. We’re here to help. Have a good day. .
