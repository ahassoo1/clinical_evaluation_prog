DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It's...well, it's a bit difficult to explain. I feel like I need a bit of a…reset, if that makes sense. A jumpstart. I just don’t feel right. Everything feels… sluggish, you know? Not necessarily sick, just…not at my best.
DOCTOR: "Sluggish." Right. That could mean a lot of things. How long have you been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been… gradual. Probably the last six months, maybe longer? It's hard to pinpoint exactly. It started with just feeling tired a lot, even after a good night’s sleep. Then little things started feeling harder… remembering names, concentrating. It’s not debilitating, but it’s… worrisome. I’m a very active person, and this is unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Six months…okay. And what sort of activities do you usually do?
PATIENT: Well, I work with my hands a lot. I'm a molder, shaper, and caster—mostly with clay and wax, things like that. It requires a lot of focus and…energy. And before this started, I was quite good at it! I also enjoy gardening, dancing… I used to dance salsa three times a week. I've had to cut back on that, honestly. Just don’t have the…oomph for it anymore. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright, so physically demanding work and social activities. Any changes in your diet or sleep schedule around the time this started?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've always eaten pretty well – lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein. Nothing extravagant, just sensible. And my sleep… well, I try to get eight hours a night. Sometimes it's interrupted, of course, but nothing drastically different than usual. My husband says I snore a little more, maybe? But he’s always teasing me about that. I don’t know if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Snoring can be…relevant. Okay. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. Sometimes I feel a little…foggy, like my brain isn’t working quite as quickly. And occasionally, I’ll get a headache, but nothing severe. They usually go away with a little rest and some water. Oh! And I’ve been feeling… colder than usual. Not sick cold, just…chilly, even when it’s warm out. Is that strange?
DOCTOR: "Foggy," headaches, being chilly… okay. Let's get some basics. Any known allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction, not to food or anything else. I live in a pretty clean environment, and I'm careful about what I touch. I haven’t been stung by a bee or anything like that in years. My husband always asks if I'm taking my vitamins, but I do, regularly. Is there something specific I should be thinking about?
DOCTOR: Vitamins aren't a replacement for proper testing, Ms. Pitzel. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I really try to avoid medication if I can. I believe in letting my body heal itself, if possible. My husband keeps offering me something for my…well, for feeling sluggish, but I’ve refused. I just thought maybe I was working too hard, but it hasn't gotten any better.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then maybe we'll take some blood, just to rule things out. It's probably nothing, but better safe than sorry. Can you step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I understand. It's good to be thorough. I just hope it’s nothing serious. I have a lot I still want to do.
DOCTOR: 115 pounds…alright. Blood pressure is 128/80, pulse is 72. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft. Let’s get some blood work. I want a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. The nurse will draw it now.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. Thank you. A thyroid panel? Is that something you suspect? I… I don't know much about those things. Is it something serious? My mother had some health issues when she was older, but I don’t recall it being…thyroid-related.
DOCTOR: It’s standard, Ms. Pitzel. Just ruling things out. Don't jump to conclusions. We’ll get the results back in a few days and go from there. The nurse will be in shortly. Try not to worry. It’s probably just stress.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. "Stress," you say. I suppose that's possible. I have been putting in long hours at the workshop lately… But I enjoy my work. Still, I appreciate you running the tests. I'll try not to worry. Thank you for your time. I’ll wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Ms. Pitzel. We'll be in touch.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. .
