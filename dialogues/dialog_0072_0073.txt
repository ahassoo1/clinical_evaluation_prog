DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have time for all this. It’s my stomach. It’s been…well, it’s been awful. Just constantly running to the bathroom. I’ve tried everything the drugstore sells, and nothing’s working. It's been going on for nearly a week now.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a week. Almost exactly. It started last Thursday, I think. Look, I’m a painter, you know? I have things to do. I can’t just sit around waiting for…whatever this is…to go away. It's interfering with my work.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. It’s certainly disruptive when illness interferes with one’s livelihood. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this. When you say “running to the bathroom,” can you describe what’s happening when you go?
PATIENT: Ugh. What do you mean? It’s…diarrhea. A lot of it. Watery. I already told you it’s awful. Do I need to go into graphic detail? Because frankly, I don’t want to. It’s embarrassing even talking about it. And it's not just once a day. It's… frequent. Very frequent.
DOCTOR: Frequent is…how frequent, exactly?
PATIENT: Look, are we playing twenty questions here? Several times a day. Okay? More than normal. Like… every couple of hours. Sometimes more. It’s just…constant. And it’s not getting better, which is why I’m here. I’ve never had anything like this last this long before. And honestly, I don't have time for fancy tests or a long drawn-out investigation. I need something to stop it.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Woodring, I’m not attempting to be difficult. Determining the cause of your symptoms is crucial to providing appropriate treatment. Simply suppressing the symptoms without knowing the underlying issue could be…unwise. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Seriously? No. I would remember that. Look, I’m not a delicate flower. I work with paint, I’ve got a strong stomach. It’s just…a lot of water. And it’s making me weak. I haven't been eating much because I'm afraid to leave the house. So, are you going to give me something or not? I’ve got a deadline, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain along with this diarrhea?
PATIENT: No fever. Maybe a little queasy sometimes, but I wouldn’t call it vomiting. And my stomach…it cramps a bit. Not terrible. It’s just…uncomfortable. Honestly, I think it’s from being so dehydrated. I keep trying to drink water, but it just…goes right through me. Is that helpful? Or are you going to keep asking me a million questions?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: What do you think I do, spend my days in and out of hospitals? I’ve always been healthy. I mean, I had the usual childhood stuff, but nothing serious. No chronic conditions. I don’t take any medications regularly. Widowed, as you can see on the chart, but my husband was healthy too. Look, I'm a very practical person, and I don't believe in dwelling on the past. Is this getting us anywhere?
DOCTOR: Very well. Any recent travel?
PATIENT: Travel? No. I haven't left the state in years. I work locally. I haven’t got time for vacations. Besides, I just told you, I'm trying to meet a deadline. What kind of questions are these? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I just want something to make it stop. I'm starting to feel a little faint, actually. Can we please just get to the point?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. Lie back on the examination table, please. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and do a quick palpation. Your abdomen is tender to the touch, particularly in the lower quadrants. Bowel sounds are…hyperactive. No rebound tenderness, no guarding. Given your symptoms and the physical findings, it appears you’re experiencing acute gastroenteritis. However, given the duration and frequency, we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Gastro...what? Look, I don’t speak doctor. Does that mean I have a bug? And what "other possibilities"? Are you thinking I have something serious? Because if you are, you should have asked me these questions first! This is all very unsettling. I just want a simple solution. A pill, something, to stop the… everything. Can you give me something now, or do I need to go to a different doctor?
DOCTOR: Gastroenteritis simply means an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, often caused by a viral or bacterial infection. It's what most people refer to as a "stomach bug." While often self-limiting, the duration of your symptoms warrants further investigation. I’m going to order a stool sample to rule out any bacterial pathogens, and a complete blood count to assess for dehydration and inflammation. I’m also going to want to check your electrolytes. While I can prescribe an anti-diarrheal medication to provide some symptomatic relief, it’s important to identify the underlying cause. In the meantime, I recommend a bland diet - BRAT diet – bananas, rice, applesauce, toast - and continue to hydrate with small, frequent sips of fluids. Do you understand?
PATIENT: BRAT diet? My grandmother used to tell me about that. Honestly. A stool sample? Fine. Whatever it takes to get this over with. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just something I ate. I really don't have time for all this testing. Yes, I understand. Bananas, rice... I can manage that. Just please, get me something to stop it. Now. And can I get a note for work? I need to explain why I’ve been…indisposed. And hurry, please. I'm losing valuable work time.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m prescribing you loperamide, two capsules initially, then one capsule after each loose stool, not to exceed eight capsules in a 24-hour period. Here is your prescription. And here is a note for your employer, excusing you from work for the past week and recommending a limited work schedule for the next few days. The lab results will take approximately 48 to 72 hours. If your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just…thank you. I suppose. Hopefully, this stuff works. And quickly. I really need to get back to work. I think that’s everything. Can I go now? I appreciate your time, Doctor. Though, frankly, it felt like an awful lot of fuss about a stomach ache. .
