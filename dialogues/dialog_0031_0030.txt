DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a little embarrassing to talk about, but I’ve noticed a change in my body odor lately. It just… doesn’t smell like me, you know? It’s different. I haven’t changed anything – soaps, deodorant, nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Purtee. It's perfectly alright to discuss these things – it's important to address any changes you notice in your body. And it’s good you haven’t changed any products, that helps us narrow things down. Could you describe the change in odor a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a tough one. It's... not bad, exactly. It’s just… sweeter, I think? And maybe a little stronger than usual. Not like BO, not like sweat, just… different. It's hard to explain. I used to just smell… clean. Now it’s like something else is mixed in. I noticed it about a week ago, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Okay, "sweeter" and "stronger," and noticed it for about a week. That is helpful. And you haven’t experienced any fever, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss along with this change?
PATIENT: No, no fever or night sweats. And my weight has been pretty steady. I haven't lost or gained anything noticeable. I check it every few weeks, just to keep track. It’s usually around 134, give or take a pound or two. I haven't been feeling sick, either – no cough, no aches, just this smell.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat pretty much the same things I always do. Lots of vegetables, some chicken and fish, rice… I try to keep it healthy. I did have a mango a few times last week, but I eat mango sometimes in the summer. It wasn't like a ton of mango, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's good information. It's unlikely to be the mango, but we’ll keep everything in consideration. Now, could you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… let's see. I had pneumonia when I was a kid, a really bad case. And I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. Other than that… not much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I do have Medicare, that's why I came here. I get a yearly check-up, but they didn’t notice anything unusual last time. I was divorced about five years ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee. Pneumonia as a child and gallbladder removal ten years ago – good to know. And no, your marital status doesn't directly impact this, but thank you for mentioning it. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I've tried a bunch of different medications over the years for headaches and stuff, but nothing ever bothered me. I eat all sorts of things, too – seafood, nuts, everything. My mom always said I had an iron stomach!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can help it. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's it. Just the basic one, you know? Nothing special. I really don't like taking medications unless I absolutely have to. I prefer just feeling well on my own.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Just a multivitamin occasionally. Now, just to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tricky one. My mom had high blood pressure, and she was diabetic. My dad… he passed away when I was young, so I don't know much about his medical history. He died of a heart attack, I think, but it was a long time ago. I have a sister, and she's healthy as a horse. No known problems. I don't know much about their families beyond that, if that makes sense. We weren't very close.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Purtee. Knowing about your mother's history of high blood pressure and diabetes, and your father's heart attack is helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, I work as a floor layer, so it’s pretty physical. Lots of bending and kneeling and lifting. It keeps me moving, that's for sure. I live alone, so I do most things myself. I try to eat healthy, like I said. I don't smoke, and I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month. I walk when I can, but my job is pretty demanding, so I'm usually pretty tired after work. I don’t really have a lot of free time for hobbies or anything. Mostly just relaxing at home.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee. That gives me a good sense of your overall health and lifestyle. I'd like to perform a brief physical exam if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just do a quick general assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit back and relax. First, I’ll check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is regular and strong, no murmurs noted. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I’m not detecting any wheezing or crackles. I’m also going to quickly examine your skin. Your skin appears normal, no rashes or unusual findings. There are no areas of increased sweating that I can detect. Based on this preliminary exam, everything appears normal. However, a change in body odor, especially one that is new and unexplained, can sometimes be a sign of underlying metabolic changes. To rule out any potential issues, I’d like to order some blood work. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood work seems like a good idea if that's what you think. I trust your professional opinion, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. So, yes, please go ahead and order whatever tests you need. Is it going to be a lot of blood? I don’t love needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles, Ms. Purtee. We’ll only take what's necessary. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. That should give us a good overview of your overall health and help rule out any underlying causes for the change in odor. It will be a standard amount of blood, a few vials. I’ll have the lab draw the samples today. They’ll send the results to me, and I’ll review them as soon as they’re available, typically within a few days. I'll then contact you to discuss the results and any necessary follow-up. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. A few vials is manageable. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It makes me feel a lot better knowing we're taking this seriously and trying to figure it out. So, yes, let's get the blood work done. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for it? Fasting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Purtee. I’m glad I could reassure you. For the comprehensive metabolic panel, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, other than water, during that time. The other tests don’t require fasting. So, if you can schedule the blood draw first thing in the morning after fasting overnight, that would be ideal. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They’ll be expecting you. Once they’ve completed the draw, you are free to eat and resume your normal activities. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything really well, Doctor. No questions at the moment. Just looking forward to getting the tests done and hopefully figuring out what’s going on. Thank you so much for your time and attention. I feel a lot better now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Purtee. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Here’s a copy of the lab order and instructions for the fasting. Have a good day, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye.
