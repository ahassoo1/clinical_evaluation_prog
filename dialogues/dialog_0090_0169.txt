DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my face and legs, mostly. They’re puffin’ up. Been happenin’ for a bit now, I reckon. Not sure exactly when it started, to be honest. Things just… swell, you know? It's a nuisance, more than anything.
DOCTOR: “Puffin’ up,” you say. Right. And you’re noticing this swelling… where exactly on your face, and on your legs?
PATIENT: Well, on my face… all over, really. Cheeks mostly, I think. Hard to say. And my legs… ankles, shins, all the way up to my knees, maybe. It comes and goes, see? Some days it’s barely there, other days… feels like balloons. I don’t pay that much attention, truth be told. Never been one for fussin’ over nothin’. Is it somethin’ serious, Doctor? Because I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: “Things to do,” yes, I understand. It’s good you came in, even if it is a nuisance. When you say it comes and goes, can you tell me roughly how often it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Roughly…? Hmm. That’s a tough one. A couple of days good, maybe a day or two bad. Then good again. Honestly, it's hard to keep track. I ain’t one for calendars or nothin’. I just notice it when my boots feel tight, or when my wife… well, used to comment on my face lookin’ funny. It's been a while, though. It’s just… there sometimes. Does that make any sense? I don't really know what I'm supposed to be tellin’ ya.
DOCTOR: It… does, to a degree. And it’s alright if you’re not sure, Mr. Miner. We’ll figure it out. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think. Not really. I get a little tired, maybe? But I’m nearly sixty, Doctor. Tired comes with the territory, don’t ya think? And my appetite's been a bit off, but… well, I just haven’t been hungry, see? Not like it used to be. It’s hard to pinpoint anything specific. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Not much goes on up here anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? Well, my wife passed away last year. That was… a change. Big one. Aside from that… not much. Same routine for years. Work, come home, watch the telly. Tried gardening for a bit, but my back ain’t what it used to be. Nothing exciting, that’s for sure. It’s been quiet, that's what it’s been. Too quiet, maybe. I don’t know. Why do you ask? Is it about the swelling?
DOCTOR: It can be about the swelling, Mr. Miner. Grief can certainly affect the body in various ways, and changes in routine can as well. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, kidney issues…?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no, never. Heart problems… the doctor said my ticker was a little weak years ago, but he just told me to lay off the bacon. Never really bothered with it much. Kidney issues… not that I know of. I’ve never been a sick man, Doctor. Mostly just aches and pains, the usual stuff. And a bad back, as I mentioned. Never been much for doctors, to be honest. Just fix what’s broke and get on with it, that's my motto. I don’t need a lot of fancy names for things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Had my appendix out when I was a lad, I suppose. And… oh, and I had a bit of skin cancer removed off my nose a few years back. Nothing major, just a little snip. That’s about it, I reckon. No big operations or nothin'. Mostly just patched up here and there, the way you get when you work with metal all your life. You cut yourself a few times, you get patched up. That's how it is.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications…? Not much. Just a couple of aspirin now and again for my back, if it’s really botherin’ me. And sometimes a bit of cream for my skin where they took the cancer out, to stop it gettin’ itchy. That’s it, really. Never been one for pills. Don’t like the way they make you feel. A bit of hard work and a good night’s sleep is what I believe in.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Nah, not that I know of. Never been allergic to anything in my life. Maybe a bit of a sniffle with dust, but everyone gets that, don't they? Never had a proper reaction to anything. I’m a pretty hardy Swede, Doctor. Built tough. We don’t have time for allergies, too much work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Miner, I’m going to need to examine you. If you don’t mind. Can you lie down on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Lie down, eh? Alright, alright. Don't mind. Though I warn ya, Doctor, I ain't the most flexible fella anymore. It might be a bit of a struggle. Just let me know if you need me to hoist myself up or somethin’. My back ain’t been right all mornin’.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take a look. Hmmm. The swelling is…pitting edema, meaning it leaves an indentation when I press on it. See?
PATIENT: Pitting… what now? Edema? Oh, yeah, I see what you mean. Leaves a little dent, doesn't it? Never knew that had a name. Always just thought it was puffiness, like a balloon fillin' with air. Is that bad, Doctor? Is that what's wrong with me? I’ve got things to do, ya know. I need to get back to work. Is it somethin' I can just rub some ointment on, or what?
DOCTOR: It’s… not necessarily something you can just rub ointment on, Mr. Miner. Edema can be a sign of several things – heart problems, kidney issues, even liver problems. It can also be caused by poor circulation, or simply prolonged standing. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Heart and lungs, eh? Alright, alright. Just tryin’ to keep up here, Doctor. Always been a bit of a smoker, ya know. Not as much now, but… well, it’s hard to kick a habit after all these years. Is everything alright in there? Is my ticker tickin’ like a clock, or is it all wonky? Don't tell me I need a fancy operation, 'cause I ain't one for hospitals.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… a little irregular, Mr. Miner. Not dramatically so, but enough that I’d like to order an EKG to get a better reading. And I want to order some blood work - a complete metabolic panel and a kidney function test. We need to rule out some of the more serious possibilities. And I’d like to check your urine for protein.
PATIENT: EKG… blood work… urine…? Now hold on just a minute, Doctor. That sounds like a whole heap of fuss for a bit of puffiness. I just thought it was my legs swellin’ up a bit! Is it really that serious? Can't you just give me somethin’ for the swelling? A water pill, maybe? I got work to do, ya know. I can’t be spendin’ all day in a hospital gettin’ poked and prodded. I just want to get back to normal. Is this gonna cost me a fortune? I ain’t got insurance, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, I understand your concerns. But ignoring this swelling won't make it go away, and it could be a sign of something serious. We need to rule out potential heart problems, kidney issues, and other underlying conditions. I know you don't have insurance, and we can discuss options for affordable testing. This hospital has financial assistance programs, and we'll do everything we can to make it manageable. But I can't, in good conscience, just prescribe you a water pill without knowing why you're swelling. That could mask a serious problem and delay proper treatment. We'll start with the blood work and EKG. Then we’ll go from there. Do you agree to that?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. You’re right, I suppose. Can't just ignore it. But… it's all so much fuss. And I really don't like needles. And the cost… well, let’s just hope it don't bankrupt me. Financial assistance, you say? Alright, I'll trust ya on that. Just… just get it over with quickly, please. And try not to poke me too hard. Where do we start? Is it gonna hurt?
DOCTOR: It won't be pleasant, Mr. Miner, but it will be quick. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. We’ll get the EKG done right here in the room as well. It just involves sticking a few small patches on your chest. Let me print out a requisition form for the blood work and a note explaining the EKG. I'll also have my nurse, Sarah, come in and explain the process to you in more detail and answer any questions you have. She's very good, and she’ll make sure you’re comfortable. Is there anyone you'd like us to contact?
PATIENT: Contact…? No, no one. Just me. Lost my wife last year, as I mentioned. No family close by. Always been a bit of a loner, truth be told. Just… just get it done, Doctor. I ain't one for complainin’, but… it’s just a bit much, all this fuss. And try not to make a big deal out of it, will ya? I don't need everyone knowin’ my business. Just… just fix what’s broke, and let me get back to my life. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. We will. We’ll do everything we can to make this as quick and comfortable as possible, and we absolutely respect your privacy. I’ll leave you to get comfortable, and Sarah will be in shortly. Don't hesitate to call out if you feel unwell at any point.
