DOCTOR: Hi Triana, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s…it’s my stomach. Been having problems for weeks now. Just…diarrhea. Non-stop. I’ve tried everything the pharmacy suggested, and it’s not getting better. Honestly, I’m starting to get really annoyed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weeks of diarrhea is definitely not fun, and it's good you're getting it checked out. Let's try and figure out what's going on. When you say "weeks," can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics. Fine. Probably…close to a month now? Maybe a little more? It started right after that cruise I took with my husband, before… well, you know. It was supposed to be relaxing. It hasn’t been. And honestly, I don’t even remember exactly when it started. Does it matter? It's just…bad.
DOCTOR: It does matter a little, but don't worry, we'll get there. A month is helpful to know. And the cruise timing is very useful information, actually. Okay, so about a month ago, shortly after a cruise. Can you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean describe it? It's…watery. A lot of it. Several times a day. Look, I’m not going to get into details with a stranger, okay? It's unpleasant, it's embarrassing, and it’s not stopping. Is that enough detail for you? It makes leaving the house a nightmare, which is already… difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand it's unpleasant to talk about, and I apologize for pushing. “Several times a day” and “watery” is good. We don’t need a lot of detail if you’re uncomfortable. Has there been any blood or mucus in the stool?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven’t looked closely. I just…deal with it. You expect me to examine my…waste? No, thank you. I'm a painter, not a…a stool inspector. I can tell you it's not normal, that's all. Everything feels…off. I just want it to stop, and I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No, you absolutely don't have to examine anything if you don’t want to. “Not normal” is helpful. When you say “everything feels off,” can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Look, I'm tired, okay? Everything just feels…weak. I have no energy. I’ve lost weight, I think, though I haven’t bothered to weigh myself. My appetite is gone. I just feel… drained. And I get cramps, obviously, with…all of this. It’s just awful. It's like my body is fighting something and losing. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Triana. Weakness, weight loss, loss of appetite, and cramps – those are all important symptoms. Roughly how much weight do you think you’ve lost, even if it’s just a guess?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. I used to be…comfortable. Now, my clothes are just hanging off me. Maybe ten pounds? Fifteen? It’s hard to say, I really don't pay attention to that stuff. I'm just…smaller. It's enough to notice, which is something for me. I don't want to be weak and frail. I need to be able to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, ten to fifteen pounds is a significant amount of weight loss over a month. And the fatigue is concerning. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. I mean, the usual childhood stuff. But nothing major. I broke my arm once, but that was ages ago. And my husband… well, he had some heart trouble, but that's not relevant, is it? I'm a healthy person. Was a healthy person. This is new. I don’t understand what’s happening to me.
DOCTOR: No, your husband’s health history isn’t directly relevant right now, but thank you for mentioning it. Okay, no major illnesses or surgeries – that’s good to know. Any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Look, I told you, I was healthy. I paint houses for a living. You need to be in decent shape to do that. I don't sit around with chronic conditions. I eat…reasonably well. I'm not a saint, but I don't eat junk food all day. I just…feel awful now, and frankly, I'm getting impatient with all of these questions. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. You're healthy, normally, and this is a recent change. That's very helpful. Let me ask about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just…the stuff I bought at the pharmacy for this, obviously. Anti-diarrheal pills. And…I think some gas relief tablets. It hasn’t helped, clearly. And I take a multivitamin sometimes, when I remember. But that’s it. I don’t like taking pills. It just feels like… admitting defeat, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, so anti-diarrheals, gas relief tablets, and an occasional multivitamin. And no allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Look, I haven’t had that much medical experience. I don’t go around collecting allergies. I just want to be fixed. This is ridiculous. Are you going to actually do something, or are you just going to keep asking questions? I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration and I apologize if I’m being slow. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I just want to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It’ll just take a few minutes. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. Yes, actually. It hurts… a little. There. Right… there. And a bit… all over, really. It's not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like everything is… stretched. Can we please be done soon? I’m starting to feel lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting the tenderness. It’s diffuse, as you described, across your abdomen. I’m also noting your voice sounds slightly strained. I want to check your blood pressure and pulse quickly just to be safe. Your blood pressure is a little low at 90/60, and your pulse is 98. This, combined with the lightheadedness, is concerning. I am going to order some blood work to check for dehydration, infection, and inflammation. I also want to order a stool sample to rule out any parasites or bacteria. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just…do it quickly. And explain what this is going to cost me. I don't need any surprises. And honestly, I’m really starting to worry now. What's wrong with me? This isn't just a bad stomach bug, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern, and I'll be as clear as possible. The cost will depend on your insurance coverage, but I will have the billing department give you an estimate before proceeding with anything. We’ll get that sorted out. As for what’s going on, it’s too early to say definitively. The tests will help us rule out several possibilities. Given your symptoms of prolonged diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal tenderness, and now slightly low blood pressure and pulse, we need to consider things like inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or a chronic infection. However, it's also possible it is a severe or prolonged infection, and we need to rule that out first. I don't want to alarm you, but it's best to be thorough. I'm going to have the nurse draw your blood and give you a container for the stool sample. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible, and then we'll discuss a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. I want to go home. And make sure this nurse is gentle. I hate needles. Honestly, this whole thing is just awful. I’m really starting to regret coming in. I should have just tried to tough it out. .
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. I will personally ensure the nurse is very gentle. I will also explain to her about your concerns. I agree, the sooner we get the results, the sooner we can figure out a plan. I will be right back to discuss everything with you once the nurse is done. Please let me know if you need anything at all.
