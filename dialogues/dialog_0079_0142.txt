DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, right. It’s these headaches, see. They come on pretty strong, and I get really sweaty when they do. And my heart… it kinda races. It’s been happening on and off for a while now, but it's been worse lately, I think. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur, trying to remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Headaches with sweating and a racing heart… I see. And you say this has been occurring “on and off for a while”?
PATIENT: Yeah, on and off. It’s not… constant, thankfully. More like… episodes, I guess? They’ll hit me, I’ll feel awful for a few hours, then it’ll be fine for a bit. Then, bam, another one. It's hard to pin down a pattern, though. Sorry, I'm not very good at explaining it. I don't really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Episodes, alright. And when you say “awful,” could you be a little more specific about the nature of these headaches?
PATIENT: Right, yeah, specific… Okay. It’s… a throbbing, mostly. Right behind my eyes, and kinda in my temples. Like a really bad pressure. And everything gets… brighter, you know? Light just feels… too much. Sometimes I get a bit nauseous too, but I haven’t actually been sick. It just feels like I might be. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Throbbing headache, primarily behind the eyes and temples, with photophobia and nausea…Yes, that’s helpful. Do these headaches occur with any particular triggers that you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Triggers… Hmm. That’s a tough one. I honestly haven't noticed anything specific. I work in a factory, so it can be noisy and a bit stressful sometimes, but it happens on days off too. I've tried thinking about it, but… nothing jumps out. I drink coffee, but not loads. And I eat… regular stuff, I guess? I really don’t know. It feels pretty random. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Random occurrences can be… difficult to assess. Let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Lawther?
PATIENT: Medications? No, not really. I haven't been to the doctor in ages, to be honest. I usually just… try to ride it out, you know? Paracetamol maybe, if it's really bad, but I don't take anything regularly. I’m not much of a pill person.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Mr. Lawther?
PATIENT: Uh… allergies. I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a bit of hay fever in the summer, but nothing serious. Nothing I need to worry about when it comes to pills or anything. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No known drug allergies, seasonal allergies only. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Past medical history… That’s a good question. To be honest, I haven't really been diagnosed with much. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football, but that healed fine. I get the usual colds and flu, I guess. Nothing major. I think that’s it, really. I’m usually pretty healthy, or I was. Before these headaches, anyway. I just… don't go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, not that I remember. Definitely nothing planned. I've been lucky, I guess. Never needed anything like that. Unless… did getting my wisdom teeth out count? That was ages ago, though. And it was just local anesthetic, I think. Not a proper surgery.
DOCTOR: No significant surgical history reported. Now, family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That’s another tricky one. My dad had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother… she had something with her heart, maybe? It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about it much. I’m not very close to my family, so I don’t know a lot of the details. Sorry. It’s probably not very helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Lawther. We work with what we have. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Right. Well, I work in a factory, like I said. Long hours, pretty physical job. I'm divorced, been a few years now. Don’t have any kids. I… don't really have many hobbies, to be honest. I watch TV sometimes. And I drink… socially. A few pints with mates on a Friday, nothing too crazy. I don’t smoke. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's perform a quick physical examination. I’m going to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Sounds good. I’m a bit nervous about all this, but I trust you. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable or anything.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is elevated at 148/92. Pulse is 88 and regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds… normal S1 and S2, no murmurs auscultated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Cranial nerves are intact. No focal neurological deficits noted. No tenderness to palpation. Your blood pressure is somewhat elevated, Mr. Lawther, and given your reported symptoms of headache, sweating, and palpitations, I’m concerned about the possibility of hypertension or another underlying cardiovascular issue. I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an electrocardiogram, to further evaluate your condition. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yeah, okay. Sounds… serious. Is it something really bad? I mean, I just thought it was stress or something. I'm happy to get the tests done if you think it's important. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just… let me know what’s going on, okay? I don’t really understand all this medical stuff.
DOCTOR: It is best to be thorough, Mr. Lawther. While it may be nothing serious, these tests will help us rule out potential causes for your symptoms. We’ll assess your kidney function, electrolyte balance, and examine your heart’s electrical activity. I will also obtain an echocardiogram to visualize the structure of your heart. While we await the results, I recommend that you monitor your blood pressure at home, if possible, and avoid strenuous activity. I will provide you with a referral to a cardiologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Cardiologist… right. That sounds… a bit scary. Okay. Uh… how long will the tests take? And… will I feel alright while I’m waiting for the results? I have to go back to work, you know. I don’t really want to lose my job. And… what if it is something bad? I'm sorry, I’m just a bit overwhelmed. Is it okay if I bring someone with me when I get the results?
DOCTOR: The tests themselves will take only a short amount of time, Mr. Lawther—perhaps an hour or so. As for how you will feel, it's difficult to say definitively. Some patients experience no symptoms while awaiting results, while others may feel anxious. It's essential to maintain a calm demeanor and to inform me of any changes in your condition. I understand your concerns about work. I will provide a note for your employer outlining the need for these tests and any potential restrictions. Regarding the possibility of a serious diagnosis… it is prudent to prepare for all eventualities, but it is also important not to catastrophize. We will discuss the results thoroughly, and I will guide you through any necessary treatment options. Yes, you may absolutely bring someone with you when you receive the results. It’s often helpful to have a support person present. Do you have any other questions I can address at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… reassuring, I think. Not the best news, but… okay. Um… how much will all this cost? I don’t have insurance, so I’m a bit worried about the bill. I'm on a pretty tight budget. Is there any way to make it cheaper? I really appreciate you writing a note for work, that's a big help. .
DOCTOR: That is a valid concern, Mr. Lawther, and unfortunately, a common one. As you are uninsured, the cost of these tests can be substantial. I will be honest, I cannot provide an exact figure at this time, as it will depend on the specific facility and the complexity of the procedures. However, I can arrange for you to be seen at a facility that offers a financial assistance program. I will also explore any available charitable organizations that may assist with the cost of care. I will have my staff contact you with details regarding these options. In the meantime, it is essential that you prioritize your health, even if it means incurring some financial burden. We will do everything we can to mitigate the cost. I've completed the referral orders and the note for your employer. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
