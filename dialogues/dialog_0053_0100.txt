DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Hmm... let me see. Right, the nice lady on the phone said something about a check-up? A screening, she called it. Something to do with… well, I can't quite recall. It's just… paperwork, I think? My memory ain't what it used to be, you know. It's been a while since I've had to do things like this.
DOCTOR: A screening, yes. Medicare does recommend certain preventative screenings for patients your age. It sounds like they scheduled you for a general health assessment, which is good. But to make sure we cover everything properly, can you tell me if there's anything specific you've been concerned about?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh dear. No, not really. I mean, I get a little tired, working with all that heavy equipment and all… but that's just… old age, I suppose. And my knees ache sometimes. But that’s been going on for years. Honestly, I mostly just try to keep busy. Is this about… drugs? The lady on the phone mentioned something about that, but I didn't quite understand. I don't… do anything like that, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hughston, this isn’t about… recreational drug use. It’s standard to ask about those things as part of a complete health assessment, but it sounds like that isn’t relevant for you. We're just trying to get a baseline of your overall health. You mentioned tiredness and knee pain. Let’s start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling tired?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while, now. It comes and goes, you know? Some days I feel alright, and other days… well, I just feel worn out. It’s hard to say exactly how long. Maybe… a few months? It’s been worse lately, I think, with the heat. Working in the sun all day really takes it out of you. I usually just drink a lot of water and try to rest when I can. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A few months, worse with the heat. Alright. And this tiredness… does it interfere with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sometimes. Not every day, mind you. But some days it's hard to even get out of bed. And when I am working… well, I have to take more breaks than I used to. I used to be able to just power through, but now… I just get worn out quicker. It's a little embarrassing, to be honest. I don't want to slow the crew down.
DOCTOR: I understand. And when you say “worn out,” can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, it’s not exactly painful, you know? It’s more like… everything feels heavy. My arms, my legs, even my eyelids. Like I’m dragging myself through mud. And I get… foggy. Like I can’t think straight. It’s hard to explain. It just… takes a lot of effort to do anything. And then it just… goes away, usually after a good night’s sleep. But it keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: Alright. Foggy, heavy limbs, comes and goes. Now, let’s talk about these knees. You said the pain has been going on for years. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes, Doctor. It’s worse when it’s cold, or when I’ve been on my feet all day. And… well, after I’ve been sitting for a while, too. It’s a little stiff when I first get up. But usually it loosens up after I move around a bit. It’s not… debilitating, you know? I can still work. But it’s… a constant ache, really. Just… always there, in the background.
DOCTOR: Constant ache, worse with cold and inactivity. Alright. Now, have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I don't think so, not usually. Sometimes they feel a little… bigger, maybe, after a long day. But I always figured that was just from working so hard. I haven't noticed any redness, no. I usually just put some cream on them, and it helps a little. It’s just… old age, I suppose. Everything aches when you get older, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. No swelling or redness. Now, let’s move on to other things. Have you been experiencing any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s a good question. Hmm… I think I’ve lost a little weight, maybe? I haven't really been keeping track. I eat when I’m hungry, and I don't eat when I’m not. I’m not much of a cook, you know? Mostly just sandwiches and soup. I haven’t noticed a big change, though. It’s just… things don’t taste as good as they used to, maybe? But that could just be getting older, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Possible slight weight loss, decreased appetite. Now, have you had any problems with your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sometimes. Not every night, mind you. But I wake up a lot. I toss and turn, and I can’t seem to get comfortable. And sometimes I just… lie awake for hours, staring at the ceiling. It’s mostly just my mind racing, I think. Worrying about things. It’s hard to explain. But I don’t… I don’t sleep as soundly as I used to, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Worrying about things. Alright. And what sorts of things are you worrying about, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, everything, really. Just… life, you know? Being alone, mostly. My husband… he passed away a few years ago. And it’s just… quiet now. Too quiet. And I worry about my job, too. I don’t want to slow the crew down, like I said. And I worry about… well, everything just seems so uncertain these days. It’s hard to explain. I just… miss having someone to talk to, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Loss of spouse, general anxiety. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh dear, let me see. That's a tough one. The doctor… the one before Dr. Pitmon… he said my blood pressure was a little high once, years ago. He put me on some pills, but I stopped taking them after a while. I didn’t feel any different. And I think… I think I had a little bit of arthritis, in my hands. But it wasn’t anything serious. Mostly just a little stiffness. I don't really remember much else, to be honest. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me take a look at your records here... It appears you were diagnosed with hypertension approximately seven years ago, and briefly treated with hydrochlorothiazide, but discontinued due to… “patient preference,” it says here. And there’s a note of mild osteoarthritis in the hands, confirmed with X-ray. Anything else you recall about past surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You’ve got good memory, Doctor! Yes, I remember the pills. They didn't seem to do much, and I didn’t like taking them. And the arthritis… it was just in my fingers, mostly. It didn't bother me too much, so I didn't really worry about it. As for surgeries… hmm. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… and I broke my arm once, when I was riding my bicycle. But that was a long time ago. I don’t think I’ve been hospitalized for anything else.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy in childhood, fractured arm… alright. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s… difficult. My mother… she had a bad heart, I think. She passed away when I was young. And my father… he had… something with his lungs. He smoked a lot, you know? But I don’t really know much else. We didn't talk about those things much. It was a different time, you know? People didn't really talk about their illnesses. I have a sister, but we haven't spoken in years. I don't know anything about her medical history.
DOCTOR: Alright. Maternal history of heart disease, paternal history of lung disease, limited information available. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not! I never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband… he used to smoke a little, but I always told him it was bad for his health. And I don’t drink alcohol, either. Never really liked the taste. And recreational drugs… oh, my goodness, no! I'm a simple woman, Doctor. I just like to work hard and keep busy. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. No, not really. Just… sometimes I take some ibuprofen for my knees, when they’re really aching. And… and I take a little bit of vitamin D, during the winter months. But that’s about it. Nothing else, really. Just the ibuprofen and the vitamin D. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen PRN for knee pain, vitamin D supplement. Okay, Ms. Hughston, I’ve got a pretty good picture of your health history now. I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Just need you to hop up on the examination table for me. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need. It's a little high, you know? Getting up and down isn’t as easy as it used to be. But I'll manage. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just take your time. Okay, let’s see… 148 over 88. A little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Nothing alarming at this point. Lungs are clear. Some crepitus in both knees, tenderness to palpation on the medial joint line. Range of motion is… limited. Alright. Everything seems consistent with osteoarthritis and mild hypertension. I’d like to order some blood work, including a CBC, CMP, thyroid panel, and vitamin D level, just to get a baseline. And I want to get an X-ray of your knees to assess the severity of the arthritis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that's… a lot of tests. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, that sounds alright. I trust your judgment. As long as it helps figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just… let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable, okay? My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. The blood work is just a simple draw, and the X-ray shouldn't be too uncomfortable. We'll just need you to stand still for a few moments. The lab and radiology departments will contact you to schedule the appointments. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a low-dose NSAID to help with the knee pain, and I recommend continuing the vitamin D supplement. This is naproxen, 250mg twice daily with food. We'll review the results when they come back and discuss a long-term management plan. We can also consider physical therapy if the pain doesn't improve. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… alright, Doctor. Naproxen, twice a day… I’ll try to remember that. Physical therapy… hmm. That sounds… good, actually. I haven’t done that in years, but if it helps, then I’m willing to try anything. When do you think I’ll get the results back? I don’t want to keep waiting around too long, you know? Just want to get things sorted out.
DOCTOR: The lab results usually come back within 3-5 business days, and the X-ray report should be available within a similar timeframe. The lab and radiology departments will contact you directly to schedule any follow-up appointments, or you can call them directly if you prefer. I’ll also have my nurse follow up with you in a week to check in and see how you’re doing with the naproxen. Now, do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I think that’s… everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s nice to finally have someone looking into what’s going on. Just… try to remember everything, okay? All the tests and the pills… it’s a lot to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hughston. My nurse will be in touch to help with that. She’ll make sure you have all the information you need. If anything changes or you have any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here, let me help you with that. Have a good day, Ms. Hughston. And please, try not to worry too much. We'll get this sorted out.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you. You too. And… thank you again. .
