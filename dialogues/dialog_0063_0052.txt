DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Benic. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s get straight to the point, shall we?
PATIENT: Aye, good afternoon to ye as well, Doctor. And please, call me Aurthur. Right, straight to the point suits me fine. It's this mornin' sickness that’s got me a bit bothered, ye see. It's not like... well, not like what folks expect, if ye ken what I mean.
DOCTOR: “Mornin’ sickness,” you say?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s what I’ve been callin’ it. It only happens in the mornin', usually. Nausea, mostly. And a wee bit of... well, I wouldn’t say sick, exactly. More like a heave. It's been goin' on for... oh, about a week now, maybe a bit longer. It's just… unusual for me, seein’ as how I haven’t had anything like this in years, and… well, the heart troubles, they make ye worry, don't they?
DOCTOR: Heart troubles, you say?
PATIENT: Aye. Diagnosed with heart failure, oh, must be five years ago now. I take my tablets regular as clockwork, mind ye. Doctor MacIntyre, back in Inverness, he’s the one who put me on ‘em. He moved away, sadly. That’s why I'm seein’ ye, Doctor. I thought it best to get it checked, this mornin’ sickness, just in case it's somethin' to do with the heart. I don’t want to be a bother, but it’s unsettling, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Right. And what medications precisely are you taking for this heart failure?
PATIENT: Och, that’s a good question. Let me think... I’ve got the pills here, thankfully. ... Right, there's Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And… Furosemide, 40 milligrams, also once a day. And… Digoxin, 0.125 milligrams, that's taken every other day. Aye, those are the ones I remember. I take ‘em with my breakfast, every mornin'. Unless I'm feelin' particularly poorly, then I try to get 'em down with a biscuit or somethin'. Does that cover it, Doctor? I’m a bit forgetful sometimes, so I could be missin’ somethin’.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms besides this nausea?
PATIENT: Aye, now that ye mention it… I’ve been a wee bit breathless lately, mind ye. Not terrible, just… more effort than usual when I’m walkin’ up the hill to the shops. And my ankles… they swell up a bit at the end of the day. I just put it down to the heat, truth be told. It’s been a warm summer. But… now that ye ask, maybe it’s more than just the heat. And… oh, I’ve also been feelin’ a bit tired, a bit run down. But who doesn’t these days, eh? It’s hard to say what’s normal and what’s not, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a listen. … Your heart rate is a bit elevated, and I do detect some congestion in your lungs. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Och, aye, I have, actually. I've been weighin' myself a wee bit more often since this started, just to keep an eye on things. And I've put on a few pounds, I reckon. Maybe five or six in the past week or so. I hadn’t mentioned it, thinkin’ it was just a bit of indulgence, a bit of extra pudding now and then. But now ye say that… maybe it's somethin’ more serious. I'm usually pretty steady with my weight, ye see. It's a bit worryin', this all is.
DOCTOR: Right. Based on what you’ve told me, and my brief examination, it appears your heart failure may be… exacerbated. The weight gain, the swelling, the increased shortness of breath, and now this nausea… it all points in that direction. We need to adjust your medication. I'll increase your Furosemide dosage temporarily. I'm also going to recommend a low-sodium diet, strictly adhered to.
PATIENT: Aye, that makes sense, I suppose. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I’ll do my best with the diet, though I do love a bit of salt on my potatoes. And the Furosemide, ye say? Will that help with the nausea, do ye think? I'm just a wee bit concerned, seein’ as how it’s been comin’ on so suddenly. I’m usually quite good at managin’ this heart, with the tablets and all. Is there anything else I should be lookin’ out for, anythin’ that would mean I need to come back in sooner?
DOCTOR: The increased Furosemide should help reduce the fluid retention, which may alleviate the nausea. However, it’s likely a symptom of the overall heart failure exacerbation, so I cannot guarantee it. If you experience any significant shortness of breath at rest, chest pain, or severe dizziness, you are to go to the emergency room immediately. I'm also going to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess your condition. Do not miss this appointment. And try to limit your sodium intake. It is critical. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Och, aye, that's a fair bit to take in. Shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness… I’ll keep a close eye on things, ye can be sure. And I’ll try my best with the salt, though I canna promise miracles. ... One week, ye say? I’ll mark it in my calendar right away. ... Doctor, is this… is this serious? I mean, am I… am I getting worse? I just want to be honest with ye. I’ve lived with this heart for a long time now, and I'm a bit scared, if I'm bein’ frank.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Benic, heart failure is a chronic condition. There will be fluctuations. This appears to be a temporary setback. However, it’s crucial you adhere to the medication adjustments and dietary recommendations. Now, is there anything else, or may I conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Och. Aye, I understand. Fluctuations, ye say. I suppose that’s just the way of it. No, I don’t think there’s anything else. I’ll get these tablets and do my best with the diet. Thank ye, Doctor. I appreciate ye takin’ the time.
DOCTOR: Very well.
