DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Seil, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s this… pain. When I breathe deep. It’s been… a little while, I guess. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days. It just… hurts when I take a big breath.
DOCTOR: I see. Pain with deep breathing. That's certainly something we want to investigate. Could you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: More about the pain… It’s…sharp, I think. Not all the time, just when I really try to fill my lungs. Like a little poke, but…deeper. It's mostly on this side… Though sometimes it feels like it's all over. It's hard to say. Everything just…aches, you know? Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sharp pain on your left side with deep breaths, and a general ache as well. Thank you for clarifying. To help me get a better understanding, could you rate the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you've ever experienced?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… Hmm… that’s a tough one. It’s not the worst pain, not like when I… well, never mind. I don't remember exactly. But it's definitely not zero. Maybe a… four? Five, on a bad day? It doesn't stop me from doing things, but it makes me… careful. I don’t want to push it, you know?
DOCTOR: A four or five, mostly with deep breaths, and it makes you cautious – I appreciate you sharing that. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better or worse besides deep breathing?
PATIENT: Better or worse… That's a good question. I haven't really… paid that much attention, to be honest. When I'm resting, it’s not so bad. Sitting still. But… if I lift something heavy, it gets worse, of course. And when I walk up the stairs… oh, that’s not good. It really feels it then. It's just…easier to not do too much these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse with exertion – lifting, stairs – and better when you're resting. Have you had any cough, fever, or shortness of breath along with this pain?
PATIENT: Cough, fever… No, no fever. Not that I know of. My daughter usually checks on me, and she would have said something if I was running a fever. And no cough. I do get a little…winded sometimes, but that's just… old age, I think. Like I said, I don't do too much running around anymore. Short of breath… maybe a little, but not a bad cough. Nothing like when I had that… something… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever or cough, just some shortness of breath with activity. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as heart problems, lung disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. That’s… a long time ago. I think… I think the doctor said something about my blood pressure being high, years ago. And my knees… they’ve always bothered me. Arthritis, maybe? The daughter said something about that. And I had something with my chest… a long time ago. But I don’t remember what it was. A lot of things, when you get old, you just…forget. I worked construction for many years, you know? Lots of heavy lifting. That probably didn't help.
DOCTOR: I understand. High blood pressure in the past, arthritis in your knees, and some chest issue a long time ago, along with a history of heavy lifting. Do you recall if you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I think… I think I had my appendix taken out when I was young. A long, long time ago. And… maybe something with my knees? The daughter mentioned something about that too, but I can't be sure. It was a long time ago and I wasn't fully aware during the procedure. I don't really remember. A lot of things are just…gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal in the past, and possibly some knee surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you have a family history of heart disease, lung problems, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My wife… she had some trouble with her heart, towards the end. I remember that. And my brother, he had something with his lungs, I think. But… that was a long time ago. A lot of my family… they're gone now. I don't really remember the details. It was a long time ago, and they didn’t talk much about those things.
DOCTOR: I understand. History of heart trouble in your wife and some lung issues in your brother. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Haven't taken any in years. I try to avoid them if I can. Too many side effects, you know? I just…deal with it. A little pain here and there… that’s just part of getting old. My daughter keeps asking me to see a doctor, but I don't like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I haven’t had any trouble with anything, not that I can remember. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes, but that's just the dust, I think. No real allergies. No, I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Ruocco. That was very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll also feel around your chest to see if I can pinpoint the source of the pain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… Well, I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. I don't like being poked and prodded, but… if it will help. Just… be gentle, please. Everything feels a little… sensitive these days. And don't take too long, alright? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, though a little bit fast. Your lungs… I hear some decreased breath sounds on the left side, where you mentioned the pain. That's not necessarily alarming, but it warrants further investigation. I'm also feeling some tenderness on your left side, right here. Now, I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. Your oxygen saturation is 93%, which is a little bit low, but not critically so. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I’m concerned about a possible pneumonia or pleurisy – inflammation of the lining around your lungs. It could also be something related to your ribs, but we need to rule out more serious causes. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… tender, alright. You’re right. Chest X-ray… More tests… I was hoping to avoid that. But… if you think it's necessary. Alright, alright. A chest X-ray. Just… how long will it take? And will it be painful? I don’t like being… fussed with, you know? And pneumonia… that sounds… serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ruocco. The X-ray itself is not painful at all. You’ll just stand or lie down while a technician takes a picture of your chest. It will only take a few minutes. Pneumonia can be serious, but it's often treatable with antibiotics. We need to confirm whether that's what you have before we can start any treatment. The X-ray will help us determine the cause of your pain and shortness of breath. While we wait for the results, I would like to order a blood test to check for signs of infection. That will also help us rule out other possible causes. Would you be willing to do that as well?
PATIENT: Blood test too…? Oh, boy. This is getting to be a lot. Alright, alright. Fine. Blood test and X-ray. Just… please, don’t keep me waiting too long. I have… things to do, you know? And I hope it doesn’t cost too much. I'm not on insurance, you see. It's…difficult these days.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. I'll make sure to expedite the orders for both the X-ray and the blood test, and I'll speak with the billing department to see if there are any options to help with the cost, given your lack of insurance. We'll do our best to keep it as affordable as possible. Okay, I’ve sent the orders to the lab and radiology. The radiology technician will come get you shortly for the X-ray, and then we’ll draw some blood. In the meantime, I'm going to write down some instructions for you. I want you to rest as much as possible and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results of the tests. And if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as high fever, severe shortness of breath, or chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about these instructions?
PATIENT: Rest… fluids… no strenuous activity… Sounds… reasonable, I suppose. And go to the emergency room if it gets worse… alright. No, I don't think so. No questions. Just… get it over with, alright? I just want to know what's wrong, and then… get back to my life.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll do everything we can to get you a diagnosis as quickly as possible. The radiology technician should be here any moment now. Technician: "Hi, I'm here to take Mr. Ruocco for a chest X-ray." Dr. Seil: "Okay, Mr. Ruocco, let’s get this done. I'll be here when you get back to discuss the results. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns." Dr. Seil: "Thank you."
