DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Fazzina, yes? Well, I just... moved here. New area, you know? Something about needing to see someone for… the healthcare. The papers said I should come. Medicare, they call it. Not sure what for, really. Just… checking in, I guess. Old man things.
DOCTOR: Right, Medicare… Yes, that’s a good idea, getting established with a primary care physician. It sounds like this is a general check-up then. Let’s see… to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what "old man things" means to you?
PATIENT: Oh, don't bother with writing everything down! It's just… aches. You know, things creak. Back hurts when I bend. Knees, too. Nothing serious, I think. I used to… work with faces. Make them pretty for the stage. Lots of bending, lots of standing. A long time ago. It's just… getting old, that's all. Not expecting you to fix anything, just… see if I'm about to fall apart.
DOCTOR: Aches and pains… Yes, that's common, especially with a physically demanding previous occupation. "Work with faces," you said?
PATIENT: Makeup! I was a makeup artist. For the theatre, Doctor. Important work! You make them look good, they feel good, they perform good. Not just… painting faces. It was… artistry. Though, it was a long time ago, yes. Not many pretty faces these days, anyway. All the same… a lot of standing. And reaching.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Mr. Szmyd. That is important work. And quite skilled, I'm sure. So, the aches and pains... are they constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. Mostly when it rains. Funny, that. Dampness gets into the bones, I think. And… when I’ve been sitting too long. Though, what else am I doing but sitting? Not running marathons, you know. They come and go. Mostly annoying. Nothing to… worry about, I hope?
DOCTOR: Right. Come and go, worse with rain and sitting. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? What kind of exam? You're not going to… poke and prod, are you? I'm not a young man anymore. But… alright. If you must. Just be gentle. And don’t expect anything fancy. Old man, remember?
DOCTOR: Just a basic check, Mr. Szmyd. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your joints. Nothing fancy, I promise. We'll start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… They always want to take my blood pressure. What do they think, I'm a balloon about to burst? Alright, alright. Go ahead. But don't squeeze too tight, my veins are… delicate.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Deep breaths in… and out…
PATIENT: Always something, isn't it? A little elevated. What does that mean? Is that bad? And… lungs? What about the lungs? I don't smoke, you know. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Too busy making faces pretty.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, good air movement. No wheezing or crackles. The blood pressure is a bit high, we'll want to monitor that. Do you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Only when I have to climb the stairs. And that’s not often. Dizzy? Sometimes. But that's just… getting old. Chest pain? No. Not really. A little ache sometimes, but that’s just… the bones, you know. Everything aches. What do you expect? I used to hold spotlights for hours. Heavy things, those.
DOCTOR: Okay. No recent chest pain, shortness of breath only with exertion, dizziness occasionally. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you please sit with your legs dangling?
PATIENT: Reflexes now? What, are you testing if I’m a robot? Fine, fine. Legs dangling. Don’t expect miracles, Doctor. They don’t work like they used to. Everything’s… slowing down. Like a rusty machine.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, could you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Steady now… careful… everything’s… protesting. You see? Not exactly graceful, am I? Old man, remember? Not a dancer. Used to be… okay, but that was a long time ago. Everything creaks.
DOCTOR: Gait is a bit slow and unsteady, but no significant limitations. Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it seems like you're experiencing normal age-related changes – some aches and pains, slightly elevated blood pressure, and some diminished reflexes. We can address the blood pressure with lifestyle modifications – diet, exercise, reducing stress. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications? Diet? Exercise? Doctor, I’m an old man! What do you want me to do, run a marathon? And stress? I am stress! Sitting around waiting for things to fall apart is stressful. But… what kind of diet? And... what does 'reducing stress' even mean? This sounds like a lot of work.
DOCTOR: No marathons, Mr. Szmyd, I promise. For diet, simply focusing on fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and reducing salt intake can make a difference. And for reducing stress… perhaps finding a relaxing hobby, spending time with loved ones, or practicing deep breathing exercises. We can also discuss medication if the lifestyle changes aren't enough to control your blood pressure. Would you like me to order some basic blood work to get a better baseline?
PATIENT: Blood work now? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, I came here to make sure I wasn’t about to fall apart, not become a science experiment. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… don’t expect any miracles. And I don’t have any “loved ones,” so the hobby suggestion is… pointless.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. The blood work is just to get a clearer picture of your overall health and rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. It’s a standard precaution. I’ll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. The lab results usually take a few days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. A few days. More waiting. Alright. Schedule something. As long as it’s not too early in the morning. Old man, remember? Need my sleep. And… what exactly will this 'plan' involve? More diet and exercise?
DOCTOR: We can discuss your diet and exercise options in more detail. But the plan will be tailored to your needs and preferences. We can start small and gradually increase activity as you feel comfortable. It doesn’t have to be strenuous. We’ll focus on what you can do, not what you can't. I’m scheduling you for a follow-up appointment on August 9th at 2 PM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: August 9th… fine. As long as it doesn't involve running. 2 PM… alright. More waiting, more poking. But... tailored to my preferences? What kind of preferences are we talking about? I mostly prefer sitting.
DOCTOR: We can work with that, Mr. Szmyd. Perhaps incorporating gentle stretching exercises while seated, or discussing enjoyable hobbies you might want to revisit. The goal is to find things you enjoy doing, that contribute to your overall wellbeing. Here are the lab orders and a summary of today’s discussion. Please take these to the lab. If you have any questions before your appointment, don't hesitate to call the clinic. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Gentle stretching… enjoyable hobbies… Sounds like a lot of work, honestly. But... alright. Fine. I suppose. No, I don't think so. Just… trying to stay alive, that's all. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. We’ll do our best to help you stay healthy and active. Take care, and I'll see you on August 9th.
