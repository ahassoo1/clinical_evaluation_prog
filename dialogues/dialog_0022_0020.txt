DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. I… how you say… I am here for this… talk on the phone, yes? The telehealth. My daughter, she make the appointment for me. I do not feel so good lately, but… not big problem, I think. Just… tired, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like your daughter scheduled a follow-up appointment based on a telehealth visit. That's helpful to know. “Just tired, mostly” is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about that tiredness?
PATIENT: Yes, my daughter, she say I should come. She worry. The tiredness… is all the time now, I think. Not just after work, like before. Even when I rest, I feel… heavy. And… sometimes, my hands, they shake a little. Not much, but I notice it. Is scary.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant tiredness, even with rest, and noticing some shaking in your hands – those are definitely things we should look into. It’s good you're paying attention to these changes. When did you first start noticing this constant tiredness, Ms. Benites?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe three months ago? It start slow. I thought it was just… getting old, you know? I work hard my whole life, fixing cars. But it not go away. And the shaking… maybe one month. Not every day, but… more and more often. It happen when I try to do small things, like button my coat. Is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three months of persistent tiredness and roughly a month of noticing the shaking, particularly with fine motor skills like buttoning a coat. That gives us a good timeline. Besides the tiredness and shaking, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes. My… how you say… my memory is not so good. I forget things. Small things, mostly. Like where I put my glasses, or what I eat for breakfast. My daughter, she say I ask the same questions many times. Is embarrassing. And… sometimes, I feel… sad. But not always. Just… down.
DOCTOR: Okay, so memory problems and feeling down occasionally as well. Thank you for sharing all of this, Ms. Benites. It's important to get a full picture. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… my appetite, it is… smaller now. I do not eat so much. And… yes, I think I lose some weight. Not much, but my clothes, they feel… loose. My daughter say I look thinner, but… I do not weigh myself. I do not like to. Is… bad for my feelings.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s alright if you don’t enjoy weighing yourself. Losing weight and a decreased appetite are important things to note. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… Doctor, I have… how you say… arthritis in my hands. The doctor told me many years ago. It makes them hurt sometimes, but I take pills for it. And… when I was young, I have… something with my heart. Not bad, the doctor say. I take medicine for a little while, then stop. I do not remember much else. Is a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your hands, which you manage with medication, and a heart condition when you were younger that resolved. That’s helpful. Do you remember what kind of heart condition it was, or what medication you were taking?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor… is very long ago. I was very young. The doctor say… something with my heart rhythm. Not good rhythm, he say. I do not remember the name. And the medicine… small white pill, I think. I take it for maybe one year, then stop. He say it was okay. I do not think about it much since then. Is a long time ago, like I say. My memory… is not so good.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Benites. It's perfectly alright if you don't remember the specifics. We can look into your medical records to get more details if that’s alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not think so. I never have… reaction to anything. I eat everything. I take the pills for arthritis, and… sometimes, I take something for the pain in my back. No problem with those. I think I am not allergic to anything. But… my daughter, she always ask me this question. She worry.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It’s always good to be cautious, and your daughter is right to be thorough. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including the arthritis medication and anything for back pain, and what dosages you take?
PATIENT: Okay. For my arthritis, I take… let me see the bottle… Naproxen. Five hundred milligrams. Two times a day. And for my back… sometimes, when it hurts bad, I take… Tramadol. Fifty milligrams. One or two pills, only when I need. Not every day, you understand? Only when the pain is… very bad. I try to not take it too much. Is… strong medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Naproxen 500mg twice daily for arthritis and Tramadol 50mg as needed for back pain. Thank you. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, dementia, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… My father… he have heart problems. He was sick for many years. And… my mother, she have… how you say… trouble with her memory when she get old. She forget things, like me now. But… that is all I remember. My brothers and sisters, they are healthy, I think. We do not talk about these things much. Is… sad to think about.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems in your father and memory issues in your mother. Thank you. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh. I am… widowed. My husband, he died many years ago. I live alone in my house. I do not drive anymore. My daughter, she help me with everything. I… how you say… I do not go out much. I used to garden, but my hands hurt now. I watch television. I… I do not have many friends. Is… lonely sometimes. But my daughter, she visit me often. She is good girl.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Benites. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and I appreciate your openness. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is fine. Whatever you need. I trust you. I want to know what is wrong with me. I feel… tired all the time. Maybe you can help me. I am ready for the exam.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Benites, your blood pressure is 140/90, your pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6. Your lungs sound clear. I do hear a slight murmur when listening to your heart, which we'll need to investigate further. I’m also going to check your reflexes and your neurological function. Your reflexes are a little diminished, and there is some mild tremor in your hands. I also noticed some slight difficulty with coordination during the neurological exam. Now, I'm going to take a look at your hands to assess the arthritis. There's some visible swelling and stiffness in your knuckles, consistent with arthritis. Alright, Ms. Benites, that concludes the physical exam for now. I want to order some blood work and a possible EKG to get a better understanding of what’s going on. The blood work will help us check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other underlying conditions. The EKG will assess your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That is… a lot of things. My thyroid? What is that? And the EKG… is that bad? I am scared. My heart… is something wrong with my heart? I feel… weak. Maybe I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when we talk about these things, Ms. Benites. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that we are just gathering information to figure out what’s going on. Your thyroid is a small gland in your neck that controls your metabolism. Sometimes, if it’s not working properly, it can cause tiredness and other symptoms. The blood work will help us see if your thyroid is functioning normally. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t hurt at all, and it will help us check your heart rhythm and see if there are any abnormalities. It’s not necessarily bad; it's just a precautionary step. The mild murmur I heard during the exam and your family history of heart problems are why I want to be thorough. It doesn’t mean anything is definitely wrong, but it’s important to investigate. We'll get the results of the blood work and EKG back within a few days, and then we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… makes a little more sense. My thyroid… and the EKG… not bad, you say? Just to check? And the blood work… will tell us if I am… sick? I am still scared, but… I trust you. What do I need to do for the blood work? And when can I have it done? I want to know what is wrong with me. Soon.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, exactly. The tests are just to gather information and see what’s going on. It's not necessarily that you are sick, just that we want to rule things out and understand the cause of your symptoms. For the blood work, you’ll need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks except water. We have a lab right downstairs, and you can go anytime tomorrow morning. They’ll take a small sample of blood, and it will be sent to the lab for analysis. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, give you a requisition form and instructions for the fasting. She’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results once they come back. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… okay, Doctor. Fasting… eight hours. I can do that. Sarah… she will give me the paper? And schedule the appointment? When will I get the results? I hope it is not too long. I want to know… soon. And thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. I am still scared, but… I feel better knowing you are helping me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. I understand your anxiety, and I’ll do everything I can to get you answers as quickly as possible. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back, so we can schedule your follow-up appointment for early next week. Sarah will also give you a copy of your test orders, just for your information. And if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. Alright, I’ll have Sarah come in and get you set up with the lab requisition and schedule your follow-up. In the meantime, try to rest and stay hydrated. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is all. Just the blood work and the appointment. Thank you very much. You have been very patient with me. I hope… I hope it is nothing serious. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any concerns. Sarah will be in shortly. Have a good rest of your day.
