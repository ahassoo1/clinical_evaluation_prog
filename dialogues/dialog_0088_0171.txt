DOCTOR: Hello, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hello. My… nails. They look funny. Not good funny. Just… funny. I think. It’s been a while since I really looked at them, you know? I just noticed this morning. They changed.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Changed” how, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Ugh. How to explain… They’re… bumpy. And the color is… off. Not my usual color. I don't know what is my usual color, really. They’re just… not nice. Like old pennies, maybe? But not shiny. Dull pennies. Is that helpful? I don't do well with… descriptions.
DOCTOR: Dull pennies… alright, that gives me a starting point. And bumpy – are those bumps all over the nails, or just in certain spots?
PATIENT: Hmm… mostly on the tips. And… a couple near the… the skin part. Not all of them, though. Just some. I think. Honestly, I mostly just noticed they weren't… pretty. I don’t usually pay attention to these things, you know? I’m an audiologist! I deal with ears, not fingernails.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly. Ears are much more your expertise! Okay, Ms. Thut, let’s take a closer look. Could you please extend your hands, palms up?
PATIENT: Here. Don’t expect much. I told you, I don’t fuss with these. They just… are. I mostly just put lotion on them sometimes. When I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There is some discoloration – a yellowish-brown hue – and some slight pitting and ridging, especially on the tips of a few nails. And those small bumps… they appear to be longitudinal ridging with some onycholysis – meaning the nail is lifting slightly from the nail bed. Does anything hurt when I touch them?
PATIENT: Onyco… what now? Lifting? Oh dear. No, it doesn’t hurt. Not really. Maybe a little sensitive if I… press hard. But it’s not painful pain. More like… a little ouch. Is this bad? Please don’t tell me it’s some horrible fungus. I hate fungus.
DOCTOR: No, no need to worry about horrible fungus just yet. Onycholysis just means the nail is separating from the bed, and it can have several causes, not just fungus. It could be trauma, a skin condition, even certain systemic illnesses. Have you noticed any changes to your skin anywhere else – like redness, scaling, or new rashes?
PATIENT: Hmm… rashes… let me think. I get a little itchy sometimes, on my arms. But I just put cream on it. Old lady cream, my sister calls it. It’s… probably nothing. I've always had sensitive skin. And… my feet are dry. Very dry. But that’s because I wear shoes all day, obviously. Audiologists don’t go barefoot, you know. Is that important? This is all very… involved.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mention the itchy skin and dry feet – that's helpful. And yes, those could be related. Do you have any family history of skin conditions, like psoriasis or eczema?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… My mother had… something. On her hands. Red and flaky, I think. She went to a lot of doctors. Always complaining. Honestly, I try not to think about it. She was a… dramatic person. My sister probably knows more. She’s the one who keeps track of things. I just… listen to people all day. I don’t remember things. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: No, not a problem at all. It's perfectly fine to not be the family historian. But the red and flaky skin on your mother’s hands could be relevant. Ms. Thut, based on what you've told me, and my initial examination, it could be a fungal infection, but it could also be a condition called psoriasis or a reaction to something irritating your skin. To be certain, I'd like to take a small scraping from under your nail to send to the lab for analysis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A scraping? Oh dear. Sounds… unpleasant. Will it hurt? And what if it is fungus? Do I have to take pills? I hate taking pills. I'm very sensitive. But… if you think it's best. Fine. But be quick, please. And gentle. Very gentle. I really don’t like anything… invasive.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Thut. It will be a very quick and relatively painless procedure. I'll use a small instrument to gently collect a tiny sample from under the nail. It might feel like a slight scratch, but it shouldn't hurt. And we’ll discuss treatment options if it turns out to be a fungal infection – there are topical medications available, and pills are usually reserved for more severe cases. Let's get this done quickly and gently, as you requested.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… get it over with. I have appointments this afternoon, you know. People are relying on me. Ears are important. Don't want to keep them waiting. Just... hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. That was quick, wasn't it?
PATIENT: Yes. Very quick. Good. Now, what happens next? Do I need to do anything special? Can I still see my patients? They need their hearing checked, you know. It's very important. I don’t want to… spread anything. Is that a worry?
DOCTOR: You can absolutely continue seeing your patients – it’s very unlikely to be contagious. And no special precautions are needed. The lab results should be back in about a week. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, keeping your nails trimmed and dry will help prevent any further irritation. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… please call me with the results. And don't make me come back if it’s nothing serious. I really don't like doctors’ offices. They remind me of… things. But thank you. I guess. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have ears to attend to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Thut. I’ll be sure to call you as soon as I have the results. It was a pleasure meeting you. And I understand – ears are important. Have a good afternoon.
