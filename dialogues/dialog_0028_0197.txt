DOCTOR: Good morning. I’m Dr. Memmolo. So, Mrs. Sciarrotta, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's about getting a card... a medical card for driving, you see. I want to keep driving the logging equipment, but they said I need this card now. It's for ride-share… or taxi… or commercial drivers, something like that. It’s all a bit confusing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. A commercial driver's license… or a medical examiner's certificate, more likely. They’ve changed the regulations, haven’t they?
PATIENT: Changed them alright! I barely keep up these days. It’s just… I’ve been driving for so long, and now this paperwork. Is this something new for people my age, Doctor? I don’t mean to be difficult, I just… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: It’s not specifically for your age, Mrs. Sciarrotta, it’s a federal requirement for operating large vehicles commercially. Regardless. Let's just go through a standard examination to see if you meet the requirements. It's mostly a physical assessment, blood pressure, vision, that sort of thing. Have you had a physical recently?
PATIENT: A physical… hmm. Let me think. Not recently, no. Maybe a year ago? With my old doctor, before he retired. I mostly just go to the clinic when something hurts, you know? I don’t bother them for check-ups if I feel alright. Is it alright if we just do it now? I’d like to get this over with as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to document everything, of course. It’s standard procedure. Let’s start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Please sit back and relax. Have you had any changes in your medications recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no medications at all, Doctor. Never have. Just a bit of arthritis in my hands sometimes, but I manage with a warm soak and some liniment. It doesn’t bother my driving, not one bit. Blood pressure sounds fine. Just get on with it, please? I have things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to a quick neurological assessment. I'll need you to follow my finger with your eyes, please, and don't look at me. Then we'll check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Follow your finger… there we go. Is this going to take long? My neck gets a bit stiff if I hold it in one position too long, you see. And the reflexes… what exactly are you looking for? I hope it's not anything too complicated.
DOCTOR: Just assessing basic motor function, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Nothing to be concerned about. Everything seems normal so far. Now, could you tell me about your vision?
PATIENT: Oh, my vision is… well, it’s not what it used to be, naturally. I need reading glasses for close-up work, but I've always been able to see perfectly well at a distance. I still have my old license, if that helps? It says 20/30, I think. I haven't had it checked properly in a few years, though. Is there a test here? I’m a bit worried about that.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a vision test, Mrs. Sciarrotta. It's a requirement. We have a chart here. Let’s just get it over with. Please read the lowest line you can clearly see.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Let’s see… E… H… P… V… K… D… oh dear. That last one… is that a B? Or a P? It’s all a bit blurry, Doctor. It’s harder than it looks! Perhaps you could… tell me the letters? I’m afraid my eyes are playing tricks on me today.
DOCTOR: Your vision is… suboptimal, Mrs. Sciarrotta. It doesn't meet the requirements for a commercial driver's license. We'll need to document this. I'm going to recommend a full ophthalmological evaluation. I can provide a referral.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… not good, is it? An ophthalmologist… that'll be expensive, I suppose. And time-consuming. I've been driving for fifty years, Doctor! Fifty years without a single accident. Surely, something can be done? I don't understand. Is there no way you can just… sign off on it? I really need to keep driving. It's how I earn my living.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sciarrotta, I understand your concern, but I cannot ethically sign off on a medical certificate when your vision clearly does not meet the federal standards. It’s a liability issue, and more importantly, it’s a matter of public safety. I can give you the referral information for a specialist. It's the only way forward. We have to be responsible.
PATIENT: Responsible… yes, I suppose so. But what am I going to do? This is just… terrible. Alright, alright. Give me the referral. But tell me, Doctor, roughly… how long does something like this usually take? And how much will it cost? I’m on a fixed income, you see. This is really… upsetting. I think… I think I need a moment. .
