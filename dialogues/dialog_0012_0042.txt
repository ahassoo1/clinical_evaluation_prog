DOCTOR: Hi Londell, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Dr. Yoshino, nice to meet you too. I appreciate you seein’ me. It’s…well, I guess I’m gettin’ up in years, and my wife, bless her heart, always kept on top of things. Since she passed, I figured I ought to get someone lookin’ at me, seein’ as how I want to stay around a good long while. It's a men's health visit, I believe the lady on the phone called it? Just want to make sure everything’s tickin’ like it should, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Londell. It's very smart to be proactive about your health, especially with a change in routine. And yes, it sounds like a men’s health visit is a good place to start. We'll do a full check-up to get a baseline and address any concerns you might have. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what's been going on with you lately?
PATIENT: Well, nothin' major, thankfully. I still get out and do things. I do a fair bit of etching, it keeps my hands busy, you know? Keeps the mind workin’ too. But…I guess I get tired quicker than I used to. And sometimes, I just don’t feel…quite as sharp as I once did. Memory’s been a little…fuzzy, maybe. Not terrible, mind you. I remember dates just fine, important things. But little things…where I put my glasses, what I was just thinkin’…that sort of thing. And…well, I've been havin' to get up once or twice a night to use the bathroom. It's not pain or anything, just…inconvenient. That's mostly it, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s all helpful information, thank you. Getting tired more easily, some memory issues – mainly with recent things – and getting up at night to urinate. Let’s dig a little deeper. When you say getting tired quicker, is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. Some days I feel alright, maybe a little sluggish, but I can still get a good day's work done. Other days…it just feels like draggin’ myself through mud. Especially if I've been out in the sun or somethin’. And it seems worse if I don't get a good night’s sleep, which…well, with gettin’ up a couple of times, that ain’t always easy. It's not like I'm fallin' asleep standin' up or anything, just…not as rested in the mornin’ as I used to be. Does that make sense? I’m not the best at explainin’ these things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Londell. You’re explaining it just fine. It sounds like it's fluctuating, and maybe connected to sleep and activity level. Okay. Let’s talk about that nighttime urination. How often would you say you’re getting up?
PATIENT: Usually once, sometimes twice. It’s not every night, thankfully, maybe three or four times a week. It's enough to disrupt things, though. I used to sleep straight through. And like I said, it’s not pain or burnin’ or anythin’. Just…the urge to go. And it's usually a good amount when I do go. Not a dribble, you know? A proper visit to the facilities. I've been drinkin' less water before bed, tryin' to fix it myself, but it don't seem to make a whole lot of difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, so three or four times a week, a good amount each time, and you've already tried reducing your fluid intake before bed without much change. That's good to know you're trying to be proactive. Now, I’m going to ask a few general health questions, just to get a broader picture. Have you been experiencing any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I still enjoy a good meal. My daughter keeps tryin’ to get me to eat more…healthy stuff, but I still like my frybread, bless her heart. I ain't lost any weight that I've noticed, and I feel hungry when it's time to eat. I've maybe lost a little interest in cookin’ for myself, now that it’s just me, but I still eat regular. I do enjoy a little sweet tea with my meals, if that makes a difference. I try not to overdo it, though. Old age ain't kind to a sweet tooth, they say.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about your appetite. And yes, old age does have a way of changing things! No need to feel bad about enjoying a little sweet tea. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Well… now that is a question. I reckon they’re pretty regular, all things considered. Not as…predictable as they used to be, maybe. Sometimes a little slow, sometimes a little quicker. Nothing alarming, though. I take a little somethin’ to keep things movin’ if I need to, but I don't have to every day. And no pain or bleedin' or anythin' like that. Just…old man stuff, I suppose. I don't dwell on it too much, if you know what I mean. It's just…not as reliable as it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Londell. It sounds like things are generally okay, just a little less consistent. That’s pretty common with age. Now, I'm going to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any major medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… Now, my wife, she had some trouble with her blood pressure towards the end, but I never did. I had pneumonia when I was a boy, real bad case, but I recovered fully. And I broke my arm once, fallin’ out of a tree when I was tryin’ to impress a girl, but that healed up alright too. Doc checked me out regular for years, mostly just routine stuff, told me I was as healthy as an ox. He retired a few years back, though. Can’t recall any major diagnoses, no. I’ve always been pretty lucky, I reckon. Oh, I did have some trouble with my prostate a few years ago, but they gave me some pills and that cleared it right up. Been fine ever since.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pneumonia as a child, a broken arm, and prostate issues that were treated successfully. That’s good to know. And you’ve been told you were generally healthy. Now, any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just the one. My appendix, when I was a teenager. Back in '62, I believe. It was a pretty straightforward affair, didn’t cause me much trouble. Didn't need much afterwards, just some rest. Been fine ever since. Nothing else. I always tried to avoid the doctor when I could, to be honest. Seemed like I always ended up with more problems from the doctor than what I went in with. But I suppose times have changed.
DOCTOR: That's good to know – appendectomy in 1962. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know of any major medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, my mother’s side, they had a lot of trouble with their hearts. Both her brothers passed away young, heart attacks. And her mother, she had diabetes, real bad case. My father's side…they mostly just lived long lives and died of old age, as far as I know. He didn’t talk much about his family. A quiet man, my father. My wife’s family…her mother had cancer, but she beat it. So, mostly heart trouble and some cancer, I reckon. Nothing else that sticks out in my mind. It's been a while since I thought about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart disease on your mother’s side, some cancer in your wife’s family. That's good to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Never have. My father smoked a pipe, but I never took to it. Smelled awful, and always seemed to make him cough. I always preferred fresh air. And my wife… she didn’t care for it either. So, no, never smoked a day in my life. I always figured it would just shorten things unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Not much anymore. Used to enjoy a little beer with my supper on the weekends, but my wife didn't care for it. She said it made me too loud. After she passed… I just didn't have much call for it. Maybe a glass of wine once in a blue moon, with a nice meal. But I wouldn't say I drink. No, not really. I mostly stick to sweet tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, very limited alcohol intake. Now, I know you mentioned etching. What else do you do for exercise or physical activity?
PATIENT: Well, the etching keeps my hands busy, and I'm standin' most of the time I’m workin’ on somethin’. But that ain’t much of a workout, I reckon. I used to enjoy fishin’, but it’s been a while since I’ve been out. It takes a bit of walkin’ to get to the good spots. And I try to do a little gardenin’ in the spring, but my back ain't what it used to be. Mostly, I just potter around the house, do a little fixin’ here and there. Not much strenuous activity, I'm afraid. I mostly try to stay busy, keep my mind sharp. I get out and walk the dog, a little bit, but he's gettin' old too and doesn't go too far these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly light activity – etching, gardening, walking the dog. Let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve taken penicillin a few times for little infections, and I’ve never had any trouble. And I eat just about anything. My wife used to try to get me to eat vegetables, but I never did develop an allergy to those, thankfully. No, I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose. I do get a little itchy sometimes when I’m out in the poison ivy, but that’s not exactly an allergy, is it? Just common sense, I reckon.
DOCTOR: No, poison ivy doesn’t count! Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my prostate, like I mentioned earlier. Doc gave it to me a few years back, and it’s been workin’ alright. I don't take it every day, just when I feel like I need it. And I take a little somethin’ for my joints every now and then, when they get stiff. Over-the-counter stuff, you know? Mostly just ibuprofen. Nothing else. Oh, and I take a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. My daughter keeps tellin’ me I need to stay healthy, so I figured it couldn't hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, so medication for your prostate as needed, ibuprofen for your joints occasionally, and a multivitamin. Alright, Londell, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that's fine. Go right ahead. I suppose it’s time to see if I’m holdin’ up alright. Haven't had a proper exam in a while, so I expect you'll find all sorts of things wrong with me. Just let me know if anythin’ feels…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily concerning, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear, good air movement on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/90, and your pulse is 78 and regular. I’m going to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears look clear, no signs of infection. Nose and throat are also clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I don’t feel any masses or abnormalities. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems generally okay, but the elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes are things we’ll want to monitor. I'd like to order some bloodwork and a urine sample to get a more detailed picture. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that sounds sensible. Bloodwork and a urine sample... good idea. Anything that'll help figure things out, I'm all for it. That elevated blood pressure… that ain’t good, is it? Is that somethin’ serious? I always thought I was pretty healthy. And the reflexes bein’ diminished…is that just old age talk? I appreciate you takin' the time to look me over. I'm just wantin' to make sure everything's tickin' like it should, you know? I don’t want to be a burden to my daughter. She's been good to me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Londell, and it's good you're being proactive about your health. The elevated blood pressure is something we want to address, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's serious. It's often manageable with lifestyle changes – like diet and exercise – and sometimes medication. We’ll see what the bloodwork tells us. And the diminished reflexes can be a normal part of aging, but we also want to rule out any other potential causes. That's what the bloodwork will help us determine. We're just covering all our bases. I’m going to order a Complete Blood Count , a Basic Metabolic Panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, a Lipid Panel to check your cholesterol, and a Urinalysis. We'll also check your prostate-specific antigen level to monitor your prostate. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood and collect a urine sample. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, that all sounds…thorough. Complete Blood Count, Basic Metabolic Panel, Lipid Panel, Urinalysis... PSA level. I’ll remember those. And the nurse will get the samples... good. I appreciate you explainin' everything so clearly. It makes me feel a lot better, knowin' what's goin' on. I suppose I should ask… roughly how long before we get those results back? And will you explain them to me when I come back? I don’t want to just get a piece of paper with numbers on it. I want to know what it means.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Londell. It usually takes about 5-7 business days to get the results back from the lab. When you come back, we’ll sit down and go over everything together, in detail. I'll explain what each number means, and we'll discuss any necessary next steps. I will never just hand you a piece of paper with numbers on it. That's not how I operate. In the meantime, I'd like you to continue to monitor your blood pressure at home, if possible. You can purchase a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Just write down the readings and bring them with you when you come back. Also, it’s a good idea to try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week, and focus on eating a healthy diet. We can discuss some specific recommendations at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, I think that covers it. Monitor my blood pressure, get some exercise, and eat healthy. Sounds… manageable. I appreciate your patience and your explainin’ things so clearly. And thank you for listenin’ to my ramblin’. I reckon I’ll just wait for the nurse, then. You have a good day, now. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Londell. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
