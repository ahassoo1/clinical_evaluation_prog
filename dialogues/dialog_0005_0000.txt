DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my legs. They just… gave out. Not completely, you understand. More like they got very weak after I had a bad cold last week. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I’m a tour guide, you see. Can’t very well guide tours if I can’t walk properly.
DOCTOR: Weakness after a cold… Right. And how long ago was this cold, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, hmm, last Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday the 22nd of July. It wasn't pleasant. A lot of sneezing, a sore throat… the usual. I thought it was just a regular cold, honestly. I didn’t think it would lead to this. It's been about ten days now since the worst of it, but the weakness… it just won’t go away. And it's in both legs, you know. Not just one.
DOCTOR: Ten days… and both legs. Okay. Can you describe the weakness for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can’t move them at all. It’s more… difficult. Like trying to walk through thick mud, perhaps? It takes a lot more effort than it used to. And they feel… heavy. Very heavy. I find myself having to really concentrate on lifting my feet, especially when I'm going up stairs. Honestly, it's embarrassing. I used to be so nimble. Now, I feel like an old woman. Which, I assure you, I am not. Forty-four is no age to be feeling this unsteady.
DOCTOR: “Heavy” and requiring more effort… Alright. Do you have any pain associated with the weakness?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, or anything like that. It's more… a dull ache, sometimes. Mostly in my thighs, I suppose. It comes and goes, really. It's not constant. It's just… uncomfortable. And it’s worse after I’ve been on my feet for a while, naturally. If I sit down and rest them, it eases up a bit. But then, I'm not exactly able to do my job if I'm constantly having to sit down, am I?
DOCTOR: Dull ache in the thighs, worse with activity... Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or changes in sensation in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no tingling or numbness. Everything feels… normal, in that respect. I can feel the floor under my feet perfectly well. And I haven't dropped anything, if that’s what you’re getting at. My coordination is fine, it's just… the effort. It’s the effort that’s so frustrating. Honestly, you'd think a simple cold wouldn't leave me feeling like this. I mean, what’s next? A bout of paralysis? Don't tell me that's going to happen.
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions, Ms. Firestone. We're simply gathering information. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms besides the cold and the leg weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. The fever, of course. It wasn't terribly high, but I did feel quite warm for a couple of days. And chills, yes, a bit of shivering. Nothing dramatic, mind you. I just stayed in bed, drank plenty of fluids, and tried to rest. I didn’t bother going to the doctor for a cold. Seemed a bit… excessive, don't you think? And no, nothing else. Just the cold, the fever, and now… this ridiculous weakness. It's very inconvenient, as I’ve said. I have a tour scheduled next week, a rather important one, and I simply must be able to walk.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. I've had colds, naturally. Everyone gets colds. But I've never experienced leg weakness like this after one. I'm a very active person, you see. I walk a lot. I hike, I dance, I keep myself fit. This is… unusual. And frankly, a bit worrying. I've always prided myself on my health. It's… unsettling, to say the least. I haven’t had any other illnesses, or injuries to my legs either. It just… came on suddenly after the cold cleared up. It’s completely baffling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. I suppose that’s… sensible. Though I must say, I’m not particularly fond of doctors’ offices. All that… sterile smell. And the paper on the tables is always so thin. But go ahead, doctor. Let’s get this over with. The sooner I know what’s wrong, the sooner I can get back to work. And hopefully, save my tour.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie flat on your back, arms at your sides. I’m going to start with your reflexes. Okay… reflexes are… 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? I do have rather strong hands, you know. I’m quite good at gardening. It requires a firm grip. And I’ve always been able to open stubborn jars, much to the relief of my friends. Is that what you needed? I’m squeezing, doctor. Are you getting a good reading?
DOCTOR: Yes, your grip is good. Now, I’m going to ask you to resist as I try to push your legs down. Try to keep your legs straight. Okay… and now with your ankles. Can you point your toes up and down against my resistance?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? I'm pushing, doctor. It feels… strained, to be honest. Like I’m working much harder than I ought to. And now my ankles… It’s not as easy as it looks, you know. I used to be able to do this effortlessly. Honestly, doctor, are you sure your equipment is working properly? It seems… off.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, can you stand up and walk for me, please?
PATIENT: Very well. There. Do you see what I mean, doctor? It’s… awkward. And tiring. It feels like I’m wading through something thick. Honestly, I feel quite ridiculous. A tour guide who can’t walk properly. It’s hardly ideal.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Ms. Firestone. Please sit back down. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like you're experiencing some weakness in your legs following a cold. Given the recent illness, it could be post-viral weakness. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. We can start with a CBC and CMP to assess your overall health and look for any signs of infection or inflammation. I would also like to order a Vitamin D level, as deficiency can sometimes cause muscle weakness. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests already? I was hoping to avoid those, if possible. I’m not terribly fond of needles, you know. And honestly, doctor, all this talk of inflammation and deficiency is rather alarming. Allergies… let me think. I had a reaction to penicillin many years ago. A rash, mostly. Nothing too serious, but I avoid it now, naturally. Aside from that, no. I'm generally quite healthy. But a CBC and a CMP? And a Vitamin D level? What exactly are we looking for? And will it take long? I have a tour scheduled…
DOCTOR: The CBC will check your blood cell counts, to rule out any underlying infection or anemia. The CMP assesses your kidney and liver function, and electrolyte levels, which can sometimes be affected by viral illnesses. The Vitamin D level is just to see if a deficiency could be contributing to the weakness. It's a simple blood draw, and it shouldn't take long. The lab is right downstairs, and it usually only takes about 15-20 minutes. Given your history of penicillin allergy, we’ll make sure to document that properly. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend continuing to rest, and staying hydrated. If the weakness worsens significantly, or if you develop any other symptoms like numbness, tingling, or fever, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Fifteen to twenty minutes, you say? Well, I suppose that's not too bad. But honestly, doctor, all this talk of underlying infections and electrolyte imbalances is rather unsettling. I just want to know what’s causing my legs to feel so weak! And I’m not sure I understand why we need to check my kidneys and liver... It all seems a bit… excessive, don’t you think? I had a cold, not a… a complete system failure. And what happens after the tests? Will you know immediately what’s wrong? And what if it’s something serious? Will I need… medication? Or physical therapy? Honestly, doctor, I just want a simple answer. A simple fix. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone. It's frustrating not to have an immediate answer. We need to rule out other potential causes before we can definitively diagnose the cause of your weakness. The tests will help us get a clearer picture of your overall health and guide our treatment plan. While we can't know the results immediately, the lab usually returns them within a few hours. If the results are normal, it's more likely that the weakness is post-viral and should resolve with rest. If the results are abnormal, we’ll discuss the findings and develop a tailored treatment plan. It's possible you may need medication, or physical therapy, depending on the underlying cause. But let's not jump to conclusions. We’ll take things one step at a time. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. Do you agree?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. One step at a time, you say? I suppose that’s… sensible. Though I must say, I’m not particularly thrilled about the prospect of more tests. But if it’s the only way to find out what’s causing my legs to feel like jelly, then so be it. Just… please, doctor, make sure everything is documented properly. I don’t want any surprises. And I hope the lab technicians are gentle. I really don’t like needles. And please, inform me as soon as the results are available. I have a tour scheduled… I really need to know if I can proceed. Alright. Let's get this over with. Where is this lab, exactly? And do I need to fill out any forms? Honestly, the paperwork alone is enough to exhaust me.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab is just down the hall, on your left. Yes, you’ll need to fill out a brief form with your insurance information and allergies. I’ll have the receptionist give you the form. She’ll also let the lab technicians know about your penicillin allergy. Once you've completed the form, just let them know you’re here for the tests I ordered. They’ll call me as soon as the results are available. I'll be right here in the office. Do you need assistance walking to the lab?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I can manage. Though I must say, I feel rather unsteady on my feet. But I'll be alright. I suppose a short walk will do me good. Just… please, doctor, don't leave me waiting too long for the results. I have a tour scheduled… and I really need to know if I can proceed. I'm counting on you. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Firestone. I'll do my best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. Don't hesitate to let the receptionist know if you need anything. .
