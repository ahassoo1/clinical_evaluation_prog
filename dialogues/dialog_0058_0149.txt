DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Honestly, I don't rightly remember scheduling this appointment. My daughter, Estelle, probably made it. She worries too much, that girl. Something about… not wanting me to do something? I’ve been a podiatrist for fifty years, I think I know what I'm doing, dear.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's… good to know you have experience in medicine, Wynell. Still, it's good Estelle is looking out for you. Let’s just run through what’s been bothering you recently, regardless of how long you’ve been practicing. Are you having any pain, or is there something specific you've been concerned about that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A little ache here and there, but what 83-year-old doesn’t have aches? Honestly, I mostly came because Estelle was fussing. She said something about… well, I don’t recall the exact words. Something about a procedure I shouldn't have? It was probably about that bunion on my left foot. It’s been there for ages, never bothered me much. I've seen worse on my patients. What’s this got to do with Estelle, anyway? She’s a good girl, but sometimes… well, she gets carried away.
DOCTOR: Right. A bunion, then. And Estelle’s concern. It is good that she’s involved in your care, Wynell. Even seasoned professionals can miss things. It's possible that bunion is causing more issues than you realize, or might develop complications down the line. Let's have a look. Could you please sit up on the exam table and I'll take a quick look at your left foot?
PATIENT: Hmph. Complications. I’ve treated complications. Still, if you insist. Just don't go poking around too much, dear. I’ve got sensitive skin. And really, a little bunion isn't something to fuss over. It’s cosmetic, mostly. You young doctors, always wanting to fix everything. Back in my day…well, nevermind. Get on with it. But be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a quick exam. Hmm. Yes, it's a fairly significant bunion. A bit of redness at the base, and… yes, there is some tenderness when I palpate here. And it appears to be affecting your gait slightly; I notice you’re favoring your right foot. How long would you say it’s been this tender, if you had to estimate?
PATIENT: Favoring my right foot? Nonsense. I walk perfectly fine. Maybe a little slower these days, but perfectly fine. And tenderness… well, I told you, it's been there for ages. Perhaps it's a little more sore lately, now that you mention it. But it’s just age, dear. Bones get achy. What kind of “procedure” is Estelle so worried about anyway? Is she thinking surgery? Because I’m not having surgery at my age.
DOCTOR: Estelle’s concern, as noted in her paperwork, was regarding a minimally invasive procedure called a bunionectomy. It is surgery, yes, but a much less invasive version than what was common even a few years ago. However, based on what I’m seeing, it doesn’t necessarily require immediate intervention. We can try conservative management first – orthotics, wider shoes, possibly some anti-inflammatory medication. But before we do anything, I’d like to get some X-rays to assess the severity and rule out any underlying arthritis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-rays? Honestly, dear, I've had X-rays. More than I care to remember. And I’ve looked at enough X-rays to know when someone is trying to frighten me with big words. Orthotics? Wider shoes? I've been managing perfectly well for decades, thank you very much. It sounds like you're trying to build a case for some unnecessary… poking and prodding. I appreciate your concern, truly, but I think I'll stick with what I know. Is Estelle here? I’d like to speak to her directly. I’m sure she’s explained everything to you. She always thinks she knows best.
DOCTOR: Wynell, with all due respect, you’ve come to me for a medical assessment. While your experience is certainly valuable, I am obligated to provide a thorough examination and recommend the best course of treatment based on current medical standards. I understand your skepticism, but dismissing potential issues simply because you’ve managed for a long time isn’t responsible medical care. And no, Estelle is not here. She scheduled the appointment and provided me with her concerns, which I am taking seriously. However, I am speaking to you, the patient. To proceed, I need to get those X-rays. It’s a standard diagnostic tool and will give us a clear picture of what’s going on. Will you allow me to order them, or would you prefer to seek a second opinion elsewhere?
PATIENT: Well, aren’t you a piece of work. “Piece of work.” Honestly. Pushing me for X-rays like I'm some… some simpleton who doesn't understand her own body. I've been a podiatrist for fifty years, I think I'm perfectly capable of knowing what I need. But fine. Order your precious X-rays. Just don't expect me to jump for joy when you tell me everything I already know. And don’t bother calling Estelle. Just get it over with. But I’m warning you, if this keeps me from my bridge game… .
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve ordered the X-rays. They can be done here in the clinic, and it will take about fifteen minutes. The technician will be in shortly to escort you. In the meantime, I’ll step out and review your chart again. Please, just sit comfortably and someone will be with you soon. .
