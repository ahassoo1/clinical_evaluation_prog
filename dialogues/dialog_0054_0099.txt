DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Dashevsky. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received some… unusual results from a test regarding my stomach, an endoscopic test, I believe it was called. The office suggested I come in to discuss them, as they were… abnormal. I must confess, I wasn’t entirely certain what to make of them myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, Denis. An endoscopic test… right. That’s a good place to start. Abnormal results can certainly be concerning, and it's perfectly normal to feel unsure what they mean. Don’t worry, we’ll go through everything together. To help me understand, could you tell me a bit more about why you had the endoscopic test in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, for several months now, I’ve been experiencing some discomfort in my abdomen. Not a sharp pain, mind you, more of a… persistent ache, and sometimes a feeling of fullness even after eating only a small amount. It began gradually, but it has become… noticeable. My primary care physician suggested the test to investigate the cause of these symptoms. He thought it best to rule out anything serious, you see. I have been trying to recall if anything specific triggered it, but I cannot pinpoint anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so persistent abdominal ache and feeling full quickly, even with small meals. That’s helpful. And it started gradually, no specific trigger you can recall. How long ago did these symptoms begin, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me see… I believe it was around November of last year. Yes, November 2024, if my memory serves. It was shortly after the Day of the Dead celebrations. At first, I dismissed it as perhaps something I had eaten, a bit of indigestion. But it didn’t resolve, and as I mentioned, it slowly became more persistent. It’s… unsettling, to feel something isn’t quite right. Do you require a more precise date, Doctor? I kept a small calendar at the time, if that would be of assistance.
DOCTOR: No, November 2024 is perfectly fine for now, Denis. You have a good memory! It’s good you can recall that detail. Now, besides the ache and fullness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I do try to maintain a clear recollection of things. Let me see… yes, actually. There has been some… change in my bowel movements. Not consistently, mind you, but occasionally I’ve noticed a darker colour. And… a slight feeling of fatigue, though I attributed that to my age, truthfully. I have also experienced a loss of appetite on occasion, but that’s intermittent. Is that… concerning? I apologize if I am being overly detailed. I simply wish to provide you with as much information as possible.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t apologize at all. It's very helpful to have as much detail as possible. Darker bowel movements, occasional fatigue, and intermittent loss of appetite… all things we need to consider. When you say darker bowel movements, can you describe the colour?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It is not… bright red, thankfully. It is more of a… very dark brown, almost black at times. Not every instance, mind you, but frequently darker than my usual stool. It’s difficult to describe precisely. It is not… tarry, if that makes sense. More… like very strong coffee grounds, though not as… granular. It occurred perhaps three or four times in the past few months. And again, it is not a constant occurrence. I apologize for the… indelicate nature of this conversation. It is not something one readily discusses.
DOCTOR: You’re not at all being indelicate, Denis. These things are part of medicine, and it's important we discuss them. It's good you can describe it like that – dark brown, almost black, not tarry, like strong coffee grounds. That’s very helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me see… I was diagnosed with mild hypertension approximately fifteen years ago, but it has been well-managed with medication for many years. Other than that, I have not had any serious illnesses. I had the usual childhood ailments, of course, but nothing significant. I had a rather uncomplicated pregnancy and childbirth, thankfully. My husband, may he rest in peace, was a very healthy man. I do not have any known allergies, and I am not currently taking any medications besides the medication for my blood pressure. I have been generally quite healthy, all things considered. I have always tried to maintain a healthy lifestyle, though admittedly, my activity level has decreased somewhat since my husband’s passing.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild hypertension well-managed with medication, no other significant medical history, no allergies, and just the blood pressure medication. I understand about your activity level decreasing since your husband’s passing – that’s perfectly understandable. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes, actually. Approximately thirty years ago, I underwent a hysterectomy. It was a relatively routine procedure, thankfully, and I recovered well. Other than that, I have not had any surgeries. I did have my wisdom teeth removed in my youth, but that hardly counts, does it? It was a rather unpleasant experience, but quite minor. I believe that is all. I remember being quite anxious before the hysterectomy, but the doctors were very kind and reassuring.
DOCTOR: Okay, hysterectomy thirty years ago, wisdom teeth removed. That's good to know. Now, thinking about your family… is there any history of stomach problems, colon cancer, or any other digestive issues in your family?
PATIENT: That is a… good question, Doctor. Let me see… my mother suffered from frequent indigestion, but it was never properly diagnosed. She attributed it to her nerves, truthfully. My father was a very stoic man, and he rarely spoke of his ailments. I believe he had some… discomfort in his abdomen occasionally, but he dismissed it as simply a part of aging. My paternal grandmother passed away at a relatively young age from pneumonia, and my maternal grandfather suffered from heart disease. I do not recall any instances of colon cancer or other serious digestive issues in my family, but my memory is not what it once was. I apologize if I am being vague. It has been many years since I inquired about my family’s medical history.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being vague at all, Denis. It's often difficult to recall family history accurately. Indigestion in your mother, some abdominal discomfort in your father… That gives us something to consider. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. I have never been a smoker. My husband was a smoker for a time, but he quit many years ago. He always regretted starting, truthfully. I have always believed in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I do not drink excessively. I find it… relaxing. And I enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning, though perhaps I should limit my intake. I do try to eat a balanced diet, with plenty of fruits and vegetables. I have always enjoyed cooking, and I find it… therapeutic.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Denis. It sounds like you do take good care of yourself. A glass of wine and a cup of coffee are perfectly reasonable. Now, before we proceed to a physical exam, let's talk about the results from your endoscopic test. Do you recall what the doctor told you about them at the time?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question, Doctor. I recall the doctor mentioning something about inflammation, and… polyps, I believe they were called. He used some… medical terminology that I did not fully understand. He said the results were… inconclusive, and that further investigation was required. He recommended I come here for a consultation. Honestly, Doctor, I was quite overwhelmed at the time, and I did not fully grasp the significance of the results. He simply said it was best to rule out anything serious. I apologize if I am being vague, but I simply cannot recall the specifics. I do remember feeling quite anxious after the procedure, and I have been somewhat worried ever since.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Denis. It's very common to feel overwhelmed after a procedure and not remember everything. Inflammation and polyps… yes, that's a good starting point. Polyps are growths in the lining of the stomach or colon, and they can be harmless, but sometimes they need to be removed and examined. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then gently press on it to check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I understand the need for a physical examination. Please, proceed at your own pace. I confess, I am somewhat apprehensive, but I trust your professional judgment. I simply wish to understand what is happening and receive the best possible care. I will do my best to remain still and cooperate fully. Is there anything specific I should be aware of during the examination?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Denis. Just relax and breathe normally. I'll let you know if I feel anything unusual. Okay, your bowel sounds are present, and I don’t hear anything immediately concerning. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. I'll start here on your right side. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that does not cause any particular discomfort. It feels… normal, as far as I can tell. I have experienced some mild discomfort in that area on occasion, but this is not the same sensation. It is… a dull ache, rather than a sharp pain. I have been trying to pinpoint the exact location of the discomfort, but it seems to shift around somewhat. It is… difficult to describe precisely. It is not… constant, either. It comes and goes, as I mentioned. I apologize if I am being overly detailed, but I simply wish to provide you with as much information as possible. Is there anything specific you are looking for during the examination?
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being overly detailed at all, Denis. That’s exactly what I need to know. It's good you can distinguish the difference between the discomfort you've been experiencing and what you're feeling now. Any tenderness here, in your upper stomach?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, actually. There is… a slight discomfort here, just below my ribs. It is not a sharp pain, more of a… pressure, a feeling of fullness. It is… difficult to describe precisely. It is not constant, either. It comes and goes, as I mentioned. I have experienced some similar discomfort after eating a large meal, but this is… less related to food intake, I believe. It is… a subtle sensation, but it is definitely present. It feels… different than the discomfort in my lower abdomen. It is… a dull ache, rather than a sharp pain. I apologize if I am being vague, but I simply wish to provide you with as much information as possible. Is that… concerning, Doctor? I confess, I am beginning to feel somewhat anxious.
DOCTOR: It's alright to feel anxious, Denis. We're just gathering information right now. Slight discomfort in your upper abdomen, below the ribs, more of a pressure than a sharp pain… that’s helpful to know. I’m noting that. It's good you can distinguish it from the discomfort you feel lower down. Now, let's check your left side. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that does not cause any particular discomfort. It feels… normal, as far as I can tell. I have experienced some mild bloating on occasion, but this is not the same sensation. It feels… much like the right side of my abdomen, truthfully. I have not experienced any significant discomfort in that area, as far as I can recall. It feels… relatively comfortable, as far as I can tell. It is… difficult to describe precisely, but I have not experienced any particular pain or discomfort in that area. It feels… much like the right side of my abdomen, truthfully. I apologize if I am being vague, but I simply wish to provide you with as much information as possible. Is there anything specific you are looking for during the examination? I confess, I am beginning to feel somewhat apprehensive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Denis. Thank you for your patience. So, to summarize, you have some mild discomfort in your upper abdomen, below the ribs, feeling like pressure rather than sharp pain, and no significant discomfort in your lower abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, and I didn't feel any masses or other abnormalities. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it's still unclear what's causing your symptoms. The results from your endoscopic test mentioning inflammation and polyps are concerning, and we need to investigate further. Do you recall if the doctor who performed the endoscopy took any biopsies?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I believe he did. I recall him mentioning something about taking some… small samples of tissue. He said they would be sent to a laboratory for analysis. He said it was… standard procedure, to rule out any serious underlying condition. He said the results would take several days to come back. I recall feeling quite anxious after the procedure, and I have been somewhat worried ever since. I simply cannot recall the specifics, but I do remember him mentioning biopsies. Is that… concerning, Doctor? I confess, I am beginning to feel somewhat anxious. I apologize if I am being vague, but I simply wish to provide you with as much information as possible.
DOCTOR: That's very important information, Denis. The biopsies are key. We need to obtain those results to determine the next steps. Do you have any paperwork from the endoscopy with the lab's contact information?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I believe I do. I have a folder with all the paperwork from the procedure, including the report and some… instructions for follow-up care. I believe the lab's contact information is included in that folder. I also have the contact information for the doctor who performed the endoscopy, if that would be helpful. I will retrieve the folder for you, if you would like. It is in my handbag, just here. I apologize for the… disorganization. I have not been myself since my husband’s passing.
DOCTOR: Please, don't apologize at all, Denis. Take your time. It’s perfectly understandable to be a little disorganised during a difficult time. Getting those results is the priority. I appreciate you going to the effort of bringing the paperwork. Once we have those results, we can discuss the best course of action.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I have highlighted the report and the lab's contact information, just in case. I believe the doctor's name is Dr. Ramirez. I apologize if I am being vague, but I simply wish to provide you with as much information as possible. Please, do not hesitate to ask if you require any further clarification. I simply wish to understand what is happening and receive the best possible care.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Denis. This is very helpful. Okay, I’m going to contact the lab now and request a copy of the biopsy results. It may take a few minutes for them to respond. While I'm doing that, could you tell me a little bit more about your diet?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I do try to maintain a balanced diet, with plenty of fruits and vegetables. I enjoy cooking, and I prefer to prepare my own meals whenever possible. I limit my intake of processed foods and sugary drinks, but I do indulge in a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I also enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning, but I have been trying to reduce my caffeine intake. I eat a variety of meats, poultry, and fish, but I prefer to eat lean proteins. I also enjoy eating whole grains and legumes. I do not have any dietary restrictions or allergies, as far as I am aware. I simply wish to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. Is there anything specific you are looking for regarding my diet? Perhaps you are looking for certain foods that may exacerbate my symptoms? I apologize if I am being vague, but I simply wish to provide you with as much information as possible.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being vague at all. That’s all very helpful information, Denis. It sounds like you have a very healthy diet, which is good. Knowing that helps us rule out certain possibilities. Okay, I’ve contacted the lab. They are having some technical difficulties retrieving your results at the moment. They said it may take a few hours for them to resolve the issue. They will fax the results to me as soon as they are available. In the meantime… let’s talk about your current medications again. Are you absolutely certain you're only taking medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am absolutely certain. I only take medication for my blood pressure. I have not taken any other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies in recent memory. I have a strict routine, and I rarely deviate from it. I simply wish to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. I have not taken any over-the-counter medications, either, such as pain relievers or antacids. I am very careful about what I put into my body. I have not taken any vitamins or minerals, either. I simply wish to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. I apologize if I am being repetitive, but I simply wish to provide you with as much information as possible. It is… unsettling, to feel something is not quite right, and I simply wish to rule out any potential causes. I confess, I am beginning to feel somewhat anxious. Is there anything specific you are looking for regarding my medications? Perhaps you are looking for certain medications that may exacerbate my symptoms?
DOCTOR: No, you're not being repetitive at all. It's important to be thorough. And I understand your anxiety. It's good to rule everything out. Okay. Given your symptoms – the upper abdominal discomfort, the dark bowel movements, the inflammation and polyps found during the endoscopy, and the fact that you're on no other medications… we need to consider a few possibilities. While we wait for the biopsy results, I want to be upfront with you. We need to rule out more serious conditions, such as stomach cancer or a peptic ulcer. I don't want to alarm you, but it's important to be prepared. We'll do further testing, including a possible CT scan, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and… stomach cancer? Doctor, that… that is quite alarming. I… I understand the need for further testing, of course. But… stomach cancer? I… I had no idea. Yes, Doctor. Please, proceed with whatever testing is necessary. I… I simply wish to understand what is happening and receive the best possible care. But… please, be honest with me. Is it… serious? Is there… hope?
DOCTOR: Denis, it’s understandable that you’re feeling alarmed and upset. I want to be honest with you, and that means explaining everything clearly. The presence of inflammation and polyps can be a sign of stomach cancer, but it doesn't automatically mean you have cancer. Many polyps are benign, and inflammation can have other causes. That’s why the biopsy is so important. It will tell us definitively what we’re dealing with. A CT scan will help us determine if the cancer has spread, if it is present. We'll look for any abnormalities in your stomach, lymph nodes, and other organs. Regarding hope… yes, there is always hope. Even if the biopsy shows cancer, early detection significantly improves the chances of successful treatment. There are various treatment options available, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Right now, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. We’re gathering information, and we’ll develop a treatment plan based on the results. I will be with you every step of the way. Do you have any family or friends you would like to have with you for support?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate your honesty. And your reassurance. It… it is simply overwhelming. My daughter… she lives in the city. I… I suppose I could call her. She is… very supportive. But… I didn’t want to worry her unnecessarily. Not yet. What… what happens next? When will I know the results of the biopsy? And… what will the CT scan involve? I… I have never had one before. Is it… painful? I apologize for all the questions. I am simply… frightened.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be frightened, Denis. You're allowed to feel all of those emotions. And please, ask as many questions as you need. That's what I'm here for. The lab said they would prioritize your biopsy results and fax them to me as soon as they are available. Typically, it takes 2-3 business days, but I will call them regularly to check on the progress. I expect to have the results by Friday at the latest. Regarding the CT scan… it's a relatively painless procedure. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. The machine uses X-rays to create detailed images of your internal organs. You may be asked to drink a contrast dye beforehand to help improve the clarity of the images. Some people experience a warm sensation during the scan, and you may need to hold your breath for a few seconds at a time. The scan usually takes about 30 minutes. There is a small amount of radiation involved in the scan, but the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. I will explain the procedure in more detail before the scan, and you can ask any questions you have. For now, let’s focus on getting through the next few days. Try to stay as calm as possible, and I’ll keep you updated on the progress of the biopsy results. Would you like me to write down the lab's contact number for you, in case you want to check on it yourself?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. That would be very helpful. And… thank you. Thank you for your kindness. And your patience. I… I suppose I should call my daughter. But… I am afraid of what she will say. And what she will think. What… what should I tell her? Do I tell her everything? Or do I wait until I know more? I… I am simply overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Here you go. That's a difficult question, Denis. It's entirely up to you how much you want to tell your daughter. Some people find comfort in sharing their worries with loved ones, while others prefer to wait until they have more information. If you're not ready to tell her everything, you could simply tell her that you're experiencing some health concerns and that you're undergoing some tests. You could let her know that you'll keep her updated on your progress. That way, she'll be aware of the situation without getting overly worried. Ultimately, the decision is yours. Do what feels right for you. And remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. If you need someone to talk to, please don't hesitate to call. Now, do you have any other questions for me at the moment?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that is all for now. I… I simply need to process everything. Thank you. Thank you for your kindness. And your patience. And your honesty. I… I suppose I should go home. And call my daughter. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. Please, take your time. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I will be in touch as soon as I have the biopsy results. Take care of yourself, and try to stay positive. I’m thinking of you. .
