DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you too. I just… moved here. And I need to, like, get set up with a doctor, I think? My husband said something about needing to do this for… insurance? I don’t really remember all the details. Medicare, I think it was called?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Getting established with a primary care physician is a good first step, especially with new insurance. And Medicare is a very common plan. It’s good your husband prompted you to do this. So, even though you're establishing care, is there anything specific that's bothering you right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I feel okay, I guess. A little tired sometimes, but… I always feel a little tired. Nothing major, no. Just trying to get everything sorted, you know? It’s all kind of… blurry, moving and everything.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Moving is a big undertaking, and it can certainly be overwhelming. It's very common to feel a bit off when you're adjusting to a new environment. Alright. Well, let's start with a general check-up then, just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks good. We can go over your medical history and any concerns you might have as we go. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… I don't think so. Not that I know of, anyway. My mom always said I was lucky like that. I don’t remember ever having a bad reaction to anything, but… I don’t really remember a lot of things, to be honest. Is that okay? Should I try to think harder?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. It's very common for people to not remember every detail of their medical past. We'll take things slowly, and if anything comes to mind later, you can always let me know. We can also look through any records you might have from previous doctors, if available. For now, let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My husband gives me something… a little orange pill, every morning? He says it’s for… something. I forget what. And sometimes I take… Tylenol, if my head hurts. But that’s it, I think. He handles most of that stuff, to be honest. I just… take what he gives me. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you're mentioning this, Emileigh. It's important for me to know everything you're taking, even if it seems minor. Do you know the dosage of the orange pill?
PATIENT: No, I don't. He just hands it to me with breakfast. I… I really don’t ask a lot of questions. He knows best, he always says. I think it’s a small one though? Not a big pill.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's good you're sharing this with me. While it’s wonderful to have someone who cares for you, it's really important that you also understand what medications you're taking, the dosage, and why. It's for your own safety, and it helps me provide the best possible care. We may want to consider getting a list of your husband’s medications to review. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Um… I don't know if he’d like that. He gets… upset sometimes when I ask too many questions. He just wants me to be healthy, I think. But… I guess if it’s important for you, I could try. It might cause a bit of a… fuss, though.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Emileigh. Your comfort is my priority. We don’t have to do anything you're not comfortable with right away. It’s important to me that we proceed at your pace. For now, let's focus on what we do know. You mentioned feeling a little tired sometimes. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Okay. Yeah, tired… It’s just… a general feeling of being worn out, I guess. Not like, I can’t get out of bed tired, but… like I haven’t had enough sleep, even when I have. It's been going on for… a while, I think. Months, maybe? It’s hard to remember. It doesn’t really stop me from doing things, but… it’s always there, in the background.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a persistent fatigue, present for months, not debilitating but noticeable. Do you notice it getting worse at any particular time of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. It’s pretty much the same all day, I think. Maybe a little worse in the afternoons? But not much. It doesn’t get worse when I’m busy, or anything. I work at the… the shop. Fixing things. It doesn’t make it worse, no. It’s just… always there. Like a low hum.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I… I have been a little forgetful lately. More than usual, I think. But… I was always a little forgetful, so it’s hard to tell. My husband jokes about it all the time. He says I lose my keys more than anyone he knows. It’s probably just… me being me. But… I feel like it’s been a little worse lately, maybe? Like… I forget things that happened yesterday. Or… what I was talking about mid-sentence. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased forgetfulness, including recent events and difficulty with recall mid-sentence. That's good information to share. It's helpful you're noticing these changes. Is this forgetfulness interfering with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Not really… yet. I still go to work, I still cook… My husband helps me remember things sometimes, like appointments. But… I feel like I’m relying on him more and more. It’s… worrying, a little. I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel worried when you notice changes in your memory, Emileigh. And it's good you're aware of it. We’ll work together to figure out what’s going on. To get a better understanding, let’s go over your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… I… don't really know. Not that I remember, anyway. I went to the doctor when I was a kid, I guess. For shots and stuff. But I don't remember ever being told I had anything wrong with me. My husband says I had… something with my ears when I was little? But I don't remember that either. It was a long time ago. Is there a way to find out? Like… a list or something?
DOCTOR: Yes, there is. We can request your medical records from any previous doctors you may have seen. That might give us some clues. Alright. Let’s move on to past surgeries. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Um… I think… maybe? When I was little, I had… something done to my tonsils? But I was really young, so I don't really remember it. And… I think I broke my arm once, but that was a long time ago. My husband would probably know more about that stuff. He remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll try to get those details clarified with your medical records. Let's talk about your family history now. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… that's… a hard one. I don't really know my family very well. My mom… she passed away when I was young. And I don't talk to my dad much. My husband says… his mom had something with her heart? And his dad had… diabetes, I think? But I don't really know much about it. Is that bad? Should I know more?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It's common for people to have limited information about their family medical history. We can work with what you do know, and sometimes we can get more information later if you're comfortable. Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never have. My husband doesn't like any of that stuff, and I… I don't really have a desire for it. He says it's bad for your health, and I trust him.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, finally, let's talk about allergies. You mentioned you didn't think you had any, but just to be sure, are you allergic to any medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… no. I really don't think so. I've never had a reaction to anything. Maybe… I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm outside? But that's probably just bugs. I don't think it's an allergy. I really don't know much about allergies, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Emileigh. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. I know it's a lot of information, and it sounds like you've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately. Based on what you've told me – the persistent fatigue, increased forgetfulness, and some vague recollections – I think it would be a good idea to run a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah… that sounds… okay. If it will help. What kind of tests? Are they… painful? I don't like needles very much. And… will it take long? I have to get back to work, eventually.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. We’ll take things slowly, and I’ll explain everything as we go. The tests I’m thinking about are just some routine blood work. It will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and a few other things that can cause fatigue and memory problems. The blood draw itself is usually quick – just a few minutes. And yes, there will be a needle, but it's usually a very small one, and most people don't find it very painful. We'll do it as gently as possible. It should only take about 30 minutes to an hour for the blood draw and any necessary preliminary paperwork. We can schedule it for a time that works best for you. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… 30 minutes, you said? I guess that's… okay. As long as I can get back to work afterwards. Could we do it… tomorrow morning? If that's possible. And… could you tell me what you're looking for in the blood work? Just… so I know what's going on?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Tomorrow morning works perfectly. We can schedule it for 9:00 AM. And of course, I’m happy to explain what we're looking for. The blood work will help us rule out things like vitamin deficiencies – especially vitamin B12 and vitamin D, which can cause fatigue and memory problems. We'll also check your thyroid function because an underactive thyroid can cause similar symptoms. We’ll also look at your blood sugar levels to rule out diabetes. And just a general assessment of your organ function to make sure everything is working as it should. It’s a pretty standard panel, and it will give us a good starting point to understand what might be causing your symptoms. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah… that makes a little more sense. Vitamin… and thyroid… okay. So, you're just looking for things that might be… wrong? And then you'll tell me what to do?
DOCTOR: Exactly. We're looking for anything that might be contributing to how you're feeling. Once we have the results, we can discuss them with you and create a plan together. That might involve lifestyle changes, medication, or further testing if needed. We’ll take things one step at a time. For now, let’s focus on getting the blood work done tomorrow. Do you have any questions about the appointment itself?
PATIENT: Um… no. I don’t think so. Just… where do I go? And… do I need to bring anything? Like… a list of the stuff I take? I think my husband has it written down somewhere. I don’t want to forget anything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. You’ll check in at the front desk when you arrive tomorrow morning. The lab is just down the hall to the left. And yes, if you could bring a list of the medications you’re taking, that would be great, if you can find it. But if you don’t have it, don’t worry. We can always get the information later. Do you have any other questions for me today, Emileigh?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Glazewski. For explaining everything. And for not… making me feel silly. It’s just… hard to remember things sometimes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. It's my job to help you feel comfortable and understand what's going on. And please, don't ever feel silly for asking questions. Your health is the most important thing. We'll see you tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. If you think of anything else before then, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good rest of your day.
