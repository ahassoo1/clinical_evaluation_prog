DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Quicksey. It is good to meet you as well. I am here because… my ear. It is leaking something. It started, let me think… about three days ago, I believe. It is the left ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. So, this leakage is from your left ear, and it started roughly three days ago. Can you describe what the leaking looks like?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. It is… not water. It is a little… yellow. And… sticky. Not much comes out, but when I touch my ear, it is there. It does not hurt, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Like something is in there.
DOCTOR: Alright, yellow and sticky discharge, not a large amount, and more of an uncomfortable sensation than pain. That's helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever. My hearing… it is a little quiet in that ear, yes. Not much different, but… less sound, maybe? And sometimes, a little… ringing. Not all the time, though. Only when it is very quiet. Like now, when I am thinking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, some decreased hearing in the left ear, and occasional ringing, particularly in quiet environments. Have you experienced any dizziness or nausea along with this?
PATIENT: No dizziness, Doctor. And no… how you say? Feeling sick to my stomach. No nausea. I have been… careful to not get water in the ear, since it started. I do not swim, and I am very careful when I shower.
DOCTOR: Good to know you've been taking precautions. Now, have you had any ear problems in the past?
PATIENT: Yes. When I was a young man, in Somalia… I had many ear infections. Very painful. The doctor… he gave me drops. But it was a long time ago. Maybe twenty years? More. I have not had problems since, until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of ear infections in your youth, treated with ear drops. And this is the first issue you've had since then. Do you recall if those infections were in one ear or both?
PATIENT: I think… both ears. Yes, I remember being very sick with the pain. My mother, she would hold a warm cloth on my ears. But it was a long, long time ago. I do not remember which ear was worse, only that both were bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of ear infections in both ears as a young man. Now, let's talk about your medical history in general. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have… how you say? Other sicknesses. I am… mostly healthy. I walk every day, and I eat good food. My doctor, back in the city, he always said my heart was strong. No high blood pressure, no… sugar sickness. Just… old age, I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Nothing at all. I do not like taking pills if I can avoid it. I prefer… natural remedies, if possible. But for this ear… I do not know what to do. That is why I am here.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And you prefer natural remedies, which is perfectly fine. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I eat many things. I am not sensitive to dust or… plants or anything. I have never had a… reaction. I have been lucky, I think. My wife… she was allergic to many things, but I… no.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. It is… bad for the health. My father, he smoked, and he… was sick often. I learned from his mistakes. I prefer fresh air.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Sometimes, Doctor. A little wine with dinner, maybe one or two times a week. Not much. I do not drink… strong liquor. Just wine. Red wine. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly reasonable. A glass or two of red wine a week is unlikely to be a problem. Now, before we move on to a quick examination, is there anything else you think I should know about your current symptoms or your medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Oh! My grandson, he had a very bad ear infection last year. The doctor said it was… fluid in the ear. He had to get tubes put in. Is that what I have, do you think? The fluid? I worry it is something like that. Perhaps it runs in the family.
DOCTOR: That’s a good thought, and it’s always helpful to consider family history. It is possible this could be related to fluid in the ear, but we need to take a look to be sure. Would you mind if I examined your ears?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Please, examine my ears. I want to know what is happening. I trust your judgment. I will do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Mr. Radillo, let's take a look. I’m going to use an otoscope to examine your ear canal. It might be a little cool, but it shouldn’t hurt. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. Okay. I see some cerumen, or earwax, present. There’s a slight redness of the ear canal, and I do see some yellowish discharge, as you described. The eardrum itself appears slightly clouded, and I can’t see it clearly due to the discharge. It’s difficult to assess the mobility of the eardrum at this point. Based on this initial examination, it appears you may have an outer ear infection, also known as otitis externa, potentially with some fluid build-up. The redness and discharge are consistent with an infection, and the clouded eardrum suggests inflammation. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out a middle ear infection, I’d like to perform a tympanometry test. It's a quick and painless test that measures the movement of your eardrum. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If you think it is necessary to check the… tympanometry, then please do. I want to know what is happening. It is good you are being thorough. I trust your expertise. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Mr. Radillo, this test will only take a few moments. I'm going to gently insert a small probe into your ear canal – it’s similar to the otoscope, but it doesn’t go as deep. It will create a small puff of air, and you might feel a slight sensation of pressure. Try to remain still and quiet during the test. We’ll test both ears just to compare. Okay, the tympanometry results show reduced mobility in your left eardrum, which supports the possibility of fluid or inflammation. It’s not a definitive diagnosis on its own, but combined with the physical examination, it strengthens the suspicion of an outer ear infection, possibly with some fluid accumulation. Based on all the information we’ve gathered – your symptoms, your medical history, and the examination results – I believe you are likely experiencing acute otitis externa, or an outer ear infection. The fluid build-up could be contributing to your decreased hearing and the ringing you’ve been experiencing. I would recommend a course of antibiotic ear drops to treat the infection. I'm also going to prescribe a steroid ear drop to help reduce inflammation and swelling. We’ll also want to keep the ear dry, so I'll advise you on some ear plug options. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. If that is what is happening, then I want to treat it. Ear drops… that sounds manageable. And keeping it dry… I can do that. I will get ear plugs. Tell me about the drops, please. How often do I put them in? And for how long? And what should I do if it does not get better?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m going to prescribe you two types of ear drops: Ciprofloxacin otic solution and Hydrocortisone otic suspension. The Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that will fight the infection, and the Hydrocortisone will help reduce the inflammation and discomfort. You will need to instill 3 drops of each medication into your left ear twice a day for 7 days. It's important to lie on your side with the affected ear facing upwards during and after instilling the drops to allow the medication to properly reach the ear canal. After instilling the drops, remain lying on your side for 5 minutes to maximize the effectiveness. It's also crucial to avoid getting water in your ear during this treatment period. Use earplugs when showering or bathing. If your symptoms do not improve within 3-5 days of starting the medication, or if they worsen at any time – if you experience increased pain, fever, or discharge – please contact the office immediately. We may need to re-evaluate your condition and consider alternative treatment options. Do you have any questions about the medication or the instructions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… very clear. Three drops, twice a day, for seven days. Lie on my side for five minutes. And avoid water. And if it gets worse, I call. I think I understand. Will I need to come back for a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: Yes, I would like to see you back in one week for a follow-up appointment to reassess your condition and ensure the infection is resolving. We’ll repeat the ear examination to check for any remaining inflammation or discharge. The appointment can be scheduled at the front desk before you leave. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms, such as high fever, severe pain, dizziness, or hearing loss, please do not hesitate to contact the office. I’m going to print out these instructions for you, along with a prescription for the ear drops. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have been very helpful, and I appreciate your thoroughness. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I will schedule the follow-up appointment before I leave.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Wishing you a speedy recovery. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well.
