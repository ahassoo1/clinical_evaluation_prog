DOCTOR: Good morning, Alese. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is lovely to meet you as well. Oh, my… where to begin? Well, it’s this pain, you see. In my lower abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it does come… it’s quite severe. I believe that’s what prompted the visit. I… I have something called SLE, I think? Or is it lupus? It’s all a bit muddled, to be honest. I've been having these episodes for a little while now, and they're becoming… more frequent, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Okay, abdominal pain, coming and going, and you suspect it might be related to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, or SLE. It's perfectly understandable that things feel muddled with a condition like that. We'll definitely try to clarify everything today. When you say “a little while now,” can you give me a rough estimate of how long you’ve been experiencing these pain episodes?
PATIENT: Oh dear, a rough estimate… that is difficult. Let me think… it feels like… several months, perhaps? Six, maybe? It’s hard to pinpoint, as they started gradually. At first, it was just a discomfort, easily dismissed. But they've grown stronger, and… more worrisome. I truly apologize for my vagueness, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize at all, Alese. It's perfectly normal for things to be fuzzy, especially when you're dealing with a chronic condition. Six months… that gives us a good starting point. And you mentioned the pain is in your lower abdomen. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Hmm… it's… a cramping sort of pain, I suppose. Like a very strong menstrual cramp, even though that hasn’t been an issue for… well, a very long time! But sharp, at times, and… achy, other times. It’s difficult to describe. It feels… deep inside, you know? And it radiates a bit, to my back sometimes. It’s… rather unpleasant, to put it mildly. I do find myself just… curling up when it’s at its worst.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping, sharp, achy pain, deep inside, radiating to your back… and it makes you want to curl up. That helps me get a better picture. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you give the pain at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh my. A scale, you say? Let me think… zero to ten… at its worst… it’s… well, it’s quite debilitating. I believe… an eight? Perhaps even a nine on some occasions. It truly takes my breath away, and makes it very difficult to function. I’ve never had anything quite like it before the SLE… or lupus… started. I do try to manage with… gentle remedies, but they don’t seem to be as effective anymore.
DOCTOR: Eight or nine… that is significant. And it's concerning that your usual remedies aren't helping as much. I understand you've been diagnosed with SLE, or lupus. Do you have records of that diagnosis, or the name of the doctor who diagnosed you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… records. That's… a tricky question. I believe Dr. Elara Vance diagnosed me, years ago. She was… a wonderful physician, but I seem to recall she retired. As for records… I’m honestly not certain. I’ve moved several times since then, and things… tend to get misplaced. I apologize again for my disorganization, Doctor. I do have a general practitioner who may have access to some of my medical history, if that is helpful? His name is Dr. Ito. I believe he’s in the city.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Alese. Dr. Vance… and Dr. Ito. That's very helpful information. We can certainly reach out to Dr. Ito for your records. In the meantime, let’s talk about your current medications, if you're taking any. And also, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, medications. I take… Plaquenil, I believe, for the SLE. And… a low dose of something for my blood pressure. I forget the name. It’s a small white pill. As for other symptoms… well, I do get very tired, quite often. And… sometimes I have a rash. It’s usually on my face, around my cheeks. It’s not always present, but it flares up with the pain, I think. Oh, and my joints ache, too. Not constantly, but… frequently. It's all rather interconnected, isn't it? A terrible, interconnected mess. I truly apologize for being so vague, Doctor. It's all just… a blur.
DOCTOR: Please, don't apologize. You're providing me with very important information, and it’s not vague at all. Plaquenil for SLE, medication for blood pressure… fatigue, rash on your face, and joint aches. That gives me a clearer picture. Now, about the rash… does it itch, burn, or is it mostly just visible?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. It doesn’t itch terribly, no. It’s more… sensitive. A burning sensation, at times, especially when I’m in the sun. It’s also… a bit scaly, I suppose. It’s not always raised, but it’s definitely noticeable. It tends to get worse with the pain, as I mentioned. And it’s… rather persistent, once it appears. It fades eventually, but it always seems to return, you know? It’s a bit… disheartening, to be honest. I try to protect my skin, but it’s difficult, as I enjoy being outdoors.
DOCTOR: Sensitive, burning, scaly rash, worsens with sun exposure and pain… and it comes back even with sun protection. That's very helpful. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Aside from the SLE, have you had any other significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh my, past medical history… let me think. I had my appendix removed as a young woman, many years ago. That was… uneventful, thankfully. And… I broke my wrist once, when I was a child. Aside from that… I don’t recall anything particularly significant. I’ve always been reasonably healthy, all things considered. Until… the SLE, of course. It’s… a rather debilitating condition, as you know. I apologize for my rambling, Doctor. My mind isn’t what it once was, and I’m afraid I’m not very organized.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize at all. Appendectomy, broken wrist… that's good to know. And you're not rambling. It's important to get a complete picture. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a good question. Let me see… My mother had arthritis, I believe. And my father… he had high blood pressure, similar to myself. As for anything else… not that I’m aware of. My family wasn’t particularly forthcoming about medical issues, to be honest. They were… a rather private bunch. I apologize for my vagueness, Doctor. It’s difficult to recall details from so long ago. It's all… rather muddled, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, high blood pressure in your father. That's helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions, Alese. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, lifestyle… well, I live alone, in a quiet suburban neighborhood. I enjoy gardening, when the weather permits. And… I used to travel quite extensively, but that’s become more difficult in recent years. I enjoy reading, and spending time with my… friends, when I’m able. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I try to maintain a healthy diet, but… it’s sometimes difficult, with my… fatigue, you know? It's all rather… mundane, to be honest. Nothing particularly exciting. I apologize for being so boring, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Not at all boring, Alese. It’s good to know you enjoy gardening and reading. And that you maintain a healthy lifestyle as much as possible. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. I don’t believe I have any allergies to medications. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. And… no food allergies, either. I’m fortunate in that regard. I apologize for my vagueness, Doctor. It's just… difficult to remember details from so long ago. My mind isn't what it once was, you know? I truly appreciate your patience with me.
DOCTOR: You’re not vague at all, Alese. You’ve given me a lot of valuable information. Thank you for being so open and honest with me. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and look at the rash on your face. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. A physical exam seems… sensible. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed at your own pace. I apologize if I’m not very… cooperative. My joints sometimes ache, and it can be difficult to move quickly. But I will do my best to assist you in any way I can. Thank you for your patience, Doctor. I truly appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Alese. I’m just listening to your heart and lungs now. Take some nice, deep breaths for me. Everything sounds clear on both sides. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or painful. Okay… and I see the rash on your face. It does appear somewhat scaly and inflamed. It's primarily around your cheeks, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's correct. Primarily around my cheeks. It does sometimes spread a bit, but it’s always most prominent there. And… yes, it does feel a bit tender when you press. Not excruciatingly painful, but… uncomfortable. A burning sensation, perhaps? It's difficult to describe. Oh… that’s a bit sensitive, there. Yes, that’s where the pain is often most concentrated. I truly apologize if I’m being difficult. It’s just… it's a rather… elusive pain, you know?
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Alese. You're not being difficult at all. It's good that you pointed that out. Tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly around that spot. That’s important information. Okay… I’m also checking your joints now. I’m gently moving your wrists, fingers, and knees. Do you notice any pain or stiffness in your joints as I move them?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My wrists feel a bit… stiff, and a bit achy. Not excruciatingly painful, but… uncomfortable. And my fingers, too. Especially in the morning. They feel… swollen, sometimes. And my knees… they occasionally creak, and ache after I’ve been sitting for a while. Oh… that’s a bit tender, there. Yes, that’s where it often hurts the most. It's a rather… persistent ache, you know? It comes and goes, but it’s always there, lurking in the background. I truly apologize for being so… verbose. It’s just… difficult to describe.
DOCTOR: No apology needed, Alese. You're providing me with very important information, and it’s not verbose at all. Stiffness and aching in your wrists, fingers, and knees… tenderness at the base of your thumb. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like your symptoms are consistent with a lupus flare. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your inflammation levels, kidney function, and rule out any other underlying conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Blood tests seem… prudent. I trust your judgment. Anything that might help determine the cause of this… discomfort, I’m willing to try. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant? And… I don’t mind a bit of discomfort, if it means we can get to the bottom of this. I truly appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. It’s… reassuring to know you’re taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, your insurance is relevant, and I’ll make sure everything is submitted correctly. We'll get the lab orders sent over right away. The tests will check for things like your complete blood count, inflammation markers like ESR and CRP, kidney and liver function, and some specific lupus antibodies. It may take a few days to get the results back. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Alese?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. You’ve been remarkably thorough, and you’ve answered all of my questions, even the ones I didn’t know I had. I truly appreciate your patience and kindness. It’s… a relief to finally feel like someone is listening. Thank you for your time, Doctor Asami. I look forward to hearing from your nurse when the results are available. Please, don’t hesitate to contact me if you need anything further.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alese. I'm glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to contact us if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or have any concerns in the meantime. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
