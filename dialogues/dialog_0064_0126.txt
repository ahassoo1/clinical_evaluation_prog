DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been a bit odd lately. I’ve just been awfully thirsty, no matter how much I drink, and hungry all the time. It's quite disruptive, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Alright, disruptive is good to know. That's helpful. Thirsty and hungry all the time… hmm. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, I’d say, maybe six or seven weeks ago? At first, I thought it was just the warmer weather, but it hasn’t really let up, even with the slightly cooler days we’ve had. It’s… persistent.
DOCTOR: Six or seven weeks… okay. And has anything else changed alongside the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been going to the bathroom more often. Especially at night. It's a nuisance, really. I’m not sure if that’s connected, though. Just thought I’d offer it.
DOCTOR: That is connected, Christen, very likely. Increased urination, especially at night… that gives us a little more to work with. Now, are you experiencing any blurry vision, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, not particularly. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, mind you, but it hasn’t gotten worse recently. As for weight loss… I haven't been weighing myself regularly, but my trousers feel a bit looser, if that makes sense. Not a dramatic change, but noticeable. I wouldn't say I've been trying to lose weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, trousers feeling looser... alright. And do you have any family history of diabetes, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother… she had something with her sugar levels, I believe. It wasn’t very well discussed, to be honest. She passed away a few years ago. My father was generally healthy, as far as I know. No major illnesses. I’m not aware of any other family history, no. It's… a bit hazy, I’m afraid. I wasn't very involved in their medical affairs.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it's common for those details to be a bit unclear. Okay. Now, let's talk about your general habits. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I… enjoy a glass of whisky now and then, perhaps a couple on the weekend. Nothing excessive, I assure you. It’s mostly just… a relaxing habit. I wouldn’t call myself a heavy drinker.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of whiskies on the weekend. Noted. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat a balanced diet. I work in shipping and receiving, so I’m quite active on my feet all day. I usually have a sandwich for lunch, something simple. Dinner is typically… a home-cooked meal. Meat and vegetables, mostly. I do enjoy a sweet treat sometimes, but I wouldn’t say I overindulge. I suppose it’s fairly standard. Nothing overly processed, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright, Christen, based on what you’ve told me – the increased thirst, frequent urination, the slight weight loss, and the family history – it sounds like we need to rule out diabetes. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and then order some blood tests to get a clearer picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I’d like to get to the bottom of this, as you say. Blood tests and an exam… yes, please. Let’s get on with it, if you will. I have a delivery schedule to manage, you see. I’d appreciate it if we could be as efficient as possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Christen. We’ll be as efficient as we can. Let's start with your vital signs. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature first. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief abdominal exam. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 78 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft to the touch, no tenderness noted. I’m going to ask you to step on the scale, if you don’t mind. Okay, 93 kilograms. That corresponds to a BMI of 32.2, placing you in the obese category. Now, I’m going to check your feet for any signs of neuropathy. Sensation appears intact, but I do notice some slight swelling in your ankles. Alright. That’s all for the physical exam. Now, I’ll get the lab order for the blood tests. We’ll be checking your fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and a complete metabolic panel. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials that I should be aware of before we draw the blood?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of, at least. No reaction to anything at the dentist or anything like that. And I appreciate you being so thorough. It’s… reassuring. Let’s just get these tests done, shall we? I’m hoping it’s nothing too serious, of course. But I’d rather know, one way or the other.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Christen. That’s the best approach. We’ll get these results back as quickly as possible, usually within 24-48 hours. The lab technician will explain the procedure. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results. In the meantime, I would recommend staying well-hydrated and avoiding sugary drinks. Try to maintain a balanced diet as you’ve been doing, and we'll revisit your diet once we have the lab results. Is there anything else I can address for you today before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate your efficiency, and I’ll look forward to hearing from your nurse regarding the follow-up appointment. Hopefully, it’s nothing too alarming. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Christen. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. .
