DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’m here about… well, I heard about something that can help prevent HIV. A friend mentioned it, said it’s a daily pill. I figured it couldn’t hurt to ask, you know? I want to be careful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. That’s very proactive of you to be thinking about preventative measures. It sounds like you're asking about pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. It’s a medication taken daily to help prevent HIV infection. Before we discuss PrEP specifically, to ensure it’s the right option for you, could you tell me a bit more about your risk factors?
PATIENT: Risk factors… hmm. Well, I’m single, been that way for a while. And, honestly, dating isn’t exactly easy these days. I… I haven’t been with anyone regularly for a few years now, but I do occasionally meet people. Is that what you mean? I haven't really thought about risk factors, if that makes sense. I just want to be safe, no matter what.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Helaina. It’s good you’re prioritizing your safety. Any sexual activity carries some risk, and it’s responsible to consider preventative options. To help me understand a little better, and to determine if PrEP is appropriate, could you tell me about the types of sexual activity you've been involved in?
PATIENT: Oh… well, this is a bit personal, isn’t it? Okay. I've had relationships with men and women. Mostly men, over the years. And… it's been a while since anything happened, like I said. Does that matter? Is there a difference for… different partners? I really don't know much about this stuff.
DOCTOR: It is a bit personal, and I appreciate you sharing that with me, Helaina. It absolutely does matter, and no, you don't need to know all the details – just being open is helpful. PrEP is effective regardless of the gender of your partner. Have you ever been tested for HIV, or other sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I think… maybe three times? A long time ago, with a previous doctor. And once at a free clinic a few years back, just to be sure. Everything came back clear, as far as I know. Honestly, I don’t remember the specifics. It was a while ago, and I wasn’t really keeping detailed records then. I mostly just went because it felt like I should.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Having previous negative tests is helpful information. And it's perfectly alright not to remember every detail – we can always re-check if needed. Do you currently have any other medical conditions, or are you taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it's mostly controlled with a small dose of medication – lisinopril, I think it’s called. And I take a multivitamin, that’s about it. Oh! And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, they bother me sometimes. Other than that… no, not really. Nothing major, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional ibuprofen for your knees – thank you for letting me know. It's good we're accounting for those. Now, before we discuss starting PrEP, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and run some lab tests. This is standard procedure to ensure you're healthy enough to start the medication and to establish a baseline for monitoring. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I mean, I want to make sure it won't hurt me, so checking everything makes sense. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Let’s get it done. I just want to be safe, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Helaina. Safety is our priority. Okay, great. We'll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. After that, we'll need to draw some blood for HIV testing , kidney function tests, and a few other routine blood tests. It will take about 15-20 minutes in total. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. I hope this doesn't take too long, though. I have a few errands to run this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. That’s a little elevated, but not significantly so, considering you mentioned taking lisinopril. Pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me, in and out.
PATIENT: Okay. Is everything alright so far? It's been a long time since I had a proper check-up, so I'm a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds good so far, Helaina. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Now, we just need to draw some blood. We’ll need about two vials. It’s a quick pinch, and it’ll be over before you know it. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. I’m not crazy about needles, but I’ll manage. Just… try to be quick, please? I really do have those errands. And maybe don’t look at me while you’re doing it?
DOCTOR: Of course, Helaina. I understand. I'll be as quick and efficient as possible, and I'll certainly avoid looking directly at you if that makes you more comfortable. Okay, I’m going to clean the area on your inner arm with an alcohol swab, and then you’ll feel a brief pinch. Try to relax your arm as much as possible. Okay, all done. You might feel a little bit of soreness at the site for a few minutes, but it should go away quickly. I’ll put a bandage on it. We should have the results back in a few days. Once we confirm you’re HIV negative and your kidney function is normal, we can discuss starting PrEP. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A few days is fine. I’m glad that’s over with. What happens if the results aren’t good? Like, if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Helaina. If the results show you are positive for HIV, we will immediately connect you with resources for treatment and care. Early treatment is extremely effective. If your kidney function isn’t optimal, we’ll discuss potential causes and work together to improve it. PrEP requires healthy kidneys, so we would need to address any underlying issues before starting the medication. We may need to consult with a nephrologist, a kidney specialist, in that case. But let’s focus on the positive. The vast majority of people are healthy enough to start PrEP, and it’s a very safe and effective preventative measure. We’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. In the meantime, do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I really appreciate you being patient with me, and… not making me feel silly for not knowing all the details. I’m glad I came in.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. It’s my job to provide you with the information and care you need, and to make you feel comfortable throughout the process. I’m glad you came in as well. We’ll be in touch in a few days with your results. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good afternoon, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
