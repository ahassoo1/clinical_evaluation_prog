DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. To get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Petrimoulx, was it? Yes, well, it’s this… going to the bathroom. Too much, you see? Just too much. It’s a bother, really. A real bother. I don't rightly recall when it started, to be honest. Old age, I suppose. Everything gets a little… leaky, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Frequent urination can certainly be bothersome. And you're right, it can be a part of getting older, but it’s good we’re talking about it to make sure everything is alright. When you say "too much," could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it? Well, I go… often. More than I used to, naturally. Used to be able to hold it for a good long while, you know? Now I feel the urge… not long after I’ve already been. And it’s not like a… weak stream or anything. It's just… frequent. I don’t understand all this fuss about describing things, though. It’s just… I go too much, alright? Is that good enough? Back in my day, a doctor just knew these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Mr. Segretto. I appreciate you telling me. It’s true, medicine has changed! Getting a detailed picture helps me understand what's going on and rule out anything serious. So, frequent urination… and you’ve noticed this has increased recently. Have you noticed any changes in how you urinate – any burning, pain, or difficulty starting or stopping the stream?
PATIENT: Burning? No, no burning. Pain, not really. Though my back… my back aches something fierce these days, but that's just old age, I reckon. Difficulty… sometimes it's a little slow to get going, if I’ve been sitting a while. But nothing awful. Like I said, it’s mostly just the frequency. It disrupts things, you see? Can't even finish a good cup of coffee without having to run to the… well, you know. It's embarrassing. My wife keeps giving me the eye.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That sounds very disruptive, and I can see why it's causing you concern, and why your wife might be noticing! The back pain is good to know – we’ll want to consider that as well. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately how many times a day would you say you are urinating?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking me to count? Doctor, I don't keep track of these things! It feels like… all the time. More than I used to, that's for sure. Maybe… six, seven times a day? Could be more, could be less. I’m not a counter of bathroom trips, you understand. It’s just… a lot. And sometimes at night, too. Which is really a nuisance. Wakes my wife up.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good starting point, Mr. Segretto. Six to seven times a day, and sometimes at night. Okay. Now, have you noticed any changes in your drinking habits recently?
PATIENT: Drinking habits? Well, I enjoy a bit of coffee with my breakfast, always have. And a glass of water with my meals, like a sensible person. I don’t go out of my way to drink a lot, no. Certainly haven't been guzzling down gallons of anything. Just the usual. Nothing fancy. I suppose I drink a little less in the winter, naturally. Less thirsty when it's cold. But nothing that would explain all this. Honestly, Doctor, I think my bladder’s just worn out. It’s a simple explanation, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It could be simple, Mr. Segretto, and it's good you've considered that. But we want to rule out anything else that might be contributing. Now, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, or have taken recently?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. My wife handles most of that, you see. I take a little something for my blood pressure, a small white pill. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take one of those orange tablets. Can’t recall the name of either, to be honest. And that’s about it. Nothing else. I used to take something for my heartburn, but that was years ago. I just try to avoid spicy foods these days. Much easier that way. It’s best to let my wife handle the pills. She’s got a good system, you see? I’m not one for remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Segretto. We can look up the names of those medications later if you'd like. Just knowing you’re taking something for blood pressure and arthritis is helpful. Now, have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet… well, my wife's been trying to get me to eat more vegetables. Says it’s good for my… something or other. I oblige her, mostly. I don't particularly like vegetables, but she's a good woman. Otherwise, I eat pretty much what I always have. Meat and potatoes, mostly. A little bit of fruit now and then. Nothing wild or unusual. I haven't been indulging in any extra salt or sugar, if that’s what you're thinking. I don't have a sweet tooth, you see. I'm a simple man, Doctor. Simple tastes. This is all very… detailed, isn’t it? Is this getting us anywhere?
DOCTOR: It is detailed, Mr. Segretto, and it is getting us somewhere. It helps me build a complete picture. One last quick question before we move on to a physical exam. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches lately?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. Chills… not really. It gets a little cool in the evenings, naturally, but that's just the weather. Body aches… well, my bones ache sometimes, but that's just old age, you see? It's always something, isn’t it? Back aches, knee aches, hip aches… it comes with the territory. Nothing new, nothing unusual. I don't feel sick, Doctor. Just… old. And leaky. Is that alright? I'm starting to feel a bit foolish answering all these questions. It’s just… old age, isn’t it? Shouldn't a doctor just know these things?
DOCTOR: It's not foolish at all, Mr. Segretto, and I appreciate you being so open with me. And you are right, sometimes it is just a part of getting older. However, it’s always best to rule out anything else that might be going on. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. We’ll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d like to do a brief abdominal exam. Is that alright with you?
