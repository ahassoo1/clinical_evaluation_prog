DOCTOR: Good morning, Miss Chakka. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… quite rural here, isn’t it? But, as you can see from my chart, I am here regarding a rather concerning issue. I have been experiencing… a decline in my physical condition, coupled with debilitating fatigue and, frankly, quite unpleasant night sweats. It’s most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Quite. One does not simply wish to lose weight, and certainly not accompanied by such… discomfort. It disrupts my schedule, and frankly, casts a shadow over my professional endeavors. I assure you, my work requires a certain… presentation. It's graphic design, you understand. One must maintain standards.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let us attempt to ascertain the source of this… disruption. I see here you are eighteen years of age. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never exhibited any allergic reactions. My constitution is, generally speaking, quite robust. I maintain a rather strict regimen, you see. Though, I confess, it has been… difficult to adhere to lately, given the circumstances.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I pride myself on a natural lifestyle. I find pharmaceuticals… unnecessary, and frankly, detrimental to one’s inherent balance. I occasionally consume herbal teas for… restorative purposes, but nothing of any consequence, I assure you. They are quite mild.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, concerning this… “decline in physical condition.” Can you elaborate?
PATIENT: It is… difficult to articulate precisely, Doctor. A general… lassitude, I suppose. A lack of energy, a diminished capacity for physical exertion. I find myself increasingly… breathless after even moderate activity. And, of course, the weight loss is… unwelcome. It began gradually, but has accelerated in recent weeks. It's quite unsettling, I must say.
DOCTOR: And how much weight have you lost, approximately?
PATIENT: Approximately… seven kilograms, Doctor. Over the past six weeks, I believe. It may be more, to be perfectly honest; I am quite meticulous about my appearance, but not, thankfully, obsessive about weighing myself constantly. It's… unsightly, to dwell on such matters. However, the change in my clothing is… undeniable. It is most… distracting.
DOCTOR: And the night sweats?
PATIENT: They are… quite drenching, Doctor. I awaken several times each night, completely soaked. It necessitates a change of bedding, and… frankly, it’s utterly exhausting. I’ve always been a rather… temperate sleeper, so this is a significant departure from the norm. It began intermittently, but has become… almost nightly now. It is… quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Do you have any family history of… similar ailments?
PATIENT: My maternal grandmother, Doctor, suffered from… a general decline in her later years. She attributed it to “weakness of the constitution,” a rather vague diagnosis, I suspect. There were whispers of… something affecting the lymphatic system, but my mother was never particularly forthcoming with details. She preferred to focus on… more pleasant topics. I doubt it is relevant, but I felt obliged to mention it.
DOCTOR: And your social history, Miss Chakka?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, I find that question… rather intrusive. However, I suppose I can indulge you briefly. I am married, as you can see from the chart. My husband is… supportive, although he doesn't quite understand the nuances of my… professional life. We live a… quiet existence. I do not partake in… excessive socializing. It’s… draining.
DOCTOR: Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, I assure you, I maintain a very… refined lifestyle. Such habits are… beneath me. I would never compromise my physical or mental well-being with such… vulgarities. My husband occasionally enjoys a glass of wine with dinner, but I abstain entirely. It is… detrimental to clarity of thought, you understand. And the others are… unthinkable.
DOCTOR: Very well. I suppose we’ll proceed. I will need to conduct a physical examination, then we'll consider some basic laboratory work. Please, lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though, I must confess, I find the clinical setting… rather sterile. I do hope the examination will be conducted with… discretion. And, if possible, with minimal disruption to my… attire. It is, after all, quite expensive.
DOCTOR: Breathe deeply, please. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… regular, though slightly rapid. Lymph nodes… slightly enlarged, but nothing conclusive. Weight is 105 pounds, height 6’4”. Significant weight loss, as you stated. Skin appears pale. Let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are… normal. Blood pressure is 110/70. Temperature is 98.6. Now, I’ll need to draw some blood for a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. Nurse, could you please prepare the patient for bloodwork?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must say, this is all rather… perfunctory. Is there truly no more thorough assessment to be conducted? I find it somewhat disconcerting to be subjected to such… cursory examinations. And frankly, I’d prefer to know what precisely you are looking for. I am, after all, a rather discerning individual.
DOCTOR: Miss Chakka, I assure you, I am a qualified physician. The preliminary examination and blood work will provide a baseline. It will help us rule out some of the more… common possibilities. I do not require a detailed account of your aesthetic preferences at this juncture. We are attempting to identify a medical issue, not provide a consultation for your… personal comfort. Now, if you’ll allow the nurse to proceed, we can expedite this process.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I maintain my reservations. It is simply… unsettling to relinquish control without a clear understanding of the… methodology. But, if you insist, proceed with your… tests. Though I must reiterate, I expect a comprehensive explanation of the results. And prompt action, should any… irregularities be detected. Do be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Proceed as necessary. Significant weight loss, night sweats, fatigue…possible malignancy, though patient’s self-assessment is… unhelpful. Will review results and determine next steps. Honestly, some patients…
