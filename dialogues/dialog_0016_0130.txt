DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer! I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, my sister… she got sick. Real sick. Cancer. And… my mother, she had something… not cancer, but… close. A long time ago. I just… I want to make sure I’m okay, you know? I don’t want… I don’t want the same thing to happen to me.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Mr. Schwer. It’s very thoughtful of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history like that. It's good you're thinking about this now. We can definitely do some things to assess your risk and make sure you’re feeling your best. To start, can you tell me a little more about your sister's illness?
PATIENT: Um… she had… lung cancer. They found it… late. She didn’t go to the doctor for a long time. Said she was just tired. But it spread… real fast. She… she passed away last year. I don't… I don't want that to happen to me. And my mother… it was her stomach. They had to… take part of it out. A long time ago, like when I was a little boy. She lived a long life after, but… it was scary.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your sister and your mother, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s completely natural to be concerned about your own health with that family history. Okay. So, let’s talk about you. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms – anything at all that’s concerning you, like fatigue, weight loss, changes in appetite, any pain, or digestive issues?
PATIENT: No… not really. I get tired sometimes, but… I’m 73. I think that’s just getting old, right? My appetite is okay. Maybe a little less than it used to be, but I eat. No pain. And… my stomach… it’s okay. It feels normal. I guess I just… worry. I don't feel sick, but… I want to be sure.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that you aren’t experiencing any specific symptoms right now. It’s very common to worry with a family history like yours, even when you’re feeling well. And you’re right, some fatigue is expected with age. Let’s do a quick review of your overall health history, just to get a better picture. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yeah. I had that for a while. Took pills for it. Doctor said it was under control when I last saw him, maybe five years ago? And… I had my gallbladder out when I was younger. That was… not fun. But other than that… I don’t think so. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit… oh, maybe 30 years ago?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. High blood pressure, managed with medication in the past, and gallbladder removal. And a past history of smoking is important information. Thirty years is excellent – that significantly lowers your risk now. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my knees. They ache sometimes. The doctor said it was arthritis. And… I take a vitamin D tablet every morning. The lady at the pharmacy said everyone needs vitamin D. That's it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright, a medication for arthritis and a daily vitamin D supplement. That's good you’re taking care of your knees and getting your vitamin D! Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. My wife… she was allergic to peanuts. But I'm not. I used to eat peanut butter sandwiches all the time. She made me stop when she found out, of course. But… I’m fine. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No known allergies. That simplifies things. Okay, Mr. Schwer, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… don't poke too much, okay? My knees are a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schwer. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a look at your throat, ears, and eyes. And finally, I'll gently feel your abdomen. Let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay. Breathing… just normal. Like this? I take a few deep breaths, a little louder than necessary. Is that good? Everything feels a little strange when I think about it too much. My heart… it sometimes feels like it skips a beat, but I think that’s just my nerves.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Mr. Schwer. Just relax and breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. I did detect a slight irregularity in your rhythm, but it’s very subtle. We can keep an eye on that. It could be a benign variation. Now, let's take a quick look at your throat, ears, and eyes. Open wide for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay. I open my mouth wide, sticking my tongue out a little. Everything okay? It feels funny when you shine that light in my mouth. And… my ears… they sometimes itch, but nothing major. Just a little itchy. I try not to stick things in them, my wife always told me not to. She was a sensible woman, my wife.
DOCTOR: Throat looks clear, no inflammation. Ears are normal, mild cerumen present, but nothing obstructing the canal. The itching you experience could be due to dry skin, common with age. We can discuss some over-the-counter remedies if it bothers you. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay. Gentle… that’s good. I tense up slightly as you press on my stomach. Uh… sometimes it feels a little… full, after I eat. But not painful. Just… uncomfortable. Like… too much food, maybe. I like to eat. My wife… she made me eat vegetables, even when I didn’t want to. She was good for me, my wife. I wince slightly as you press a little harder. Ooh… that’s a little tender there, on the right side. Not bad, just… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some mild tenderness in your right upper quadrant. It could be related to your gallbladder, even though you had it removed years ago. Sometimes there's residual discomfort. It’s also possible it’s related to your liver or colon. Given your family history of cancer and this slight tenderness, I’d like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. The blood work will give us a baseline assessment of your liver function, kidney function, and check for any signs of inflammation. The CT scan will give us a more detailed look at your abdominal organs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Uh… a CT scan? That sounds… serious. Is it expensive? And… blood work… lots of needles, right? My sister… she didn’t like needles. But… if you think it's best, Doctor… okay. If it will make sure I'm okay… yes. Do whatever you think is best. But… no surprises, okay? Tell me if it's going to be expensive before you do it. And… gentle with the needles. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schwer. A CT scan can feel a bit daunting, but it’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. And I absolutely agree – we’ll avoid any surprises. I’ll have the billing department check your Medicare coverage and give you a cost estimate before we proceed. They can also discuss payment options if needed. As for the blood work, it’s just a few small vials. And I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is very gentle. We can even use a numbing cream if you’re particularly anxious. To recap: I’m ordering blood work to assess your overall health and a CT scan of your abdomen to investigate the tenderness. I'll also get a referral to a gastroenterologist for you. They can give their expert opinion after they've reviewed the results. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work… gentle needles… CT scan… no surprises… and a… gastro… what did you call it? The stomach doctor. Yes. That sounds… good. As long as you tell me what’s going on, every step of the way. I trust you, Doctor. Just… keep me informed. And… thank you. I was getting worried. A lot of worrying. This… this makes me feel a little better. Now… what do I do? Do I schedule something? Or… do you just call me when it’s ready?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I’m glad I could ease your worries a bit. And absolutely, I’ll keep you informed every step of the way. My assistant, Sarah, will call you tomorrow to schedule the blood work and the CT scan. She’ll also provide instructions on how to prepare for each test. Once the results are back, I’ll call you to discuss them in detail and schedule an appointment with the gastroenterologist if necessary. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits – please don't hesitate to call the office right away. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. Sarah… she'll call me. Okay. And… tell her to be gentle with the phone call, too. I don’t like surprises. I slowly stand up, a little unsteady on my feet. I guess I’ll see you… later. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. And I’ll make sure Sarah knows to be gentle with the phone call! We'll take good care of you. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
