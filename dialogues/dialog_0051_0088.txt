DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, it’s my ears, actually. They’ve been ringing. It's been going on for a little while now, and it's starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. That’s… tinnitus, as we call it. And you said it’s been going on for “a little while” – could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably about three months now? Maybe a little longer. It started off quiet, just after I got divorced actually, and I didn't really pay much attention to it then. Things were… a bit messy, you know? But it’s gotten louder lately. It’s making it hard to concentrate at work.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Life events can certainly contribute to stress, and sometimes that manifests physically. Three months… alright. Is it constant ringing, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. It’s worse at night, when it's quiet. During work, when there’s lots of noise, I barely notice it. But trying to sleep… that’s when it really gets to me. It's like a high-pitched whine, sometimes. Other times, it’s more of a buzzing sound.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse at night, when it’s quiet, and a varying tone – sometimes a whine, sometimes a buzz. Have you noticed any hearing loss at all, along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, maybe a little. I used to be able to hear my aunty calling me from across the room, but now I have to ask her to speak up. But I thought it was just because I’m getting older! I'm not sure if it’s related.
DOCTOR: It very well could be related. Hearing loss is a common cause of tinnitus. Alright. And have you been exposed to any loud noises recently – concerts, construction, anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… not really. Work gets a bit noisy, you know, the clatter of plates and people talking, but nothing really loud. I went to a wedding a couple of months ago, and the music was pretty loud then, but that was it. Nothing else I can think of.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a fuller picture, have you experienced any dizziness, fullness in your ears, or any pain along with the ringing?
PATIENT: No dizziness, no. And no pain, thankfully. Sometimes my ears feel a bit… blocked, like when you’re on a plane, but that doesn't happen often. Mostly just the ringing, and feeling a bit tired from trying to ignore it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness or pain, occasional fullness. I see. Let’s do a quick examination of your ears, just to rule out any obvious causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jaylyne. Everything looks normal visually. The Weber test… seems midline. And the Rinne test… air conduction is slightly better than bone conduction in both ears, which is what we’d expect. That suggests the hearing loss, if present, is likely mild and conductive, rather than sensorineural. But it’s hard to be certain with a quick screening like this. I’m going to recommend an audiogram – a formal hearing test – just to get a more accurate assessment of your hearing levels. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. An audiogram… is that painful? I’m not good with tests, to be honest. I get a bit anxious. But if you think it's necessary… then yeah, I’ll do it. Just tell me what to expect, okay?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not painful at all. It’s a completely non-invasive test. You’ll sit in a soundproof booth and wear headphones, and you’ll hear a series of tones and beeps at different frequencies and volumes. You simply indicate when you can hear the sound, usually by pressing a button. The technician will be monitoring the whole time, and they can stop at any point if you feel uncomfortable. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. We can schedule that for you today, if you like. And in the meantime, to help manage the tinnitus, I recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible – even with headphones – and ensuring you’re getting enough sleep and managing any stress you might be experiencing. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Not as scary as I thought, thankfully. Thirty to forty-five minutes… I can manage that. And yeah, avoiding noise and getting sleep… easier said than done, but I’ll try. Let’s schedule the test, please. And, um… is there anything else I should be doing? Like, can it be cured? I’m just… worried it’ll never go away.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Jaylyne. Let’s schedule that audiogram for you, and then we can discuss some options. Okay, I have you scheduled for an audiogram next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. The audiologist is excellent, and will be able to give you a more detailed assessment. As for a cure… unfortunately, there’s no one-size-fits-all cure for tinnitus. However, it's often manageable. In many cases, the tinnitus will lessen over time on its own. But the audiologist can discuss options like tinnitus retraining therapy, sound masking, or even cognitive behavioral therapy if it's significantly impacting your quality of life. We can also rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to it. I don’t want to dismiss your concerns, and it's important to remember that people live very fulfilling lives with tinnitus. But getting a proper diagnosis and management plan is the first step. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Right, Tuesday at two… okay. Tinnitus retraining therapy… sound masking… I’ll have to look those up. It’s just… it’s so annoying, you know? Especially when I’m trying to sleep. Um… no, I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything really well, and I feel a bit better knowing there are things we can try.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. I’m glad I could help ease some of your worries. Remember, we’re here to support you throughout this process. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns before your appointment. Here’s a printout with information about the audiogram, and some helpful websites regarding tinnitus management. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you next week.
PATIENT: Right, thank you again, Doctor. I will. Have a good day too. .
