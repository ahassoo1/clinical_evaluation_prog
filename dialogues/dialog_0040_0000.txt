DOCTOR: Right. Sharifa Firestone, 44. Okay. Well, let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's my legs. They just… gave out. Not completely, but they feel like jelly, especially after I had that awful cold last week. It's… unsettling. I haven’t felt this weak in years.
DOCTOR: “Jelly legs” after a cold. Right. And how long has this weakness been going on exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… the cold itself ended maybe five days ago? And the legs started feeling wobbly right after I started feeling better. Maybe four days now? It's hard to pinpoint exactly, I don't sit around analyzing my leg strength, you know? It's just… noticeable. Especially when I try to walk any distance.
DOCTOR: Four days. Okay. And are we talking a complete inability to walk, or just… some instability?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not completely unable. I can walk, but I feel like I’m going to fall. It’s… precarious. And it's worse going upstairs. I had to practically crawl up the steps this morning, which is ridiculous. I usually bound up those stairs. It's not dignified, I tell you.
DOCTOR: “Bound up the stairs,” right. Any pain associated with this?
PATIENT: No, no pain. That’s the thing that’s so odd! Just… weakness. A complete lack of strength. It feels like they're not my legs, if that makes sense? Like they’re filled with… water balloons. And frankly, I don’t appreciate being made to feel like I’m exaggerating. I know my body.
DOCTOR: “Water balloons.” Right. Okay. Let’s just get a few basics out of the way. Any history of diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Heavens, no. My mother was perfectly healthy until she was ninety, and her mother before her. We’re a strong, hardworking people. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. We eat well, mostly. Lots of beans and plantains, you know? Real food. Not this processed nonsense everyone eats now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Just my Medicare supplements, really. And a multivitamin, sometimes. I don't bother with much else. I prefer to let my body do its own work. And I haven’t been sick, truly sick, in years. Just that little cold, and it wasn’t even that bad. It’s just this leg weakness that's… concerning. I need to get this sorted out, you know? I have a tour scheduled next week.
DOCTOR: A “tour.” Okay. Right. Let's have a look at your legs, then. Please, just step onto the examination table. And try not to… dramatize.
PATIENT: Dramatize? I am not dramatizing. I'm simply explaining how I feel. Honestly. But fine, I'll get on your table. Just be quick about it, if you don't mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Reflexes… slightly diminished, but within normal limits. Strength is… adequate. Though, I must say, your description is a bit… exaggerated. It's likely just lingering weakness from the cold. I'm going to order some basic blood work, just to rule anything out. Complete blood count, electrolytes… the usual. But I don't anticipate finding anything significant.
PATIENT: “Lingering weakness”? You haven't even looked at me properly! I can barely climb a flight of stairs! And “the usual”? Honestly, are you even listening to me? I need more than “the usual”. I want to know why my legs feel like jelly, not be dismissed with a cursory examination and some routine blood work. I expect a proper diagnosis, Doctor. Not this… condescending dismissal. Is there anything else you need to know, or are we just going to continue this charade?
DOCTOR: Look. I’ve been doing this for twenty-five years. It's a virus. It happens. It weakens you. It takes time. We’ll rule out anything serious with the blood work, and then you’ll be fine. I’m ordering a Vitamin D level as well. People are always deficient. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I’ll have the lab results sent to your primary care physician. They can discuss the results with you further. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: “Discuss the results with me further”? You are sending me to someone else after barely examining me and dismissing my concerns? That’s… unacceptable! I came here for a diagnosis, not a referral! I don’t have a primary care physician! I came to you because I needed someone to take this seriously! This is ridiculous. I want a second opinion, and I want it now. I don't feel like you're actually listening to me. .
DOCTOR: Fine. Whatever. I'll write a referral to a neurologist. Happy now?
