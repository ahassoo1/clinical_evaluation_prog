DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Well, honestly? Just curious, really. My Harold – my husband, God rest his soul – always liked to get things checked out. I suppose it’s just… a habit. Not that I feel particularly unwell, you understand. Just seeing what all the fuss is about these days. Is everything so different now?
DOCTOR: "Just curious," alright. And how old are you, Ms. Calvery?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Sixty-four. Yes, sixty-four. Though I don’t feel it, most days. Though my knees… well, they tell a different story, don’t they? Still, sixty-four. Seems like a perfectly reasonable age, doesn’t it? Are you writing all this down? It feels awfully official.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s standard procedure. Sixty-four. And your height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes. Now you're asking the difficult questions! Hmm… well, I used to be taller, you know. Harold always said I was statuesque. I’d say… five foot eight? Maybe nine? And weight… oh, goodness gracious. I really don’t keep track of those things. Around… a hundred and three, I suppose. Give or take a few. Is that bad? I mostly eat sensible things.
DOCTOR: It's… substantial. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, dear. I don't think so. Not that I know of, anyway. Harold always handled the medications, you see. He was very particular about those things. I took what he gave me, and it always worked. Never had a reaction, not that I recall. Though… there was that one time with the shellfish, but that wasn't a medication, was it? It just made my throat a bit itchy. Is that what you mean? Honestly, I'm not good with remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Shellfish is irrelevant. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not really. Well… sometimes I take a little something for my knees, when they’re acting up. But it's just… one of those things I get at the drugstore. A cream, mostly. And sometimes a little pain reliever. But that's it, really. Nothing serious. Harold always said I was too stubborn to take proper medicine. He was probably right. Is that important? Seems like a lot of questions for a “curiosity visit,” don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any significant medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're getting to the serious stuff. Well... Harold always said I had a strong constitution. I’ve never been one for being sick. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps, rubella… but nothing serious. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. But that was a long time ago. And I had my gallbladder out, years ago. That was… unpleasant. Beyond that? Not really. I’ve been quite lucky, all things considered. Do you need the exact dates for all this? I'm really terrible with remembering those things. It was all so long ago.
DOCTOR: No, not at the moment. Any family history of… significant illness?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… Let me think. Harold’s father… he had something with his lungs, I believe. From the factory, you see. Not a good thing. And his mother… she lived to be a very old age, thankfully. Though I can’t recall what, if anything, she suffered from. My mother, as I said, had something with her heart. And my sister… she had a touch of diabetes, I think. But that was years ago. Honestly, it’s all a bit hazy, you understand. We didn’t talk about these things much. It was considered… impolite, somehow. Is this important? It’s all just… names and vague recollections.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Goodness gracious. What does that even mean? I was married, as you know. To Harold. For… well, a very long time. We didn't have any children, which was… our choice. We kept to ourselves mostly. I volunteered at the church for a while, but my knees… they don’t allow for much activity these days. I enjoy reading, and watching television. Is that what you mean by “social history?” It doesn’t sound very… medical, does it? It feels like you’re trying to find something wrong, and I'm telling you, I'm perfectly fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Ms. Calvery. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. Harold always said it was a dreadful habit. Ruined his mother’s lungs, you see. And I’ve always had a good constitution, as I mentioned. I can’t stand the smell of it. What kind of doctor asks if someone smokes after asking about their social history? It’s… rather odd, don’t you think? Are we getting anywhere with this, dear? I’m starting to feel a bit… flustered.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to a physical exam, then. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, dear. Lie down? Now? Is something wrong? Are you sure? I didn’t even bring a proper… undergarment for such things. This is all happening so quickly! And I just had a nice cup of tea… I suppose. Very well. But don’t expect much, dear. My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Just lie down, Ms. Calvery. I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but with some reduced breath sounds at the bases.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Deep breath… there. Is something wrong? They don't sound wrong to me. Reduced, you say? Reduced how? I’ve never had my heart listened to before. It feels… strange. And is this table cold? It’s rather drafty in here. I always preferred Harold’s touch. He had very warm hands. What are you looking for, dear? Is it something serious? I really don’t like feeling so… exposed.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Calvery. Now, let me check your reflexes. Two-plus reflexes bilaterally. Patellar and Achilles.
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness gracious, that was a bit startling! My knees… you didn't warn me! Two-plus? Is that good? Is that… normal? I always thought my reflexes were rather slow. Harold used to tease me about it. He said I was too laid-back. What does it mean, dear? Is something wrong with my nerves? I really don't like all these numbers and terms. It's all very confusing. And my knees are starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are within normal limits, Ms. Calvery. Let me palpate your abdomen. Soft, non-tender abdomen. No masses palpated.
PATIENT: Oh. Palpate? Is that… poking? It feels a bit invasive, dear. Are you looking for something? I told you, I eat sensible things! And I haven't been feeling particularly unwell. My abdomen has always been… soft. Non-tender, you say? Well, I should hope so! It wouldn’t be very pleasant if it were tender, would it? I really don't understand why you're doing all this. Is this going to take much longer? I have a… a program on television I quite enjoy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. Based on this brief examination, and your… somewhat vague history, I don’t find anything acutely concerning. You are likely experiencing age-related mild decline in lung capacity, and some expected musculoskeletal discomfort. I recommend regular, light exercise, and maintaining a healthy diet. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, dear. Light exercise? Well, that’s hardly revolutionary, is it? Harold always said a good walk was the best medicine. And a healthy diet… I do try. So, you’re saying… there’s nothing wrong with me? After all this poking and prodding and asking about my “vague history”? It feels rather… anticlimactic, doesn’t it? I suppose… no. I don’t think I have any questions. Just… a bit disappointed, perhaps. I expected… something more. Thank you, I suppose. Now, how do I get down from here?
DOCTOR: Carefully, use the stool. And please schedule a follow-up appointment in six months for routine monitoring. Next patient.
PATIENT: Oh. A step stool? Well, that’s… helpful. I suppose. Routine monitoring? For what, exactly? It all feels rather… unnecessary, doesn’t it? Honestly. A waste of a perfectly good afternoon, that’s what it was. .
