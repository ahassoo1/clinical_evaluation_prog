DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Doctor Donate, right? Yes, yes. My... uh... the team. The tryouts. I gotta get checked, see if this old body can still... well, you know. Play a little. It’s for... sports. I think. My wife signed me up. She thinks it’ll be good for me. I forget what sport exactly... but it involves a ball. Maybe?
DOCTOR: Right. “The team.” And you’re looking for a general check-up to make sure you're fit for…sports. It's good your wife is encouraging you to be active, though. So, let's start with the basics. When did you last see a doctor, and was it for anything specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Let me think... It was… a while ago. Maybe… last year? No, before that. A long time before that. It was for… my knee. I think. It was bothering me a little. But it felt better after a bit, so I didn't really... follow up. Does that make sense? I don’t remember the doctor’s name, or much else, to be honest. It was just a quick visit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a visit for knee pain some time ago with no follow-up. That's... not ideal, but we'll work with it. And right now, is your knee still bothering you at all?
PATIENT: No, no, it’s alright now. Mostly. Sometimes, when it’s cold, it feels a little… stiff. But nothing I can’t walk off. Or ignore! It's just old age, I guess. You know how it is. I don’t want to complain, Doctor. I just want to make sure I don’t… pull a muscle or something during these tryouts. My wife would be so disappointed!
DOCTOR: Right, well, pulling a muscle is always a concern. We'll have to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at that knee, just to be sure. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm... Let me see... I get a little tired sometimes, but everyone does, right? And… I forget things. A lot of things. Like what I had for breakfast. Or why I walked into the room! But I figure that’s just getting older, too. Nothing to worry about, I hope. My wife says I’m just… absent-minded. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Absent-mindedness can be normal, especially with age. But we’ll make a note of it. Fatigue and memory issues... alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Well, my wife does a lot of the cooking. So I eat what she makes. It's usually good! I think I'm eating… okay. Maybe a little less than before? I just don't feel as hungry sometimes. And… sweets are good. I like sweets. I sneak a little extra when she’s not looking. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll make a note of the changes in appetite and… the sweets. Now, let’s talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take a little pill for… uh… my water. My water pressure. I think. It’s a little white pill. My wife handles all that, so I don't really pay attention. And sometimes, when my knee acts up, I take something for the pain. But it’s just when it really bothers me. I think it’s ibuprofen? Is that right? I’m not very good with names, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. A medication for blood pressure – we'll need to confirm the name and dosage. And ibuprofen as needed for pain. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… That’s a good question. I don't think so. I haven't had any trouble with anything, not that I remember. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the weather. Or the dust! We live in the city, you know. Lots of dust. I don’t think I have any serious allergies. My wife would tell me if I did, wouldn’t she?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s proceed with a quick physical exam. If you could just hop up on the exam table for me. We'll start with your heart and lungs, then take a look at your knee, and check your reflexes. Then, I’ll order some blood work just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh dear. Is that… is that necessary? I don’t like needles very much. But… alright. If you think it's best. No, I don't think I have any questions. Just… go easy on me, Doctor. And please, don't make me run. My knees aren't what they used to be! Let's just get this over with, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. We'll take it easy. No running involved. Just some basic blood work to rule things out. First, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please, take a deep breath… and exhale. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at that knee. Can you bend it for me?
PATIENT: Okay… Deep breath… exhale. Yes, I can do that. Oh… that’s a little stiff. See? It’s not as flexible as it used to be. It clicks a little, too. Do you hear that click? My wife says it's just “old age.” It doesn't hurt, not really. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, I hear the crepitus. And there’s a little bit of tenderness here… Range of motion is limited. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Patellar reflex is 2+, slightly diminished. Achilles reflex is 1+, also diminished. Alright, Mr. Murph. That's all for the physical exam. Now, we'll get those blood work orders sent to the lab. It's standard procedure. It appears we'll need to run a CBC, CMP, and a thyroid panel. I also want to rule out any vitamin deficiencies. Are you on any special diets?
PATIENT: Special diets? No, not really. My wife tries to make me eat healthy, but… I like my sweets. She lets me have them sometimes. We eat a lot of rice and beans, that’s for sure. And… Oh! She makes a really good chicken soup. It's very healthy, I think. But no, nothing fancy. I just eat whatever she puts in front of me. She says I need my strength for… well, for the tryouts! Is that a problem, Doctor? Too much rice and beans?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not necessarily a problem, Mr. Murph. But we need a complete picture. The blood work will give us a better understanding of your overall health. We'll check your vitamin levels, electrolytes, and kidney function. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to take your blood pressure medication as prescribed and avoid any strenuous activity until we have a better idea of what’s going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Strenuous activity… yes, yes. No running. No pulling muscles. I understand. No… overdoing it. Just… gentle walks? Is that okay? And the blood work… how long will that take? I have to be ready for these tryouts, you know. My wife would be so disappointed if I missed them. Are they going to stick a lot of needles in me, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’ll be a standard blood draw, Mr. Murph. A few vials of blood, that’s all. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. The results should be back within 2-3 business days. As for activity, gentle walks are fine, but listen to your body. If you feel any pain, stop immediately. We'll also want to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. 2-3 days… I can wait. Gentle walks, no pain… I remember. Follow-up appointment… yes, good. My wife will be glad to hear that. She worries about me. So… I can go home now? And… just wait for the results? And… try not to pull a muscle before then? Is there anything else I need to do, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Murph, you can go home now. Just try to take it easy, listen to your body, and avoid any strenuous activity. We'll contact you as soon as the results are back. The lab results will be sent to my office, and a nurse will call to schedule your follow-up appointment. And, please, avoid self-treating. If you experience any worsening symptoms before your appointment, contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. No self-treating… got it. Listen to my body. No running. No pulling muscles. My wife will be happy. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. I hope… I hope I can still play sports. I'll… I'll wait for the phone call. Goodbye, Doctor. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: Another one… hoping for a miracle. .
