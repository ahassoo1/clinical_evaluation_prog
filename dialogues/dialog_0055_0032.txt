DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Eaddy, you say? A… a peculiar name. But never mind that. I believe my… downstairs area is causing a bit of a nuisance. A discharge, the intake form mentioned. Quite bothersome, really. Not something one discusses easily, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, these things do happen. It takes courage to discuss such personal matters, Mr. Krok. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Can you describe this discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Hmm. Well, it’s… wet. Naturally. That much is obvious. And… yellowish, I suppose. Though the lighting in my bathroom isn’t the best, you see. I’m not a connoisseur of such things, Doctor. It’s simply… not a normal occurrence for a man of my age and… standing. Is this going to involve… tests? I do dislike poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: “Standing” is… irrelevant, Mr. Krok. And yes, some examination will be necessary to determine the cause of this discharge. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we must rule out any potential infections or other underlying issues. Before we proceed, have you noticed any pain, burning, or itching associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not precisely pain. A slight… discomfort, perhaps. Like a chafing, if you will. Though I haven’t been doing any strenuous labor lately. Mostly tending to the… equipment, you see. And itching… occasionally. It’s more of an… awareness. An irritating awareness, if that makes any sense. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always believed a man should simply endure these things. But my wife insisted I come. She’s… a very insistent woman.
DOCTOR: “Enduring” can sometimes lead to complications, Mr. Krok. It’s admirable that you possess such fortitude, but we are here to ensure your comfort and well-being. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections, or any other urinary or genital conditions?
PATIENT: Sexually transmitted… Good heavens. At my age? Doctor, I’ve been married for… well, a very long time. A respectable long time. Such things are simply not… discussed in polite society. No, absolutely not. Never. As for other conditions… I had a prostate issue years ago, but that was resolved. A minor inconvenience, really. The doctor prescribed some pills. I can’t recall the name of them, though. Everything is a bit… hazy these days. Old age, you see. It plays tricks on the memory.
DOCTOR: “Hazy” is understandable, Mr. Krok. However, it’s important to have a complete picture of your medical history. Do you recall approximately when this prostate issue was treated?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When? Let me think… It was… after the war. No, before the war. Or perhaps… during? Honestly, Doctor, the years blend together. It was a long time ago. Before we had all this… modern medicine. A small town doctor, that's who treated me. He’s likely retired, or… passed on by now. A kind man, though. Always smelled of pipe tobacco. The pills were… small and white, I believe. Perhaps that helps? I truly wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: It is… difficult to ascertain much from that information, Mr. Krok. Very well. Let’s shift focus. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Goodness, no. I believe in a good, hearty diet. And perhaps a small glass of sherry now and then. As for medications… just the usual. For my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. Or perhaps it's blue? My wife manages most of those things, you see. She has a very organized system. I simply take what she gives me. And I trust her implicitly. She's a very practical woman.
DOCTOR: “Trusting implicitly” is… commendable, Mr. Krok, but it doesn’t allow for accurate medical record-keeping. I need a precise list of your medications. Perhaps your wife could bring the bottles in, or a list of them, at a later date?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That might cause a bit of a… stir. She’s very particular about her arrangements. But… I suppose I could ask. Yes, I'll ask her. She keeps everything in that little cabinet in the kitchen. A very organized cabinet, I assure you. She’d likely be… displeased to have her system disrupted. But for the sake of your examination, Doctor, I shall endeavor to procure a list. Though I make no promises.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we proceed with the physical examination, let me ask about any allergies you may have. To medications, foods, or anything else.
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Let me see… I don’t believe so. I’ve always been rather robust, you see. A strong constitution. Though I do get a bit of a… sniffle in the spring. Pollen, perhaps? But that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Just a seasonal… irritation. I’ve never had any serious reactions to anything, thank goodness. My wife is very careful about what she prepares for me. She wouldn’t dream of serving me anything harmful.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll excuse me, Mr. Krok, I’m going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table, please. We’ll start with an abdominal examination, and then proceed as necessary. Do you have any difficulty lying flat?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. The examination. Yes. Well, my back isn't what it used to be, you see. A bit of a… twinge now and then. Lying flat might… exacerbate it. But I suppose I can manage. For the sake of your profession, Doctor. Though I must warn you, I'm not particularly… flexible. I haven't done any stretching in… decades.
DOCTOR: Please, just do your best, Mr. Krok. We’ll be as gentle as possible. I’ll need you to remove your trousers and undergarments from the waist down. I'll leave the room to allow you some privacy. Please call out when you are ready.
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. Right. Remove my… trousers? In here? Well, I suppose it’s necessary. Though I must say, Doctor, this is all rather… undignified. A man of my age… But very well. I shall endeavor to comply. It’s for the good of my health, you say? Very well. Give me just a moment. And do try not to rush me. It’s a bit… awkward, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. If you are ready, we can begin. I’m going to start by palpating your abdomen. Please let me know if you experience any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Right. Palpating, you say? It’s… a bit chilly in here, you know. And this table is rather… hard. A bit of pressure there, Doctor. Not pain, precisely, but… awareness. Yes, awareness. It's probably just my age, you understand. Everything feels a bit… sensitive these days. Is this going to take long? My back is beginning to… twinge.
DOCTOR: I’m assessing for any tenderness or masses, Mr. Krok. Now, this might be slightly uncomfortable. Let me know if you experience any sharp pain. Do you feel any pain in this area specifically?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, there! A bit of… discomfort. No, more than discomfort. A twinge, a sharp twinge! It’s… rather unpleasant, Doctor. Are you certain you're not pressing too hard? It feels… sensitive, you understand. And that area… always has been a bit… delicate. My wife always warned me to be careful. She has a very… intuitive understanding of these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. That’s enough for now. Please remain still. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Can you tell me if you’ve had any recent changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Goodness, Doctor, is this really necessary? A man of my age… But very well. No, not really. They’re… regular, I suppose. A bit… sluggish now and then, but nothing alarming. My wife always insists on a healthy diet. Plenty of fiber, she says. And prune juice, occasionally. It keeps everything… moving. Though I find it rather… unpleasant, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I’m going to need to perform a quick genital exam now. I understand this may be uncomfortable, but it’s necessary to determine the cause of the discharge. I’ll ensure your privacy as much as possible. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Good heavens. A… genital exam? At my age? Well, I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary. But please, Doctor, be gentle. Very gentle. And do try to be quick about it. This is all rather… undignified, you understand. And my back is beginning to ache. Truly. I haven’t been… examined in… decades.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Please lie on your back with your knees bent. I’ll drape you appropriately to maintain your privacy. I’ll examine the area visually and then palpate it gently to check for any abnormalities. I'm observing the area now. Do you feel any pain when I touch here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! A bit of… stinging. Not pain, precisely, but… awareness. And it’s… rather tender, Doctor. Very tender. Are you certain you’re not pressing too hard? It’s… sensitive, you understand. Always has been. My wife always warned me to be careful. She says I have… delicate skin. Truly. And that discharge… it’s quite bothersome, you know. It’s… unsightly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. That’s enough for now. Please sit up when you're ready. Based on my examination, it appears you have some inflammation and discharge in the genital area. It’s difficult to make a definitive diagnosis without further testing, but it could be a case of balanitis—inflammation of the glans—or a mild sexually transmitted infection, despite your long marriage. Though, I acknowledge that's less likely. We need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a urine sample and a swab of the discharge for analysis. This will help us determine the cause of the inflammation and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A swab? And a urine sample? Good heavens, Doctor, this is becoming quite… involved. A swab of the… discharge? Truly? It’s… rather unpleasant to think about. And a sexually transmitted infection? Despite my long marriage? That’s… quite scandalous. My wife would be… appalled. Truly appalled. But… if it’s necessary. If it’s for the good of my health, you say? Very well. But please, Doctor, be gentle. Very gentle. And do try to explain everything clearly. I’m not a young man anymore, you understand. And this is all rather… distressing. A swab and a urine sample. Very well. But do try to make it quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I understand your concerns. I'll explain everything clearly, and we'll proceed as gently as possible. The urine sample is straightforward—you'll simply provide a sample in a sterile cup. The swab will involve a quick collection of a small amount of the discharge with a cotton swab. It will be… minimally uncomfortable. I'll provide you with the necessary containers and instructions. The lab results should be available in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend keeping the area clean and dry. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Clean and dry, you say? Yes, I suppose I can manage that. My wife is very particular about hygiene. She always insists on… thoroughness. But a swab… and a lab? Truly? It all seems rather… excessive. And what if it is something… scandalous? What if it reflects poorly on my marriage? My wife… she has a very strong sense of propriety. But very well. If it’s necessary. I suppose I have no choice. But please, Doctor, be discreet. Very discreet. And do try to make it quick. And… explain the process again, slowly? For an old man, you understand. A swab and a urine sample. And… discretion. Very important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Let's go through it again, slowly. First, the urine sample. You'll receive a sterile cup. I'd like you to collect a mid-stream sample—meaning, you start urinating, then collect a portion in the cup, and finish urinating. It’s important to clean the area beforehand to avoid contamination. I'll provide you with cleansing wipes. Now, the swab. I'll use a cotton swab to gently collect a small amount of the discharge from the affected area. It may feel slightly uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. It will only take a few seconds. I'll use a sterile glove, and I will be as gentle as possible. The samples will be sent to the lab for analysis, and the results should be available in a few days. Once we have the results, we can determine the cause of the inflammation and recommend the appropriate treatment. I assure you, everything will be handled with the utmost discretion. My priority is your health and well-being. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you insist. But please, be gentle. Very gentle. And… discreet. Truly discreet. My wife… she wouldn’t understand. A swab and a urine sample. It all seems rather… undignified, for a man of my age. But if it’s necessary… then very well. Let's get it over with. But do explain the procedure again, one last time? Just to be sure. And… slowly. Very slowly. A swab and a urine sample. And… discretion. Very important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Let's go through it one last time. You'll receive two containers. One is for the urine sample, and the other is for the swab. For the urine sample, you will need to collect a mid-stream sample. That means you start urinating into the toilet, then pause for a moment and collect a portion of the urine into the cup. It’s important to clean the area with the provided wipe before collecting the sample. For the swab, I will gently use a cotton swab to collect a small amount of the discharge from the affected area. I will use a sterile glove and be as gentle as possible. It may feel slightly uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. The process will be quick. I assure you, everything will be handled with the utmost discretion. Your privacy is my concern. I’ll leave the room to allow you privacy, and you can call out when you are ready. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… no further questions, Doctor. Just… please be quick. And gentle. Very gentle. And… discreet. Truly discreet. This is all rather… distressing, for a man of my age. I suppose… I suppose I’m ready. But do try not to rush me. And… explain what I should do with the containers afterwards? Just… to be sure. A swab and a urine sample. And… discretion. Very important. Just… please be quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Take your time. I will leave the room now. When you have collected the samples, please call out my name, and I will return to collect them. After you have collected both samples, you can simply place the containers on the small table near the examination table. I will handle the rest. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I understand, Doctor. Take my time… collect the samples… place them on the table. And… call out your name when I’m finished. Yes. I think… I think I understand. Very well. Please… please give me a moment.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Doctor Eaddy?… Doctor Eaddy, are you there?… I… I think I’m finished.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Thank you. Please remain seated. I'll collect the samples now. Thank you. I'll send these off to the lab immediately. The results should be available in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to keep the area clean and dry. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… no further questions, Doctor. Just… thank you. Thank you for your… discretion. And your… patience. It was… rather unpleasant. I suppose… I suppose I’ll be going now? Very well. Thank you again, Doctor Eaddy. And… please, don’t mention any of this to my wife. Very important.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krok. Your privacy is my utmost concern. I will not disclose any information to your wife or anyone else without your express permission. I’ll be in touch as soon as the lab results are available. If you experience any worsening symptoms in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, Mr. Krok.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. .
