DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, good morning. Lamark, please. I’m here for a physical… for a tryout. Sports team. Gotta make sure I’m not, you know, falling apart before I start kicking again. Want to get this over with quick if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lamark. A pre-participation physical, that’s very wise. We want to ensure you’re in good health for your tryout. I’ll do my best to be efficient. To begin, could you tell me a bit more about the sport you’re trying out for?
PATIENT: Soccer. Been playing a long time. Not as much lately, gotta be honest. Old man stuff creeping in, you know? But still got it, mostly. This is, uh, a local team. Semi-pro, I guess you'd call it. Trying to get back in the game.
DOCTOR: Soccer – excellent. And you mentioned not playing as much recently. Could you tell me roughly how often you were playing before you scaled back, and how often you're playing now?
PATIENT: Well, before... maybe three times a week? Full games, pretty intense. Now? Uh... once a month, if I'm lucky. Just kicking around with some friends, really. Nothing serious. Don't have the time like I used to. Work, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Work commitments can certainly impact those things. And when you are playing now, are you experiencing any pain or discomfort at all?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really pain, pain. But my knees… they get a little stiff sometimes. Especially after running. And my left ankle, it kinda twinges if I twist it too hard. Old injury, probably. Happened years ago. Never really got it looked at properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness in the knees after running and a twinge in your left ankle with twisting. We’ll definitely want to assess those more closely. Have you noticed any swelling in either the knees or ankle?
PATIENT: Nah, no swelling. Just… feels a little creaky, that's all. And the ankle, it's just a quick little zing. Doesn't last long. Honestly, I probably just ignore it. Old man problems, right? You get used to it.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re being proactive about it now, Lamark. Even “old man problems” deserve attention, especially with a tryout coming up. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you step over to the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Sounds good. The quicker the better, yeah?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as efficient as possible. First, let’s just check your range of motion in your knees. Could you bend each knee as far as is comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Uh, okay. That’s alright. That one's a little tighter. Not terrible, just… feels it. Old injury, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. Some slight limitation on the left, as you mentioned. Now, let’s check your ankles. Can you point your toes up and down, and then circle your ankles both ways?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's okay. That side... a little tight there too. Feels a bit weird. Like a little click sometimes. Not painful, though. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I feel a slight crepitus there with the movement, and a bit of tenderness when I press here. No significant swelling that I can detect. Now, let’s check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Could you cross your legs and relax your legs?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, okay. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I'm not a fan of all this poking and prodding, to be honest. Getting old is no fun.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We're just trying to get a baseline understanding of how things are functioning. Good reflexes bilaterally. Now, I’m going to ask you to push against my hand with your legs, both with your legs straight and bent. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Feels alright. Not as strong as I used to be, maybe, but… I can still do it. I used to be a lot faster, though. You wouldn't believe it.
DOCTOR: Okay, strength is a little diminished, but adequate. Alright, Lamark, that completes the physical exam portion. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it seems like you have some mild crepitus and decreased range of motion in both knees and some lingering discomfort in your left ankle, likely related to that old injury. Given your history and the upcoming tryout, I recommend we get an X-ray of your left ankle to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. X-ray… that sounds… expensive. And a hassle. Is it necessary? I mean, it's just a little twinge, like I said. I've been playing with it for years. Can't I just… ice it? Or stretch it? I really just want to make sure I can play. I don't want to waste time and money on something that's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost and time, Lamark. And it’s true, many ankle sprains heal on their own. However, given the tryout, we want to be thorough. The X-ray will give us a clear picture of the joint and rule out any fractures or significant arthritis that could worsen with increased activity. We could also consider a trial of physical therapy – some targeted exercises to strengthen the ankle and improve range of motion. If you don't see improvement within a week or two, then we could consider the X-ray. What do you think about that approach?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… that sounds better. Less poking and prodding. And no expensive machines. A week or two… alright. If it doesn't get better, then we talk about the X-ray. But I'm really hoping I won't need it. Where do I go for that? And how much does it cost roughly? I need to know. I'm retired, you know? Gotta watch the pennies.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I have a list here of several reputable physical therapy clinics in the area that accept a variety of insurance plans, though you mentioned you're currently uninsured. The cost without insurance varies, but typically a single session ranges from $75 to $150, depending on the clinic and the type of treatment. I can provide you with some contact information and you can call to inquire about their self-pay rates. I’ll also write you a referral for a basic course of physical therapy – focusing on strengthening and range of motion exercises for the ankle. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to ice the ankle after activity, and avoiding any movements that cause significant pain. And please, listen to your body. Don’t push through pain. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. That sounds… reasonable. Ice it, don’t push it… I can do that. $75 to $150… ouch. But I guess it’s better than a broken ankle. And a big bill. Listen to my body… easier said than done when you’re trying to impress a coach. But I'll try. Thank you, Doctor. I think that's all I needed to know for now. I can go now, right? I got some errands to run.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can absolutely go now, Lamark. Here’s the referral for physical therapy. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And if your symptoms worsen at any point, or if you experience any new pain, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I wish you the best of luck with your tryout, and I hope you get back on the field soon. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate you not wasting my time. .
