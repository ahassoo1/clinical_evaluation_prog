DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you too. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue. I'm here today regarding a matter at my place of work. It has to do with the masks they're requiring us to wear, and…well, I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption, or at least explore some alternatives. It’s causing me some difficulties, and I wanted to get your professional opinion.
DOCTOR: I see. So it sounds like the mask requirement at work is presenting some challenges for you, and you're hoping I can offer some guidance regarding a possible exemption or alternative solutions. That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Knabenshue. To better understand the situation, could you tell me a little more about what difficulties you are experiencing while wearing the mask?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s…difficult to explain, exactly. It’s not a pain, not exactly. More like…a feeling of being closed in. A tightness in my chest, and it makes it harder to breathe, even though I can breathe. It reminds me of…well, things best left in the past. It brings on a feeling of…unease, and it makes concentrating on my work quite challenging. It's impacting my ability to do my job effectively, and truthfully, it’s causing me a fair bit of stress. I’ve tried different types of masks, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference. They all have the same effect, unfortunately. It's...it's a deeply unsettling sensation.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knabenshue. That sounds very distressing, and it’s good you’re addressing this. It's helpful that you’ve tried different types of masks already. It sounds like this is more than just a simple discomfort; the feeling of being closed in, the tightness in your chest, and the associated stress are significant. To get a clearer picture, and to determine the best course of action, I’d like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind. First, have you experienced anything like this before the mask requirement at work?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Before all of this with the masks, I’ve never felt anything like it. I’ve always been…a fairly open person, if that makes sense. I spend a lot of time outdoors, working with people, and I’ve never had issues with feeling…confined. It really did come on with the masks. I thought maybe it was just something I’d get used to, but it hasn’t gotten any better. If anything, it’s slightly worse now, the longer I have to wear them. I’ve been trying to push through it, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to do my job properly when I'm constantly feeling…unsettled. It’s…a bit embarrassing to admit, but there it is.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Mr. Knabenshue. The fact that this started with the mask requirement, and hasn't improved with time, is important. It suggests a strong connection between the masks and your symptoms. Now, just to rule out other possibilities, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m generally a healthy man, as far as I know. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. No major surgeries or hospitalizations. I do have Medicare, so I have regular check-ups, and those have always been unremarkable. My blood pressure is usually good, cholesterol is fine…nothing significant flagged on those reports. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. As for allergies…I’m slightly allergic to ragweed, but that’s it. It causes a bit of sneezing in the fall, but nothing that requires medication. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle – I eat well, get plenty of rest when I can, and I’m physically active when my work allows. I suppose that’s the gist of it. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: That's all very good information, Mr. Knabenshue, thank you. It sounds like you are generally in good health, which is reassuring. Knowing about the ragweed allergy is helpful. To complete the picture, could you tell me about any family history of medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, my family history is…a bit complicated. I was raised within the Lakota Sioux community, and we didn’t have a lot of formal medical records, if that makes sense. We relied more on traditional healers and remedies. My mother…she passed away when I was young, and I don't have a lot of information about her medical background. My father…he was a strong man, lived a long life, but he didn’t talk much about illnesses. I know he had some issues with his heart later in life, but I don't know the specifics. As far as other relatives…there's been some diabetes in the family, on my mother’s side, I believe. And my aunt had some trouble with her lungs, but again, I don't have a lot of details. It's not a complete picture, unfortunately. We didn’t prioritize documenting those things the way things are done now.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Knabenshue. I appreciate your honesty. It’s not uncommon to have limited information about family medical history, especially within communities with different healthcare traditions. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me a little about the type of work you do?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I work as a Protective Service Worker. Essentially, I assist individuals who are vulnerable, those needing a bit of extra support to live independently. It involves a lot of home visits, checking in on people, helping them with daily tasks, and coordinating resources. It’s a very hands-on job, and it requires a lot of face-to-face interaction. I spend a good portion of my day speaking directly with people, building trust, assessing their needs, and ensuring their safety. Lately, it’s been…challenging, having to wear a mask during those visits. It makes it harder to connect with the people I’m helping, and it's impacting my ability to accurately assess their emotional state. It's a job that relies on empathy and observation, and the mask feels like a barrier to that.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful context, Mr. Knabenshue. Protective Service Work sounds incredibly important, and it’s clear that being able to connect with people and accurately assess their emotional state is crucial to your success. It’s understandable that a mask could create difficulties in that environment. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your current symptoms. When you’re wearing the mask, can you describe exactly what you feel?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It starts with a tightness in my chest, almost like…a band constricting around it. It’s not painful, not exactly, but it’s definitely uncomfortable. Then, I start to feel a bit…closed in, like the air is thinner. It's difficult to explain, but it feels like my breathing is restricted, even though I am breathing. It’s accompanied by a growing sense of unease, almost a panic-like feeling, but not quite full-blown panic. It’s more of a subtle anxiety that builds over time. And it definitely affects my concentration. I find it harder to focus on the conversation, and I worry about missing important cues or details. I feel…detached, almost, like I'm observing things from a distance. It’s…a bit unsettling, to be honest. It makes me feel…vulnerable, which is not a good feeling when I'm trying to help others.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that so thoroughly, Mr. Knabenshue. That gives me a much clearer picture of what you're experiencing. It sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of physical sensations – the chest tightness, the feeling of restricted breathing – alongside emotional symptoms like anxiety and detachment. Now, to help rule out other possibilities, would you say you've experienced any similar feelings at other times, perhaps unrelated to the mask?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. That's what makes this so…peculiar. I’ve never felt anything like it before the mask requirement. I’ve been in stressful situations before – difficult cases at work, personal challenges – but I’ve always been able to manage those feelings. I’ve never experienced this specific combination of physical and emotional symptoms. It really does seem to be directly linked to the mask. When I'm not wearing it, I feel perfectly normal. I can breathe normally, I can concentrate, and I don't feel anxious or detached. It’s…almost like the mask is triggering something, but I’m not sure what. I’ve tried to rationalise it, but it doesn’t make sense. I’ve always been a fairly calm and collected person, and this feels…out of character.
DOCTOR: That’s very important information, Mr. Knabenshue. The fact that these symptoms are exclusively triggered by the mask, and resolve when it's removed, strongly suggests a connection. To get a clearer understanding of your physical health, and to rule out any underlying respiratory issues, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your lungs and checking your oxygen saturation level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need to rule out any other possibilities. I'm happy to undergo a physical exam. I trust your professional judgement, and I want to do whatever it takes to understand what's going on. I've got nothing to hide, and I appreciate you taking my concerns seriously. Let's proceed with the exam whenever you're ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you, Mr. Knabenshue. Please have a seat on the examination table. Take a nice, deep breath in…and exhale…good. And again…deep breath in…and exhale…okay. Your lungs sound clear bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles noted. Now, just a quick clip on your finger for your oxygen level…okay, that’s good. Your oxygen saturation is 98%, which is within the normal range. So, physically, everything appears normal. Your lungs are clear, and your oxygen levels are healthy. This makes it less likely that there's an underlying respiratory condition contributing to your symptoms.
PATIENT: That's…reassuring to hear, Doctor. It's good to know that my lungs are clear and my oxygen levels are normal. It does seem to point back to the mask being the primary issue. Honestly, I was a bit worried there might be something more serious going on. This…this makes me feel a little better, knowing that it's not something physical. So, where do we go from here? What do you suggest?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear it provides some relief, Mr. Knabenshue. Given your normal physical exam findings and the clear association with the mask, I suspect you may be experiencing what’s often referred to as mask-induced anxiety or a claustrophobic response. It’s not uncommon, especially given the prolonged use of masks during the pandemic. While it doesn’t necessarily constitute a formal diagnosis, it’s a plausible explanation for your symptoms. It sounds like wearing the mask is triggering a sense of restriction and unease, which is then manifesting as chest tightness, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating. Now, to explore this further, I’d like to discuss potential strategies for managing this. Would you be open to discussing some possible approaches?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. I'm very open to discussing any potential strategies. I want to find a solution that allows me to continue doing my job effectively, without feeling…this way. I understand it might not be a simple fix, but I'm willing to try whatever it takes. What kind of approaches are we talking about? Perhaps there’s a way to modify the mask, or some techniques I can use to calm myself down? I'm eager to hear your suggestions. I’m particularly interested in anything that doesn’t involve medication, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knabenshue. We can explore several non-pharmacological approaches. First, we could discuss relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises and mindfulness meditation. These can help to calm your nervous system and reduce anxiety. There are many resources available online and through guided meditation apps. Second, we could explore different types of masks. Perhaps a looser-fitting mask, or one made from a different material, might be more comfortable. Third, we could consider a gradual exposure therapy approach, where you slowly acclimate yourself to wearing the mask for increasing periods of time. Fourth, it may be helpful to discuss this with your employer. Perhaps there's flexibility in the mask requirement, or alternative protective measures that could be considered. Finally, if your symptoms are significantly impacting your ability to function, we could consider a referral to a therapist specializing in anxiety disorders. Would you like to start by discussing some of the relaxation techniques in more detail?
PATIENT: Those all sound like reasonable approaches, Doctor. I particularly like the idea of relaxation techniques. I’ve heard about deep breathing exercises before, but I’ve never really tried them consistently. And the idea of exploring different masks…that’s a good suggestion too. Maybe the type of mask I'm currently using is contributing to the problem. I think I'd like to start with the relaxation techniques. If I can learn some effective ways to calm myself down, that might be enough to manage the situation. Could you perhaps guide me through a simple breathing exercise now, just to give me an idea of what it involves? I’m eager to see if it makes any difference. And perhaps you could point me towards some resources where I can learn more?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knabenshue. We can certainly try a simple breathing exercise now. It’s called diaphragmatic breathing, or belly breathing. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen. We're going to focus on breathing deeply from your diaphragm, rather than shallowly from your chest. As you inhale, focus on expanding your abdomen, and try to keep your chest relatively still. You should feel your hand on your abdomen rise more than the hand on your chest. Now, let’s try it together. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose…expanding your abdomen…and exhale slowly through your mouth…allowing your abdomen to fall. Good. Continue to focus on your breath, and try to slow down your breathing. Inhale…exhale…inhale…exhale… How does that feel?
PATIENT: It feels…different, Doctor. I think I'm used to breathing more from my chest, so focusing on my abdomen feels a bit unnatural at first. But I can definitely feel my abdomen rising and falling with each breath, and it does seem to be…calming, in a way. I feel a little bit more relaxed, and less…tight in my chest, if that makes sense. It's subtle, but noticeable. I can see how practicing this regularly might be helpful. It feels like it's forcing me to slow down and focus on my body, which is something I don't usually do. Is there a specific time or place I should practice this? And how often should I do it? Is there a certain number of breaths I should aim for each time? I want to make sure I'm doing it correctly.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Knabenshue. You're doing very well. It's perfectly normal for it to feel a bit unnatural at first; it takes practice to retrain your breathing muscles. There’s no strict rule about when or where to practice. Ideally, you should find a quiet and comfortable space where you won’t be disturbed. You can practice it anytime you feel anxious or stressed, or even as a preventative measure before a potentially stressful situation. As for frequency and duration, aim for 5-10 minutes of diaphragmatic breathing at least twice a day. You can start with 5 minutes and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable. Regarding the number of breaths, focus on slow, deep breaths rather than counting. Just breathe at a comfortable pace and focus on expanding your abdomen with each inhale. There are many excellent resources available online that can guide you through diaphragmatic breathing exercises. I can provide you with some links to reputable websites and apps after our consultation. Do you feel comfortable trying this at home?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I absolutely feel comfortable trying this at home. I think it's something I can definitely incorporate into my daily routine. It doesn’t require any special equipment or a lot of time, and it feels…empowering, in a way, to have a technique I can use to manage my anxiety. I'm particularly grateful for the suggestion, and I'm eager to see if it makes a difference in my ability to wear the mask comfortably. Is there anything else we should discuss today? Or are you happy with us finishing here, and you sending me those resources? I wouldn't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad you find it empowering. I think we’ve covered everything for today. As we discussed, I’ll email you some links to reputable websites and apps that can guide you through diaphragmatic breathing exercises. I recommend starting with those exercises and see how they work for you. If you continue to experience significant difficulties, or if your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment. I'm happy with finishing here. And please, remember to be patient with yourself. It takes time and practice to develop these skills. It was a pleasure meeting you today, Mr. Knabenshue. Have a good rest of your day.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. Thank you for your time, your patience, and your helpful suggestions. I truly appreciate it. I will certainly start practicing those breathing exercises, and I’ll reach out if I experience any further difficulties. Have a good day to you as well, Doctor Abady.
