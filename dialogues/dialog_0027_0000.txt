DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my legs. They just suddenly feel weak. It’s rather inconvenient, honestly. I had a bit of a cold last week, just a normal one, and now… this. It’s not like I have time for this.
DOCTOR: Weakness… alright. And when you say “suddenly,” can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Well, it wasn't gradual. I woke up yesterday morning, and they just… were. Weak. Like trying to walk through molasses. Before that, perfectly fine. I was doing my usual walking tour, no problems at all. It’s quite perplexing, really. I don’t usually have problems with my legs. I keep myself fit, you know? It's part of the job.
DOCTOR: Okay, yesterday morning… and you were doing your walking tour. So, it started abruptly after the cold seemed to resolve?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! The cold was gone, a bit of a sniffle left, but nothing serious. I thought I was in the clear. Then bam. Weak legs. It's not like I overdid it or anything. I’ve done that tour hundreds of times. Honestly, it’s just… unsettling. It feels very strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this weakness in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Both. Equally, I’d say. It's not like one is dramatically worse than the other. It’s… symmetrical, if that makes sense. I had to practically drag myself out of bed this morning, and walking is just… slow and tiring. It’s quite embarrassing, really. A tour guide who can’t walk properly. The irony.
DOCTOR: Symmetrical weakness… that’s helpful. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No numbness, no tingling, no pain. Just… the weakness. A little bit of fatigue, perhaps, but I always feel a little tired after a long week of tours. It’s the legs that are the main issue. It’s just… so odd. I don’t understand what could have caused it. I don't normally get sick, let alone have my legs just… give out.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your bladder or bowel function?
PATIENT: Goodness, Doctor. Do you really need to know about that? It’s rather personal, isn’t it? But… no. Everything seems normal down there, thankfully. Honestly, I'm quite particular about those things. I keep everything… regular, if you understand. It’s just my legs that are the problem. It's very frustrating. I have a tour scheduled for tomorrow!
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Firestone. It’s important to rule things out, and those questions are standard procedure. Alright. Just to recap, you had a cold last week that resolved, and yesterday morning you woke up with symmetrical weakness in both legs, no numbness, tingling, or pain, and normal bowel and bladder function. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Yes, that's quite right. And no, I don't have any allergies. Not to anything, as far as I know. I’ve taken antibiotics before, various things for insect bites when I’m on tour, and never had a reaction. I'm quite careful about what I put in my body, honestly. I can’t afford to be sick when I’m looking after a group of tourists. It would be a disaster! I do take a multivitamin daily, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin daily. Good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and a few other things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Honestly, I just want to find out what’s wrong and get back to work. I suppose an exam is necessary. But please be quick. I have a rather busy schedule, you understand. And try not to… poke too much. It’s just… I’m not very fond of being touched.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Firestone. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. If you’d like to lie down on the table, we can begin. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Can you bend your knees and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Fine. It’s terribly cold in here, isn't it? Hurry up, Doctor. I have people relying on me. And please, be careful with my ankles. I need those for walking, obviously. I’ve sprained them before. It’s quite painful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your reflexes are… diminished, a little bit slower than expected. Now, can you try and push against my hand with your feet?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? It’s rather tiring, you know. Honestly, I feel like I’m exerting myself just lying here. This is all very inconvenient. I should be preparing for tomorrow’s tour, not… being poked and prodded. It's a historical tour, very detailed. It requires a lot of concentration.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Firestone. Your muscle strength is also reduced, but not significantly. It's a bit difficult to assess fully with your fatigue, but it’s noticeable. Now, I’m going to quickly check your sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel it. Perfectly well, thank you. I’m not… numb, if that’s what you’re getting at. Honestly, Doctor, is this going to take much longer? I have a schedule to keep. And I’m starting to feel rather exposed lying here. It’s not very dignified. Is there anything conclusive you can tell me yet? Or am I just wasting my time?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. Based on the exam, the diminished reflexes and reduced muscle strength, coupled with the sudden onset after your cold, are concerning. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing, but it’s suggestive of a possible neurological issue, potentially affecting your nerves. To rule out more serious causes, I’d like to order a blood test to check for vitamin deficiencies and inflammation, and an MRI of your spine to look for any compression or damage to your nerves. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI?! Good heavens, no! I don’t do… machines. And blood tests… are they going to take much blood? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to think I should have just stayed home and rested. This is all very stressful. Are you sure it's something serious? Couldn’t it just be… a lingering effect of the cold? Perhaps I need more rest? I have a very important tour tomorrow, you understand. People are relying on me! An MRI sounds… drastic.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone. It’s not necessarily drastic, but it's the best way to get a clear picture of what’s happening. The MRI doesn’t involve any radiation, and it's a painless procedure. As for the blood test, it’s just a few vials—enough to check for common deficiencies and signs of inflammation. While it could be a lingering effect of the cold, the sudden onset of symmetrical weakness warrants further investigation. We need to rule out more serious causes, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome or multiple sclerosis, even though they are less common. I wouldn’t want you to continue working and potentially worsen the condition without knowing what we’re dealing with. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Guillain-Barré syndrome… multiple sclerosis… Honestly, Doctor, you’re scaring me now! I’m a tour guide, not a… a medical case study! Very well. Fine. Do the tests. But I expect a quick turnaround. I can’t afford to be laid up for weeks. And if it turns out to be nothing, I’m sending you the bill for my lost income. Do you understand? And make sure the MRI machine isn't too… claustrophobic. I don't do small spaces. It's rather unnerving, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Firestone. We’ll get the tests scheduled as quickly as possible. I'll make a note about your concerns regarding claustrophobia and we can discuss options like an open MRI if needed. I will also send the results to you as soon as they’re available. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. If you experience any new symptoms—such as difficulty breathing, double vision, or worsening weakness—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing… double vision… Oh, goodness. This is dreadful. No, I don’t think so. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will this affect my ability to work tomorrow? I have a very detailed itinerary, you understand. It involves several historical landmarks… and a rather discerning group of tourists. They expect a certain level of expertise. And will I be able to walk? That’s the most important thing. I need to be able to walk.
DOCTOR: The results typically take 24-48 hours, Ms. Firestone. I'll prioritize the request to expedite them as much as possible. As for tomorrow, I wouldn’t recommend strenuous activity, but a gentle walking tour might be okay if you’re feeling up to it. However, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, please cancel it. It’s difficult to say definitively whether you’ll be able to walk normally, but the goal is to determine the cause of the weakness so we can provide appropriate treatment. Hopefully, it’s something mild and treatable. I’ll have my nurse schedule the blood test and MRI for you now. She will also provide you with detailed instructions and answer any further questions you might have. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Do that. But make sure the nurse is… efficient. I don’t have time for dilly-dallying. And I expect clear instructions. I’m not one for complicated procedures. And tell her to be gentle with the needle. I dislike needles immensely. Honestly, this whole experience has been terribly unsettling. I should be preparing for my tour, not… being poked and prodded. Very well. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Firestone. I’ll let the nurse know about your concerns. She will be very gentle and efficient. I’m sorry for the inconvenience, but it’s important to get to the bottom of this. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Thank you for your patience, Ms. Firestone. We'll do everything we can to help.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you… I suppose. I expect good results. And a quick turnaround. I have a schedule to keep, you know.
