DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Tayar is name. Uh... travel. I need... travel papers? My wife... she liked travel. Now... I go. Need check for... bugs? Somewhere far.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tayar. It sounds like you’re planning a trip, and you’d like a check-up to make sure you’re healthy enough to travel and to rule out any infections. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah. Healthy. Important. Not like… her. She got sick. Far away place. I don’t… remember exactly where. Just… hot. Lots of… people. Need make sure I don’t get sick. You understand? It's important.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tayar, I absolutely understand. You want to be sure you’re healthy before your trip, especially given your wife’s experience. That’s very sensible. To help me understand what kind of precautions we should take, could you tell me a little more about when your wife got sick?
PATIENT: Precautions? Like… what kind of things? She… cough. Fever. Bad. Doctors… didn't help. It was… last year, I think. Maybe two years? Time… goes fast. We were… visiting. Family. Not here. Somewhere with… monkeys. Lots of monkeys. And… spicy food. Very spicy.
DOCTOR: Okay, visiting family somewhere with monkeys and spicy food… that’s helpful. It sounds like it was a serious illness. Do you recall roughly when during the trip she became ill – was it at the beginning, middle, or end of your visit?
PATIENT: Hmm… middle, I think. We had been there… maybe a week? Two weeks? We ate at… a market. Big market. Lots of smells. She liked the fruit. Then… she didn't want fruit anymore. And she… slept a lot. I took care of her. But… it didn't help. It was… bad. Really bad. I don't like talking about this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tayar. It’s perfectly alright if this is difficult to talk about. We don’t need to go into every detail if you’re not comfortable. Knowing it was during the trip, and that it involved a market, is very useful. Just to be thorough, and to help me determine what precautions you should take, could you tell me anything about the country or region you visited?
PATIENT: Country…? Oh. Nepal. We went to Nepal. Her family is from Nepal. Mountain place. Beautiful, but… dirty. The market was in… Kathmandu, I think. Big city. Lots of dust. And… people touching everything. I don’t… I don't remember much else, honestly. It was a long time ago. And I… I'm still sad. It's hard to think about.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tayar. It's completely understandable that it's difficult to recall details, and that it's still painful to think about. Knowing you visited Nepal, specifically Kathmandu, helps greatly. To get a better picture of your current health, could you tell me about any medical conditions you currently have?
PATIENT: Conditions? I… I’m okay. Mostly. My back hurts sometimes. From work. Lifting… heavy things. Aircraft parts. It's… a hard job. And I get… tired. Easy tired. But that’s… just old age, I think. Not a condition. My wife… she always took care of my health. I don’t usually go to doctors. Makes me… nervous.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Tayar. Many people don’t enjoy going to the doctor. Back pain from lifting is common with your line of work, and feeling tired is something we can explore further. Just to be sure, have you been diagnosed with anything in the past – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Never. Doctors… poked and prodded. Said I was… fine. Always fine. My wife… she worried too much. Always getting me checked. But I was fine. I am fine. Mostly. Just tired. And back hurts. Is that… enough? Can we just… get the papers? So I can go? I need to… visit family. Like she wanted.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tayar. We can absolutely focus on getting you prepared for your trip. To do that, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a look at your back. Would that be alright?
