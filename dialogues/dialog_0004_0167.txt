DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my foot is… hurting. It has a sore on it that won’t go away. It’s been bothering me for a long time now. I think it’s from the sugar sickness, you know? The… diabetes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Diabetes, yes, I see that in your records. And this sore… how long exactly has it been “bothering you”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Let me think… It started small, maybe six months ago? Or was it eight? Time… it goes so fast, you know? But it’s gotten bigger lately, and it really aches. Especially when I try to walk. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes.
DOCTOR: Six to eight months… Okay. And you said it's gotten bigger recently. Can you describe the sore to me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… pretty. It’s red around the edges, and the middle… it’s kinda deep. Not bleeding much, but it looks…raw. Like it needs a good cleaning, but I’m afraid to mess with it too much. I try to keep it covered with a bandage, but it still feels…sore. It's not a big hole, but not small either. About the size of a quarter, maybe a little bigger.
DOCTOR: A quarter-sized sore that’s been present for six to eight months, despite being covered with a bandage… And you're experiencing pain with ambulation, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Pain when I walk. It’s a dull ache mostly, but sometimes it sharp, like a little poke. And it’s…worrisome, you know? I don’t want to lose my foot! My wife… she always took care of my feet, and now… well, she’s gone. So I’m trying to be careful. But I just don’t know what to do anymore. Is it bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, with a history of diabetes and a chronic, non-healing wound, it could be serious. We need to examine it properly to determine the extent of the problem. Have you noticed any drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Hmm… Let me think. Sometimes… a little bit. Not much. It’s… kinda yellowish, I think. And it smells… not good. It’s not a lot, but enough to make the bandage not so clean after a day. I change it every morning, but… it keeps coming back. Is that bad? What does that mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yellowish drainage with an odor… That suggests a possible infection. It’s not something we can ignore. I’m going to need to take a look at your foot, and we’ll likely need to send a sample to the lab for testing. Can you please remove your sock and shoe so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Oh dear. An infection… that doesn’t sound good at all. Alright, alright. Yes, I can take my shoe and sock off. Just a moment… It’s a little tight, you see. Old man’s feet, you know? There. Be careful, it might not look pretty.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take a look… Yes, I see the wound. It is quite deep, and there is significant surrounding erythema. The base of the wound appears granulated, which is not ideal. There’s also some surrounding induration. And you’re right, there is a noticeable odor. Palpating the foot, I note warmth to the touch and diminished pulses in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. This suggests some degree of peripheral vascular disease, which complicates matters. Mr. Stoegbauer, this wound is concerning. I'm going to need to order some blood work – a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel – to assess your overall health and check for signs of infection. We'll also need to obtain a wound culture to identify the specific bacteria present. And, frankly, given the diminished pulses, I think a vascular ultrasound is warranted to evaluate the blood flow to your foot.
PATIENT: Oh my goodness. That sounds like… a lot of tests. Blood work, a culture, an ultrasound… Is it really that bad, Doctor? Diminished pulses… That doesn't sound good either. What does all this mean? Will I have to go to the hospital? I just… I’m a little scared, to be honest. I just want this sore to go away. I don’t understand all these big words. Is my foot going to be alright?
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, I understand your concern. These tests are necessary to determine the extent of the problem and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Diminished pulses suggest reduced blood flow, which hinders healing and increases the risk of infection. We need to know exactly what we’re dealing with before we can say anything definitive. It doesn't necessarily mean you’ll need to go to the hospital, but it could become necessary if the infection is severe. The blood work will assess your overall health and whether you have a systemic infection. The wound culture will identify the specific bacteria causing the infection, so we can choose the appropriate antibiotics. The vascular ultrasound will determine if there’s significant blockage in the arteries supplying your foot. I'll order these tests immediately. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible, and then we’ll discuss the best course of action. Until then, it is imperative that you keep the wound clean and dry, and avoid putting any weight on your foot. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I think so. Keep it clean and dry, don't put weight on it… and wait for the tests. It’s just… a lot to take in. I’m an old man, you see. I don’t always remember things so easily. Will these tests tell me if I’m going to lose my foot? That’s what I’m most afraid of. My wife… she always said I had to take care of my feet.
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, let’s not jump to conclusions. It’s far too early to discuss amputation. These tests are simply to help us understand the severity of the infection and any underlying vascular issues. We will address the infection with appropriate antibiotics and wound care, and hopefully, that will be sufficient to promote healing. I’m going to write you a prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic and give you detailed instructions on wound care. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for three days from now to review the test results and assess your progress. Do you have any questions regarding the antibiotic or wound care instructions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. Just… try to get better. That’s all I want. Antibiotic… wound care… three days. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you looking at it. I hope it's not too bad. Can someone help me get a ride home? I don't think I should be walking on it. And… could you write down those instructions for me? Just to be safe. My memory… you know. .
DOCTOR: The nurse will assist you with transportation and provide you with written instructions. It’s imperative you follow them carefully. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Alright. Next patient.
