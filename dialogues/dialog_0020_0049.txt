DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Beinborn, is it? Lovely name. Well, now… what did bring me in… hmm. It’s somethin’ with my ears, I think. People don’t seem to speak as clear as they used to, you know? Or maybe I don’t hear them as clear. It’s hard to say, really. It's just… quieter, everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, quieter… I understand. It can be tricky to pinpoint those things. So, it sounds like you've noticed a change in your hearing. Has this been happening gradually, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Gradually, I think. Not all at once, no. It’s been… well, a while now, really. Hard to say how long. Years, probably. I don’t keep track of those things anymore. Used to be able to hear the birds clear as a bell, though. Not so much these days. Do you… understand what I mean? I’m not very good at explainin’ these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Mr. Schneer. It’s perfectly normal to have trouble pinpointing exactly when changes happen over time. And it's very common for hearing to change gradually as we get older. So, besides difficulty hearing the birds, are there other situations where you find it hard to hear?
PATIENT: Oh, well… yes. When folks are talkin’ fast, that’s a bother. And in restaurants, forget about it! Too much noise. I just nod and smile, pretend I know what's goin' on. My niece, bless her heart, she says I ask her to repeat herself a lot. She gets a bit… impatient, sometimes. But she’s a good girl. Is that… helpful? I don’t know if I’m tellin' you what you need to know.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Schneer, thank you. Difficulty with fast speech and noisy environments is common with hearing loss. And it sounds like your niece has noticed a change as well. Now, have you ever had any ringing in your ears, or a feeling of fullness or pressure?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes. A sort of… high-pitched whine. Not all the time, though. Mostly when it’s quiet. Like a kettle boilin’, maybe? And fullness… not really. Pressure… no, I don't think so. It just… feels empty, sometimes. Like somethin’s missin’. Does that make sense? I'm sorry if I'm ramblin'. I get lost in my thoughts easily.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Mr. Schneer. That’s very good information. The ringing – you described it as a high-pitched whine, happening mostly when it's quiet – that's called tinnitus, and it's often associated with hearing loss. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago. And… I think I had pneumonia once, a long time back. But other than that… nothin’ much, really. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. My doctor, Dr. Abernathy, he always said I was a sturdy one. He retired, though. Haven’t seen a doctor in… well, a while. I try to stay out of their way, if you know what I mean. Do you need a list or somethin'? I don't keep track of these things. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: No list is necessary, Mr. Schneer. Just knowing about the gallbladder removal and the pneumonia is helpful. And it's alright that you don’t keep detailed records; we’ll figure things out. Now, do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medications… let me see. Just a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. And… sometimes, if my arthritis acts up, I take somethin’ for that. But that’s only when it’s botherin’ me somethin’ awful. I can’t remember the name of it, though. My niece, she helps me with those things. She fills the little pill box for me every week. I trust her to keep me right. Is that… enough information? I'm afraid I'm not much help with these details.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Schneer. We can certainly look up the medications in your records. Knowing you take something for blood pressure and arthritis is a good start. Before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’, thankfully. I used to eat shellfish all the time, no problem. My mother, she was allergic to bee stings, but I don’t think I inherited that. I… I don't think so. I've always been pretty lucky with that sort of thing, too. I've never been one to fuss about allergies. Is that… good enough? I don't want to hold you up.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Schneer. No known allergies is helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your ears, just to get a better look and see if we can identify anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive. Not painful, exactly, but… delicate. I’m an old man, you know. Things don’t work like they used to. Take your time. And… tell me what you’re doin’, if you don’t mind. I like to know what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I'm going to use this instrument, called an otoscope, to look inside your ear canal. It has a light and magnifying glass. I'll just gently insert it into your ear, and it shouldn't cause any discomfort. I’ll tell you what I’m seeing as I go. Okay, looking at your right ear now… I see some wax buildup, which is common. The ear canal itself looks clear, and the eardrum appears intact, though a bit… dull. And now your left ear… similar findings – some wax, clear canal, and a slightly dull eardrum. The dullness of the eardrum could be due to the wax, or it could indicate some fluid behind the eardrum. To get a better idea, I’d like to do a simple hearing test, just to see how well you’re hearing different sounds. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds sensible. A hearing test. Yes, go ahead. I don’t mind at all. Just… don’t shout, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive, remember? And… tell me what you’re doin’, if you don't mind. Like you said. I like to know what’s goin’ on. What kind of test is it, exactly? Will it take long? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Not a bother at all, Mr. Schneer. It’s a very simple test. It’s called an audiometry screening. We'll use headphones, and I’ll play different tones at different volumes in each ear. When you hear a tone, you’ll press a button. It doesn’t involve shouting at all, just quiet sounds. It should take about 10-15 minutes. It will give us a better idea of the extent of any hearing loss you might have. Alright, let’s get started. I’m going to put these headphones on you, and I’ll explain everything as we go. Just relax and press the button whenever you hear a sound.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds… alright. Headphones, you say? Just relax and press the button. I can do that. I used to be good at puzzles, you know. Lots of concentration. Hopefully that'll help. Just tell me if I'm doin' somethin' wrong. And... don't hesitate to stop if it gets uncomfortable, alright? I'm an old man, things don't work like they used to. Go ahead then. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'll start with your right ear. You’ll hear a series of beeps, and I’ll ask you to press this button every time you hear one, even if it's very quiet. It's alright if you miss some – just do your best. Here we go... …Any sound now?
PATIENT: …No. Not a thing. Quiet as a mouse. …Wait… maybe… just a little somethin’? Very faint. Like a… distant bell? …No, gone again. …Quiet. …Nothing. …Just the hum of the machine, I think. …Wait… there it is again! A tiny beep. Just now. I think. …Press the button? Now? …Is this right? I’m not very good at this. …I think… I think I heard somethin’. …Quiet again. …Oh dear. This is harder than it looks. …Just the hum of the machine. …Quiet. …Nothing. …Quiet. …Is this right? I think I need a break. This is… tiring.
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Mr. Schneer. It is harder than it looks, and you’re right, it’s alright to take a break. Your responses are consistent with some hearing loss, particularly at higher frequencies, but we need to finish the test to get a complete picture. Based on these initial results, it appears you have mild to moderate high-frequency hearing loss in both ears. This means you might have trouble hearing higher-pitched sounds like birdsong or some consonants in speech. The wax buildup could be contributing to this as well. Now, I recommend we remove the wax buildup in your ears. That alone might improve your hearing. If it doesn't, or if you continue to have difficulty hearing, we can discuss getting a hearing aid. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That… doesn’t surprise me, I suppose. Not hearin’ the birds anymore, and all. Mild to moderate… what did you say? High… frequency? Oh dear. Sounds complicated. Wax buildup… yes, that makes sense. I get a bit of wax, sometimes. Removing it… yes, that sounds… sensible. A good idea. Less complicated than a… a hearin’ aid, I suppose. A hearing aid… oh, no. I don’t think so. I’ve never been one for gadgets. Too much fuss. Just removin’ the wax, then. That sounds… alright. Is that… painful? I don’t want to be a bother. How does it work? Tell me everything, if you don’t mind. Like you said, I like to know what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Not a bother at all, Mr. Schneer. It’s perfectly normal to be hesitant about hearing aids, and we can certainly start with just removing the wax. It’s a very simple procedure. We’ll use a special tool, and some warm water, to gently flush out the wax. It shouldn’t be painful at all – some people find it a little strange, but it’s generally very comfortable. I’ll tilt your head slightly to the side, and gently insert a small tip into your ear canal. Then, I’ll use a syringe to flush the ear with warm water. It's important to stay still during the process. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh. Warm water, you say? Tilt my head… yes, I can do that. Stay still… yes, I can manage that. It sounds… alright. A bit strange, maybe, but alright. Warm water… not too warm, I hope? I’ve got sensitive ears, remember? And… gentle, you said? Gentle is good. Just… take your time, alright? No rush. And… tell me what you’re doin’, like you said. Every step of the way. I like to know what’s goin’ on. And… if it gets uncomfortable, just stop, alright? I don’t want to be a bother. Just… gentle and slow. And warm, not too warm. Is that alright? I’m ready, I think. Go ahead then. But… slow and gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. Slow and gentle is my priority. I'll use body-temperature water, and I'll stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. I'll tell you every step of the way. Alright, just relaxing your head back for me… and I’m going to gently insert this tip into your ear canal… now, just a little warm water… It might feel a little strange, like a slight pressure… How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh… a little pressure, yes. Just like you said. A bit… ticklish, maybe? And… warm. Not too warm, thankfully. It’s… strange, yes. But not… unpleasant. A bit like bein’ at the seaside, maybe? With the waves… A bit of a whooshing sound, too. Oh… just a little bit of a wobble, I think? Just there. But not… painful. Just… strange. And… a little bit of water, maybe? Runnin’ down my ear. Just keep goin’, I think. Slow and gentle, like you said. And… tell me what you’re doin’, every step of the way. Are you gettin’ anythin’ out? Is it workin’? Just… slow and gentle, alright? And… tell me what you’re doin’.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm seeing some wax coming out now, Mr. Schneer. It's a bit thick, but it's gradually loosening. That little wobble you felt was likely the water dislodging the wax. I’m going to continue flushing for another minute or so to make sure we get most of it out. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. …And now… just a little more water… Keep breathing normally… Almost done now… Alright, that’s all for this ear. Let’s take a look and see what we’ve got…
PATIENT: Oh. Just… let me know when you’re done, alright? Don’t want to be surprised. And… gentle, like you said. …Oh. That feels… better, actually. A little bit of relief, maybe? Less… stuffy, I think? But… a little bit wet, still. And… a little bit of a wobble, still. But… less. Just… let me know when you’re done, alright? Don’t want to be surprised. Oh. That feels… better, actually. A little bit of relief, maybe? Less… stuffy, I think? But… a little bit wet, still. And… a little bit of a wobble, still. But… less. Just… let me know when you’re done, alright? Don’t want to be surprised.
DOCTOR: Okay, looking at your right ear now… The ear canal is much clearer. I can see the eardrum more clearly, and it looks less dull than before. There’s still a little wax residue, but it’s significantly improved. Alright, let’s move on to your left ear now. Same process as before – just relaxing your head back and I’ll gently flush it with warm water… …How is that feeling?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. Just… the same as before, alright? Warm water… gentle… relax my head… yes, I can do that. Oh. Just… a little bit of a tickle, I think? And… a little bit of a wobble, maybe? But not… unpleasant. Just… the same as before. Oh. Just… a little bit of a tickle, I think? And… a little bit of a wobble, maybe? But not… unpleasant. Just… the same as before. And… a little bit of water, maybe? Runnin’ down my ear. But not… painful. Just… the same as before. And… tell me what you’re doin’, every step of the way. Just… the same as before. Is it workin’? Just… slow and gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm seeing some wax coming out now, Mr. Schneer. It's a bit thick, but it's gradually loosening. That little wobble you felt was likely the water dislodging the wax. I’m going to continue flushing for another minute or so to make sure we get most of it out. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. …And now… just a little more water… Keep breathing normally… Almost done now… Alright, that’s all for this ear. Let’s take a look and see what we’ve got…
PATIENT: Oh. Just… let me know when you’re done, alright? Don’t want to be surprised. And… gentle, like you said. Oh. Just… a little bit of a tickle, I think? And… a little bit of a wobble, maybe? But not… unpleasant. Just… the same as before. And… a little bit of water, maybe? Runnin’ down my ear. But not… painful. Just… the same as before. And… tell me what you’re doin’, every step of the way. Just… slow and gentle, alright? Just… the same as before. Is it workin’? Just… slow and gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, looking at your left ear now… The ear canal is much clearer. I can see the eardrum more clearly, and it looks less dull than before. There’s still a little wax residue, but it’s significantly improved. Alright, that’s all done! Both ears are much cleaner now. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh. That feels… better, actually. A little bit of relief, maybe? Less… stuffy, I think? And… a little bit quieter, maybe? Not sure, though. Just… better. Oh. That feels… better, actually. A little bit of relief, maybe? Less… stuffy, I think? And… a little bit quieter, maybe? Not sure, though. Just… better. And… a little bit of water, maybe? Still runnin’ down my ear, a little bit. But not… painful. Just… better. Oh. That feels… better, actually. A little bit of relief, maybe? Less… stuffy, I think? And… a little bit quieter, maybe? Not sure, though. Just… better.

And… a little bit quieter, maybe? Not sure, though. Just… better. And… a little bit of water, maybe? Still runnin’ down my ear, a little bit. But not… painful. Just… better. Now… what happens next?
DOCTOR: That’s great to hear, Mr. Schneer! The relief you're feeling is likely from removing the wax buildup. The water should drain on its own in a few minutes. I'll give you a few tissues to dab your ears as needed. Now, I'm going to repeat a quick hearing test to see if removing the wax has improved your hearing. It’s the same test as before, with the headphones. If there's still significant hearing loss, we can discuss options like hearing aids. But let’s see what the test results say first. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Another test, you say? With the headphones? Alright. Just… let me know when you’re done, alright? Don’t want to be surprised. And… gentle, like you said. Oh. Another test, you say? With the headphones? Alright. Just… let me know when you’re done, alright? Don’t want to be surprised. And… gentle, like you said. Just… let me know when you’re done, alright? Don’t want to be surprised. And… gentle, like you said. Just… let me know when you’re done, alright? Don’t want to be surprised. And… gentle, like you said. Now… what happens next?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. I’ll let you know every step of the way. I'll start with your right ear. Just relax and press the button whenever you hear a tone, even if it’s very quiet. …Any sound now?
PATIENT: Oh… a little bit of a beep, maybe? Very faint. Just now. I think. …Press the button? Now? …Is this right? I’m not very good at this. …I think… I think I heard somethin’. …Quiet again. …Oh dear. This is harder than it looks. …Just the hum of the machine, I think. …Wait… there it is again! A tiny beep. Just now. I think. …Press the button? Now? …Is this right? I need a break. This is… tiring. And… my ears are a little wet still. Can we stop now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. We can definitely stop. You’ve done great, and you're right, it can be tiring. Okay, let’s take a look at these results… Alright, the test shows a slight improvement in your hearing now that the wax has been removed. However, you still have mild to moderate high-frequency hearing loss in both ears. This means you may still have trouble hearing some sounds, especially higher-pitched ones or in noisy environments. Now, we have a few options. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to see if your hearing improves on its own, or we can discuss getting a hearing aid. Would you like me to explain more about hearing aids?
PATIENT: Oh. That… doesn’t surprise me, I suppose. Not hearin’ the birds anymore, and all. Mild to moderate… what did you say? High… frequency? Oh dear. Sounds complicated. Hearing aids… oh, no. I’ve never been one for gadgets. Too much fuss. Just… schedule a follow-up appointment, I think. See if it gets better on its own. That sounds… alright. No fuss. No gadgets. Just… see what happens. And… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. Now… when would that be?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I understand your preference, and scheduling a follow-up appointment is a good first step. How about two months from today, August 2nd?
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… alright. Two months from today. August 2nd. Yes, that’ll do. Just… no fuss, alright? No gadgets. Just… a check-up. And… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. Now… is there anything else I need to know? Anything at all? Before I go?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Schneer. I've made a note of your appointment for August 2nd. Just try to avoid getting water in your ears in the meantime. And if you notice any pain, discomfort, or changes in your hearing, please don't hesitate to call the office. Otherwise, I think that’s all for today. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, Mr. Schneer.
PATIENT: Oh. Water in my ears… yes, I’ll remember that. And… thank you, Doctor. You too. You’ve been very kind. . Now… where did I leave my hat…?
