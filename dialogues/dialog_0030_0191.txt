DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It's a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I requested to come in… about getting tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, and I thought it was time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. That’s a very responsible decision, and I commend you for taking this step. Before we proceed with the testing, I’d like to gather some information to assess your risk factors and ensure we provide the most appropriate care. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, ask away. I’ll do my best to answer everything honestly. It’s good to be thorough, I think.
DOCTOR: Excellent. To start, could you tell me a bit about your sexual history?
PATIENT: Oh… well. That’s a bit personal, isn't it? I’ve been married for… forty years now, to my husband, Samuel. We haven’t… been with anyone else, not for a very long time. But… years ago, before I met Samuel, there were… a few different people. It was a long time ago, though. Does that make sense? I don’t know what details you need, exactly.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Shaub, and you've been very brave sharing that with me. It’s important for me to understand your full history to provide the best care. When you say “a few different people,” could you give me a rough estimate of how many partners you had before meeting Samuel?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Rough estimate… let me think. It wasn't a large number, not at all. Perhaps… three? Four, at the most? It was a long time ago, and honestly, I don’t remember the exact number. We were young, and… foolish sometimes. It wasn’t like it is now, with everything being so… open about things. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. And did you and those partners use any protection during those encounters?
PATIENT: Oh, no. No, we didn’t. It wasn’t something we talked about, or even really thought about, back then. We were… careless. I know that sounds foolish now, but that’s just the way it was. It’s something I regret, of course. We didn't know any better.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shaub. It's good you're being so honest with me. It’s important to remember that knowledge about safe practices has evolved over time, and it's more important to focus on taking care of yourself now. Now, have you ever shared needles with anyone, or received any tattoos or piercings from a place that wasn't professionally licensed?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never shared needles with anyone. And all my piercings – just my ears, really – were done by a proper jeweler. Samuel and I aren’t the type to… do anything risky like tattoos. We’re quite sensible people, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Shaub. Just a few more questions regarding your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Not that I know of. Samuel and I… well, we were both tested before we got married, and everything was clear then. And we haven’t really been… at risk since. Until now, I suppose. That's why I'm here. It's just... better to be safe than sorry, after all these years.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Shaub. It’s always better to be safe. And it's commendable that you’re taking this step now. Now, I'd like to ask about any medical conditions you may have, and any medications you are currently taking. Also, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Well, I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s managed with a small dose of lisinopril. Just ten milligrams a day. Other than that, I’m quite healthy for my age, thankfully. And no, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication before. Samuel always says I'm as strong as an ox, but I suppose everyone says that about their wives!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Shaub. So, just to confirm, you're taking lisinopril for high blood pressure, and have no known allergies. Now, before we proceed with the testing, I want to explain the process. We can do a simple blood draw here in the office. The test detects antibodies your body makes to fight HIV. It can take a few weeks for antibodies to develop after exposure, so if you've had a very recent potential exposure, we may need to repeat the test in a few weeks to confirm the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. A blood draw is perfectly fine. And… I understand about the antibodies. It's been a very long time since any potential exposure, so I don’t think that will be a problem. But I appreciate you explaining it. Just… I hope it’s all clear. It's been weighing on my mind a bit, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shaub. It's natural to feel anxious in this situation. We will do everything we can to get you answers as quickly as possible. Okay, let’s proceed with the blood draw. I'll have my nurse, Maria, come in to draw the sample. She’s very skilled and gentle. While she's preparing, would you mind if I perform a brief physical exam – just checking your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. A physical exam is perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. And thank you for being so thorough and kind. It does ease my mind a little, knowing you're taking everything so seriously.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm… excellent. Blood pressure is a little elevated today, but that can be due to anxiety, as well. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out… Heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Pulse is 72 and regular. Everything sounds good so far. Maria will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've answered everything I was wondering. I… I suppose I’ll just wait for Maria, then. Thank you again for being so patient and understanding. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Shaub. It's my job to provide the best possible care, and that includes addressing any concerns you may have. Maria, could you please come in when you have a moment?
