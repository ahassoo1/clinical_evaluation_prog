DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I’m Dr. TodoroVICH. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I’m not really one for talking about… things. Just feel bloated, okay? Been happening for a bit. Can we just… figure out what I need to take to make it stop? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. “Bloated.” Okay. Well, even if you’re not one for “talking about things,” some details are helpful to figure out what’s causing the bloating, and what’s safe to take to fix it. It could be… a lot of things. How long has this been happening, exactly?
PATIENT: Ugh, a while. Honestly? Don’t really keep track. Weeks, maybe? Longer? It comes and goes. Look, is it something I ate? Because I eat what I want, when I want. I’m a grown man. It's probably just… gas. Can we rule that out first? I don't need a lecture on diet.
DOCTOR: Okay, “weeks, maybe longer.” And it comes and goes. Alright. And you haven’t noticed any particular foods that seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: No! I just told you, I don’t pay attention to that stuff. Look, are you a doctor or a food critic? I work hard, I eat when I can, and sometimes my stomach puffs up. It's not exactly rocket science. Just… give me something for it. I gotta get back to work. This is costing me money, you know?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand you're busy, but dismissing it as "something you ate" without any further investigation isn't responsible medicine. There are things beyond diet that can cause bloating, some of which we need to rule out before I hand you anything. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? I feel… normal, besides the stomach thing. Maybe a little tired, but who isn't? I work long hours. Look, is this going to take all day? I really don't have time for a whole… examination. Can’t you just prescribe something? Anything? I’ve taken stuff before, works fine.
DOCTOR: “Taken stuff before.” Right. Okay. And when you say “tired,” is that just general fatigue, or is it more like… weakness?
PATIENT: Weakness… No, just tired. Like, after a long shift on the pile driver, okay? You know, heavy work. It's not like I can't do things, I just… don't want to after a 12-hour day. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? My stomach’s bloated, I’m tired sometimes. Is that a rare condition I need a specialist for? Because I don't have time for specialists.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. According to your record, you haven't had a physical exam in… over five years. And you're 40 years old. Before I consider prescribing anything, I need to do a basic examination. It's standard procedure. I need to listen to your abdomen, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure. It’ll take fifteen minutes, maximum. Are you willing to let me do that?
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes? Fine. But make it quick. And don’t poke around too much. I’ve got a job to do, you know? This better be worth my time. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. Please lie down on the examination table. I'm going to start with listening to your abdomen. Just relax and breathe normally. Alright… I’m hearing some… active bowel sounds. A little more than I'd expect, but not dramatically so. Do you experience any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Hey, easy! Yeah, that’s a little tender. Not horrible, just… uncomfortable. Like you’re poking a bruise. Look, are you sure this is necessary? It’s just a bloated stomach! It's not a life-threatening emergency.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness in the lower abdomen. And how about here?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah, that's… worse. Seriously, what are you looking for? It feels like you’re trying to find something wrong just to justify poking around. Just tell me what I need to take and let me go. I'm starting to feel like I wasted my time coming here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration. However, dismissing this without proper investigation is irresponsible. The tenderness you're experiencing, combined with your description of the bloating, could indicate a number of things – everything from simple constipation to something more serious. Given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, I'm going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. These tests will help rule out any underlying infections or imbalances. I also want to order a stool sample to check for any parasites or bacteria. Until we have the results, I will not prescribe anything. Taking medication without knowing the cause could mask the underlying problem and potentially make things worse. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A stool sample?! Seriously? You want a sample of my stool? Look, I am a busy man. I don’t have time for this nonsense. I came here for a quick fix, not a whole battery of tests! Is this some kind of joke? You know what? Forget it. I’ll just deal with it myself. I’ve taken care of myself for forty years, I don’t need a doctor telling me what’s wrong with me. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand you're frustrated, but refusing to pursue necessary testing is not advisable. I strongly recommend you reconsider. Given your refusal of testing and your dismissal of my medical advice, I am documenting my concerns about your well-being. I recommend you seek a second opinion. Here's a summary of our conversation. Please read it carefully. .
