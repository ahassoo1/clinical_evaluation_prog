DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’m here because I’ve put on weight, and I don’t understand why. It’s… quite concerning, really. I haven’t changed my diet or exercise routine, and yet… here we are.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Selbitschka. It is concerning when weight changes occur without an obvious explanation. We’ll certainly investigate this together. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me about how long you’ve been noticing this weight gain, and approximately how much weight we’re talking about?
PATIENT: Approximately… let me think. It’s been about six months, I’d say. And… oh, around 15 pounds, maybe a little more. It’s not a dramatic change overnight, but it’s noticeable in my clothes, and… well, I just feel different. I try to weigh myself regularly, but I don't have a precise scale. It's been gradual, but steady.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And just to clarify, you mentioned no changes to your diet or exercise routine over these past six months?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I work as an orderly at the hospital, so I’m on my feet most of the day. It’s quite physical work, actually. And my husband and I… we eat fairly simply. Mostly home-cooked meals. Nothing extravagant, and certainly nothing new that could explain this. I haven’t started drinking soda, or… well, anything like that. It’s very puzzling.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you providing such detail, Ms. Selbitschka. That is helpful. Let’s delve a bit deeper. Have you noticed any other changes along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. Other changes… well, I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual, I suppose. Not constantly exhausted, but… I used to have a lot more energy. And… now that I mention it, I’ve been feeling colder more easily than I used to. I attributed it to the summer being unusually cool, but… perhaps it's connected? I also seem to be more… forgetful, but honestly, at my age, who isn't? Though I do pride myself on a good memory, usually.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Selbitschka. The fatigue, increased sensitivity to cold, and even the forgetfulness could be relevant. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been very healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothing serious. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, but that healed perfectly. My blood pressure is usually quite good, I check it occasionally at the pharmacy. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve never had to spend much time in a doctor’s office before. This is… unusual for me.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Ms. Selbitschka. It's good that you've been generally healthy. And don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. I’ve avoided them like the plague. I’m… not fond of hospitals, ironically, given my profession. But it’s mostly routine work, helping patients, not… being a patient myself. I’ve always been able to manage any minor ailments on my own. This weight gain… it feels different. More worrying, somehow.
DOCTOR: I understand. And that’s perfectly reasonable. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, thyroid problems, heart disease, or anything else that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had some problems with her… thyroid, I believe. She was always cold, and tired. She was diagnosed quite late in life, though. She’s passed away now, unfortunately. My father was very healthy, lived to be 85. He had high blood pressure towards the end, but nothing major. My husband’s family… mostly heart problems, I think. His father had a heart attack. But that’s… about all I know, to be honest. We weren't very close to his side of the family.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Selbitschka. That’s helpful. And now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never have, never will. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit over ten years ago. He’s very healthy now, thankfully. We both try to live a clean lifestyle. It’s important to us. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but nothing excessive. Perhaps one or two glasses, three on special occasions. But it’s not a regular habit.
DOCTOR: Good. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medications if I can. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I’m giving you a list of things I don’t do. It’s frustrating, because I can’t pinpoint anything that might be causing this. It’s… unnerving.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Selbitschka. It is unsettling when things change without a clear explanation. Given your history, and the symptoms you’ve described, I would like to conduct a physical examination. This will help me gather more information and determine the best course of action. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed. I want to get to the bottom of this, and if an examination is what it takes, then so be it. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll do my best. First, I'm going to check your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your thyroid gland. I'll also take a look at your general appearance. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 68 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to feel your thyroid… It feels slightly enlarged and there's a bit of tenderness to palpation. I don't feel any significant nodules at this time, but it is definitely more prominent than I'd expect.
PATIENT: Oh. That… doesn't sound good, does it? My mother’s thyroid… was it enlarged too? I don’t remember exactly. I was quite young when she was diagnosed. Is that… serious? What does that mean, Doctor? I’m starting to feel rather anxious now, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re feeling anxious, Ms. Selbitschka. An enlarged thyroid, or goiter, can be caused by several things, and it doesn't automatically mean anything serious. In your mother’s case, it’s difficult to say without knowing more details about her diagnosis. However, given your symptoms – the weight gain, fatigue, increased sensitivity to cold, and the finding of an enlarged, tender thyroid – it's important to investigate further. I would like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us evaluate your thyroid function and rule out any underlying causes. Specifically, I want to check your TSH , T4 , and T3 levels, as well as a thyroid antibody panel. I’ll also order a complete blood count to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Blood tests… alright. That sounds… thorough. And I appreciate that. I just… I hope it’s not something too serious. Will these tests tell us definitively what's wrong? And how long will it take to get the results? I need to get back to work, you know. I can't be off for too long.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the allergies. The blood tests will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on with your thyroid and help us determine the cause of your symptoms. They won’t necessarily give us a definitive diagnosis immediately, but they are a crucial first step. The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll review them carefully and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a treatment plan, if necessary. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or a rapid heartbeat – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. 2-3 business days… alright. I'll try not to worry too much in the meantime, but it's difficult. Thank you for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience. Where do I go to have the blood drawn? And is there anything I need to do to prepare for it?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I understand your anxiety, and I'm here to support you through this process. The lab is located just down the hall, to your left. The receptionist there will be expecting you. You don't need to do anything special to prepare for the blood draw – you can eat and drink as normal. However, it's a good idea to stay well-hydrated. I'll have the receptionist send over the lab requisition form. And I’ll also have a copy sent to your email address, just in case. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Thank you again, Doctor Kalinski. You've been very kind. I’ll go get the blood tests done now. I hope everything turns out alright. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I'm optimistic that we'll get to the bottom of this. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
