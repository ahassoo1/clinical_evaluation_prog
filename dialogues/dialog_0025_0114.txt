DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. When I lie flat, it gets… difficult. Like something is pressing on me. I don’t know if that makes sense. I just want to get this sorted if you don't mind, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Difficulty breathing when lying flat, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s not constant, mind you. Only when I’m lying down. And it feels… heavier then. Not a pain, exactly. Just… hard to get a good breath. I prefer to sleep propped up with pillows now, it’s easier that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started, I’d say… maybe six months ago? It was gradual. At first, I didn’t think much of it. Just a little discomfort. But it’s gotten worse lately, which is why I’m here now. I don’t want it to become a bigger problem, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Six months… Okay. And has anything made it better?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, propping myself up with pillows helps tremendously. Sitting up, even just leaning forward a little, makes it easier. And… honestly, if I just get up and walk around for a bit, it usually settles down. But I don’t want to have to constantly be moving to breathe comfortably, you see? It’s… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Right, inconvenient. I understand. Now, besides the breathing, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… No chest pain, thankfully. No coughing. Sometimes my ankles swell up a bit at the end of the day, but I thought that was just from being on my feet too long at the library. And… I have been a little more tired lately, but I’m 71, Doctor, so that could be anything. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright. No chest pain, some ankle swelling, increased fatigue… Those are good things to mention. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago. And the doctor told me years and years ago that my blood pressure runs a little high, but it’s been managed with… well, with pills. I take one every morning. And I used to have arthritis in my hands, but that’s not really bothered me lately. Does that answer your question? I try to keep track, but sometimes it's hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. And what about family history?
PATIENT: My mother… she had a bad heart. She passed away when she was 85. And my father… he had diabetes, I believe. And… oh, and my brother, he had high blood pressure too, just like me. Is that important? I’m not sure how much these things matter. It’s been so long since anyone asked me about this.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Vanderwiele. Thank you for telling me. Now, let’s quickly go over some lifestyle questions. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. My husband, bless his soul, smoked a pipe for years, but I always told him to do it outside. I’ve always been very careful about my health. I eat a balanced diet, mostly. And I try to walk when I can, though the heat lately… it’s been dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just the one for my blood pressure, like I said. And… oh, sometimes I take ibuprofen for my hands if they get a little stiff. But that’s it. I don’t like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it. I prefer to manage things naturally, if possible. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your ankles to see about that swelling you mentioned. Then, I'll feel around. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I do hope it doesn't take too long. I have a volunteer shift at the library this afternoon, and I don't want to be late. Go ahead, then. I’ll just sit here quietly.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me… and another… Alright. Heart sounds are a little fast, but regular. I’m hearing some… fluid in your lungs. It’s faint, but it’s there. Now, let me check your ankles. And you’re right, there’s some swelling here. Plus two pitting edema on both sides. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Alright. Now, to get a better idea of what's going on, I'd like to order a few tests. A chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs, and some blood work to check your kidney function and rule out any other potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… Well, I suppose it’s necessary if you think it’s important. I don't like hospitals, you know. Always smells of… everything. But, alright. If you think it will help. Where do I go to get these tests done? And how long will it take to get the results? I really do have that volunteer shift this afternoon, and I promised to cover for Mrs. Peterson.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Vanderwiele. We'll keep it as brief as possible. The lab and X-ray are right here in the building, so you won't have to go anywhere else. The lab will take about 30 minutes, and the X-ray is even quicker, maybe ten. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. We'll call you with the results as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild diuretic - a water pill - to help get rid of some of that fluid. This should help with your breathing and swelling. It’s a low dose, nothing too strong. Does that sound okay with you?
PATIENT: A water pill… alright. As long as it doesn’t have any… side effects. I don’t do well with too many medications, you know. Makes me feel… foggy. And will it interfere with my blood pressure medication? I take that every morning, like clockwork. And could I get a written explanation of everything? Just so I remember what I’m supposed to do. I do tend to forget things sometimes, you see. It's just… a part of getting older. I appreciate you being patient with me.
DOCTOR: Of course. That’s what I’m here for. Yes, I’ll make sure to write everything down for you. The diuretic, furosemide, can sometimes cause you to urinate more frequently, and it can lower your potassium levels, which is why we'll be monitoring that with the blood work. It shouldn't interact with your blood pressure medication, but it’s always best to be cautious. We'll start you on a low dose and see how you respond. Here’s the medication list with instructions, and here's a summary of everything we discussed today – the tests, the diuretic, and what to watch out for. I'll also have the nurse go over it with you before you leave, just to be sure. We'll call you with the results of the tests as soon as they're available. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, I think you’ve covered everything. The instructions seem clear enough, thank goodness. And you're monitoring my potassium, that’s good. Alright. I suppose there’s nothing else. I really do appreciate your patience, Doctor. It's… reassuring to have someone explain things so carefully. I best be going, then, to get those tests done and make my volunteer shift. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before we hear back from the lab. And get those tests done - we want to get you feeling better as soon as possible. Have a good afternoon, and I hope your volunteer shift goes well. .
