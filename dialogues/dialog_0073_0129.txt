DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get this over with. It’s my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. And I take pills. Lots of them. For my arthritis, you know? The ibuprofen. Been taking it for years. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Black stools can be concerning, yes. And ibuprofen can sometimes contribute to stomach issues. “Lots of pills” isn't terribly specific, though. Could you tell me roughly how many ibuprofen tablets you take each day?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t count. It's… enough to keep me moving. Maybe six? Eight? Sometimes more if I’ve been gardening. It depends on the pain, really. Why does it matter how many? It’s just black stool, isn’t it? Not like I'm dropping dead here.
DOCTOR: It matters because ibuprofen, like many medications, can irritate the stomach lining, and that irritation can lead to bleeding. Black, tarry stools often indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract. Now, one or two pills wouldn’t necessarily be cause for alarm, but six to eight regularly... that’s something we need to investigate further. Do you experience any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Oh, for heaven’s sake. I haven’t noticed any bleeding. Just the stool. And no, I don’t have any… what do you call them? Symptoms? I feel a bit tired, now that you mention it. But I’m seventy-three! Of course I’m tired. And my stomach… well, it gurgles sometimes. It always has. Is this going to take much longer? I have a pot roast in the oven.
DOCTOR: “A bit tired” and “gurgles sometimes” are good things to mention, thank you. Fatigue can be a symptom of blood loss, even a small amount over time. And stomach gurgling... well, that’s non-specific, but we’ll note it. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your abdomen, and check for any tenderness. Then I’d like to order a stool test – just to confirm the presence of blood, and a complete blood count to see if you’re anemic. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Don't poke too hard, though. My skin is sensitive. And I don't want any of those… probes. I saw a program on television once… A stool test is alright, I suppose. But if it takes too long, I’m blaming you when the roast is ruined. Honestly, doctors these days... always making a fuss.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Hatchard, I'll be as gentle as possible. No "probes" will be involved – just a simple sample collection. If you could lie back on the exam table, please. I’m just going to listen to your stomach. Deep breaths, if you would. Your abdomen is a little…hypoactive, I’d say. Not alarming, but less active than I’d expect. No tenderness to the touch, thankfully. Alright, let’s get that stool sample ordered, and a CBC. The lab is just down the hall. Do you have any difficulty walking?
PATIENT: No, I walk just fine, thank you very much. I still do all my own gardening! Though the weeds are getting the better of me this year… A “See-Bee-See?” What does that even mean? And you want a sample of… that? Honestly. Is there someone else I can see? This is all so… undignified. I need a pot roast, not a battery of tests. .
DOCTOR: A "CBC" is a complete blood count, Ms. Hatchard. It checks your red blood cell count, white blood cell count, and other things, to see if there’s any sign of blood loss. I understand your frustration, truly. But black stools are a potentially serious symptom, and it’s my responsibility to investigate. It's much better to be cautious. I'm the physician on duty today, and I am best suited to assess your condition. However, I can certainly document your discomfort in your chart. If you’d like, I can explain the process of collecting the stool sample in more detail. It’s quite simple, really. And it will help me determine the best course of action to ensure you don’t end up in a more serious situation. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
