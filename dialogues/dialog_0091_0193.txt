DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Delacour. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Thank you for having me. Well, it’s a bit… embarrassing, to be honest. But I have been having a lot of gas. More than usual. It’s quite disruptive, really. I don’t know what’s causing it. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Goodstein. There’s no need to feel embarrassed – gastrointestinal issues are quite common, and we address them frequently. It's good you're seeking answers. Could you tell me a bit more about this gas?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, it started, I think… maybe a month ago? It isn't constant, you understand. It comes and goes. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes not. And it… varies in intensity. Some days it’s just a little rumble, other days… well, it's quite noticeable. I work at the burger place, you see, and I don’t want to, shall we say, offend the customers.
DOCTOR: I see. A month ago is helpful to know. And the fact that it isn’t consistently linked to eating is also noted. You mentioned you work at a burger place – could you describe a typical day's diet for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A typical day… well, it's not the healthiest, I admit. I usually have a small breakfast – maybe toast and coffee. Lunch is… often a burger and fries from work, to be honest. It’s convenient. And dinner… varies. Sometimes I cook something simple – maybe pasta. Other times, I just grab something quick. I do drink a lot of water, though, I always try to stay hydrated. I also have a sweet tooth and enjoy a biscuit or a small piece of cake with my coffee.
DOCTOR: Thank you for the honest answer, Mr. Goodstein. It's helpful for me to understand your dietary habits. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the gas?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, now that you mention it… sometimes I have a little bit of stomach cramping. Not severe, just a discomfort. And… occasionally, bloating. My trousers feel a little tight after lunch, usually. It isn't painful, just… full. And, I suppose, a little sluggish sometimes, if I am to be frank. Not energetic, you see. I wouldn’t say it’s anything terrible, but I feel it.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Stomach cramping, bloating, and a general feeling of sluggishness – those details are all important. Do you have any changes in your bowel habits – have you noticed any diarrhea, constipation, or a change in stool color or consistency?
PATIENT: Now that you ask… yes, a little bit. It's not frequent, but I have been a bit more… irregular, shall we say. Sometimes it's a little loose, other times it’s a little… harder to pass. And the color… I think it’s normal, but it’s difficult for me to say with certainty, you see. I don’t usually… examine it closely. It’s just… not a conversation one usually has.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Goodstein. It’s perfectly normal not to pay close attention to those details. Thank you for sharing. Now, let's move onto your medical history. Do you have any diagnosed medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… I don't believe so, no. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was many years ago. And I get the usual yearly flu shot, of course. But no, I haven’t been told I have anything… serious. I have Medicare, you see, and they haven't sent me any worrying letters.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known medical conditions besides tonsillectomy. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat most things, and I haven't had any problems with medicines. I did once get a bit of a rash from a plant when I was a boy, but that was a very long time ago and I don’t remember what plant it was.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't take anything regularly. Not even vitamins. I used to take something for my knees, a few years back, but that was just when they were bothering me. I stopped that when it got better. Just… nothing. Plain and simple.
DOCTOR: Very good. No current medications. Now, regarding your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My mother, she… passed away when I was young. From something else, entirely. And my father… he wasn’t a man who talked much about his health, or anyone else's, to be honest. I know my aunt, on my mother's side, had some problems with her stomach, years ago. Something about digestion, I think. But I don't know the specifics. We weren’t a family to… share medical details. It wasn't the custom, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. Family history can sometimes be difficult to ascertain. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. I have never smoked a cigarette in my life, and I do not drink alcohol. I find it… unpleasant, to be frank. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I’m a simple man, you see. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book and a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Very good. Thank you for being so forthcoming, Mr. Goodstein. Now, let's perform a brief physical exam. I'd like to listen to your abdomen, and I'll gently palpate your stomach to check for any tenderness or masses. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment entirely. I am here to find out what is causing this gas, so please, proceed. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable in any way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. I’m listening to your bowel sounds now. They appear to be… slightly hyperactive. And on palpation, I do note some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, primarily on the left side. There is also some mild distention. It doesn’t appear to be acutely painful, but it's worth noting. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Based on your history and this brief examination, it seems likely you're experiencing symptoms consistent with irritable bowel syndrome, potentially triggered by dietary factors. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a stool sample analysis to check for any infections or inflammation. I will also order a basic metabolic panel to assess your overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: That… sounds very sensible, Doctor. Irritable bowel syndrome… I have heard of it. If that is what it is, I am glad it isn't anything serious. A stool sample and a blood test? Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I trust your expertise. Please, let me know how to proceed with those tests. I want to get to the bottom of this, and if these tests will help, then I am happy to do them.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and provide you with the necessary collection kits and instructions for both the stool sample and the blood draw. The blood draw can be done here in the clinic. As for the stool sample, it’s best to collect it first thing in the morning and bring it in as soon as possible. Sarah will explain the proper collection technique. While we await the results, I recommend keeping a food diary to track what you're eating and when you experience symptoms. This can help us identify potential trigger foods. Also, consider trying a low-FODMAP diet temporarily – it can often alleviate symptoms of IBS. I will provide you with a handout detailing this diet. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That all sounds very reasonable. A food diary and a low-FODMAP diet… I will certainly do that. I appreciate the handout. Sarah, you say? I will be glad to meet her. Yes, I do have one question, if you don't mind. About the low-FODMAP diet… is it very restrictive? Will I be able to eat anything at all? I do enjoy my biscuits with my tea, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent question, Mr. Goodstein. The low-FODMAP diet can be restrictive initially, but it’s not meant to be a permanent lifestyle change. It’s more of an elimination diet – we eliminate high-FODMAP foods for a period of time – usually two to six weeks – to see if your symptoms improve. Then, we gradually reintroduce foods one by one to identify your specific triggers. The handout will provide you with a list of high and low-FODMAP foods. Biscuits, unfortunately, often contain high-FODMAP ingredients like wheat and milk. However, there are some gluten-free, dairy-free biscuit alternatives you might be able to try. It’s about finding what works for you. Sarah can also provide you with resources for low-FODMAP recipes. Does that help clarify things?
PATIENT: Yes, that does help. An elimination diet, to find my triggers. And gluten-free, dairy-free biscuits… I suppose I can try those. It's good to know there are options. It sounds like a bit of work, but if it helps, then I am willing to give it a go. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very patient and informative. I feel much better understanding what is going on, and what I need to do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. Remember, it’s a process, and it may take some time to identify your triggers. Please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or experience any worsening of your symptoms. Sarah will be in shortly with the collection kits and handouts. I will review the results of the stool sample and blood work as soon as they become available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. You have been most helpful. I will be glad to meet Sarah, and I will follow your instructions carefully. Thank you again for your time and your patience. I feel much more hopeful now, knowing what to do. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Excellent. You as well, Mr. Goodstein. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
PATIENT: .
