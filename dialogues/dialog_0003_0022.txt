DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s try to be brief. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well... my tummy feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. It’s just… not feeling right. I don't remember when it started, exactly. A little while ago, I think.
DOCTOR: “Big,” you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. It’s… puffed out. Like a balloon, maybe? Not a big balloon, but… bigger than usual. I used to have a flat tummy, you see. Not anymore. It feels… tight sometimes. I don't know if that makes sense. I'm sorry, my mind isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And this tightness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Mostly when I… well, after I eat a little bit. Not always, though. Sometimes it's just there. It doesn't hurt hurt, you understand. Just… uncomfortable. Like a full feeling, even when I haven't eaten much. Is that… okay to say? I don't want to bother you with silly things.
DOCTOR: “Uncomfortable,” alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh, dear. Now, what was that? I go to the bathroom… yes, I do. Is it different? I… I don't really pay attention, to be honest. I go when I need to. Maybe not as often as before? But I'm old, you know. Things change. I'm sorry, I'm not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: Let's try this another way. Any nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea?
PATIENT: Oh, no vomiting. Not recently, anyway. Nausea… sometimes I feel a little sick to my stomach, yes. But not often. And… diarrhea? No, not diarrhea. Just… regular. Mostly. Maybe a little… loose sometimes? But I wouldn't call it… a bad problem. It's just… hard to explain. Everything feels a bit mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Oh, my. That's a good question. I haven’t… stepped on the scale in a long time. I used to weigh more, I think. But I don’t remember exactly how much. I just… haven't been feeling hungry, so maybe? It’s hard to say, Doctor. I don't keep track of these things anymore. Everything feels so far away.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Not that I know of. I don't take many pills, you see. Just a little something for my… for my bones, I think. And sometimes something when I can’t sleep. But I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I've never had a bad reaction, as far as I remember. But my memory… it’s not so good. Maybe I forgot?
DOCTOR: Okay. And what medications are you currently taking, if you recall the names?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that's a hard one. Let me think… the bone one is… a white pill, I think. Small. And the sleep one is… blue, maybe? A little oval. I don't remember the names, no. The doctor just gives them to me. I take them and hope they work. I don't write things down, you see. Too much trouble. It’s just… a lot to keep track of when you get old. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical… exam. Yes. It’s a bit high, isn’t it? But I can manage. Just give me a moment. My old bones don't move as fast as they used to.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. McConnon. Now, if you’ll just lie flat… I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. …Normal bowel sounds. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. … Abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. … I'm detecting some mild fullness in the lower quadrants. No masses palpated.
PATIENT: Oh, yes… it feels… a little uncomfortable when you press there. Not painful, exactly. Just… full. Like a balloon, like I said before. Is that bad, Doctor? I don't want to worry you. Is it something serious? It's just… I get anxious easily these days. My tummy just feels… different.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the examination, it’s difficult to determine the exact cause of your discomfort. The distention and mild fullness are concerning. Given your age and the lack of specific information regarding your medications and bowel habits, I recommend a few tests. We will need to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample analysis to rule out any underlying infection or inflammation. We also need to schedule an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your internal organs. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… a lot of tests. A blood count… and a stool sample? And an… ultrasound? That sounds… complicated. I'm not very good with these things, Doctor. Will it hurt? And what are you looking for, exactly? Is it something bad? I just want to feel better, you see. I don't want to worry my friends. And I don't want anything… serious. I understand you need to find out what’s wrong, but… it’s a little frightening. Could you explain it to me… slowly?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. Let’s take it one step at a time. The blood tests will help us assess your overall health and look for any signs of infection or anemia. The stool sample analysis will check for any bacteria or parasites. And the ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of your internal organs, so we can see if there's anything abnormal. It's a non-invasive procedure, and it won't hurt. We’re just trying to rule out anything serious, like a blockage, inflammation, or other underlying condition. I understand you’re anxious, and that’s perfectly normal. The nurse will explain the details of each test and schedule them for you. For now, I’m going to prescribe a mild stool softener to help with any discomfort. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, a stool softener… that sounds… gentle. Allergies… no, I don't think so. Not that I know of. I told you, I don’t take many pills. Just the bone one and the sleep one. I've never had a bad reaction, but… my memory is so bad these days. I could have forgotten, I suppose. But I really don’t think so. Is this stool softener safe? Will it make me… go too much? I don’t want to be stuck in the bathroom all day.
DOCTOR: It’s a very mild stool softener, Ms. McConnon. The dosage is low, and it’s unlikely to cause any significant side effects. The nurse will provide detailed instructions. Frankly, given your age and the vague nature of your symptoms, it’s more important to address any potential constipation that might be contributing to your discomfort. I’m going to order the tests now. The nurse will schedule them for you and provide you with instructions. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh… well… I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I just… I wish I knew what was wrong. It's just a tummy, isn't it? But it feels… different. You'll find out, won't you? You'll tell me what's wrong? That's all I want. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think I'm ready to go. I hope I haven't taken up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: The nurse will review the results with you once they are available. Try not to worry. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Oh… yes, thank you, Doctor. A good day… yes.
