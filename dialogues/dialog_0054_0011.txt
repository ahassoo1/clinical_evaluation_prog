DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. Welcome to the clinic. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Honcoop is the name. Look, I ain't got all day, so let’s get straight to it. I need… a paper. A paper sayin' I can do somethin'. A… a fixin' paper. For my face. Something like that. I don't rightly remember all the details, truthfully. It's about lookin'… presentable. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. A paper… for a facial issue, to help you look presentable. I understand. It sounds like you might be referring to a medical note for cosmetic procedures or perhaps something related to a skin condition. To help me understand exactly what you need this note for, could you tell me a little more?
PATIENT: Cosmetic… that sounds right. Yes. Listen, a fella offered me a good price. Real good. On somethin' to… tighten things up. My cheeks, mostly. They’re… saggin’, you see? And I gotta prove I'm okay to do it, that I ain't gonna… fall apart on the table or somethin'. I don't know what they need, a doctor's say-so, I suppose. I just need the paper, Doctor. Don’t need a whole examination if you can avoid it. Time is money, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand you're looking for a note to confirm you're healthy enough for a cosmetic procedure to tighten your cheeks. And you'd prefer to avoid a full examination if possible. Mr. Honcoop, even for a cosmetic procedure, it's important for me to understand your overall health to ensure your safety. A quick assessment helps me determine if there are any underlying conditions that might increase your risk. It's not about denying you the procedure, but about making sure you're a good candidate. Would you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I ain’t got a fancy medical history. Never been one for doctors, frankly. I work with towers, you know? Climb 'em, fix 'em. That's real work. Not sittin' around waitin' for somethin' to break. I've had the usual bumps and bruises, maybe a pulled muscle now and then. But nothin' serious. Are you tellin' me I have to get poked and prodded just to get a paper? Because if that’s the case… I might have to go somewhere else. I told you, time is money.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Honcoop. And I appreciate you being upfront about your concerns. I'm not trying to waste your time. The reason I ask is simply to rule out any conditions that might make the procedure unsafe. For example, certain medications or underlying health problems can affect healing or increase the risk of complications. It’s about responsible care. Just a few quick questions, then a brief look at your blood pressure and maybe listen to your heart and lungs. That’s all. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood pressure... fine. Heart and lungs... reluctantly fine. But no needles, Doctor. Absolutely no needles. And don’t go askin’ me about what I ate for breakfast. Just the basics. Quick and simple. And then the paper, right? You give me the paper, and I'm on my way. No fuss, no bother. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Absolutely understood, Mr. Honcoop. No needles. Just a quick check of your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. And then we'll discuss the note. Before we start, could you tell me if you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. Never had no allergies. Dust maybe. Climbin' towers gets you dusty. But no medicines. I don't take medicines. Waste of time and money, I tell ya. Everything I need, I build myself. Now can we get this over with? My lunch break ain't gonna last forever.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably and keep your arm still?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Fast. I got things to do. And don't go squeezin' too tight, I don't want my arm to fall off. This better be quick. Honestly, I don't see what this has to do with tighten’ up my face. It's just skin, Doctor, skin.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Honcoop. Checking your blood pressure is just one small part of making sure you're healthy enough for any procedure. It gives me a baseline to work from. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140 over 90. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d just like to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Elevated? What's that mean? Is that bad? I told you, climbin’ towers is hard work! That'll raise your blood pressure! And I ain’t got time to sit around worryin’ about numbers. Just get it done. Listen to whatever you gotta listen to, and give me the paper. I got a schedule to keep, Doctor. A very important schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. I heard a slightly rapid heartbeat, and a little bit of crackling in your lungs. It could be related to your work, as you mentioned. But given your elevated blood pressure and these findings, I need to ask a few more questions to get a clearer picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or any heart or lung conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. Never. I told you, I don't go to doctors. I fix things myself. Climbin’ towers is all I do. Been doin' it for forty years! A little cracklin’… that’s just dust! And maybe a little shortness of breath, but that's the altitude! You think standin' hundreds of feet in the air isn’t gonna make you breathe harder? Look, Doctor, are you gonna give me the paper or not? Because honestly, I'm startin’ to regret comin’ in here. This is a waste of my time. A serious waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration. However, I can’t responsibly provide a note without a more thorough assessment. The elevated blood pressure and the crackling in your lungs suggest there might be underlying issues that need to be addressed before undergoing any procedure, even a cosmetic one. I’m concerned about the possibility of an underlying heart or lung condition. It would be irresponsible of me to sign off on a procedure knowing there’s a potential risk. I recommend we do a simple EKG and a chest X-ray. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and allow me to determine if you’re a suitable candidate for the procedure. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: An EKG? A chest X-ray? Are you kiddin’ me?! I came in here for a paper, not a whole medical exam! You're tellin' me I gotta get poked and prodded and scanned just to get permission to tighten my face? This is ridiculous! Look, Doctor, I appreciate your… concern, but I'm not interested in a whole investigation. I'm perfectly healthy! Just a little dust, that's all. Give me the paper, or I'm walkin' out. I'll find another doctor who understands I got things to do. This is a complete waste of my time. Absolutely unacceptable. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I cannot in good conscience provide a note without ensuring your safety. Given your blood pressure and the findings from the auscultation, proceeding without further investigation would be ethically irresponsible. I respect your decision to seek another opinion. However, I strongly advise you to consult with another physician and get a complete medical evaluation before undergoing any procedure. If you change your mind, please don't hesitate to contact us. I wish you all the best. .
