DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been…myself lately. It’s a bit difficult to explain, but I just feel…low. Very low. I suppose that’s why I’m here. I’d like to get this sorted out, if you don’t mind. I haven’t got all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: “Low,” alright. Can you elaborate on that a little for me?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Hmm. It’s not a physical thing, not like a cold or a bad knee. It’s…inside. A heaviness, a lack of…spark, I suppose. Everything feels…grey. And I find myself not wanting to do things I usually enjoy. Even my garden, which I love, feels like a chore now. It’s been going on for a few months, at least. I don't really keep track of dates anymore, truthfully. It’s just…wearing me down.
DOCTOR: Months, you say. And this lack of… “spark,” is it interfering with your daily life?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, quite. I used to be very active. Lifeguarding in the summers, ski patrol in the winters… kept me going. Now? I struggle to even get out of bed some days. I manage, of course. I’ve always managed. But it takes effort. And frankly, the effort is exhausting. I canceled a few shifts at the beach last month. Didn’t feel up to it. And my daughter keeps calling, asking if I’m alright. She worries. I don’t want to worry her, but… it’s hard to pretend everything is fine when it isn’t.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specific happened in the last few months that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: Triggered? Hmm. Well… my divorce was finalized earlier this year. It wasn’t…pleasant. We’d been separated for a while, but the paperwork… it made it very real. He… wasn’t a good man, truthfully. But it’s still a shock, you know? Even after all this time. And my oldest grandson, he moved to Canada for work. I miss him terribly. Perhaps those things… I don’t know. It all feels a bit muddled, to be honest. Is that helpful? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Right. Divorce, relocation of family… that certainly provides context. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I can barely eat. Other days, I overeat, just to… feel something, I suppose. And sleep? That’s a battle. I wake up several times a night, tossing and turning. Even when I do sleep, I don’t feel rested. It’s… draining. Like I’m constantly running on empty. And I find myself… more irritable. Snapping at people, which isn’t like me at all. My daughter pointed that out, too. She said I wasn’t myself. She’s a good girl, that one. Always has been.
DOCTOR: Okay. Appetite changes, sleep disturbance, irritability… Let’s move on to a quick physical exam, just to rule out any underlying medical causes. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, that sort of thing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Let's get it over with, shall we? The sooner we figure this out, the better. I have a few things I need to attend to this afternoon. Though, if you don’t mind, could you be quick? I do get a bit… anxious around doctors, you see. Not that you're doing anything wrong, of course. It's just… a general thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here. I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Blood pressure first. 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, if you’ll just take a deep breath… Lungs are clear, bilaterally. Heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Everything sounds within normal limits, physically. But we'll need to run some blood work to rule out other possibilities. I’ll order a complete blood count, thyroid panel, vitamin D level, and a basic metabolic panel. That will give us a better picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Very well. Blood work, you say? Is that done here, or do I need to go somewhere else? Honestly, I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a small garden to tend to, you see, and the weeds don’t pull themselves. Though, truthfully, I haven’t had much energy for gardening lately. It’s all a bit… much. And will you explain the results to me, Doctor? I don't understand all that medical jargon. Plain English, please.
DOCTOR: We can do the blood work right here in the clinic. It should only take about fifteen minutes. And yes, of course, I will explain the results to you in plain English. No jargon, I promise. Just take this to the lab technician down the hall. Once the results are back—usually a couple of days—my nurse will call to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a low-dose antidepressant to start. It may help with your mood and energy levels. It's not a magic bullet, but it's a good starting point. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Let me think… No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Though, my daughter always says I should be more careful. She’s a pharmacist, you see, so she worries about these things. I trust her, of course. But I’ve always been… resilient. Rarely get sick, rarely have problems with medications. But an antidepressant, you say? Is that… a strong drug? I don’t want to feel… numb. Just… better. Is that possible? I'd like to feel like myself again, Doctor. That's all.
DOCTOR: It’s a low dose, and we’ll monitor you closely for any side effects. It’s not about feeling numb; it’s about rebalancing the chemicals in your brain to help regulate your mood. Many people find it helps them regain their energy and interest in things. It’s not a quick fix, but it can be effective. I’ll write you a prescription for Sertraline, 25 milligrams, once daily. Here you go. And I’m also going to recommend you consider talking to a therapist. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to can make a big difference. I can give you a list of therapists in the area if you're interested. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Therapists, you say? Hmm. I've never really been one for talking about my feelings. Always handled things myself. But… perhaps it wouldn't hurt. A list would be helpful, thank you. And is there anything I should be aware of, with the… Sertraline? Any foods to avoid, or side effects I should watch for? I don’t want to be caught off guard. My daughter would have a fit if I got sick. She worries so much. Honestly, I think I'm ready to go now, if you don't mind. I appreciate your help, Doctor. I truly do. I just want to feel like myself again. That's all.
DOCTOR: Certainly. With the Sertraline, common side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, and some sleep disturbance, but these usually subside within a week or two. Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice, as it can interfere with the medication. And it's important to take it consistently, even if you start feeling better. Here’s the information on the medication and the therapist list. If you experience any severe side effects, or if your mood worsens, please contact my office immediately. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Hopefully, we can get you feeling like yourself again soon. Have a good day, Ms. Derasmo.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll… try my best. Good day to you as well. .
