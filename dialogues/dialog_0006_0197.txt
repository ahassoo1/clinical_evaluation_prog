DOCTOR: Right, hello. San Sciarrotta, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. San Sciarrotta. Look, I’m a bit busy today, so if we could just get this done quickly, that would be great. I need the card for the… the driving, you know? The ride-share thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the driving… the commercial driver’s license medical evaluation. Of course. Just a standard check-up, really. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, they said I needed it. To drive for the apps. Uber, Lyft… that sort of thing. I haven’t driven professionally before, not really, but my grandson said it’s good money. I’m perfectly healthy, though. I’ve been logging my whole life, you know? It keeps you strong. No problems at all, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. No current complaints… just the requirement for the license. And you say you've been… logging your whole life?
PATIENT: Yes! Logging. Like… with trees. I operated the machines that cut and haul them. For… oh, goodness, over fifty years. Until I retired, anyway. It’s hard work, but it keeps you fit. Strong back, good eyes… well, they’re a little older now, but still good enough to see the road, I assure you. Did that make sense? Sometimes I ramble.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, forestry work. That is physical. Fifty years… impressive. Okay. And you're generally feeling well, no new aches, pains, or changes in your health?
PATIENT: Yes, perfectly fine. No aches, no pains. Maybe a little stiff in the mornings, but that’s just getting old, isn’t it? Nothing that a bit of moving around doesn't fix. I eat pretty well, mostly. My daughter worries about me, tries to get me to eat more fish, but I like my rice and vegetables. Honestly, doctor, I feel better now than I did twenty years ago. I just want to make sure this card doesn’t have any silly restrictions.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. No significant changes… good. We'll do a quick physical exam just to be thorough, you understand. Blood pressure, vision, reflexes… the usual. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, none at all. And no, nothing I know of. I’ve never really been sick, honestly. Not seriously. I had the flu once, a long time ago, but everyone gets that, right? I don't take any pills, either. Nothing at all. Just a bit of arthritis cream sometimes, when my knuckles get stiff. That’s it. Is that… okay? I feel like I should be listing a million things, but there really aren’t any.
DOCTOR: No, that’s… fine. No medications. Arthritis cream only as needed. Good. And family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… Let me think. My mother lived to be 85, I think. She died peacefully in her sleep. My father… he worked in the timber industry too, like me. He had a bad back when he got older, but that was from the work, not anything else. My brother… he’s still alive, but he’s not very healthy. He smoked too much, always did. He has some heart problems now, I think. But that's him, not me. I never smoked a day in my life. Does that help? I don't remember anything else specific.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Mother, lived to 85. Father, back problems related to work. Brother, some heart issues. Good to know. Now, just to be complete, are you currently experiencing any… well, any changes in your vision, hearing, or balance?
PATIENT: No, none at all. My hearing is still pretty good – my grandson yells at me sometimes when he’s playing those video games, and I can always hear him! And my vision… well, I need reading glasses now, for close-up work, but that’s just age, isn’t it? I can see the road perfectly fine. And my balance… I walk just fine. I go to the market every week, and I don't fall or anything. Honestly, doctor, I feel like I could still climb a tree if I had to! But I don’t. I leave that to the young ones. Does that answer your question? I’m trying to be thorough, I promise.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, that’s good. So, no falls, no dizziness, vision is clear for driving… Okay. Let’s just do a quick exam, just to confirm everything. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There we go. A little creaky, but still going strong. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’m not as flexible as I used to be, but I can still manage.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes… Knees are 2+ and ankles are 1+. And can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Perfectly fine. I used to be very good at tracking things in the forest, you know? Spotting deer, finding the best trees… it takes good eyes. Is everything alright, doctor? You seem a little… distracted. I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, perfectly alright. Just… a busy day. Okay. Can you stand on one foot for ten seconds?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try. Oh! Eight seconds. Not bad for an old lady, is it? My balance isn't what it used to be, but it's still good enough to walk around without falling, I assure you. Is that enough? Or do you need me to do more? I can try harder, if you want.
DOCTOR: No, no, that’s fine. Eight seconds is… adequate. Now, let's just check your vision.
PATIENT: Okay. Twenty-thirty, I think. With my glasses, of course. Without them, it’s… a bit blurry. But I always wear my glasses when I drive, doctor. Always. I wouldn’t dream of driving without them. Is that okay? Please tell me everything is alright. I just want to get this card and go.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Vision is 20/30 with correction, reflexes are normal, heart and lungs are clear… Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but we can monitor that. Overall, you seem… fit enough to drive. I’m going to recommend a repeat blood pressure check in three months, just to be safe. And please continue wearing your glasses. I’m going to issue the medical card now, with the notation of the slightly elevated blood pressure. It shouldn't be a problem. Just be mindful of your health.
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness! Thank you, doctor, thank you! That’s wonderful news. A repeat check in three months, you said? I can certainly do that. Thank you for not making me worry unnecessarily. I really appreciate your time. And… I apologize for rambling on. I get a bit nervous at the doctor’s office. Is there anything else I need to do? Any forms to sign? Or can I just go now?
