DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… a check-up, mostly. My regular doctor, he… passed away last year. I need to find someone new, and this is the closest clinic. I have Medicare, is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is perfectly fine. We take it here. A general check-up is good. Though, frankly, most people come in with something specific bothering them. Still, we can do a basic assessment. Have you been feeling generally well, aside from needing to establish care?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly well. I… get tired sometimes, but I am 57, yes? That is normal, no? My knees ache a little when it rains, but… I work with cars all day. Lots of bending and… standing. It is hard work. I don’t think it is so bad, but… maybe you should look?
DOCTOR: Tiredness can be normal at your age, yes. But it's good you mention it. And aches and pains are… common. Though, working with cars all day, bending and standing… that definitely puts strain on the body. We'll take a look. Just to be thorough. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had… the flu, many times. And when I was little, I had chickenpox. Nothing… serious. Oh! And I broke my arm when I was a teenager, falling from a tree. But it healed good. I don’t think… I don’t think anything else. No, not really. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… sufficient for now. No chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. My husband… he had high blood pressure, but I do not. I always… I always felt very healthy. I eat… normal food. Not too much sugar. I try. He liked sweets, but I… not so much. He passed away two years ago, you see. It was… a shock. I am still getting used to… everything.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, that’s good to know. A family history of high blood pressure is relevant, though. Any other significant medical issues in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had problems with her… her stomach. She had an operation, I think. A long time ago. My father… he smoked. A lot. He died young, from… from something with his lungs, I think. But that was a long time ago. I never smoked. I don’t drink much either. Just… a little wine with dinner, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take anything. Not even vitamins. I always thought… if I eat good food, I should be okay. My husband, he took pills for his blood pressure, but… I never needed them. I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. If you could just sit up here on the examination table…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… good. Be careful, is this table strong? It looks… a little wobbly.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly safe, Ms. Benites. I assure you. Now, if you could just relax your shoulders… I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out…
PATIENT: Like this? Is that okay? I always feel… funny when someone listens to my chest. It makes me… nervous. Is everything alright? You are very close.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine. Perfectly normal to feel a little…self-conscious. Your heart sounds…regular. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sound on the lower lobes. Probably nothing. Any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I worked in a factory when I was young, but… it was not too bad. Just… dusty sometimes. I always tried to… hold my breath. My mother said it was good for my lungs. Is… is something wrong? You are looking at me very seriously.
DOCTOR: No, no, not necessarily "wrong." Just… noting things. A little diminished breath sound can be normal, especially if you've had some dust exposure in the past. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Okay. It feels… tight. Is this going to hurt? I don’t like feeling… squeezed. My husband always said his blood pressure was very high. He worried about it a lot. Is it bad to worry?
DOCTOR: It shouldn't hurt, just a slight pressure. And worrying… well, worrying doesn't help, certainly. Your blood pressure is… 140 over 90. A little elevated. Not alarmingly so, but something we should monitor. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Could you bend them for me, if you can?
PATIENT: Oh… that feels… a little sore. Like this? It’s worse when it rains, you see. And when I have been working with cars all day. It’s just… old age, I think. Is there anything you can do about it? I don’t want to stop working, you see. I like working with cars.
DOCTOR: There's some crepitus, and mild tenderness on the medial joint line of both knees. Likely osteoarthritis. It's very common with your activity level and age. Stopping work isn't necessarily the answer. We can discuss some options – physical therapy, pain management, possibly injections. Can you fully extend this leg?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… difficult. It feels… stuck. Not completely stuck, but… tight. Like something is… blocking it. Is that bad? I haven’t told anyone about this before. I just… tried to ignore it. Is it a serious problem, Doctor? I worry about falling.
DOCTOR: There's a slight restriction in full extension, yes. And some mild swelling. It could be a meniscal tear, or just significant arthritis. We need to get an X-ray to rule out anything serious. I'm going to order one now. It's unlikely to be a catastrophic injury, but it’s better to be certain. Then we can discuss a treatment plan. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. My husband, he was allergic to… penicillin, I think. But I never had any problems. I ate everything. I liked… pickles. And… and cherries. No, I don't think I am allergic to anything. Is the X-ray… is it safe? I worry about… radiation.
DOCTOR: The amount of radiation from an X-ray is minimal, Ms. Benites. It’s perfectly safe, and the benefits of ruling out a serious injury far outweigh the risks. We’ll take a few images of both knees. While we're waiting for the results, let's talk about your lifestyle. What's a typical day like for you?
PATIENT: A typical day… I wake up, eat breakfast. Then I go to work. I work on cars all day. Fixing them, changing oil, tires… everything. It is hard work, but I like it. I come home, eat dinner. Watch television, sometimes. Then I go to bed. It is… quiet. Since my husband passed away, it is very quiet. Is that enough information, Doctor? I don't do much… exciting.
DOCTOR: That’s… sufficient. And do you do any regular exercise, besides working on cars?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. I used to… walk sometimes, with my husband. But… not anymore. It is too lonely. And my knees… they hurt if I walk too much. I try to move around at work, but… it is not the same. Is exercise… important? I always thought if I ate good food, that was enough.
DOCTOR: Exercise is important for overall health, Ms. Benites. But we’ll start small. We need to get these X-rays first, then we can discuss a plan that’s right for you. The technician will come in shortly to take the images. Just try to relax, and follow their instructions. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. It is nice to… talk to someone. It has been a long time since I had a proper check-up. I hope the X-rays are not… too bad. And I hope I can still work on cars. It is all I know.
