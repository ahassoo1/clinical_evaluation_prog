DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I… believe I need to arrange some paperwork, regarding future care. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… should things become difficult. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, and I want to be prepared. It has something to do with an Advance Directive or a POLST form, I think? My… ex-husband mentioned it.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you, Evann, to be proactive about this. It’s excellent that you’re thinking ahead. An Advance Directive and a POLST form are both good options for ensuring your wishes are respected. To clarify, when you say your memory isn’t what it once was, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to explain. It’s not a complete loss, Doctor, more like… gaps. Vague recollections. Important details sometimes slip my mind. Dates, names… even conversations. It’s been getting progressively worse over the last few years, I believe. I don’t recall a specific diagnosis, if that’s what you’re asking. My ex-husband suggested this paperwork would be helpful, because of it, I think. He said it would cover things if I were unable to… articulate my preferences.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Evann. It sounds like you’ve noticed some concerning changes in your memory, and it’s good you’re addressing them. I see here in your record there aren't any prior documented concerns about memory loss. To get a better understanding, could you describe a typical instance where you experience these memory gaps?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just yesterday, actually. I went to the market for… for groceries. I had a list, I’m certain of it. But when I arrived, I couldn’t recall what was on the list. I wandered around for quite some time, trying to remember, but it was… gone. I ended up buying mostly things I already had at home. Small things, like tea and biscuits. Not the essentials. It’s frustrating, Doctor. And a little… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: That does sound frustrating, Evann. It's completely understandable why you'd feel that way. Losing track of things like a grocery list can be unsettling. To help me get a clearer picture, let’s do a quick review of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… not that I recall. I had the usual childhood ailments, of course, but nothing major. No serious injuries, either. I broke my wrist once, when I was quite young, but it healed completely. I did have a rather severe bout of influenza a few years ago. It was quite debilitating, but I recovered fully. I… I don’t believe I’ve been hospitalized for anything else. I had regular check-ups with my previous physician, but I haven’t seen a doctor consistently in… well, some time, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. My previous physician always said I was remarkably healthy, if a little… absent-minded. I don't recall any specific diagnoses of that nature. I did have some… discomfort in my joints a few years ago, but it was dismissed as simply aging. Nothing serious, I was told. I suppose I should have kept better records. It’s all rather hazy, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Evann. We’ll try to piece things together. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have experienced memory loss, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My family… we weren't very close. My parents passed away when I was young, and I didn’t have any siblings. I had an aunt, on my mother’s side, who… well, she spent her later years in a care facility. I believe she suffered from some sort of… confusion. But I wasn't involved in her care, and I don’t know the specifics. My grandmother, on my father’s side, was very sharp, right up until the end. I don’t recall anyone else… It’s not something we discussed openly, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Evann. It’s helpful to know, even if the information is limited. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not currently. I haven't needed any prescription medication in… years. I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for… minor aches and pains, but that’s it. And I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a while ago. I don’t really believe in them. I stopped taking the multivitamin… perhaps a year or two ago. It’s all a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. I should be more organized. It’s a terrible habit.
DOCTOR: Alright, Evann. That gives me a good starting point. Now, to get a better understanding of your cognitive function, I’d like to perform a brief cognitive assessment. It will involve some simple questions and tasks, just to assess your memory, attention, and language skills. It shouldn't take long, and it will help me determine if further evaluation is needed. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If it will help, then please, proceed. I understand it's necessary. I just… I hope I don’t make a fool of myself. My memory is rather unreliable, as you know. But I will do my best.
DOCTOR: You won’t make a fool of yourself, Evann. This is a safe and confidential environment, and I’m here to help, not to judge. It’s simply a way for me to gather information and determine the best course of action. Okay, let’s start with a simple question. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… Oh dear. Let me think… It’s… August. Definitely August. But the day… Is it the 1st? No, that feels wrong. I believe it’s the 2nd. August 2nd, 2025. Is that correct? I’m terribly sorry, Doctor. I really should know this.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Evann. August 2nd, 2025. That’s a good start. Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: We are… in a doctor’s office. Yes, that much is clear. It’s… a suburban clinic. Dr. Petrimoulx’s office. Is that correct? It’s… a very nice office. I apologize again for my… vagueness. I’m doing my best to recall details, but it’s proving difficult.
DOCTOR: You are doing perfectly fine, Evann. You are in Dr. Petrimoulx’s office, and yes, it is a suburban clinic. Now, let’s try a memory test. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me immediately. Then, I’ll ask you to recall them again in a few minutes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m ready. Please proceed. I will try my utmost to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me, please.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. I believe that is correct. Now, we wait for a few minutes, yes? I will try to keep them in mind. It’s… surprisingly difficult.
DOCTOR: That’s right, Evann. We’ll wait a few minutes, and then I’ll ask you to recall those three words again. While we wait, let’s just briefly discuss your sleep. How have you been sleeping lately?
PATIENT: My sleep… is rather fragmented, I’m afraid. I don’t sleep very soundly. I often wake up during the night, and have trouble falling back asleep. It’s not a consistent issue, but it happens frequently enough to be… bothersome. I don’t feel particularly rested when I wake up. I attribute it to… general anxiety, I suppose. And perhaps… my age. It’s not unusual, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not unusual at all, Evann. Fragmented sleep and difficulty falling back asleep are common concerns, especially with increasing age and anxiety. Now, before we return to the memory test, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: My appetite… has been somewhat diminished, I believe. I don't feel as hungry as I used to. And yes, I have lost a little weight, though it's not drastic. I haven't been intentionally trying to lose weight, so it’s a bit concerning. It’s not a significant amount, but enough to notice, perhaps. I suppose it’s just another symptom of… feeling unwell. It’s difficult to pinpoint the cause, of course. Everything feels rather… disconnected.
DOCTOR: Alright, Evann. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's revisit those three words I asked you to remember earlier. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is… embarrassing. Let me think… I remember something about… a fruit? And… furniture? I’m terribly sorry, Doctor. I’m afraid they’ve completely slipped my mind. I recall that I was supposed to remember three words, but the words themselves… are gone. I apologize. It’s just… a complete blank.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Evann. Don’t apologize. It’s not uncommon to have difficulty recalling things, and this test is simply a tool to help me assess your cognitive function. You remembered that there were three words, and that’s a good start. Based on your responses to the questions, and the results of this brief assessment, I think it would be beneficial to order some further testing. I'd like to order a comprehensive blood panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I also recommend a neurocognitive evaluation with a specialist, which will involve more detailed testing of your memory, attention, and language skills. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. If further testing will help determine the cause of these issues, then please, proceed. I trust your judgment. A comprehensive blood panel and a neurocognitive evaluation… yes, that seems like a logical next step. I must admit, I’m a little apprehensive. But I understand it’s necessary. And I appreciate your… patience and understanding. I apologize for being so… forgetful.
DOCTOR: You have nothing to apologize for, Evann. We're simply gathering information, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Alright. I will write the orders for the blood panel now. The lab is located just down the hall, and they should be expecting you. As for the neurocognitive evaluation, I have a referral here for Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s an excellent specialist. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on getting good sleep, maintaining a healthy diet, and staying socially active. These things can all contribute to overall cognitive health. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t believe so. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything clearly. I appreciate your… kindness and patience. Just one small thing… regarding the Advance Directive and POLST form that I initially came to discuss… should I postpone that until after the results of these tests are available? I wouldn’t want to make any decisions while my cognitive function is… uncertain.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible question, Evann, and a very good point. Yes, I would recommend postponing the discussion about the Advance Directive and POLST form until after we have the results of the testing and a clearer understanding of your cognitive function. It’s important to make those decisions when you’re feeling at your best and are able to fully understand the implications. So, let’s focus on getting those tests done first. Once we have those results, we can revisit the topic and make informed decisions together. Here are the orders for the blood panel, and the referral to Dr. Sharma. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any other concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and… reassurance. I feel… slightly less anxious now. I will schedule the blood work tomorrow and contact Dr. Sharma’s office. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you, once again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Please, take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day as well. And please, keep me updated on how things go. .
