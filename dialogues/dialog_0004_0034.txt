DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bonck. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Well, I just moved here… not too long ago. It’s a… social thing, I think? Like, to get set up with healthcare around here? I have Medicare, and someone said I should come. I don’t really… remember all the details, sorry.
DOCTOR: I see. Establishing care is always a good first step. And Medicare is excellent coverage. While a general check-up is certainly reasonable, it sounds like you don’t have a specific complaint driving this visit. To make the best use of our time, let's clarify – are you currently experiencing any health issues, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but everyone does, right? And my back… it kinda aches after I’ve been working on stuff. But I do a lot of… building things. For my job. It’s… mechanical stuff. I don’t think that’s anything wrong, wrong. Just… old. I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: "Old," as in… how long has this back pain been going on?
PATIENT: Oh… a while. Months, maybe? It comes and goes. Worse when I’m bending a lot, or lifting things. It’s hard to say exactly… I don’t really keep track of that sort of thing, I guess. It hasn’t stopped me from working, though.
DOCTOR: Right. And this tiredness… is it constant, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes. Some days I feel okay, and other days I just… want to sit. It’s not like, sick tired, just… regular tired. I don't know if that makes sense. It’s probably just the job, you know? It can be pretty demanding.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this tiredness – perhaps difficulty concentrating, changes in your appetite, or sleep disturbances?
PATIENT: Oh… um… maybe? I sometimes have trouble falling asleep, but I always do eventually. And I… I guess I haven't been eating as much lately. Not because I don’t want to, just… haven’t been very hungry. I don't know if that's related. It’s hard to remember what I ate yesterday, honestly.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I mean, I take a multivitamin sometimes, but not every day. Just when I remember. It’s the gummy kind. Nothing else, though. Definitely not anything regular.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: I… don’t think so. I mean, I’ve been to doctors before, but… nothing serious. Just check-ups, mostly. My mom always took me when I was little. I don’t really remember what they told her. I think everything was always… okay.
DOCTOR: And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No… not that I recall. I broke my arm when I was a kid, I think. But that was a long time ago. Just a cast. Nothing… big. I don't really remember much about it. I mostly just remember being bored with the cast.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Um… my mom, yes. She’s okay. She lives… far away. My dad… he passed away a few years ago. I don't really… talk about it much. He… he had some problems with his heart, I think. But I don’t know the details. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I see. And did anyone else in your family – grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles – have any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or mental health issues?
PATIENT: Um… my grandma, on my mom’s side, she had… something with her memory. Like, she forgot things a lot. And my uncle, he… he had some problems with his weight, I think. But that’s about all I know. It’s hard to remember everyone’s stuff. Everyone has something, right?
DOCTOR: Right. Now, briefly, could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Um… okay. I work, mostly. I'm a mechanical engineering tech. So, I’m on my feet a lot, building and fixing stuff. I live with my husband… he's really good at cooking. We don't really… go out much. Mostly just stay home. I don't really have much time for hobbies, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Definitely not. I don’t like any of that stuff. Never have. My husband… he has a beer sometimes, on weekends, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on what you've told me, and the fact that you’ve not described any acute symptoms, I’m not overly concerned at this point. However, your fatigue and back pain warrant some investigation. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. Is that… is that going to take long? I have… stuff to do later.
DOCTOR: 82 kilograms. And your height is recorded as 150 centimeters. That puts your BMI at… 36.2. We’ll discuss that later. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… normal. I sometimes get a little winded when I’m climbing stairs, but that’s probably just because I’m not very… fit. I haven't been exercising much lately. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… normal. Sometimes it feels a little… bloated, but that’s probably just what I ate. Or didn't eat. That spot… is a little sensitive, maybe? But it’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Reflexes seem normal. And finally, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90, and pulse is 80. A bit elevated, but not alarming. Given your BMI and blood pressure, we should run some basic blood work to rule out any underlying issues like pre-diabetes or high cholesterol. We’ll also check a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone. I'm also going to order a urinalysis, just to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… complicated. But, yeah. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t really understand all those words, though. Will it take long? And… will it hurt? I just want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Bonck. The blood work itself is a simple draw – a little pinch, that’s all. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours. While we wait for those results, I recommend you focus on improving your diet and incorporating regular exercise into your routine. Even a 30-minute walk each day can make a significant difference. We can discuss a referral to a nutritionist if you’d like. And I suggest monitoring your blood pressure at home, using an over-the-counter device. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Um… a nutritionist? I don’t know. That sounds… expensive. And I’m really busy. What about the blood pressure thing? How do I… do that? I don’t really know anything about… machines.
DOCTOR: A home blood pressure monitor is relatively inexpensive, Ms. Bonck, and it’s a worthwhile investment in your health. The pharmacy can show you how to use it, and I can provide you with a written guide. It’s simply a matter of wrapping the cuff around your arm and pressing a button. I'll also give you a handout with guidelines on what your readings should be. In the meantime, let's focus on the blood work. I'll send the order to the lab now. You can go there at your convenience. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Okay… two weeks. That sounds… okay. So, I just… go to the lab? And then I come back here? Is there… anything I need to do before the blood work? Like, should I not eat anything? Or… drink anything? I always forget things like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Bonck. You need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drink – except water – for 12 hours prior to your appointment. The lab will likely remind you of this, but I wanted to emphasize it. Here is a handout with all of the pre-blood work instructions, as well as a list of local labs. Please review it carefully. I’ll see you in two weeks. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll try to remember everything. .
