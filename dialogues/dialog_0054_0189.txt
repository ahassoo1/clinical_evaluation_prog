DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about my… business. Down there. I noticed something wasn't quite right, and frankly, it’s unsettling. Blood, you see. In the stool. Not a good sign, I assure you. A man needs to be… regular. And this is not regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Blood in the stool can certainly be concerning, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What exactly do you want to know? It was… red. Obviously. And not just a little streak, mind you. A proper amount. Happened twice now, over the last… three days, I suppose. I eat a sensible diet. Mostly. Not like these youngsters with their… processed foods. I’ve been flying for sixty years, you know. A man needs his strength.
DOCTOR: Sixty years of flying – that’s remarkable! Thank you for sharing that. Okay, so red blood, a noticeable amount, twice in the last three days. That helps. Is the blood bright red, or darker, more like a maroon color?
PATIENT: Bright red. Definitely bright red. Like… well, like you’d expect blood to look, I suppose. Not dark and… sludgy. It was fresh, if you catch my meaning. And it wasn’t mixed in with everything, exactly. More… coating it. Unpleasant business, really. I haven’t seen anything like it since… well, never mind. It’s best not to dwell on the past.
DOCTOR: Okay, bright red blood coating the stool. And you said it happened twice in the last three days. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with bowel movements, or any pain in your abdomen at all?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A bit of… straining, perhaps. But a man my age, you expect a little of that. Nothing severe. And no cramps or anything. Just… the blood. It's the blood that's concerning, not some little ache. I’ve taken worse knocks in the cockpit, let me tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant pain, just some straining. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently – like becoming more frequent, less frequent, or a change in the consistency of your stool?
PATIENT: Consistency? Goodness. Now you're asking me to be a… a stool inspector. It's been… normal, mostly. A bit softer than usual, maybe. But not diarrhea, if that's what you're thinking. Just… not as firm as it ought to be. I used to be able to… well, never you mind. A man doesn't discuss these things with strangers.
DOCTOR: I understand. You don't have to go into detail if you're not comfortable. So, slightly softer stools than usual, but no diarrhea. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, or any fatigue – feeling unusually tired?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. I haven't been weighing myself, if that's what you mean. My wife used to keep track of that sort of thing. Since the divorce… well, it’s not a priority. And tired? A little, perhaps. But a man my age is always a little tired. Flying across time zones does things to a body, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. No recent intentional weight loss, and fatigue that could be related to age and travel. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical history? Hmph. Not much to tell you. I’ve been remarkably healthy, all things considered. A bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me once. But nothing that required… pills, or anything. I don't believe in coddling the body. A bit of fresh air and hard work is all a man needs. Besides, I've always been too busy flying to bother with doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure, but generally healthy and haven't taken many medications. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Not a fan of being cut open. Had my appendix out when I was a boy, I suppose. That’s about it. And one time I broke my arm when I was learning to fly, but that didn’t require a hospital, just a good cast. Mostly just bumps and bruises over the years. A pilot gets a few of those, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removed as a child and a broken arm, otherwise generally healthy. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. A good, hearty breakfast is essential for a long flight. Don't believe in those fancy food restrictions. A bit of dust bothers my eyes sometimes, but that's hardly an allergy. A man needs to be resilient. I've flown through worse than a little pollen, let me tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. I told you, I don’t believe in coddling the body. A bit of a stiff drink now and then, perhaps. But that’s hardly a medication. Used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but I stopped. Didn't seem to be doing much good, and I didn't like the side effects. A man needs to be in control of his own body, not relying on… potions.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have had any history of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or any other digestive problems?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he was a strong man. Never sick a day in his life, as far as I know. Mother… she had a bit of… stomach trouble, now that I think about it. But she never went to the doctor, so who knows what it was. My sister… she’s still alive, but we don’t talk much. She always was a bit… delicate. I doubt she'd know anything about digestive problems. No, not that I recall. We weren’t a family that discussed… these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, some vague history of stomach trouble in your mother, but generally no known family history of colon cancer or other digestive problems. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. A pilot needs a clear head, and that means a clean living. My co-pilot, old Jack, used to smoke like a chimney. Terrible habit. Shortened his life, I always said. No, I’ve always been very careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Good. And how much alcohol do you drink, on average?
PATIENT: Well, now. That depends on the week. If I'm not flying, a glass of scotch with dinner, perhaps two. Good scotch, mind you. When I am flying, well, let's just say a pilot needs to unwind after a long flight. A bit more than usual, perhaps. But nothing excessive. A man needs to relax. It helps with the stress.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, what do you do for work, and do you have any significant travel history, besides your flying?
PATIENT: Work? I am a pilot, I told you. Been flying for sixty years. Commercial mostly, some private charters. And travel? Everywhere. Literally everywhere. Asia, Africa, South America, Europe… you name it, I've been there. That’s why I said I'm always a little tired. Constantly crossing time zones does a number on a man. I’ve seen more of the world than most people can dream of.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for all of that information, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and do a rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Good heavens. Must we? I'm not a fan of being… poked and prodded. Is it absolutely necessary? I’ve told you everything, haven’t I? Surely that's enough. I’m an old man. A bit of dignity, if you please.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize for the discomfort. You’re right, you’ve given me a lot of valuable information. However, given the presence of blood in your stool, a rectal exam is an important part of the evaluation. It allows me to check for things like hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or any other masses that could be causing the bleeding. It's a quick exam, and I'll be as gentle as possible. It's important to rule out anything serious. We can discuss alternatives, but it may mean needing further, more invasive testing later on if we don't get a complete picture now. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Invasive testing? Good grief. Alright, alright. But make it quick. And be gentle, as you said. I haven’t had anyone… poking around down there in decades. And frankly, I’d prefer not to start now. But if it’s absolutely necessary… get on with it. Just… warn me before you do anything. A man deserves a little warning, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. I will explain everything step-by-step and warn you before each part of the exam. Please just let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. Okay, so I’m going to have you lie on your side with your knees bent. Then, I’ll gently insert a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum to check for any abnormalities. It may feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll start slowly and let you know what I’m doing. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. And try not to… linger. A quick in and out, if you please. I have things to do, you know. A man’s time is valuable. And no unnecessary conversation, if you don’t mind. Just… focus on the task at hand.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. That didn’t take long, did it?
PATIENT: No. It didn't. And frankly, it wasn't pleasant. Well? What did you find? Don't tell me I have something dreadful. I haven’t time for dreadful.
DOCTOR: Well, the good news is I didn't feel any obvious masses or significant abnormalities. There were some internal hemorrhoids, which are quite common, especially with straining, and likely the source of the bleeding. They didn’t appear to be actively bleeding at this moment, but they are likely irritated. Your sphincter tone is normal. However, given your age and the fact that you've noticed blood in your stool twice now, I do want to do some further testing to rule out anything more serious. Would you be willing to do a fecal immunochemical test, or FIT test?
PATIENT: A… a FIT test? Another test? What does it involve? More poking and prodding, I presume? Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a specimen under a microscope. And what exactly are you trying to rule out? Is it something dreadful? You need to be clear with me, young man. I’m not getting any younger, and I don’t have time for vague diagnoses.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize for the number of tests. The FIT test is a very simple, non-invasive test. You simply collect a small stool sample at home – it comes with a kit and instructions. It checks for hidden blood in the stool, which can be a sign of colon cancer or polyps. It doesn't involve any poking or prodding. Colon cancer is always a possibility with any rectal bleeding, which is why I want to rule it out as a precaution. It's more common in older adults, but early detection is key, and treatment is often very successful. That’s what I’m trying to rule out. It’s also possible that the bleeding is simply due to the hemorrhoids, but it’s always best to be safe. Would you be willing to do the FIT test?
PATIENT: Hidden blood, you say. And it requires a… sample. Very well. I suppose I can collect a sample. But I want it to be quick. And I expect a clear explanation of the results. No vague jargon, understand? And if it turns out to be nothing, I expect an apology for the inconvenience. A man’s time is valuable, and I haven’t got all day. So, give me the kit, and let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. Here is the kit. It comes with clear instructions – please read them carefully. You’ll collect a small stool sample at home and mail it to the lab. The results usually take about a week to come back. I will personally review them with you and explain them in detail, with no jargon, as you requested. If the results are positive – meaning blood is detected – we’ll discuss the next steps, which may involve a colonoscopy to get a closer look. If the results are negative, we can likely attribute the bleeding to the hemorrhoids and focus on managing those. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fiber intake and staying well-hydrated to help prevent constipation and straining. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, or significant bleeding – please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions about the FIT test or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No. I think I’ve got it. Collect a sample, mail it off, and wait. Fine. Just… don’t bother me unless it’s absolutely necessary. And no vague pronouncements. Clear, concise information, that’s all I ask. I have things to do, you know. A man can’t spend all day worrying about… samples. Right. Well, I suppose I’ll be going then. Thank you… I suppose. Though I’m not sure I appreciate being subjected to all this fuss over a little blood. And if it is something dreadful… just be quick about it. A man doesn’t have time to waste.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And I assure you, we’ll move as quickly as possible if we need to. Have a good day, Mr. Rowbottom. And please take care.
