DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Paes. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and my skin… it’s gotten darker. Not like a tan, but… just darker overall, you know? It’s a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Fatigue and changes in skin pigmentation can be concerning. Could you tell me a bit more about the fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s just… all the time, really. Even after a full night’s sleep, I feel like I haven’t rested. It’s not like I’m struggling to get through the day, but I definitely don’t have much energy left over for anything extra. I used to enjoy gardening, but now… I just sit and watch TV mostly. And it's been going on for maybe… two or three months now, I think? It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue for two to three months. And it’s not interfering with your basic daily activities, but it's diminishing your enjoyment of things you used to like. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about the skin changes. You mentioned it’s darker overall—is this happening all over your body, or just in certain areas?
PATIENT: It's… pretty much everywhere, I think. My face, my arms, my legs… even my stomach. It’s not patchy, just… a general darkening. It’s hard to explain. It's not like a sunburn look, it's more… brownish, I guess? And it doesn't feel different, if that makes sense. No itching, no pain, just… darker skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, a general darkening of the skin all over, brownish in color, and no associated symptoms like itching or pain. That’s good information. Has anything changed recently in your life that you can think of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Work's the same. I haven't started any new medications. I haven't been traveling. Oh! Wait… I did start using a new laundry detergent a couple months ago, maybe around the same time I started feeling tired. It was on sale, and it smelled nice. But I don’t see how that would affect my skin… or make me tired.
DOCTOR: That’s good you’re thinking of potential changes, even seemingly small ones. It's always worth considering. We'll definitely keep that in mind. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, measles… but nothing major. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but other than that, I’m pretty healthy. I get regular checkups with my primary care doctor, but this skin thing… it’s new.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, otherwise generally healthy with regular checkups. And you said this skin change is relatively new. Do you have any family history of skin conditions, or any conditions that cause unusual fatigue?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mom… she had some problems with her skin later in life, but I don’t really remember what it was. Just… rashes, I think? And my grandma on my father’s side, she always seemed tired, but everyone just said she was anemic. I don’t know if it was anything serious. We didn’t really talk about health much in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of rashes and fatigue, but not a clear diagnosis. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s talk about your current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if my knees bother me, I take ibuprofen. But that's it. No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed, no known allergies. That’s helpful. To get a better picture of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I’m starting to get a little worried about being so tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your concern. Your lymph nodes feel normal, no swelling. Your heart and lungs sound clear. And I do notice the overall darkening of your skin, as you described. It’s not patchy, and there’s no rash or other visible abnormalities. Your sclera are clear, no sign of jaundice. Your vital signs are within normal limits – blood pressure 128/78, pulse 72, temperature 98.6, and respiratory rate 16. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One possibility is Addison’s disease, which can cause fatigue and skin darkening. Another could be iron deficiency anemia, even though you haven’t noticed any other typical symptoms. There are other, less common possibilities as well. To narrow it down, I'd like to order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Addison’s disease? That sounds… serious. I’ve never heard of that. Blood tests sound good, though. If that’s what you think is best. I just want to know what’s causing this. It's hard to enjoy anything when you're always tired and feeling… off.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking questions. Addison’s disease can be serious if left untreated, but it’s also relatively rare. The blood tests will help us determine if that’s a possibility and rule out other causes. I’ll order a complete blood count to check for anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and an ACTH stimulation test to evaluate your adrenal function. The lab will need a sample of your blood. The nurse will be in shortly to draw it for you. It typically takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I’d like you to continue your usual activities as much as possible, but please avoid strenuous exercise. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that all makes sense. A few days… okay. I’ll try to take it easy. Thank you, Dr. Glowka. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure things out. I was starting to worry I was just… getting old.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Paes. It’s my pleasure. Don't ever dismiss your concerns like that. It’s always best to get things checked out. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Feel free to ask her any questions you have as well. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms while you wait for the results. We'll be in touch as soon as we have them. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
