DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Doctor Havird, is it? Yes, well. It’s… complicated. Though I doubt it’s truly complicated for a professional like yourself. It’s just… the university. The students, you see. They simply don’t appreciate knowledge anymore. And the paperwork! Mountains of it. It's… stressful. I suppose that’s the word. Can we get this over with quickly? I have a rather important collection to catalogue.
DOCTOR: Stressful, alright. We can certainly talk about that. Though, to be clear, you came to me because of the stress?
PATIENT: Well, yes. Though “came to you” is rather generous. My daughter insisted. She’s… overly concerned, you understand. Always has been. But yes, the stress. It’s affecting my… focus. My ability to properly organize things. A library must be organized. It's a matter of principle! Is this going to involve… lying on a couch? Because I absolutely will not.
DOCTOR: No couch, Mr. Schlatterer. Though it sounds like this has been going on for a bit. Has this… lack of focus, as you put it, been interfering with your daily life besides the cataloguing?
PATIENT: Interfering… well, I find myself… forgetting where I’ve placed my spectacles. And I had to re-read a rather important article three times this morning. Three times! It’s… unnerving. And my ex-wife calls more often. Complaining about… things. It’s all very distracting. Honestly, it’s a wonder I haven’t misplaced the entire Dewey Decimal System. Is this relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay. Forgetting things, needing to repeat readings… the calls from your ex-wife are… noted. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Doctor, I have always been a light sleeper. A mind as active as mine rarely fully rests. It’s a small price to pay for… intellectual superiority. But, if you must know, I wake up more often now. Thinking about… misplaced books, primarily. And the students, of course. Their dreadful essays. It’s a constant barrage, you understand. Are we getting anywhere with this? I have a lecture to prepare, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Waking up more often, thinking about work. Any changes in appetite, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Appetite? Perfectly normal. I still enjoy a good schnitzel, though the university cafeteria has gone downhill considerably. Too much… processed food. It’s an affront to the palate, frankly. No, my appetite is the least of my concerns. This is about my… cognitive function. My ability to maintain order. Are you a librarian, Doctor? No, I suppose not. It’s difficult to explain the gravity of the situation to someone who doesn’t understand the importance of a well-curated collection. Can we move on, please? I'm losing valuable time.
DOCTOR: Right. No changes in appetite. And you’re concerned about your cognitive function. Have you experienced any dizziness, headaches, or vision changes besides needing to re-read things?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Good heavens, no. I maintain excellent posture. Headaches? Occasionally. A slight throbbing, usually brought on by… student idiocy. And vision changes… well, I mentioned the re-reading, didn’t I? It's simply a matter of needing to concentrate harder. The print is smaller these days. Everything is smaller! It's a conspiracy, I tell you. A conspiracy to diminish the importance of the written word. Honestly, Doctor, are we going to get to the point of this? I have a backlog of acquisitions to process. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. I think I have enough information for now. It sounds like you're experiencing some stress and possibly some age-related changes. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything else. It'll be brief.
