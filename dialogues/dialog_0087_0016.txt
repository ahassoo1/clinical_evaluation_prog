DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's...fine. Look, it's this bruising. I'm on that blood thinner, you see, and I've been noticing…more of it lately. Just seems to happen with the slightest bump. It’s frankly ridiculous. I didn't used to bruise like this. And honestly, I expect a bit more from modern medicine than this constant worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson. It's certainly frustrating when a medication meant to help causes new worries. Bruising easily while on a blood thinner is definitely something we need to investigate. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you first started noticing this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s hard to say exactly. It's been…gradual. Probably the last month or so. Maybe a little longer. I don't keep a calendar of my bumps and bruises, Doctor. I have other things to occupy my time, you know. Important things. It’s just…more noticeable now. I bumped my arm on the doorframe last week – a doorframe – and ended up with a plum-sized bruise. A plum! It’s quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over the last month or so, with a particularly noticeable bruise from a minor injury like bumping your arm on a doorframe. That's helpful. And are the bruises appearing with only minor bumps, or have you had any more significant injuries recently that might explain them?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing significant. I haven’t been in a fight, if that's what you're implying. Just the usual clumsy moments. Tripped over the dog last week, knocked my shin. Bruised, of course. Scraped my elbow gardening. Bruised. It's becoming… a nuisance. And frankly, I’m starting to wonder if this medication is doing more harm than good. I read things, you know. On the internet. You hear about these things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson, and it’s good you’re paying attention to changes in your body. The internet can certainly be…a mixed bag of information. Let's try to get a more complete picture. Aside from the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? Like…feeling sick? No, I haven’t felt sick. A little tired, perhaps, but that could be the heat. It’s been quite warm lately. No fever, no dizziness… just…this bruising. And a general feeling of…irritation, if you must know. It’s unsettling, always worrying about a simple bump turning into a colorful map of my body. Is that a symptom, Doctor? Being irritated?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. Feeling irritated is certainly a valid response to a concerning symptom like increased bruising. I was asking about things like bleeding gums when you brush your teeth, nosebleeds that are difficult to stop, blood in your urine or stool, or any unusual headaches. But we can come back to those questions if needed. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, besides what might be causing this need for a blood thinner?
PATIENT: Well, let’s see… I had a…problem with my heart a few years back. That’s why I’m on the thinner, of course. They said it was…atrial fibrillation, something like that. Makes my heart flutter. And I’ve always had…trouble with my digestion. Nothing serious, just…sensitive. I’ve also had the usual aches and pains of getting older, but I don't bother the doctors with those. I’m not a hypochondriac, Doctor. And my wife…well, she always handled the medical details. It's been two years, you know. I’m still getting used to managing everything myself.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed managing things on your own after a loss. So, to clarify, you have a history of atrial fibrillation, which is being treated with a blood thinner, and some sensitivity with your digestion. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A very long time ago. And I had a knee replacement about ten years ago. Nothing else comes to mind. It was…routine. The knee was bothering me for years, finally decided to get it done. And…I think that’s it. I was a fairly healthy man, up until the heart trouble. Still am, I believe, despite all this bruising. It’s just… frustrating. Doctors always want to know everything. It feels like an interrogation, frankly.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like an interrogation, Mr. Farson. I assure you, I’m just trying to get a complete picture of your health so I can provide the best possible care. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Well, let’s see… the blood thinner, of course. That’s… Warfarin, I think. And I take something for my… indigestion. An antacid, I suppose. Something over the counter. I can't recall the name. And I have some… pills for my blood pressure, but I haven't been taking those regularly. My wife always reminded me, you see. And now… I forget. Occasionally, if I can't sleep, I'll take one of those…melatonin tablets. But that’s about it. A fairly simple regimen, really. Or it was. Before all this bruising.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Warfarin for your atrial fibrillation, an antacid for indigestion, blood pressure medication you haven’t been taking consistently, and melatonin as needed for sleep. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had one. I used to be very proud of that, actually. My wife always said I was remarkably resilient. Aside from… this whole bruising situation, of course. I’ve never reacted badly to anything. And I don’t eat anything unusual. Just… normal food. I try to eat healthy, you know. Lots of fruits and vegetables. I don’t drink much alcohol. And I certainly don’t do any… illicit substances. I’m a reasonable man, Doctor. A perfectly reasonable man. Now, can we discuss this bruising? I'm starting to feel quite anxious about it.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Farson. We can discuss the bruising now. Before we do, just to be thorough, could you tell me if you smoke or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she was very strict about that. Considered it… vulgar. I certainly don’t partake in any such habits. I always considered smoking to be… foolish. A waste of money, and terrible for one’s health. It’s another one of those things I never understood. Now, about this bruising… are we going to do something about it, Doctor? Or are we just going to keep asking questions? I have appointments later today.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are going to do something about it, Mr. Farson. I apologize for the lengthy questioning – it’s important to rule out other potential causes. To get a better understanding of the bruising, I would like to do a quick physical examination. I'll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at the areas where you’ve been bruising. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick about it, Doctor. I truly don't have all day. And please, be gentle. I bruise easily, as you know. The very thought of being prodded and poked… it’s rather unsettling. Honestly, I'd prefer to skip the whole examination, but I suppose it’s necessary. Just… don't be rough. And tell me what you're doing as you go, alright? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I will be as gentle as possible, and I will explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not significantly concerning. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Your heart rate is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur, which is consistent with your history of atrial fibrillation. Your lungs sound clear. Finally, I'm going to take a look at the areas where you’ve been bruising. Could you please point them out to me?
PATIENT: Well, there's one on my forearm, right here. I bumped it on the doorframe last week. See? A plum. And there's a smaller one on my shin, from tripping over the dog. And I think… yes, here on my elbow. Gardening, you see. Nothing major. They all appeared within the last few weeks. And they haven't gone away. That’s what’s bothering me, Doctor. They just… linger. It’s rather… unsightly. Honestly, I feel like an old man. Is something seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: The bruises do appear somewhat extensive for minor trauma, Mr. Farson, and the lingering is concerning, as you rightly point out. They are varying shades of purple and blue, which indicates they are at different stages of healing. I don't feel any lumps or unusual swelling associated with them. Given your history of atrial fibrillation and Warfarin use, the increased bruising is likely related to the medication, but we need to rule out other potential causes. I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a coagulation panel to assess your Warfarin levels and how well your blood is clotting, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, I was hoping for a more… straightforward answer. Is this Warfarin doing something bad to me? Am I going to be spending the rest of my life covered in bruises? I really dislike hospitals and doctors, you know. It reminds me too much of my wife… always in and out of those places. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Blood tests. Just… please, tell me everything you’re looking for. And tell me what the results mean. I don't want to be left in the dark. And how long will this take? I have a bridge game tomorrow evening. I certainly can't show up looking like I’ve been in a fight.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Farson, and I apologize for the additional tests. It's natural to feel anxious when something isn't right, and I will explain everything as clearly as possible. The blood tests will help us determine if your Warfarin level is too high, which could be causing the increased bruising. They will also rule out any other underlying conditions that could be contributing to the problem, such as a low platelet count or a problem with your liver function. The tests are relatively quick—it should only take about 10-15 minutes to draw the blood. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. I will call you as soon as they are available to discuss the findings and determine the next steps. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding any activities that could lead to injury, and if you do happen to bump yourself, apply ice to the area immediately to minimize bruising. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long for the results, alright? I loathe uncertainty. And please, if it is the Warfarin, can we adjust the dosage or something? I don't want to spend my remaining years looking like a battered fruit. I suppose… I suppose that's all. Where do I go for these tests? And do I need to fast beforehand? Honestly, the inconvenience of it all… it’s quite tiresome. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I will make sure the lab results are prioritized, and I will call you as soon as they are available. You can go to the lab located in the building next door. They are open until 5:00 PM today. You do not need to fast beforehand. I understand your frustration with the inconvenience, and I assure you I will do everything I can to get to the bottom of this quickly. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. I wish you a good day, Mr. Farson, and I look forward to speaking with you soon. .
