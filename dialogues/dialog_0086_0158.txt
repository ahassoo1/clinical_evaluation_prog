DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… about a letter. Something to do with a pet, I think? Honestly, my ex-husband handled most of that stuff. He was always very… particular. I just need a piece of paper saying something, I guess. For… the building? Is that right? It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: A letter, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a letter. Honestly, I don't remember the specifics. It's for the apartment complex. They want… proof of pet ownership or something? Look, I have a dog, a lovely little thing, but all the paperwork… It was his department. He liked keeping things organized. Is it really necessary to go through all of this? It feels a bit much, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Wrye, unfortunately, many buildings do require documentation for pets. It’s usually related to liability and breed restrictions. So, to clarify – you do currently possess a dog?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely. A small one. A Shih Tzu. Very fluffy. He doesn’t look like trouble, does he? A little yappy sometimes, but mostly sweet. I’ve had him for… oh, goodness, I can’t remember exactly how long. A few years, at least. Since… well, since things ended with him, I suppose. Is knowing when I got him important? It feels like a lot of questions for a simple letter.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Wrye. Establishing a timeline helps. And frankly, knowing the dog’s age is important for potential health concerns as well. We need to ensure the animal is current on vaccinations. Do you have any vaccination records at all?
PATIENT: Vaccinations… hmm. He took care of those too. I think… maybe a card? Somewhere? Honestly, I haven’t needed to deal with vet visits myself. He always scheduled everything. I just paid the bill. Look, is it possible you can just write a letter saying I have a dog and that he seems healthy? I mean, I look after him. I feed him, walk him… Surely that’s enough? This is all rather stressful.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, with all due respect, a simple statement from you isn’t sufficient for official documentation. Buildings have specific requirements for a reason. We need to verify the dog's health status – a physical examination, at the very least. Do you know who your veterinarian is, or was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. His name was… Dr. Abernathy? Yes, that’s right. Abernathy Veterinary Clinic. It’s… over on Elm Street, I think. Though I haven't been there since… well, since everything. I suppose they have records. Would they be able to help? It just feels like such a fuss over a little dog. He's a good boy, really. Not a bother at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me see if I can pull up any records for a Shih Tzu under Dr. Abernathy’s name. Do you happen to know the dog’s birthdate, or approximately when you acquired him?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A birthdate? I honestly have no idea. He didn’t really share those details with me. I just… took the dog. It was a few years ago, maybe 2022? Or 2023? I’m terrible with dates, I really am. Look, can’t you just call the clinic and ask them? They should have everything. I'm sure they do. This is all very… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can contact Dr. Abernathy’s office. However, they may require your authorization to release those records to me. In the meantime, let’s at least do a basic examination. It will take just a few minutes, and will allow me to assess the dog's current health status, regardless of the records. We’ll check his weight, listen to his heart and lungs, and look at his teeth. Can you bring him in to be examined?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I suppose that’s fair. A quick look won't hurt. He's probably due for a check-up anyway. He's a bit of a pampered pooch, you see. But honestly, I really wish this was simpler. It feels like such a bother, dragging him all the way here. Fine. Yes, I can bring him in. When would be a good time?
DOCTOR: How about now, actually?
PATIENT: Oh. Now? Well… I didn’t expect that. Is there a waiting room? He gets a little anxious around other dogs, you see. And he sheds a lot. I don’t want to cause any trouble. Fine, alright. If you’re sure. Let’s just get this over with. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Down that hall, first door on the left. The technician, Maria, will get you settled. And yes, we can accommodate his anxiety – we’ll take him straight into an examination room. Just be aware, Ms. Wrye, the examination itself will require a physical assessment. We need to actually look at him.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s… reassuring, about the waiting room. A physical assessment… yes, of course. I understand. He's a good boy, really. Just a little fluffy. Alright. Let's go then. Thank you, Doctor. Hopefully, this won't take too long.
