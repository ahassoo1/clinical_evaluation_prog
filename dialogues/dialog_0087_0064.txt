DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Chelberg. My name is Dr. Soodeen. Welcome to the clinic. I see you're here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you. Oh, well... my chest. It hurts sometimes. Not all the time, you know? More like... a squeezing. It started, hmm... maybe a week ago? I was making arepas, and it just… started.
DOCTOR: Okay, a squeezing sensation in your chest that started about a week ago, while you were making arepas. I understand. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this squeezing?
PATIENT: Well… it feels like someone is hugging my chest, but a tight hug. Not a good hug, you know? And it goes away after a little bit. Maybe ten minutes? Sometimes longer if I… if I walk around a little. It doesn’t go all the way through to my back, if that makes sense. Just right here…
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight squeezing sensation in the center of your chest, not extending to your back, and it resolves with rest or walking around after about ten minutes or longer. That's helpful. Does anything specifically trigger it, besides making arepas?
PATIENT: Hmm… making arepas, yes. But… sometimes when I’m carrying groceries. Not every time, but when the bag is really heavy. And… oh! When I get excited talking to my grandkids on the phone! It’s silly, I know, but it happens. It's like… a little flutter, then the squeezing. It doesn’t hurt bad, like a sharp pain. More uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be brought on by exertion – carrying heavy bags, even getting emotionally excited – and it’s described as an uncomfortable squeezing, not a sharp pain. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this chest discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Sometimes I get a little… short of breath when it happens. Not like, really short of breath, but I have to take a few deeper breaths. And… my left arm feels… a little heavy sometimes. Not always, but when the chest hurts, maybe half the time. It doesn’t hurt in my arm, just… feels tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath and a feeling of heaviness in your left arm accompanying the chest discomfort, about half the time. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I've had a little indigestion sometimes, you know, after eating too much empanadas. But this is different. It’s… higher up, in my chest, not in my stomach. And it doesn’t feel like heartburn. I’ve never had this squeezing feeling before. It worried my husband a little, that’s why I came to see you. He says it could be serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good that your husband encouraged you to come in. Given the new onset of chest discomfort accompanied by shortness of breath and arm heaviness, we need to rule out some potential causes. Let's go through some of your medical history to get a clearer picture. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me think… the doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on a little pill, but I stopped taking it because it made me feel dizzy. I don’t think I have the… the sugar problem, diabetes? No, never been told that. And my cholesterol… I don’t think so. I try to eat healthy, you know? Lots of fruit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, for which you were briefly on medication but stopped due to dizziness. No diagnosis of diabetes or high cholesterol. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes with certain perfumes, but not a bad allergy. No pills or anything make me sick. And food… I like everything! Maybe a little sensitive to spicy food, but that’s not an allergy. My husband is allergic to cats, but I love cats!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're currently not taking any medications, is that correct?
PATIENT: That is right. No pills. Just… vitamins sometimes. The kind with the letters. You know, A, B, C. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! When I was younger, I had my tonsils taken out. That was a long time ago, when I first came to this country. And… hmm… No, I don’t think I’ve been in the hospital for anything else. Just for the tonsils, and when I had my babies, of course. That was a long time ago too.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy in the past, and hospitalizations for the births of your children. Now, thinking about your family—do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, or children – have any heart problems, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or a history of early heart attacks or strokes?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. She was always a little worried about it. And my brother, he had a little… a little problem with his heart a few years ago. Not a big problem, but he had to see a specialist. My father was healthy as a horse! Never sick a day in his life. And my kids… they're both healthy, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure in your mother and some heart issue in your brother. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well… I try to stay busy. I like to cook, of course. And I go to church every Sunday. I walk a little bit, when the weather is nice. I don’t smoke. Never have. And I drink a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. Just a small glass. I used to dance a lot, but my knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. That's just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a few other basic checks. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. My husband says I worry too much, so I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. Could you please have a seat and I’ll start the exam. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated – 148/92. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Your lungs sound clear. No tenderness to palpation of the chest wall. I’m also going to check your pulse and oxygen saturation. Your pulse is 78 and your oxygen saturation is 98%, which is good. Given your symptoms and these initial findings, I think it’s important to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I’d like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check your heart’s electrical activity, and some blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and other important markers. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. Okay… if you think it’s best, Doctor. I don't like tests, but… I want to know what’s wrong. So, yes. EKG and blood work. What do I have to do? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The EKG is very simple. We'll just place a few stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart's electrical activity. It doesn't hurt at all; you won't feel anything. It takes just a few minutes. The blood work involves taking a small sample of blood from your arm. You might feel a little pinch, but it’s very quick. The nurse will draw the blood for me. Do you have any concerns about either of these procedures?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Stickers and a little pinch... I can handle that. I’m a little afraid of needles, but… if the nurse is gentle, I think I’ll be alright. When can we do them? And… will I get the results right away?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. The nurse is very experienced and gentle. We can get the EKG done right now, and the nurse will draw your blood afterwards. The initial EKG results will be available within a few minutes. The blood work results will take a couple of days to come back from the lab. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results in detail then. In the meantime, I want you to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any severe chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Emergency room if it gets bad. I understand. So, stickers first, then the little pinch. And a follow-up appointment later. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better just knowing we’re doing something.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could ease some of your worries. I’ll have the nurse come in to start the EKG. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns at any point. I'll be right outside if you need me.
