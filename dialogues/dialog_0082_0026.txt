DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUZZOLINO. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Dr… Iuzzolino, was it? Yes. Well, it’s this tiredness. Just… awful tiredness. Comes and goes, but when it’s here… I can barely lift a teacup, honestly. My husband keeps saying I need to rest more, but I do rest! It just doesn't… help. And the young man at the lab said something about my… numbers being off. Something about my muscles? I don’t rightly recall.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ardelle, Iuzzolino. And thank you for telling me. Tiredness is certainly… troublesome. And the numbers from the lab… hmm. It sounds like we're talking about some blood work, perhaps checking for things like anemia or maybe something affecting your muscles, as you said. Could you tell me a bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work, yes. Always poking and prodding. It comes on suddenly, usually. Not like I’ve been working myself to the bone, mind you. I used to be a commercial diver, you know. Used to be. That was… a long time ago. Now, it's just… poof. Gone all my energy. And it's not just feeling sleepy, it's like… everything is heavy. My arms, my legs… even talking feels like a chore sometimes. It lasts… a few days usually. Sometimes longer. It’s hard to say exactly. My memory isn’t what it used to be, as I said. My husband usually has to remind me of these things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite debilitating, this sudden heaviness and fatigue. And it’s perfectly alright that the timing is unclear – memories can be fickle. So, just to clarify, would you say this tiredness interferes with your daily activities – things like housework, hobbies, or even just getting around?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely interferes. Housework? Forget about it. My husband, bless his heart, does most of that now. Hobbies… I used to enjoy gardening, but I can barely bend over these days when it’s bad. And getting around… well, I don't go far. Just to the market and back, usually. And even that is a struggle sometimes. I used to be so strong, you know. Lifting heavy gear underwater... it’s a far cry from this. It’s… humiliating, really.
DOCTOR: I can certainly understand how frustrating and disheartening that must be, Ardelle. A big change from your diving days, to be sure. Now, have you noticed anything else that happens when you're feeling this tired?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes my muscles ache. Not a sharp pain, just a dull ache, all over. And… oh, this is silly, but sometimes my urine is… darker than usual. Like tea, almost. I noticed it a few times, but I figured I wasn't drinking enough water. My husband keeps telling me to drink more water, too. Honestly, everyone tells me to drink more water.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ardelle. Those are important things to mention. Dark urine, especially with muscle aches, can point us in a certain direction. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but I recovered from that. My husband handles most of the doctor visits now, so I don’t always remember everything. I'm on… something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. And… oh, and I have arthritis in my hands, it’s why they're always a bit stiff. But nothing major, really. Nothing that would explain all this tiredness, I wouldn’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle. So, gallbladder removal, pneumonia, hypertension managed with medication, and arthritis. I see here in your records you’ve been on lisinopril 10mg daily for your blood pressure. And are you currently experiencing any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Lisinopril, yes, that’s it. And allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get terribly itchy when I was a child, but that was just hay fever, I think. Nothing serious. I haven’t had a reaction to any medications in a long time, thank goodness. I used to be so afraid of getting sick when I was underwater. One little thing could get you into a lot of trouble. But now… well, I mostly just try to stay out of trouble.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A quick exam, you say? Yes, go ahead. I don't like being poked and prodded, but if it helps… I suppose it's necessary. Just be gentle, please. My husband always says I have delicate skin.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ardelle. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright, Ardelle, deep breath in… and out… Good. Your lungs sound clear, but your heart rate is a little faster than usual. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, a little. Just there, on the right side. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache, like a heavy feeling. It’s been there for a few days, I think. My husband noticed it too, he said I was wincing when he hugged me. He’s a very observant man, my husband.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle. And how about your extremities?
PATIENT: Oh, my hands are always a bit stiff, as I said, with the arthritis. But my legs… they feel alright. A little weak sometimes, but that’s just from not getting around much. Nothing special, really. Though… now that you mention it, my calf muscles do feel a little tight. Especially on my right leg. It's probably just from sitting too long. I do a lot of knitting, you know. Very relaxing, but not much exercise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle. Thank you. Now, I'm going to take a look at those lab results from your recent blood work. One moment please. Okay, Ardelle. The results from your blood work show some things that need our attention. Your creatine kinase levels are a bit high, which can indicate muscle damage. And your liver enzymes are also slightly elevated. Coupled with your symptoms of fatigue, muscle aches, dark urine, and the tenderness in your abdomen, I'm concerned about a few possibilities.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Muscle damage? What does that mean? Is something terribly wrong? My husband always said I shouldn’t have gone back to that diving job after retirement. He said it was too risky, even just helping out now and then. Is it my muscles? Or is it my liver? I haven't done anything to hurt my liver, have I? I barely drink any alcohol at all. This is all very worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ardelle. It's good you're asking questions. It’s not necessarily something terribly wrong, but it does require further investigation to determine the exact cause. The elevated CK levels could indicate muscle damage, as you said, and the elevated liver enzymes suggest some inflammation in the liver. However, there are several possible reasons for both of these findings, and it’s too early to jump to conclusions. Several things could cause this. It could be a medication side effect – sometimes even seemingly harmless medications can affect the liver and muscles. It could also be related to your arthritis, as inflammation can sometimes cause muscle issues. And, yes, it's possible something happened with your diving – even helping out could have strained your muscles. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some additional blood tests. We'll check a full liver panel, kidney function, and repeat the CK levels. I also want to order a urinalysis to check for myoglobin, which is a protein released from damaged muscles. While we wait for those results, I’d like to be cautious. I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity, especially anything that could strain your muscles. And, just to be safe, I’d like you to limit your alcohol intake to zero for now. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, zero alcohol? Well, I suppose I can manage that. I don’t drink much anyway, mostly just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And no strenuous activity… that’s fine too. I haven’t been doing much of that lately. Just knitting, as I said. Additional blood tests, though… more poking and prodding. It never ends, does it? But if it helps… then I suppose I have no choice. How long will it take to get the results? And will it be terribly expensive? My Medicare doesn’t cover everything, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ardelle. We’ll try to make this as quick and painless as possible. The blood tests shouldn’t take more than a few days – usually 24-48 hours. The lab will submit the results directly to my office, and my staff will contact you as soon as they're available. Regarding the cost, I will have my billing department check what your Medicare will cover. They are very experienced with Medicare claims, and they can give you an estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. They can also discuss payment options if needed. We don't want the cost to be a barrier to getting the care you need. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe muscle pain, dark-colored urine, shortness of breath, or yellowing of your skin – please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Yellowing of my skin? Oh dear, that sounds dreadful. No, I haven’t noticed anything like that. Just the tiredness, the aches, and the dark urine. And the heavy feeling in my right side. I suppose… no, I don’t have any other questions right now. I just hope it’s nothing too serious. And I hope my husband doesn’t say “I told you so.” He’s a good man, but he can be… very insistent. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need to go home and lie down. All this talking has quite worn me out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ardelle. I understand. It’s perfectly alright to be tired after discussing all of this. And please, don’t worry about your husband – we'll get to the bottom of this together. My staff will escort you to the checkout, and they’ll schedule your follow-up appointment. We’ll discuss the results of your blood tests then. Rest well, Ardelle. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your appointment. .
