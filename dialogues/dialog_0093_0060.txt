DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, good morning, Doctor. Look, I don’t usually do this, honestly. I’m an engineer, I solve problems. But my mother… well, she's been going on and on about family history. A lot of heart trouble on her side. And my aunt, she… wasn’t very lucky, either. I’m perfectly healthy, I feel fine, but she’s convinced I’m a ticking time bomb. I just want to know I'm not going to drop dead unexpectedly, you know? It’s… reassuring, I guess, is what I’m after.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Theriot. It's quite sensible to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart trouble. It's good you're taking your mother's concerns seriously, and it's excellent that you feel well at the moment. Reassurance is a perfectly valid reason to seek a medical evaluation. To give you the most accurate assessment, let’s gather some information. We'll go through your history, do a physical exam, and perhaps some basic tests. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Tests? Look, I'm not thrilled about that. I mean, if it's just a chat and you tell me everything's probably fine, that would be ideal. I really don’t see the point of poking and prodding and… whatever else you doctors do. I eat reasonably well, I get some exercise... I’m not a couch potato, if that’s what you’re thinking. Is a chat really not possible?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your hesitation, Mr. Theriot. A “chat” can certainly be a starting point, and I want to respect your preferences. However, given your family history, a thorough evaluation is really the most responsible approach. It’s not about suspecting anything is wrong, but about establishing a baseline and identifying any potential risk factors before they become problems. The tests we would consider are quite standard – a blood pressure check, listening to your heart and lungs, perhaps an EKG to assess your heart’s electrical activity, and a basic blood panel to check cholesterol and other key markers. These tests provide objective information that complements what we discuss. I wouldn’t recommend anything unnecessary, and we can tailor the evaluation to your specific concerns. Would you be more comfortable if we started with a detailed discussion of your family history and a physical exam, and then discuss the need for further testing based on those findings?
PATIENT: Fine. A discussion, and then we talk about tests. But no promises. I still think it’s unnecessary. My mother worries too much. Okay, let's get this over with. Family history... where do I even begin? It's mostly her side, like I said. A lot of heart attacks, strokes… my grandfather died very young, apparently. And my aunt… she had something with her valves, I think. It was… messy.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Theriot. We’ll take it at your pace. Starting with your mother’s side is a good place to begin. And it's helpful to know it was mostly on that side of the family. Could you tell me a little more about your grandfather?
PATIENT: Um… well, my mother says he was a big man. Worked hard, manual labor. She doesn't remember much, she was very young when he died. Around sixty, I think? She always says it was "his heart". Sudden. He just… collapsed. No warning, apparently. And my aunt… she was diagnosed in her fifties. Something about her heart not pumping properly. She had a lot of… procedures. Lots of hospital visits. It wasn't pleasant. I try not to think about it, honestly. It just… complicates things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like both instances were quite sudden and concerning. Knowing the approximate ages at which these events occurred is helpful. So, your grandfather around sixty and your aunt in her fifties. Was your aunt’s condition specifically diagnosed, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Ugh. My mother uses a lot of medical terms I don’t understand. Something about… mitral valve prolapse? And… cardiomyopathy? I think. She says it weakens the heart muscle. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. She was always very dramatic about it. "Everything's genetic, Blain! You're doomed!" She's a bit… much. I mostly just remember a lot of hospital visits and her constantly worrying about everyone. And telling me to eat less salt.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Theriot. Medical terminology can be quite confusing. Mitral valve prolapse and cardiomyopathy are both heart conditions, and it’s helpful to know they were part of your aunt’s diagnosis. It sounds like she had a complex condition. Now, shifting focus to you, have you ever experienced any symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Never. I feel perfectly fine. That’s why I'm here, remember? My mother is just being… my mother. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness… nothing. I run three miles a week, I don’t smoke, I drink occasionally... I’m a fairly healthy person. Honestly, Doctor, I think she's wasting your time. And mine.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Theriot. It’s very reassuring that you haven’t experienced any symptoms, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle is a significant benefit. We're simply being thorough given your family history, and I appreciate your patience. To complete the picture, let’s briefly discuss your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I haven’t even had the flu in years. I think I had chickenpox as a kid, but that’s about it. No allergies, no chronic illnesses, no surgeries... I'm remarkably boring, medically speaking. Seriously. You can probably just write "healthy" on the chart and be done with it. It's a waste of resources, honestly. There are people who need this time.
DOCTOR: “Remarkably boring” is an excellent sign, Mr. Theriot. I assure you, preventing potential problems is a valuable use of resources. And knowing you have no prior medical conditions, allergies, or surgeries is very helpful. Just to confirm, you mentioned no surgeries – have you ever been hospitalized for any reason, even briefly?
PATIENT: No. Never. Not even for tonsils or anything silly like that. I've always been… lucky, I guess. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but that was just a cast. No overnight stays, no procedures. I’m telling you, Doctor, this is unnecessary. I'm a healthy, functioning adult. You're going to tell me my blood pressure is fine, my heart sounds normal, and I'll go home and my mother will still worry. It’s a vicious cycle.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Theriot, and I appreciate you being so forthcoming. Your history of good health is certainly encouraging. Alright, let’s move on to social history. Do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I find it disgusting. My mother would have a fit if I even thought about it. She’s very… health-conscious, to say the least. And I don’t drink excessively. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Nothing that would remotely impact my health. It's more for the taste, really. I’m a fairly… moderate person, all around.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Theriot. And moderate habits are certainly beneficial. Now, just to complete the picture, what is your occupation?
PATIENT: I’m an engineering teacher. Postsecondary. I teach at the community college. It’s… fine. Mostly dealing with students who haven’t quite figured out what they want to do with their lives. It’s… draining, occasionally. But it pays the bills. I mostly do a lot of problem solving, honestly. Which is ironic, given I’m here trying to avoid solving a problem.
DOCTOR: That’s quite fitting, actually. Problem-solving is a valuable skill, in any field. Now, one final question for the social history. Do you have any significant stressors in your life at the moment?
PATIENT: Stressors? Are you kidding? My mother is a constant stressor. She calls me multiple times a week to check on my health, remind me to eat vegetables, and generally worry about every aspect of my existence. And being divorced doesn't exactly help. The paperwork was a nightmare, and... well, it's complicated. Other than that? Just the usual work stress. Students, deadlines, bureaucracy… the normal stuff. But my mother is the biggest source of stress, by far. She's… a lot to handle.
DOCTOR: That sounds challenging, Mr. Theriot. Managing a demanding job and navigating a recent divorce while also addressing your mother’s concerns is quite a lot to handle. It’s understandable if you feel stressed. Alright, before we proceed with the physical exam, let's quickly review your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I pride myself on not needing anything. I eat well, I exercise, I get enough sleep… I’m remarkably self-sufficient, medically speaking. I don’t even take a multivitamin. I get all the nutrients I need from my diet. Seriously. You’re wasting your time with me. It’s like you’re trying to find something wrong that isn’t there.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Theriot. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and avoiding medications is commendable. It’s helpful to know you aren’t taking anything currently. Alright. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, such as foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No. None. I can eat anything, I haven’t got a sniffle from pollen in years. I'm remarkably… robust. Honestly Doctor, are you sure you've got the right chart? Maybe you're expecting someone who’s actually sick? It’s a little insulting, if I'm being honest. I’m perfectly healthy. This is… a waste of my time. And yours.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Theriot, I have the correct chart. And I apologize if the thoroughness feels excessive. Given your family history, and understanding your mother's concerns, it's my professional responsibility to be comprehensive. This isn’t about expecting you to be sick, but about proactively assessing your health and providing you with peace of mind. Now, if you’re willing, let’s proceed with a brief physical exam. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick visual assessment. It should only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. But don’t be surprised if everything’s perfectly normal. I told you. I’m perfectly healthy. You’re going to waste your time, and I'm going to go back home and my mother will still worry. It’s a vicious cycle. Just… get on with it. But gently, please. I don't like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Theriot. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Hurry up. This is… unnerving. Honestly, I’d rather be solving engineering problems right now. At least that makes sense. This is just… anxiety-inducing. Get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 122 over 78. That’s within the normal range, Mr. Theriot. Now, if you’ll just take a deep breath for me, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular and there are no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Your lungs are clear, with good air entry bilaterally. Everything sounds good so far. Now, could you just open your mouth for me, so I can take a quick look?
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. This is… invasive. Honestly, I haven’t had a doctor listen to my heart since elementary school. It’s… unsettling. Make it quick, please. I've got things to do. More important things than this.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks clear and healthy, Mr. Theriot. Everything appears normal. Based on this brief physical exam, there are no immediate concerns. To be thorough, given your family history, I would recommend a basic EKG to assess your heart’s electrical activity, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: You’ve got to be kidding me. More tests? Seriously? I told you, I'm perfectly healthy! This is ridiculous. My mother is going to be insufferable if I tell her you want more tests. This is a nightmare. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your… thoroughness. But I’m going to politely decline. I'm not going to subject myself to more poking and prodding. I’m going home. Thanks for your time. But honestly, I think I’m perfectly fine. And frankly, I think I’d be better off ignoring my mother’s anxieties. It’s less stressful.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I understand your frustration, and I respect your decision. However, given your strong family history of heart trouble, I strongly advise against declining these simple, non-invasive tests. They would provide valuable baseline data and help us to rule out any potential concerns. While I respect your autonomy, I feel it’s my professional responsibility to strongly recommend these tests. I’m concerned about potentially missing an early warning sign. If you’re hesitant about undergoing these tests at this clinic, I can provide you with a referral to another cardiologist for a second opinion. Perhaps a different perspective might be helpful. Ultimately, the decision is yours. But please consider the potential benefits of these tests, especially given your family history. Would you at least be willing to think about it?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor. You’re a nice guy, I get it. You're doing your job. But my mother is going to scrutinize every single result, second-guess everything, and drive me insane. And frankly, I don’t need that stress in my life. A second opinion is just going to lead to more tests, more anxiety, and more of my mother’s insufferable worrying. No. Just… no. I'm going home. I'm a healthy, functioning adult, and I'm going to enjoy my life. I appreciate your concern, but I'm done. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Theriot. I respect your decision, though I remain concerned. Please know that my door is always open should you change your mind in the future. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations, please seek immediate medical attention. I wish you all the best, Mr. Theriot, and hope you enjoy your life. .
