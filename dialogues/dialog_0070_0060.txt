DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Good morning, Doctor. Thanks for having me. It's… well, it's family history, mostly. My mother’s side… a lot of heart problems. And her brother, he didn’t even make it to sixty. I'm probably being silly, but I just want to make sure I’m okay. Get some reassurance, you know? I try to eat healthy and I walk when I can, but… it’s always in the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Theriot. It’s very sensible to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart problems. It’s not silly at all to want reassurance and to get things checked out. We’ll do a thorough evaluation. To start, could you tell me a little more about these heart problems on your mother’s side?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I’m glad you don’t think I’m overreacting. My mom… she had angina, I think that’s what they called it. Chest pain, mostly. She was on medication for it for years. And then, like I said, her brother… he had a heart attack. Sudden. Didn't even make it to the hospital. That's what really freaks me out, I guess. Just… dropping dead. I mean, I’m young, right? But it feels like it could happen to anyone.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are young, Mr. Theriot, and it’s good you’re thinking about this now. A family history like that certainly warrants a closer look. Knowing the specifics can help us determine your risk. Regarding your mother’s angina – do you recall if she had any specific tests done to diagnose it?
PATIENT: Tests? Honestly, I was… I don’t know, maybe ten or twelve when she started having problems. I wasn’t really paying attention to the details of her doctor's visits. I just remember she went a lot. I think… maybe an EKG? Something with stickers on her chest. And she definitely had a stress test at some point, running on a treadmill. I'm really not sure. She didn’t talk about it much, and I didn't ask. It wasn't really something we discussed as a family, you know? I feel bad now that I didn’t… but that’s how it was.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very common for families not to discuss medical details openly. Don’t feel bad about that. We’ll focus on what we can do now. So, to recap, your mother had angina and underwent an EKG and a stress test. And your uncle experienced a sudden heart attack. Now, let’s talk about you. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or fatigue?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Nothing like that. That’s why I feel a bit foolish, maybe. I feel fine. I get tired sometimes, but who doesn’t, right? I work long hours grading papers. It’s just… this nagging worry. I don’t want to end up like them. I guess I'm looking for preventative measures, if that makes sense. What can I do to lower my risk? Besides eating healthy and walking, obviously. Are there any tests you recommend, just to be on the safe side?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Theriot, and you're not foolish at all. Proactive preventative measures are always a good idea, especially with your family history. Given your concerns and family background, I recommend we do a few things. First, I’d like to perform a physical exam, including listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your blood pressure. We'll also order a complete blood panel, including a lipid profile to check your cholesterol levels. Additionally, an electrocardiogram will give us a snapshot of your heart’s electrical activity. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Fine, let’s do it. Whatever you think is best. Honestly, I just want to know if I need to worry or not. Cholesterol, ECG… whatever tests you deem necessary. The sooner we get this sorted out, the better. I have a lot of papers to grade, you know. I'd rather get this done now and not have to worry about it for the next few months.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I completely understand. We’ll get everything taken care of as efficiently as possible. Alright, let’s start with the physical exam. Could you please have a seat on the examination table and loosen your shirt?
PATIENT: Fine. Here we go. Just try not to poke me too much, alright? I’m not a big fan of doctors, to be honest. It's not the pain, it’s just… the whole thing. All the poking and prodding. But I’m here, so… do your worst, I guess. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Theriot. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. This won’t take long, and I’ll explain everything as I go along. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular. No murmurs or extra sounds noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 120/80, which is within the normal range. Finally, I'll quickly palpate your pulses. Pulses are strong and regular. Everything appears normal so far, which is encouraging. Now, we’ll proceed with the ECG and blood work. A nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and attach the ECG leads. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing at all. I can eat anything, take any medication… I’m pretty boring that way, actually. Just… anxious, I guess. You said everything appears normal? That’s not the same as is normal, is it? I mean, you haven't even done the tests yet. This whole thing is probably just a waste of time, but my wife… she insisted. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: You are right to clarify, Mr. Theriot. “Appears normal” is a preliminary observation based on the initial physical exam. It doesn't substitute for the results of the tests. The ECG and blood work will give us a more comprehensive picture of your cardiovascular health. It’s good that your wife is proactive about your health. It’s always helpful to have someone looking out for you. And it's certainly not a waste of time to be thorough, especially with your family history. The nurse should be here momentarily to start the tests. While we wait, do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t believe in all that stuff. Just a waste of money, honestly. I eat reasonably well, I try to get some exercise, and I hope for the best. I’ve always been healthy. It’s just… the worry. It’s getting to me. My wife keeps talking about my uncle and my mother… it’s not helpful, you know? I keep telling her I feel fine, but she just doesn’t listen. I think she's projecting her own anxieties onto me.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, Mr. Theriot – not just health concerns, but also anxieties around those concerns and differing perspectives with your wife. That can be very stressful. It’s good that you’re taking steps to address the health aspect, and we’ll get those tests done to give you some concrete information. We can also discuss strategies for managing the anxiety, if you'd like. Perhaps having objective results to share with your wife will be helpful. Alright, I see the nurse is here now. She'll explain the process for the blood work and ECG. We'll take it one step at a time.
PATIENT: Fine. Let’s just get it over with. The sooner this is done, the better. Hopefully, it’s all just a waste of time, and I can go back to grading papers in peace. Tell her to be quick, alright? I have a stack of essays waiting for me.
DOCTOR: I’ll let her know you’re in a hurry, Mr. Theriot. We’ll be as efficient as possible. While she’s setting things up, let me quickly ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And drugs? Don’t even think about it. I’m an engineering teacher, Doctor. I have a reputation to maintain. I need a clear head for grading papers and explaining complex concepts to… less-than-motivated students. Honestly, I barely have time to sleep, let alone indulge in any vices.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Theriot. A healthy lifestyle is very important. Alright, it seems the nurse is ready to begin the blood work. She’ll be right with you. I’ll step out for a moment to give you some privacy. Please let me know if you have any questions or feel uncomfortable at any time. We’ll review the results as soon as they’re available. Just focus on relaxing, and we'll take it from there.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… try not to take too long, alright? The sooner I get out of here, the better.
