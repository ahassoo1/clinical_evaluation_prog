DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. I'm Dr. Voytek. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... what did bring me in? Right, right. It's about a letter. For a pet, you see. Some people are being difficult, saying I can't just… have one. Seems silly, really. I need a letter saying I'm responsible enough, I suppose. That's what they told me, anyway. It's a dog, a lovely thing. Though, honestly, I can’t remember exactly what breed it is now. They all look the same to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a letter confirming you're a responsible pet owner. I can certainly document that for you. Just to be clear, this isn’t a medical issue for the dog itself, correct?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, the dog is fine. Perfectly healthy, as far as I know. It's just… people asking questions. Bureaucracy, you see? It’s not about the dog being sick, it’s about them wanting paperwork. Honestly, it’s ridiculous. I’ve had pets my whole life, I know what I’m doing. But they want a letter. It's just… frustrating, that's all. Do you need to see the dog? It’s probably at home.
DOCTOR: No, we don’t necessarily need to see the dog for this. I understand your frustration. To help me write a comprehensive letter, can you tell me a little more about your experience with pet ownership?
PATIENT: Oh, experience... well, I’ve always had animals. Growing up, we had… chickens, I think. And a goat? Maybe a sheep. It was a farm, you see. And then when I got older, I had a cat. A fluffy one. Lived a good long life, that cat. And… others. It’s all a bit blurry, to be honest. I've just always been good with them. They like me, you see? I'm a… a natural. Is that enough? I really can't recall specifics. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. So, you’ve had a lifelong history of pet ownership. Just to get a clearer picture for the documentation, have you ever had any pets require veterinary care?
PATIENT: Veterinary care... hmm. Now you're asking something. I… think so? Yes, I'm sure of it. The cat, maybe? It got… something. A cough, perhaps? Or maybe it was the dog before that. They all get things, don't they? It was a long time ago, I don't recall the details. I took them to the vet, of course. Paid the bills and everything. I just… don't remember what was wrong with them. Is that a problem? It's just… my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not a problem, Deloris. It's perfectly normal to not remember specific details from the past. It’s good that you sought veterinary care when needed. To complete the documentation, can you confirm you are currently able to financially provide for a pet’s needs, including food, shelter, and veterinary care?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely! Yes, of course. Money is… manageable. I have insurance, you see. Private insurance. And I… I’m comfortable. I can certainly afford food. And a nice, warm place for it to sleep. And if it gets sick, yes, I can pay for a vet. I wouldn’t get a pet if I couldn’t look after it properly. It’s just… people are making it sound like I’m irresponsible. Which is quite frankly, insulting. I'm a sensible woman, Doctor. I can assure you of that.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Deloris. Based on what you’ve told me, I can certainly write a letter stating you are a responsible pet owner capable of providing adequate care for an animal. It will state your history of pet ownership and your ability to financially support a pet’s needs. Is there anything else you'd like me to include in the letter?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful, Doctor! Thank you. Hmm… you know what? Maybe just say I’m a… compassionate person? And that I love animals very much. That seems important. And perhaps… a line about how I’m a good neighbour. People need to know I'm not going to let the dog run wild and cause trouble. Yes, those two things. Compassionate and a good neighbour. That would be perfect. Honestly, it's just about showing those… those people that I’m a reasonable human being.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll add that you are a compassionate person and a good neighbor. Just a moment while I finalize the letter. Here you are. It summarizes your history of pet ownership, your financial stability, and your compassionate nature. I’ve also included a statement about being a good neighbor. Please review it to ensure everything is accurate.
PATIENT: Oh, lovely! Yes, yes, that sounds… perfectly adequate. “Compassionate nature,” I like that. And “responsible pet owner,” of course. Yes, this will do nicely. Thank you very much, Doctor. You’ve been a great help. Those people will be very pleased. Hopefully. It’s just a silly thing, really. But I appreciate you writing this for me. Now, how much do I owe you?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Deloris. The cost for this letter is \$75. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Here you are. Thank you again, Doctor Voytek. You’ve really put my mind at ease. Now I can finally get this sorted. It’s just… bureaucratic nonsense, really. But you’ve been a lifesaver. I suppose I'll be on my way then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Deloris. I’m glad I could help. Yes, you’re all set. Have a good day, and enjoy your pet! If you ever need anything in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor! I will. You have a good day too! Goodbye now! And thank you again! .
