DOCTOR: Good morning, Alese. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Meng Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Oh dear... what brings me in... Let me see. It’s this pain, really. A rather severe pain in my lower abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it's here… well, it’s quite disruptive. I believe I’ve been told before it has something to do with… SLE? Is that right? It's just... everything feels a bit hazy these days, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. It’s perfectly normal to feel a bit overwhelmed, especially with ongoing health concerns. SLE stands for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and it’s a condition we can certainly explore. So, this pain in your lower abdomen… when did it start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… That is the question, isn’t it? Let me think… It feels like it’s been… a while. Not recently, certainly. Perhaps… several months ago? It's hard to pinpoint, truthfully. It began gradually, I believe. Not a sudden, sharp thing. More… a growing discomfort that flared up from time to time. I apologize for my vagueness. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary at all, Alese. It's very common for symptoms to develop gradually, and memory can certainly be affected by various things. Several months ago, starting gradually... okay. And can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, well… it’s not a constant ache, you see. It comes in waves, really. Like… cramping, perhaps? But deeper, more… intense. And sometimes it radiates, I think. Down my legs a bit. It's difficult to describe, truthfully. It's not like a simple injury. It’s more of a… a pressure, building up until it becomes quite uncomfortable. It makes me feel quite… unwell, generally. And sometimes, I feel a bit nauseous with it, but not always. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Cramping, deeper and more intense, radiating down the legs, a building pressure, and sometimes nausea… okay. And is anything specific that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me see… I haven't noticed a clear pattern, you know? It doesn't seem to be related to food, or activity, or… well, anything specific that I can pinpoint. Sometimes it happens when I'm resting, and sometimes when I’m moving around. It feels rather random, truthfully. Perhaps… stress? I do worry quite a bit, and I wonder if that contributes. But I can’t say for certain. It’s just… there, sometimes. A rather unwelcome visitor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no clear triggers identified, and you suspect stress might play a role. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Now, you mentioned SLE. Have you been officially diagnosed with lupus, and if so, do you know which organs are involved?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… I believe I have been diagnosed. It was quite some time ago, and frankly, the details are a bit… blurry. I recall many appointments, many tests… and a diagnosis. But which organs… oh dear. That’s where I really struggle. I believe… the joints? And something about the skin? I was told it was affecting multiple systems, but the specifics… I’m afraid I couldn’t tell you. I apologize again for my lack of clarity. I really should have written these things down. Is there a record of it somewhere? Perhaps you can tell me what's involved?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Alese. That’s what we’re here for. Let’s see… yes, it looks like you were diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus approximately seven years ago. The records indicate involvement of the joints, as you suspected, and also some skin manifestations. There's also a history of mild kidney involvement, and some evidence of fatigue. We’ll want to review those results in more detail. Now, going back to this abdominal pain… have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it, such as fever, weight loss, changes in your bowel habits, or any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That is helpful to know, to have a reminder of it all. Thank you. Let me see… fever… I don’t recall having a fever recently. And weight loss… no, I don’t think so. My appetite has been… rather variable, truthfully, but I haven’t noticed any significant weight loss. Changes in bowel habits… perhaps a little constipation from time to time, but nothing dramatic. And blood in my stool… no, thankfully not. I haven’t noticed anything like that. It's mostly just the pain, and the general feeling of unwellness that comes with it. Sometimes I feel quite weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, weight loss, or blood in stool. Some constipation, and feeling of weakness accompanying the pain. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, check for any tenderness, and also take your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, certainly. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, do whatever you need to do. I’ll just… sit here, shall I? I trust your judgement completely, Doctor. I just hope we can figure out what’s causing all this discomfort. It's been… rather disruptive, to say the least. I’ll try to remain still, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright, Alese, this may be a little uncomfortable. Just let me know if you feel any sharp pain. I'm noting some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. I don’t hear any abnormal bowel sounds at this time. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72. Everything seems stable, but the tenderness in your lower abdomen is concerning, given your history of lupus. It could be a flare-up, or something else entirely. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order some blood tests and a urine analysis. This will help us rule out infection, assess your kidney function, and get a better picture of what’s going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Very sensible indeed. Blood tests and a urine analysis… yes, let’s do that. I trust your judgement completely. Tenderness on the left side… I hadn’t specifically noticed that, but I suppose that makes sense. It could be a flare-up. I do feel rather fatigued, as I mentioned. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. When would I be able to get these tests done? And will I need to fast beforehand? I do try to plan my meals, you understand. It's just… things get a bit muddled sometimes.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just down the hall. You will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests, so ideally, no food or drinks other than water overnight. We can schedule the tests for first thing tomorrow morning. That gives you plenty of time to prepare. While we wait for the results, I also want to discuss pain management. Are you currently taking anything for pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds perfectly manageable. First thing tomorrow morning… I shall make a note of that. Eight hours fasting… water only. Yes, I can do that. Pain management… Let me see. Not currently, no. I’ve tried a few things over the years, I believe. Some over-the-counter remedies, perhaps? But nothing has been particularly effective, truthfully. I’ve mostly just… tried to rest, and hope it passes. I’m a little hesitant to take anything too strong, you understand. I worry about side effects. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible, if that makes sense. Is there something gentle you might recommend?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. It’s always best to start with the most conservative approach. Given your concerns, we can certainly explore some gentle options. We can try acetaminophen or ibuprofen , as needed, but I’ll advise you to take them with food and to follow the dosage instructions carefully. If those aren’t providing enough relief, we can discuss other possibilities. I also want to emphasize the importance of staying hydrated and getting adequate rest. In the meantime, if the pain worsens significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting, please contact the clinic immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… reasonable. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen… I think I have some of each at home. I shall be sure to take them with food, and follow the instructions carefully. Hydration and rest… yes, I’ll do my best. No, I don’t think I have any questions at this moment. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Worsening pain, fever, chills, nausea… yes, I shall keep an eye out for those symptoms. I feel much more reassured now, knowing what to look for. .
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Alese. My pleasure entirely. We'll get those tests done tomorrow, and we can discuss the results and create a plan to get you feeling better. If anything changes before then, please don't hesitate to call. Have a good rest of your day, and I'll see you tomorrow.
