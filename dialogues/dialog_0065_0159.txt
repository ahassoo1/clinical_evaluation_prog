DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Fratoni. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s kinda embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been havin’ trouble gettin’ up from chairs. Like, really stuck sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It’s been goin’ on for maybe a month or so now.
DOCTOR: Stuck as in… difficulty initiating the movement, or pain when you try to stand?
PATIENT: Not really pain, no. More like… my legs just don’t wanna listen. Like they're heavy, and I gotta really think about pushin' myself up. Sometimes I gotta use my arms to help, which I never used to. It’s weird. It's not a sudden thing, it just… crept up on me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And does this happen with all chairs, or specific types?
PATIENT: It seems worse with the lower ones, you know? Like, those restaurant chairs, or the ones at the diner. The ones with the back support don't bother me as much. My chair at home, it's pretty high up, and I don't have much trouble with that one. It’s mostly when I gotta get up from somethin’ low to the ground. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does. And has this been accompanied by any weakness in your legs when walking, or any numbness or tingling?
PATIENT: No numbness or tingling, no. Walkin' is fine. I work out on the rigs, pretty physical job, so I'm movin' around a lot. It's just… that first push off the chair is the hard part. Like a little stall before my legs decide to cooperate. I don’t feel weak walkin', just… stuck sometimes when I'm sittin'.
DOCTOR: You mentioned working on the rigs. Could you describe the physical demands of that job in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Sure. It's a lot of liftin', carryin', climbin'… you know, oil and gas stuff. We're movin' pipes, checkin' equipment, haulin' tools. It’s hot, dusty work, and we're on our feet most of the day. Been doin' it for about five years now. Before that, I did construction, so I'm used to bein' physical. It’s just… lately this chair thing is worryin' me, 'cause I need my legs to be workin' right. Don't wanna fall or somethin'. It's kinda a dangerous job as it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your overall energy levels, or any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No weight loss, definitely not. I eat like a horse to keep up with the work. And my energy's been… normal, I guess. Tired at the end of the day, like anyone would be after a long shift, but nothin' more than usual. I haven't felt sick or anything. It's just this… chair problem. It's kinda frustrating, 'cause I can't put my finger on what's causin' it. I just wish it would go away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’d like to check your strength, reflexes, and range of motion. We'll start with your legs. Could you please sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Just gotta… take a moment here. It's not bad, just… takes a bit. Here we go. All right, I'm sittin'.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, could you please extend your legs straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: Like this? Feels okay. A little stiff maybe, but nothin' awful. Is that what you wanted?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And now, push your heels down into the table, like you're pressing on a gas pedal. I'm going to provide some resistance. And now, pull your toes up towards your shins. Again, I’ll provide some resistance. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally for dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Now, stand up slowly for me when you're ready.
PATIENT: Okay, here we go… There. That was… not as easy as it used to be. Feels kinda wobbly for a second there. Is that what you were lookin' for?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Please walk a few steps for me. Gait appears stable, no obvious signs of weakness or asymmetry. Now, can you squat down and stand back up?
PATIENT: Uh… I can, but it’s… tight. There. It’s not as smooth as it used to be. Feels kinda like… somethin’s blockin’ me. It's not painful, just… restricted. Is that what you wanted? I don’t wanna push it too hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing some early signs of weakness in your lower extremities, possibly related to your physically demanding job. The partial squat and difficulty standing from a seated position are concerning. However, it’s difficult to determine the exact cause without further investigation. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or electrolyte imbalances. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for an electromyography to assess the function of your nerves and muscles. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… reasonable. I mean, I trust your judgment, Doctor. If that’ll help figure out what’s goin' on, then yeah, let’s do it. Blood work and… what was it, an electro-my-o-gra-phy? Sounds… complicated. As long as it helps me get back to normal, I’m willin' to try it. Will those tests… tell us somethin' serious? I’m kinda nervous now.
DOCTOR: The tests will help us to narrow down the possibilities and determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. While it's important to rule out any serious conditions, it’s also possible that this could be related to muscle fatigue or overuse, which is often manageable with physical therapy. I’m going to order the blood work now, and I’ll provide you with a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a neurologist specializing in neuromuscular disorders. The neurology office will contact you to schedule the EMG. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. Listen to your body and take breaks when you need them. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay. No strenuous activity, got it. Dr. Ramirez, good. Um… how long will it take to get the results from the blood work? And… what exactly is an EMG? Is it gonna hurt? I don’t have a good history with needles, if you know what I mean. And… is there anything I can do right now to help? Like, stretches or somethin’? I'm kinda a mess of questions, I guess. Sorry.
DOCTOR: The blood work results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. As for the EMG, it involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to measure their electrical activity. It can be slightly uncomfortable, but it's generally well-tolerated. Dr. Ramirez's office will provide you with detailed instructions before the procedure. They will also discuss any potential risks and benefits. As for what you can do right now, gentle stretching can be helpful, but avoid any aggressive movements that cause pain. Focus on stretches for your hamstrings, quadriceps, and calves. I’m going to provide you with a handout detailing some safe stretches. However, please remember that this is just a temporary measure until we have the results of the tests. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, gentle stretches. Got it. Hamstrings, quads, calves… I can manage that. No, I think that's all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… helpful. I was kinda freakin' out a bit, but I feel a little better knowin' we're lookin' into it. I appreciate your time. I guess I’ll go take it easy and try those stretches. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember to schedule your appointment with Dr. Ramirez as soon as possible. Have a good day, Mr. Fratoni.
