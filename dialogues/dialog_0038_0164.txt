DOCTOR: Good morning, Mande. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit… strange, really. I’ve been feeling quite unwell after eating fava beans. I get very tired, and I’ve been looking a bit yellow, if you know what I mean. It started a few weeks ago, and it only happens after I eat them.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is interesting. Tiredness and yellowing skin... and it's specifically after eating fava beans. That definitely gives us something to work with. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just a little sleepy, you know? It’s… draining. Like all my energy is just gone. I have trouble getting through the day, even with enough sleep. I feel weak, and I get breathless easily, even just walking around the house. It's just… a lot worse after I eat the beans, and then it slowly gets better as I haven’t eaten any more for a while.
DOCTOR: Right, that sounds significantly debilitating, and the correlation with the fava beans is very important. And you said it gradually improves when you avoid them?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. If I don’t eat them, I feel… normal-ish. Not perfect, but I can manage. It’s when I have them – even a small amount, sometimes – that it really knocks me for six. It usually starts within a few hours, and lasts for a couple of days. It's a bit scary, honestly. I don’t understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mande. It is good that you've noticed the connection with the fava beans; that’s a really helpful clue. We need to explore this further. Have you experienced anything else along with the tiredness and yellowing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I get a bit of a tummy ache, but that could be anything, really. And I’ve noticed my urine is… darker than usual, a sort of reddish-brown colour. It doesn’t happen every time, but when I am feeling really unwell, it's definitely darker. Oh, and I feel a bit dizzy sometimes too. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all important details, Mande. Dark urine and dizziness, alongside the fatigue, yellowing, and abdominal discomfort… this is starting to paint a clearer picture. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and things, but nothing serious. I've never been hospitalised, and I don’t take any regular medication. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that’s it. I’ve never been allergic to anything, as far as I’m aware.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Gallbladder removal is relevant, thank you for mentioning that. And no known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some problems with his heart in his later years. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. On my mother’s side, there was an uncle who had some sort of… blood disorder, I think? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to that side of the family, so I don’t know much about it. It wasn’t anything contagious, if that makes sense. They just said he had “weak blood.” I don’t know if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mande, thank you. “Weak blood” could be a number of things, and the family history of a blood disorder is definitely something to consider. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Of course. I live alone, and I work as a receptionist at a doctor's office, ironically enough! I'm not very active, I have to admit. I mostly sit at a desk all day. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I eat a fairly healthy diet, mostly vegetables and lean protein. I do enjoy cooking, but I’m not a big fan of exercise. I don’t travel much either. I mostly just stay at home and read. Does that give you a good idea?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Okay, Mande, based on what you've told me – the symptoms specifically triggered by fava beans, the yellowing skin, tiredness, dark urine, family history of a possible blood disorder, and your overall health – I’m starting to suspect you might have a condition called Favism. It's a genetic deficiency where your body can't properly process a substance in fava beans. However, we need to confirm this with some tests. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a reticulocyte count, and a G6PD enzyme assay. Do you have any concerns about having these blood tests?
PATIENT: Favism? I've never heard of it. It sounds… frightening. Is it serious? Blood tests are fine, I suppose. A bit unpleasant, but if it will help find out what’s wrong, then yes, please. What exactly will they show? And what happens if it is Favism? Will I have to avoid fava beans forever? I do enjoy them sometimes, especially in salads… although, maybe not so much now.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you're frightened, Mande. Let's talk through it. Favism is a genetic condition, so it's not something you catch, and it’s not usually life-threatening, but it can cause significant symptoms like the ones you’re experiencing. The blood tests will help us confirm the diagnosis. The complete blood count will show if your red blood cells are being broken down, which is what happens in Favism. The reticulocyte count measures how quickly your body is making new red blood cells. And the G6PD enzyme assay is the key test – it measures the level of the G6PD enzyme, which is deficient in people with Favism. If it is Favism, the main treatment is to avoid fava beans and certain other substances that can trigger the breakdown of red blood cells. It does mean avoiding them, yes, but there are many other delicious foods you can enjoy. We can also discuss ways to manage any potential symptoms if you accidentally ingest something that triggers a reaction. It's also important to inform other healthcare providers about your condition. Do you have any other questions before we proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable, I suppose. Avoiding fava beans isn't the end of the world, although it is a bit disappointing. So, what happens now? Do I need to go somewhere else for these tests, or can they be done here? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m a bit anxious about waiting, to be honest. I just want to know what’s wrong and what I need to do. And… is it possible to pass this on to anyone? I don’t have any children, but… it's just something I'm thinking about.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Mande. We can do all the tests right here in the clinic, so you don’t have to go anywhere else. I’ll write up the requests now. The results usually take a couple of days to come back, but I'll make sure we get them as quickly as possible. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. And to answer your question about passing it on, yes, Favism is a genetic condition, so it can be inherited. It’s an X-linked recessive trait, meaning it’s primarily passed on by mothers to their sons. Since you don’t have any children, that’s not an immediate concern, but it’s good to be aware of it. We can discuss genetic counselling if you're interested. Here are the lab requests. Please take these to the reception desk, and they’ll schedule you for a blood draw. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding fava beans and anything that might contain them, just to be safe. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel a lot less anxious knowing what’s going on. It’s a relief to finally have some answers, even if it’s not a definitive answer yet. I’ll go and schedule the blood draw now. And I’ll definitely avoid the fava beans! Thank you again for your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We'll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available.
