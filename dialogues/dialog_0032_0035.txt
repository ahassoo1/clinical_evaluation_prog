DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I am Dr. Pipkorn. Welcome to the clinic. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor Pipkorn. It's these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… well, a little while now. Not constantly, mind you, but they pop up at the strangest times. It’s a bit of a bother, really.
DOCTOR: A bother, yes, I can imagine. And when did you first notice these hiccups beginning, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it was right after my grandson, Leo, visited. He came all the way from Australia, lovely boy, but a whirlwind! It must have been… oh, around the 28th of July, I reckon. We were having tea and laughing, and then hic – there it started. Though it didn’t really bother me much then, just a little tickle. It's gotten more frequent since.
DOCTOR: July 28th… coinciding with your grandson’s visit. And would you describe these hiccups as constant, intermittent, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely intermittent. Not like I’m hiccuping non-stop, goodness no! They come and go. Sometimes hours between them, other times… well, just now, you see? hic A few in a row, then nothing for a bit. It’s unpredictable, that's what it is. And usually it's just one or two at a time, rarely more than three. It doesn’t hurt, you understand, just… annoying!
DOCTOR: Annoying, yes. And are there any particular things you've noticed that seem to trigger these hiccups, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Now, let me think… not really anything specific, I don't believe. I tried eating slower, and that didn't seem to make a difference. Drinking water too quickly, sometimes, but not always. Honestly, it feels quite random. I was gardening yesterday, peaceful as could be, and hic – there it was again! And then just now, talking to you! No excitement or anything. It's just… baffling, really.
DOCTOR: Baffling, indeed. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these hiccups, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, nothing else at all. No heartburn, no trouble breathing, no dizziness… Just the hiccups! I feel perfectly alright otherwise, very healthy for my age, if I do say so myself! I still walk a mile every morning, and I'm very active in the church choir. It’s just these pesky hics that are bothering me. It's not pain, not discomfort, just... inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Just my usual blood pressure tablets, Doctor. A small dose, prescribed by Dr. Sharma. Been taking them for years, no problems at all. And a vitamin D supplement in the winter, just because the sunshine isn’t as strong. Other than that, nothing. I'm not one for popping pills if I can help it!
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication and Vitamin D. Any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies, thankfully. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to help my mother in the kitchen, and we used all sorts of herbs and spices, never a problem. I’m quite blessed that way. No, no allergies at all. I can eat pretty much anything, which is a good thing, as I enjoy my cooking!
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. Just to rule out anything obvious. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement completely. Go right ahead. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Been to the doctor enough times in my 86 years!
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, rate is within normal limits. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. No organomegaly noted. Everything appears normal, Ms. Sucich.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear, Doctor! So, it’s not anything serious, then? Just… hiccups? It's awfully frustrating, having them pop up for no reason. I was hoping you could give me something to make them stop, or at least calm them down. I haven't been sleeping perfectly lately, and it’s a bit distracting when they come on at night.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Sucich, persistent hiccups, especially in someone of your age, can sometimes be… vexing. Often, they are benign and self-limiting. However, given your age and the duration, we should rule out some less common causes. Although the physical exam was unremarkable, I’d like to order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count to assess your electrolyte levels and rule out any underlying issues. I also want to check your thyroid function. It’s unlikely to be a major problem, but it’s prudent to investigate. In the meantime, you could try a teaspoon of sugar, slowly swallowed. Sometimes that can stimulate the vagus nerve and resolve the hiccups. It's a rather old remedy, but occasionally effective.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. If you think those tests are a good idea, then I trust your judgement. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. A teaspoon of sugar, you say? That's not so bad. My grandson Leo always has a sweet tooth, maybe it's in the genes! So, just a teaspoon, slowly? And we'll get those blood tests done, yes? Where do I go for those?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Just a teaspoon, slowly swallowed. And yes, I'm writing the requisition now. You can go to the lab here in the clinic, just down the hall. They'll take a small blood sample. Fasting is not required, so you can have breakfast if you haven't already. The results should be available in a few days, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Now, if the hiccups continue to be severely disruptive, and especially if they are accompanied by any difficulty breathing, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, perfectly clear. Down the hall for the blood tests, and a teaspoon of sugar. And if anything gets worse – breathing trouble, chest pain, dizziness – straight to the emergency room. I'll remember that. Thank you so much for your time and patience. It’s a relief to know we’re doing something to figure it out. It’s just… annoying, you know? But I appreciate you taking me seriously. I'll go to the lab right away.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sucich. If you have any questions before your follow-up, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
