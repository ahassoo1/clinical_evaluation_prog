DOCTOR: Right, yes. Delron Hartness, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Look, I haven’t got all day, you know. Got a thing with the army coming up. Important exam. Need this done quick.
DOCTOR: An army exam… yes, well, we all have commitments. Though, frankly, rushing a medical assessment isn't ideal. But, alright. What brings you in here today?
PATIENT: It's for the recruitment thing. They want a check-up, make sure I’m… fit. I am fit. Always been. But paperwork, you know? They need a doctor to say so. Nothing’s wrong. I just need a signature, really. Is that what you do here? Sign things?
DOCTOR: A signature?
PATIENT: Look, don't get me wrong, I appreciate a good bit of bureaucracy as much as the next guy, but I don’t just hand out signatures. It's a check-up, remember? They want to know if you’re healthy enough for… strenuous activity. Now, have you had any problems, any problems at all, with your breathing? Chest pain? Anything like that? Even a little bit?
DOCTOR: Right. Breathing…chest pain… let’s just get this over with. Any major illnesses?
PATIENT: Major illnesses? No. Never been one for being sick. Had a cold once, maybe, when I was a kid. That's it. Always strong. Good genes, I suppose. My father, he was a lumberjack. Built like a… well, like a lumberjack. Never sick a day in his life. Don't waste my time asking about silly things. This is for the army, not a wellness check.
DOCTOR: Fine, fine. Family history… lumberjacks… very enlightening. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Why would I have surgeries? I haven’t needed surgeries. I keep myself in good condition. Look, is this some kind of test? Are you trying to find something wrong with me? Because you won't. I'm perfectly healthy, and I'd like to get this over with. This is… frankly, a bit insulting.
DOCTOR: Insulting?
PATIENT: Look, I'm a practical man. I don't have time for… feelings. You ask me about illnesses, surgeries… it’s like you’re looking for a reason to say no. I’m strong, I’m capable. The army needs people like me. Are you going to help me get this form signed, or should I go somewhere else? I can find another doctor, you know. I’m not stuck here.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s just skip the history then. You say you're in good condition?
PATIENT: Good condition? Absolutely. Best condition. I can run for miles. Lift heavy things. No problem at all. I work hard, you see? Physical labor. Always have. Don’t get winded easily. I’m… robust. That's the word. Now, can we just… measure something? Check my height, weight, or whatever you need to do to finish this? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s get this over with. You're rather… slight. Step on the scale, please. And try to stand still.
PATIENT: Slight? Slight? I'm lean, okay? Muscle, not fat. It’s efficient. The army doesn't need a heavyweight, they need someone who can move. Just get it over with. I’m standing still. See? Perfectly still. Don't need a lecture on my physique.
DOCTOR: 53 kilograms?
PATIENT: What? 53? That’s… that can’t be right. The machine must be broken. I weigh much more than that. I have muscle, remember? There's something wrong with this thing. It's not accurate. I’m definitely heavier. Ask anyone. I could probably bench press twice my weight. Honestly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Bench pressing twice your weight, you say?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not going to stand here and be questioned about my strength! I am strong. It’s a fact. I’ve been doing physical labor my whole life. Maybe the machine is off. Maybe you need to recalibrate it. Or maybe… well, maybe you’re just not very good at your job. It’s a simple weight check. Don’t make this harder than it needs to be. The army won’t accept this kind of… incompetence. Are you going to fix the scale, or do I need to complain to someone?
DOCTOR: Let's just move on. I'll document a weight of 53kg. Now, any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely none. I eat everything. Everything! Don't bother asking. I'm a simple man with a simple constitution. Strong. Remember that word? And I don't react to anything. Dust, pollen, cats, dogs... doesn't matter. Waste of time. Just sign the form. I’ve told you everything you need to know. This is getting absurd.
DOCTOR: No allergies, documented. Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never take medications. What kind of question is that? I’m a healthy man! I don't need medications. I get by on hard work and good genes. None. Zero. Nothing. Are we done yet? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I'm starting to lose patience. Is there a manager I can speak to?
DOCTOR: Fine. No medications. Let's just do a quick physical exam, to… confirm your self-assessment. Lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Lie down? What for? I've told you everything! This is a waste of time. I’m perfectly healthy! You’ve asked all the questions, I've given you all the answers. This is… humiliating. Fine. But make it quick. I haven't got all day. And don't expect me to be comfortable. This is… undignified.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Breath sounds are… diminished.
PATIENT: Diminished? What are you talking about? I breathe perfectly fine! I just ran up the stairs! I'm not winded at all. Diminished? You’re telling me I have bad lungs? That’s… that’s impossible. This machine must be faulty. You need to check it again. You’re clearly incompetent. I demand a second opinion. This is… outrageous! I’m perfectly healthy!
DOCTOR: Let’s just move on. Abdomen is… soft, but… lacking muscle tone.
PATIENT: Lacking muscle tone?! Are you serious? Look at my arms! Look at my… well, look at me! I work with my hands all day. I lift heavy things. That's muscle! This is… insulting! You’re making fun of me now? I’m perfectly capable! I can do push-ups, I can… I can do anything! This is… I’m leaving. I want my form back. This is a complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: I'm documenting my findings. Diminished breath sounds and lack of muscle tone. It's my professional opinion that you are not fit for strenuous physical activity. I will not sign this form. I recommend a referral to a pulmonologist and a physical therapist. Perhaps after some treatment you will be in a better condition.
PATIENT: WHAT?! You're not going to sign it?! Are you KIDDING me?! This is unbelievable! I'm perfectly healthy! You haven't even tried to understand! Pulmonologist? Physical therapist? I don't need a pulmonologist! I ran up the stairs! I told you! This is… this is an outrage! I’m going to report you! To someone! I’ll… I’ll call the army! They need to know about this! You’re ruining my life! This is… completely unacceptable! Give me my form back NOW! I demand to speak to your manager! This is… this is… This is… just… ridiculous. .
