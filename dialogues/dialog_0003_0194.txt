DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. It’s hard to explain. Things just… go quiet sometimes, and I get really dizzy. It doesn't happen all the time, thankfully. And my… my husband, bless his soul, he had something similar, years back. That’s why I thought I should come in. It's just… fuzzy, you know? Remembering exactly when it started… that's a bit difficult for me.
DOCTOR: Right. “Fuzzy,” and dizziness. And it’s intermittent, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, intermittent. That’s a good word for it. It comes and goes. Some days I don’t notice a thing, and others… well, others it’s like someone turned down the volume on the world. And the spinning… oh, the spinning is awful. Makes it hard to even stand up. It doesn’t last long, usually, just… moments. But scary moments.
DOCTOR: Moments, alright. And has anything specific triggered these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggered…? Hmm. That’s a good question. Honestly, I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It doesn’t seem to happen after anything particular. I've tried to think, you know, if it's after I've been out in the sun, or after a big meal… nothing seems to set it off. It just… happens. I do spend a lot of time at the… well, at the club, if that makes a difference? But I wouldn’t think… oh, dear, I’m rambling, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: A “club,” you say?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. The… the gaming club. It's just a little place, you know? People go to play cards and… things. It’s mostly social, really. I… I do enjoy a bit of a flutter now and then. But I don’t think that has anything to do with my ears. It’s just… well, it keeps me occupied, since… since my husband passed. It's probably just getting old, isn't it? Everything goes a bit wonky eventually. I don’t want to take up your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's proceed with a basic examination, then. I need to rule out the obvious. Please sit up and I'll take a look in your ears. It's unlikely to be related to… recreational activities, but we must be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Thorough is good. Just… be gentle, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive these days. I’m not very good with things poking around in there.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I am quite experienced. Please remain still. Hmm. Some cerumen present, but nothing remarkable. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Please take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. I always feel a bit silly when they listen to my chest. Like they're expecting to find a bird in there. It’s probably nothing, really. I just… worry, you know? My husband was a strong man, but even strong men get sick sometimes. Is everything alright so far, Doctor? You don’t look very… cheerful.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is within normal limits. Lungs are clear. It is difficult to ascertain a diagnosis without more information. We need to consider several possibilities. Have you experienced any hearing loss, tinnitus – ringing in the ears – or any nausea or vomiting alongside these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh dear, so many questions! Let me think… Hearing loss, yes, definitely. Like someone turned the volume down, like I said. And… ringing? Now and then, yes. It’s a faint ringing, mostly when it’s quiet. Not constant, thankfully. Nausea… hmm. Not really vomiting, no. But sometimes I feel a bit queasy when I’m dizzy. A bit lightheaded, you know? I’m not very good at describing these things, I’m afraid. It all just… feels unwell. I hope I’m not being a bother, Doctor. This is all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms – intermittent dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, and occasional queasiness – it could be Ménière’s disease. However, it’s too early to definitively diagnose. I’m going to order a hearing test and a balance test. That will give us a clearer picture. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Ménière’s disease… sounds rather frightening. A test… alright. I suppose that’s sensible. Allergies… hmm. Let me see… Not that I know of, no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to take something for my arthritis, years back, but that was a long time ago. No, I don’t think so. I just… I hope it’s not something serious, Doctor. I’m not a young woman anymore, you know. And I rather like my quiet life. Even with the… the club.
DOCTOR: We’ll have the results back within the week. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them. In the meantime, try to avoid sudden movements and loud noises. And perhaps… reconsider some of your social engagements. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh… reconsider my engagements… Well, no, Doctor. I think that's all. Just the tests, then. Thank you. Thank you for seeing me. I hope… I hope everything will be alright. I’ll see you next week, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist will schedule your follow-up. Have a good day. .
