DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Demondre. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hey, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Uh, well, to be honest… I just kinda wanted to check things out. I ain’t really sick sick, if you know what I mean. Just figured I should probably get looked at, ya know? Like, make sure everything’s okay. I been workin' on the boats a lot lately.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Demondre. That’s a very sensible thing to do – preventative care is always a good idea. Working on boats can be physically demanding, so it’s smart to get a check-up. So, you mentioned working on boats. What kind of work do you do specifically?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is hard work. Lots of liftin' and movin'. I'm a sailor and a marine oiler. Mostly keepin' the engines runnin' smooth, fixin' stuff when it breaks, and… well, sailor stuff. It's good work, pays the bills, but it's not exactly easy on the body, ya know?
DOCTOR: I can imagine. Both sailing and engine work require a lot of physical exertion and can put strain on different parts of the body. Okay. Now, when you say “make sure everything’s okay,” are there any specific concerns you have, or is it more of a general check-up?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' specific really. I guess… sometimes my back gets a little sore after a long shift. And my hands, they get kinda rough and achey. But I just figured it was from the work, ya know? I ain’t never really bothered a doctor with it before. Just thought I'd see what you think.
DOCTOR: That’s good you’re bringing it up now. Even seemingly minor aches and pains can be worth checking out, especially with a physically demanding job. It's better to address things early on. Okay, so back soreness and rough, achy hands. Let's start with the back. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it ain't like a sharp pain, more like a dull ache. It kinda starts at the lower back and sometimes goes down my legs a little. It's worse after I been liftin' heavy stuff for a long time, or if I twist wrong. Usually goes away after I rest, but it comes back pretty quick when I get back to work. It ain't stopped me from workin' yet, but it's gettin' a little more frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in the lower back radiating down the legs, worse with lifting and twisting, relieved with rest, but returning with activity. That gives me a better picture. And how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It's been comin' and goin' for… maybe a year or so? At first it was just now and then, like after a really tough job. But like I said, it's been happenin' more often lately. Maybe the last six months, it’s been pretty regular. I dunno exactly, to be honest. Time kinda blurs when you're at sea.
DOCTOR: I understand completely – time does have a way of doing that. Six months of increasing frequency is good to know. Alright. Now, let's talk about your hands. You said they get rough and achy. Can you describe the ache?
PATIENT: It's kinda like a deep ache, in the joints mostly. And they get real stiff, especially in the mornin'. Makes it hard to grip things sometimes. And they get all cracked and dry, no matter how much lotion I use. It’s mostly after a long shift fixin’ stuff, ya know? All the grease and oil and wrenchin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Deep ache in the joints, stiffness in the morning, and dryness and cracking despite lotion use. That's helpful. And you mentioned grease and oil… do you use gloves when you're working with those substances?
PATIENT: Sometimes. I try to, but… honestly, they get in the way a lot. Makes it harder to feel what I’m doin’. And they rip easy, so I end up just usin' my bare hands a lot of the time. I know I should wear 'em, but… It’s kinda hard to explain. You gotta have a good feel for the engines, ya know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s a trade-off between protection and dexterity. It sounds like you've been prioritizing feeling what you're doing, which makes sense for your work. Alright. Now, let’s quickly go through some other areas. Have you noticed any pain in your shoulders, elbows, or wrists?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. My shoulders get a little tired sometimes after a long shift, but it ain’t pain, ya know? Just kinda… achy. And my elbows are okay. Wrists are alright too, I guess. No real problems there, like with my back and hands. Just the usual tired feelin’ after work.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No significant pain in your shoulders, elbows, or wrists. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. No fever, no chills, and my weight's been pretty steady. I been eatin' okay, I guess. Maybe a little more when I'm workin' hard, but no big changes. No, I feel pretty good overall, besides my back and hands. It’s just… those been botherin' me more lately, so I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. No fever, chills, or weight loss. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin'. I don't really take much medicine, unless I got a bad cold or somethin'. No, no allergies. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' at all. Just… sometimes I take some ibuprofen for my back when it gets real bad. But that’s it. And I don’t take it very often, like maybe once a month or somethin'. Mostly try to just rest it off, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen for back pain. Now, just a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions like arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. Never been diagnosed with anythin'. I been pretty healthy my whole life, knock on wood. No, no big medical problems. Just the usual colds and flu, ya know? Nothin' serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No prior significant medical diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nah, never had any surgery. Not even a tonsillectomy or nothin'. No, never been under the knife. I’m pretty lucky that way. Both my parents had some surgeries when they got older, but I ain’t had any yet. I hope I don’t!
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries. And finally, is there any significant medical history in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandma on my mom’s side had arthritis real bad. And my dad had high blood pressure when he got older. But that’s about it, I think. No, nothin' else that I can think of. Both my parents are still alive, and they’re pretty healthy overall. But yeah, arthritis and high blood pressure… that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis and high blood pressure. Alright, Demondre, that gives me a good overview. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing some musculoskeletal discomfort, likely related to the physical demands of your work. The back soreness and hand pain, combined with your description of the symptoms, point towards potential strain and overuse. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind, just to assess the range of motion in your back and hands, and to check for any signs of inflammation or other issues. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead, I ain’t got nothin' to hide! Just let me know if somethin' hurts real bad.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will. First, let's start with your back. Could you please stand up and gently bend forward, reaching towards your toes?
PATIENT: Okay, here goes… Yeah, it gets kinda tight down here. That’s about as far as I can go without it hurtin' too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And I notice some mild tenderness when you bend forward. Now, can you gently twist your torso to the left, and then to the right?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, that's where it gets kinda tight. Feels about the same on this side too. Not a sharp pain, just kinda… tight and achy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s check your hands. Can you make a fist for me, as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Here ya go. It ain't as strong as it used to be, though. Feels kinda stiff, ya know? Especially in the mornin'. It takes a minute to get 'em movin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And can you spread your fingers out as wide as you can?
PATIENT: Here ya go. It kinda… hurts to do that, ya know? Not a bad pain, just a little ache in the joints. Feels kinda tight and achy.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m not feeling any significant swelling, but there is some tenderness along the knuckles and at the base of your thumbs. Based on the physical exam and your history, it appears you’re experiencing symptoms of musculoskeletal strain, likely related to repetitive use and physical exertion from your work. The tenderness, limited range of motion, and stiffness are consistent with this. It's not something immediately concerning, but it's important to manage it to prevent it from becoming chronic. Do you have any questions about what I’ve found so far?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. That makes sense, I guess. It’s just… work, ya know? I figured it was somethin’ like that. So… what do I do about it? Is there any medicine you can give me? Or somethin’ I can do to make it better?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. There are several things we can do to manage this. First, let's talk about conservative treatment. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed for pain and inflammation. You've already been taking ibuprofen occasionally, which is a good start. I also suggest applying ice or heat to your back and hands for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. More importantly, we need to focus on prevention. That means taking breaks during your work shifts to stretch and move around. Proper lifting techniques are crucial - bend your knees, keep your back straight, and avoid twisting. And, if possible, try to wear gloves to protect your hands, even if they're not ideal. I’m also going to recommend some simple hand and back stretches you can do at home. I can print out a handout with some examples for you. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. I can try all that. The stretches sound like a good idea. And I'll try to be more careful with the gloves, even if they get in the way. I kinda figured I should be takin' better care of myself, to be honest. A handout with the stretches would be great, yeah. Thanks.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad to hear that. I'll print out that handout for you now. Here you go. These are just some simple exercises you can do throughout the day to keep your muscles loose and prevent stiffness. Start slowly and don’t push yourself too hard. I also want you to monitor your symptoms. If your pain worsens, or if you develop any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your hands or back, please contact me immediately. I'm not concerned about anything serious at this point, but it's always best to be cautious. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You been a big help. Thanks for takin’ the time to listen and explain things to me. I feel a lot better knowin’ what’s goin’ on and what I can do about it. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Demondre. I'm glad I could help. Remember, preventative care is key. Taking care of your body now will help you stay healthy and continue doing the work you enjoy. I'll see you back in a few weeks if your symptoms don’t improve. Otherwise, feel free to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and be careful out there.
