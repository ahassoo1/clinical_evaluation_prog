DOCTOR: Hi Jinnie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you, Doctor. It’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that’s why one comes to a doctor, isn’t it? It’s… a problem. A delicate problem, with… a gentleman acquaintance. He’s been experiencing… a discharge. Yes. A discharge. It's most unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jinnie. No need to be embarrassed, these things happen and we're here to help. It sounds like your… acquaintance is experiencing some kind of genital discharge. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, well, I’m glad you say that. It’s just… not something one discusses. He says it's… well, it's not exactly clear. It’s not like water, not like… normal fluids. More… thick. And yellowish, I believe. He's been trying to keep things clean, of course, but it persists. And it smells… rather unpleasant, if I may be so bold. It’s been going on for… oh, a week, perhaps? A little longer? It's difficult to say precisely. He doesn’t want to come here himself, you understand. Thinks it's… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jinnie. It's very common for people to feel uncomfortable discussing these issues, and I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out on his behalf. A thick, yellowish discharge with an odor that's been going on for a week or more… that does point towards a few possibilities. To get a better idea of what might be going on, could you tell me if he’s experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. He hasn’t mentioned any… burning. No pain, as far as I know. Though he is a rather stoic fellow, doesn't complain easily. He did mention some… discomfort. A slight ache, lower down. And… well, he's been a bit more irritable than usual. Not towards me, of course, but just generally. He's also been going to the bathroom more frequently, I think. Is that relevant, Doctor? It's all very distressing, really. Such a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, no burning or pain, some lower abdominal discomfort, increased irritability, and more frequent urination. That's helpful. Has he noticed any fever or chills?
PATIENT: Fever or chills… No, not that I've observed. He's been keeping rather to himself, which makes it difficult to say definitively. He’s not one to readily announce his ailments, you understand. He drinks his tea, reads his newspaper… generally carries on as normal. But I haven't felt his forehead, if you catch my meaning. He doesn’t seem unwell, exactly. Just… preoccupied. And a little grumpy, perhaps. Is a fever something I should be checking for? I suppose I could… but he’d likely object.
DOCTOR: It's good you're observing him closely, Jinnie. A fever would be a sign we need to investigate more urgently. Since he's not exhibiting other severe symptoms right now, let's proceed carefully. Has he had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. He's… a respectable man, Doctor. Keeps himself clean, doesn't… well, he doesn't go about with just anyone, if you understand my meaning. This is entirely new territory for him, and for me, naturally. He's always been… very particular about his health. Vitamins, sensible eating… all that sort of thing. To have this… affliction… it’s quite upsetting. He's rather embarrassed, you know. And I, naturally, wish to be helpful. But I'm hardly a medical professional.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jinnie. It's good he generally takes care of his health. Given the new onset of symptoms, and without any prior history, we need to consider a few possibilities. To help narrow it down, is he sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. Well… that is… a rather personal question, isn’t it? I mean, I… I shouldn't presume to know all of his private affairs. But… yes. He is. I believe it's safe to say he is. He's a… a man of certain appetites, shall we say? Though he’s always been… discreet. I don’t ask, you understand. It's none of my business. But yes, he does… partake. Is that relevant, Doctor? Will knowing this change your diagnosis? It’s rather delicate, you see.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Jinnie, thank you for sharing that. Knowing he’s sexually active helps us consider potential sexually transmitted infections as a possibility. To be thorough, we’ll need to consider that alongside other causes. Does he consistently use protection, like a condom?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking a great deal. I truly don’t know, Doctor. I… I haven't been involved in those… details. It’s hardly something one discusses over tea and biscuits! He’s a grown man, capable of making his own decisions. I simply… offer companionship. And a clean home. I wouldn’t presume to know his… arrangements. Honestly, this is all rather awkward. He’d be mortified if he knew I was divulging so much. I’m just trying to be helpful! And frankly, I’m starting to feel rather flustered.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jinnie. You're doing a wonderful job providing information, and I appreciate your honesty. It's perfectly okay if you're not aware of those details. We can proceed without knowing. To help me get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask about his medical history, if you don’t mind. Does he have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. He doesn't seem to react to any foods, as far as I'm aware. He enjoys a good roast dinner, all the trimmings. And he’s quite fond of a glass of sherry. As for other allergies… I don’t recall him mentioning any. He's never had a bad reaction to any medication that I’ve seen him take, but he doesn't take much, thankfully. Just the occasional aspirin for a headache, perhaps. He’s a robust fellow, generally. I suppose that’s good news, isn’t it? That he's not prone to… sensitivities. It would complicate matters terribly if he were allergic to something.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, no known allergies. And no major medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing significant. He had a touch of… the flu, perhaps, a few years back. But nothing serious. He recovered quickly. He doesn’t see a doctor unless absolutely necessary. Thinks they… exaggerate things. He believes in a good night’s sleep and a healthy diet. And plenty of fresh air. He used to be a very active gardener, but his knees aren't what they used to be. That’s about all I can think of, Doctor. He’s generally a very healthy man, or at least, he was before this… unfortunate development. Honestly, I’m starting to worry about him. It’s just not like him to be… unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jinnie. No major medical history, a touch of the flu in the past, and some knee trouble. Thank you for sharing all of that. To get a better sense of what’s going on, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Would you mind if I take a look?
PATIENT: Oh. Now you’re asking a great deal, Doctor. I… I hadn’t anticipated this. A physical exam… of that area? Is it absolutely necessary? It seems… rather invasive. He wouldn't approve, you know. He's a very private man. And frankly, I’m not sure I'm comfortable… facilitating such an examination. Couldn’t you… perhaps prescribe something? An ointment, perhaps? Or some pills? Surely there’s a less… personal way to determine the cause of his ailment? I'm starting to feel quite distressed, Doctor. This is all very upsetting. He would be mortified if he knew.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Jinnie, and I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable. You’re right to be concerned about his privacy and comfort. A physical exam would give me the best chance to determine the cause of the discharge and recommend the right treatment. However, I absolutely respect his and your wishes. Without a proper exam, it's difficult to be certain, but given the symptoms – the yellowish discharge, discomfort, increased urination, and sexual activity – the most likely possibilities are either a bacterial infection like gonorrhea or chlamydia, or a non-sexually transmitted infection. I could prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers both possibilities, but it’s not ideal. It’s better to have a definitive diagnosis first to ensure the correct treatment and avoid antibiotic resistance. Would you be willing to discuss this with him and see if he'd be comfortable coming in for a quick exam?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… a difficult position. To ask him, after all this… He’d be furious with me, I'm certain. He's a very proud man, as I’ve mentioned. And to think of him… examined… It's simply unthinkable. A broad-spectrum antibiotic… is that safe? Will it… have side effects? I wouldn’t want to cause him any further discomfort. Honestly, I’m not sure what to do. Perhaps… perhaps it’s best to just let it run its course? He might recover on his own. He's a strong man, after all. Though that's probably foolish thinking, isn't it? I’m just… so worried about upsetting him. And frankly, I’m not sure I have the courage to ask. It feels like a betrayal of his trust. Perhaps you could… suggest something he could do at home? A warm bath, perhaps? Or some herbal remedy? Anything to avoid… that?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Jinnie. You’re in a very difficult position, and I appreciate you trying to do what’s best for him while respecting his wishes. Letting it run its course isn’t ideal, as these types of infections can sometimes lead to more serious complications if left untreated. While a warm bath might provide some temporary relief, it won’t address the underlying infection. And herbal remedies haven’t been scientifically proven to be effective against these types of conditions. Given the circumstances, I’m willing to prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic as a first step, but I strongly recommend he see a doctor for a proper examination and diagnosis as soon as possible. I’ll write a prescription for azithromycin, a single-dose antibiotic that often works well for these types of infections. I’ll also include instructions on potential side effects, which can include nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. However, it's crucial that he completes the full course of antibiotics, even if he starts feeling better, and that he avoids sexual activity until he and his partner have been evaluated and treated. Would you like me to write that prescription for him now?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. Azithromycin, you said? A single dose… that sounds… less intrusive. And if it alleviates his discomfort… that would be a great relief. Please, write the prescription. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very understanding. I’m still terribly worried, but… at least we’re doing something. And I’ll… I’ll try to persuade him to see a doctor. Though I can’t promise anything. He's a very stubborn man, you know. Please, write the prescription and tell me… what should I watch out for? What if it gets worse? Or if he develops… a fever? I’m terribly anxious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jinnie. Here is the prescription for azithromycin. It's a single 1-gram dose, to be taken orally as soon as possible. Now, regarding what to watch out for: if he experiences any severe side effects, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, or severe abdominal pain, he needs to seek immediate medical attention. If his symptoms worsen or don't improve within 2-3 days of taking the antibiotic, or if he develops a fever, chills, or pain in his lower abdomen, it’s crucial that he see a doctor right away. These could be signs of a more serious infection. Also, it's important that he completes the full course of antibiotics, even if he starts feeling better. Stopping early can lead to antibiotic resistance and a recurrence of the infection. I'll also provide you with some written information about the antibiotic and potential side effects. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. And patient. I truly appreciate your understanding. It’s a… delicate situation, as I’m sure you can appreciate. I’ll… I’ll try to persuade him to see a doctor. But I can’t promise anything. He’s a very proud man, you know. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve… eased my mind, somewhat. I’ll take this prescription and… see what I can do. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jinnie. I understand it’s a delicate situation, and I’m glad I could help, even if it's just a little. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns or if his condition worsens. Take care of yourself and him. .
