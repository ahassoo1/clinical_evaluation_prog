DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Sobkowic, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Just…chest hurt. And my heart…feels funny. Like it’s flapping. Doctor, I don’t have all day, you know. Busy man.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Chest hurt” and a “funny feeling” in your heart… that gives us a starting point. Can you tell me a little more about the chest hurt?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to tell? It hurts. Like…pressure. Heavy. And sometimes…sharp. Not all the time. Mostly when I…walk fast. Or get excited. Stupid things. Old man problems. Can we hurry this up? My wife is waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand you want to be quick, and we'll do our best. “Pressure and heaviness” that comes on with walking or getting excited... that's helpful. And sometimes sharp pain too. Does the pain radiate anywhere – like to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Radiate? You use big words. It…sometimes goes to my left arm. A little. Not always. And…maybe my jaw. Hard to tell. Everything hurts when you get old, you know. Is this important? Because I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, radiating to the left arm and sometimes the jaw… that is important, Mr. Sobkowic. It’s good you mentioned that. Just to be thorough, can you describe what you mean by "funny feeling" in your heart?
PATIENT: Like…flapping. Like a bird. Or…like it’s going too fast. Or…skipping. I don’t know! It’s just…not normal. Look, I take my pills. Doctor told me to. For the…blood pressure. Is that what you want to know? Is my blood pressure bad? It’s always high, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, “flapping, fast, or skipping” – that sounds like palpitations. And you're taking medication for high blood pressure, that’s good. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Hmph. Names? I don’t remember names. Little white pill. Take it every morning. Doctor…old doctor…gave it to me. That’s all I know. I have a wife who handles these things. She keeps track. I just take it. Can we get this over with? I’m sweating.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little white pill for blood pressure. We can look that up in your records if we need to. Since you're sweating and describing chest pain and palpitations, I’d like to do a quick exam. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Exam? What kind of exam? Stick things in me? I don’t like needles. And poking and prodding. Just tell me if my blood pressure is bad and give me something to make it better. I haven’t got time for…tests. My wife made me a sandwich. And it's getting cold.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Sobkowic. No needles right now, I promise. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your pulse, and taking your blood pressure. It will be quick. Then we can talk about what might be going on and if any further tests are needed. Your heart rate is a little fast, and I hear a slight irregularity. Your blood pressure is elevated – 160/95. Your lungs sound clear. I’m going to feel your pulse in your wrists and ankles as well. Your pulses are a little weak.
PATIENT: Weak? What does that mean? Weak? I walk every day! Well, sometimes. Not when it’s cold. Look, just…fix it. Give me something. My wife is going to kill me if I’m late for lunch. And this sandwich…it's a special sandwich.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowic. "Weak pulses" can sometimes mean the heart isn’t pumping as strongly as it should. Given your symptoms – chest pain, palpitations, elevated blood pressure, and weak pulses – I’m concerned about a possible cardiac issue. I want to be very careful, and I think we need to rule out something serious. I’m going to order an EKG right away to check your heart's electrical activity. And I’d also like to order a blood test to check for cardiac enzymes, which can indicate heart damage. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Enzymes? Electrical activity? This is ridiculous! I just wanted someone to tell me if my blood pressure was bad! Look, I don't have time for fancy tests. I'm an old man! My heart is old! It's going to stop one day, that’s all. Can't you just…give me a pill and send me home? My wife will be furious. She made potato salad too. It's her special recipe. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowic, I understand your frustration, and I truly want to respect your wishes. However, given your symptoms, dismissing this as simply "getting old" could be dangerous. The tests I'm recommending are quick and will give us valuable information. While I can prescribe you medication to manage your blood pressure, it’s important to know why it’s elevated and to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. We can't just treat the symptom without understanding the cause. I strongly recommend we proceed with the EKG and blood test. If everything comes back normal, we can discuss managing your blood pressure with medication and lifestyle changes. But if there is a problem, we need to know about it right away. I’m concerned enough to suggest that, if you're still uncomfortable with the tests, we should consider sending you to the emergency room for a more thorough evaluation. Would you like me to explain why that might be a better option?
