DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. It’s… life insurance. They need me to get checked out, some kind of medical thing for the policy. I just want to get it over with, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the insurance physical. Perfectly understandable. It is rather… bureaucratic, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Bureaucratic is a good word for it. Look, I got things I gotta do today, so the faster we can get this done, the better. Is it gonna be long?
DOCTOR: We’ll try to be efficient. It’s a standard exam. I’ll need to ask some questions, do a brief physical, and likely order some bloodwork. Do you have any known allergies or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Uh… no allergies that I know of. And no, I don’t take any pills or anything regularly. Just… sometimes ibuprofen for my back, if it’s really acting up. But that’s it.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, occasionally. Good. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical… hmm. Let me think. I had… pneumonia when I was a kid, I think. And a broken arm once, when I was maybe ten. Nothing major since then, really. Just the usual colds and stuff. I had high blood pressure a few years back, the doctor put me on something for it but I stopped taking it when I moved. It felt fine after that.
DOCTOR: You stopped taking medication for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yeah, well, it was a while ago. And honestly, I felt okay. It was expensive, and I didn’t really see a difference. Plus, things were kinda hectic then, you know? I just… stopped going to the doctor regularly after that. Is that bad? I just…I really don’t like doctors, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal. High blood pressure is serious, Mr. Putney. We’ll need to check your current blood pressure today. And we definitely need to discuss getting that addressed, regardless of the insurance physical. If you’ll step over here, we’ll start with a quick measurement and then move onto a basic physical exam.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Fine. Let’s just get it over with. The quicker the better, right?
DOCTOR: Precisely. Please sit here, and I'll take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Easy for you to say. This cuff always makes my arm feel weird. Is it high? Is it really bad?
DOCTOR: 158/92. And 160/95 on this side. Yes, Mr. Putney, it is elevated. Significantly so. Heart sounds are…regular, but a bit forceful. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. We need to address this immediately. Do you have any family history of heart disease, stroke, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uh… my mom had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandpa… he had a stroke, yeah. A pretty bad one. I don't really know much about it, to be honest. We didn't talk about health stuff much. This isn’t good, is it? What does this mean? I just wanted a life insurance policy…
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Putney, it’s not ideal. A family history of stroke and hypertension, combined with your current blood pressure… it’s concerning. We need to order some blood work to assess kidney function and check for any other underlying issues. An EKG would also be prudent to evaluate your heart. And you need to start medication to control your blood pressure. This isn’t something you can ignore. This insurance physical… frankly, it may be complicated given your current health status. I can't guarantee you'll qualify.
PATIENT: Complicated? What does that mean? I need this insurance. My wife… well, my ex-wife… needs it for the kids. I was hoping this would be easy. So, you’re saying I probably won’t get it? And I gotta take pills again? This is just great. What kind of bloodwork? How long is this gonna take? I got things to do…
DOCTOR: Standard lipid panel, complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. It’s fairly routine. The lab should be able to draw it today. We’ll also need to schedule an EKG. As for the insurance… the company will assess the results. I can write a letter detailing your current condition, but I can’t promise anything. Honestly, Mr. Putney, your health is far more important than a policy. Do you have any questions about the tests, or the need for medication?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… a lot. Tests, pills, insurance… I just wanted it to be simple. Can you just… tell me what I need to do? The lab, the EKG… just lay it out for me, step by step. And… what kind of pills are we talking about? I remember the last ones making me feel awful. I just want to get this over with, and I don’t wanna feel sick again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s a lab requisition. Go to the lab across the hall, tell them you’re here for bloodwork ordered by Dr. Sink. They’ll take care of it. I’ll schedule the EKG for you tomorrow at 10 AM. As for medication... We'll start with a low dose of an ACE inhibitor, likely Lisinopril. It's generally well-tolerated, but as with any medication, side effects are possible. Here’s a prescription for Lisinopril 5mg, to be taken once daily. Start with half a tablet for a week, then increase to a full tablet if your blood pressure remains elevated. Follow up with me in two weeks to review the results and assess your response to the medication. Now, if there’s nothing else, I have other patients waiting.
