DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't really have time for a lot of chit-chat. It's… my stomach, I guess. Been feeling pretty puffed up lately. Just want something to fix it, quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re short on time, and we’ll get right to it. “Puffed up,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, how much detail do you need? It just… feels full. Like I ate a Thanksgiving dinner, even when I haven't. And it's uncomfortable, okay? Like, tight. It happens mostly after I eat, I think. Honestly, I don’t pay that much attention. It’s not like it’s life-threatening.
DOCTOR: Okay, “full” and “tight” after eating. That's helpful. And you said mostly after eating – does it happen every time you eat, or just sometimes?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Look, I work construction, alright? Pile driving. It's not exactly a gourmet lifestyle. I eat when I can, what's available. Sometimes it's a sandwich, sometimes it's… not. Probably just something I ate. I don’t need a whole investigation.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you're right, it very well could be something simple. To help me narrow things down, even with a busy schedule, could you describe what you typically eat on a regular day?
PATIENT: Seriously? You want a menu of my lunch pail? Fine. Usually it's… a sandwich. Ham and cheese, sometimes turkey. Chips. Maybe a piece of fruit if I remembered to grab one. And a soda. Look, it's not fancy. I don’t eat a lot of vegetables. Never have. Is that what you want to know? Because honestly, this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: No, it's not about judging your diet, Mr. Kristofik. It helps me understand the possibilities. Soda, chips, and sandwiches…Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don't know. I haven't been keeping a log of everything that happens after I eat. I work, okay? I don't sit around analyzing my insides. If it gets really bad, I take something for gas. That’s it. Maybe some heartburn sometimes, but that’s probably the soda. Honestly, I’m not sure I understand why I even need to tell you all this. Isn’t there a pill you can just give me?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize if it feels like I’m asking a lot of questions. It's important to understand the whole picture before recommending anything, even a simple medication. It helps me make sure I’m not missing something more serious. When you say “sometimes,” how often are you experiencing this fullness and heartburn?
PATIENT: Look, it’s a couple times a week, maybe? Honestly, it comes and goes. Some weeks it’s not bad at all, some weeks it's… irritating. A couple of times it's been bad enough I had to go to the bathroom. That’s all. Is that enough detail for you? Can we just get this over with? I have work in an hour.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of times a week, with occasional urgency. And you haven’t noticed any blood in your stool, weight loss, or fever accompanying these symptoms, correct?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Look, if I was bleeding, I'd know, alright? And weight loss? I haven't been on a scale in… years. I'm a construction worker, I'm built like one. Fever? No. I just feel bloated and uncomfortable, and sometimes gassy. This is ridiculous. Seriously. Is this going to take all day? Can you just give me something for the gas and be done with it? I’m not a doctor, I don't know all this fancy medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood, no weight loss, no fever. I understand your frustration and want to assure you I'm working as efficiently as possible. Before I recommend something, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. It will only take a few moments. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…get it over with. I really don't have time for this. Just… don't poke around too much, alright? I have a job to do. And honestly, I'm not impressed with this whole process. It feels like a waste of perfectly good work hours. .
DOCTOR: I understand. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie back on the exam table, and I'll start with listening to your abdomen. Okay. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now...they’re present, though a bit rumbling. Palpation reveals some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no significant guarding or masses. Do you usually experience discomfort in that specific area?
