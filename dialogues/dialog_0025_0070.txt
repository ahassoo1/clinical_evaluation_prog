DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Szmyd, good afternoon. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Doctor, yes. New here. Just… checking. Medicare said I need to come. Something about… being new to the area. I do makeup, you know. For the theater. Not important, really. Just… a check-up, I think? I forget why exactly. It's all a blur.
DOCTOR: Right. A general check-up. Medicare does like to get everyone in for those when there's a change of address. And you do makeup for the theater… Okay. Well, let’s try to make this useful, then. “Blur” isn't very helpful, Mr. Szmyd. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…sick? No, no. I feel…fine. Old, maybe. But that’s always. Everything hurts a little, you know? Is that a symptom? I don't understand what you want. Just…checking I'm okay. That's what they said. It’s very confusing, all this paperwork. They keep sending letters.
DOCTOR: Okay, “everything hurts a little” is something, Mr. Szmyd, though not very precise. When did you start noticing this generalized discomfort?
PATIENT: Generalized…what? Discomfort? Oh. A long time. Years, probably. Since…well, since my wife left. It just…never went away, you know? Is that what you want to know? Everything aches. Back, knees, sometimes my fingers. Hard to hold the brushes steady sometimes. It's just getting old, I think. Don't make a fuss.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I’m trying to ascertain if this is simply age-related discomfort, or something more…concerning. “Years” is still vague. Has the pain been getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm… Maybe? It’s hard to say. The shows are more demanding now, I think. More glitter, more…everything. I have to stand longer, hold my arms up more. It's just…tiring. I don’t think it’s pain, exactly. Just…uncomfortable. Like an old engine that needs oil. Is that making sense? I don't want any pills, you know. Pills make me sleepy.
DOCTOR: “Uncomfortable” is… not a diagnosis, Mr. Szmyd. We need to be specific. So, you're experiencing discomfort in your back, knees and fingers, which seems to be exacerbated by standing and holding your arms up for extended periods. Are you having any swelling or redness in your joints?
PATIENT: Swelling? No, no swelling. Redness…sometimes my knuckles get a little…pink, maybe? But that's the glitter, I think. It gets everywhere. I wash my hands, but it still gets in there. It doesn’t hurt to move them, just…stiff. Like rusty hinges. I don't want you poking around, Doctor. I’m a professional, you know. I have to keep my hands steady. No needles either. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. No needles, I understand. We’ll proceed without. Let’s just…try to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Always. Shows are exhausting. Standing all day, dealing with…divas. But that’s not…sick fatigue, you know? Just…tired. No fever, no chills. Unless it’s the air conditioning. This place is freezing! And what is with all the questions? I thought this was just a check-up. A quick look, make sure I’m not…dropping dead. That's all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, a "quick look" requires information. I need to know your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical…history? Oh dear. That was…a long time ago. My wife handled all that. She was very organized. I…think I had something with my…blood pressure, maybe? The doctor kept telling me to watch the salt. And…something with my stomach, years ago. But it all…blurs together. I don't remember details. Honestly, I just want to go home and have a cup of tea. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, this is becoming increasingly difficult. “Something with your blood pressure” and “something with your stomach” are not helpful. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No! Absolutely not. I told you, pills make me sleepy. And they ruin my complexion. You know, a makeup artist has to be very careful with what they put in their body. It shows on the face. Just…tea, and sometimes a little brandy to calm my nerves before a show. But that’s not medicine! Honestly, I feel like I’m being interrogated. Is this how doctors treat people now? Very rude. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Let's try a very basic physical exam, then. Can you stand up for me, please?
