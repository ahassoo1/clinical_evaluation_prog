DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I am Dr. Yackey. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… the swelling. It’s in my leg, you see? After the… the treatments. It’s just gotten bigger, and it’s a little uncomfortable. I hope you can help!
DOCTOR: Treatments?
PATIENT: Yes, for the… the cancer. A few months ago now. They did… things. I don't remember all the names, honestly. Lots of appointments… and then this leg started to puff up. It’s mostly my right leg, I think. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It can be. Right leg specifically… and when you say “puff up,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it's bigger than it used to be, of course. And it feels… tight. Like a… a really tight sock that's too small. And sometimes it aches, especially at the end of the day. Not a bad ache, just… noticeable. Is that making sense? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been gradually worsening, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It didn’t just pop up overnight, you know? It was… slow. A little bit bigger each day, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly. It’s been a few weeks, I guess, since I really noticed it. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some records here of chemotherapy and radiation therapy completed approximately three months ago for… lymphedema risk reduction strategies. And you're experiencing unilateral lower extremity swelling. Let's do a quick examination. Could you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Lymphedema… yes, that sounds right. They talked about that. All those words… Okay, yes, the table. There we go. Is this alright? I'm not very flexible anymore, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to take a look and feel your legs. Hmm… Yes, there is definite asymmetry. Your right leg is notably larger in circumference than your left. Palpation reveals… pitting edema, approximately +2 bilaterally, but significantly more pronounced on the right. Skin is warm to the touch, no visible lesions. Dorsalis pedis pulses are… present, but somewhat diminished in the right lower extremity. Capillary refill is… prolonged, approximately 3 seconds in the right foot. And any pain with this examination?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… a lot of words again! No, no pain when you're touching it. It feels… strange, maybe? Like a heavy feeling. And I do get cold feet sometimes, so maybe that’s what you’re feeling? The pulses… are those important? I don’t want to worry you.
DOCTOR: Diminished pulses can be a concern, yes. It suggests potential vascular compromise. Alright, Ms. Queener, based on your history and this examination, it appears you are experiencing lymphedema secondary to your cancer treatment. The prolonged capillary refill and diminished pulses warrant further investigation to rule out deep vein thrombosis. I’m going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your right leg to assess for DVT. We'll also want to continue with compression therapy to help manage the swelling.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. A Doppler? Is that… painful? And compression therapy… like those tight stockings? I don’t like feeling constricted. What if it’s something really bad? I just want this swelling to go away!
DOCTOR: The ultrasound is non-invasive, Ms. Queener. It simply uses sound waves to create an image of the blood flow in your leg. It is not painful. And compression therapy is standard treatment for lymphedema; it helps to reduce swelling and improve circulation. While it may feel somewhat constricting initially, it's essential for managing your condition. We are being proactive here to ensure we rule out anything serious. I'll write you a prescription for compression stockings, class 2. I'm also going to schedule you for a Doppler ultrasound at the imaging center tomorrow morning. Do you have any transportation arranged?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Non-invasive… that’s good. And I suppose the stockings are alright if they help. Class 2… I’ll try anything at this point. Tomorrow… yes, my neighbor, Madame Dubois, she’s driving me to the market, maybe she can take me to this… imaging center too. If that’s alright? I don’t want to bother her too much. Will this take long? I really don’t like being at the doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s… acceptable, Ms. Queener. The ultrasound should take approximately 30-45 minutes. I will have the results sent to my office, and we can discuss them at your follow-up appointment next week. I will also provide you with a handout outlining proper compression stocking care and exercises to help manage your lymphedema. Here you go. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. Hopefully, it’s not too bad. And thank you for explaining things, even if I don't understand all the words. I suppose I'll go now. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? .
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Queener, you're all set. Just follow up next week as scheduled. Have a good day. .
