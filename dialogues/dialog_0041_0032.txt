DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome. I’m Dr. Polczynski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… a delicate matter, really. Something a man doesn’t usually discuss so freely. It’s… a discharge. From down there. A bit embarrassing, to be frank. I haven’t… well, it’s been happening for a little while now. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It is often a bit uncomfortable to talk about these things, and you're right to bring it up. We’re here to help, and it’s important to get to the bottom of this. “Discharge” can mean a lot of things, so let’s try to be a bit more specific. Could you describe the discharge to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Hmm. Well… it’s not… large. That much I can tell you. And it’s… yellowish, I believe. Or perhaps a pale green? It’s difficult to say with certainty, you understand. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be. And there’s… a bit of an odor. Not pleasant, I assure you. It’s not… pus, if that makes any difference. I’ve… seen pus before, and this isn’t quite that. Does that help? Honestly, I’m not very good at these sorts of… descriptions.
DOCTOR: That does help, thank you. Yellowish or pale green, with an odor… and not pus-like. Okay. And when did you first notice this discharge, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. Time seems to slip away so quickly these days, you know? Let me see… it must have been… a few weeks ago, perhaps? Or was it a month? I really couldn’t say for certain. It wasn’t sudden, not like a burst pipe. It just… appeared gradually. I noticed it when… well, when changing my trousers, naturally. It’s not something one ignores, is it? My wife, she hasn’t said anything. She probably hasn’t noticed. Or perhaps she's just being polite. Women are very good at that, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks to a month, gradually appearing. And you haven’t noticed any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Now you mention it… there’s been a slight… burning sensation. When I… relieve myself, you understand. Not terribly painful, just… uncomfortable. And perhaps a little… itching. But that could be anything, really. Dry skin, perhaps. Or just… age. Everything itches when one gets to my age. I don’t believe I’ve felt any fever, or chills, or any… swelling. No, nothing like that. I sleep as soundly as ever, thankfully. And my appetite is still quite good. Though my wife does complain I eat too much rice. But that's neither here nor there, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Burning with urination, some itching… no fever, chills, or swelling. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in my urine… Now that you mention it… it’s perhaps a bit… cloudy. Usually, it’s perfectly clear, you understand. But lately, it’s been… a little hazy. Not terribly noticeable, mind you. One doesn't examine one's urine with a magnifying glass, does one? And the color… perhaps a bit darker than usual. But I drink plenty of fluids, so that could be the reason. No blood, thankfully. I’ve never seen blood, and I sincerely hope I never do. Is that… relevant? I always try to stay well-hydrated. It's very important for… regularity.
DOCTOR: Cloudy urine and a slightly darker color… no blood. Yes, that’s relevant. Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medical history… Well, at my age, one accumulates a few… ailments, naturally. I had a touch of the flu a few years back, a rather nasty one. And my knees… they ache something awful, especially in the cold weather. The doctor said it was arthritis, or something similar. I take some pills for it, helps a little. As for diabetes or high blood pressure… I don’t think so. The doctor never mentioned anything of the sort. I see him every year for a checkup, you understand. Though he’s a young fellow, barely out of medical school. Not sure how much he truly knows. I believe my wife handles all the paperwork. I leave the medical details to her, frankly. It’s all rather… confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Arthritis in your knees, and you haven't been diagnosed with diabetes or high blood pressure. Your wife manages the medical paperwork. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me see. Yes, I had my appendix removed when I was a young man. A rather painful affair, I recall. And… oh yes, I had a cataract removed from my left eye a few years back. That improved my vision considerably, thankfully. But that was quite some time ago. And… I believe that’s it. Nothing major, thankfully. I’ve always been a strong, healthy man. Well, relatively speaking. As strong and healthy as one can be at my age, you understand. I’ve never been one for unnecessary procedures. A bit of a risk, those surgeries. One hears so many stories.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal, cataract surgery. Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… that's a bit of a complicated matter. My wife, bless her soul, is very healthy. Still gets up at dawn and makes the best ghormeh sabzi you've ever tasted. But my father… he had a weak heart, passed away when I was a boy. And my brother… he suffered from some sort of… lung ailment. Didn't take care of himself, spent too much time smoking. A foolish habit, really. No one else, really. I didn’t keep close contact with many relatives after I moved to this country. It’s a long story, best left untold. Why do you ask? Is my family's health relevant to my… condition?
DOCTOR: It can be. Knowing your family history helps us understand potential risks. Heart problems in your father and a lung ailment in your brother, okay. And you mentioned you don't smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. A foolish and dangerous habit, as I said. A waste of money and a detriment to one's health. My wife wouldn't allow it, even if I were so inclined. She’s a very sensible woman. I drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, a good Shiraz, but that’s it. Nothing excessive, you understand. I believe moderation is key to a long and healthy life. Though at my age, one can’t be entirely sure what constitutes “healthy” anymore. It’s all rather… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Good, good. No smoking, occasional wine. That’s helpful. Now, just a few more questions. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t believe so. I’ve taken various pills over the years, for my arthritis, and a few other minor ailments, but I’ve never had any… adverse reactions. A slight stomach upset on occasion, but nothing serious. My wife usually remembers what I’ve taken, she keeps a detailed list. She’s very organized, as I’ve mentioned. I’m not particularly good at remembering these things. I suppose if I had a serious allergy, I would have noticed by now, wouldn’t I? I've never needed an EpiPen or anything of that nature. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. But ask my wife, she’d know for certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, but your wife keeps a list. That’s good. Now, I’d like to examine you, if that’s alright. Just a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Examine me…? Well… I suppose it’s necessary, isn’t it? But… it’s a rather personal matter, you understand. I’m not a young man anymore. And… I haven’t been examined in quite some time. Is there any way to… minimize the discomfort? And… will it be a thorough examination? I’d prefer to… keep it brief, if possible. What exactly will you be… looking for? I’d appreciate a bit of… explanation beforehand, you understand. It’s all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Krok. It is a personal matter, and I will do my best to make you comfortable. It will be a focused exam, primarily looking at your abdomen and pelvic region. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. I’ll also need to do a brief digital rectal exam – that involves a gloved and lubricated finger to check your prostate and rectum. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it’s important for ruling out certain conditions. It will be as brief as possible, I assure you. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? Good heavens. Is that absolutely necessary? I… I don't believe I'm comfortable with that. Couldn't you… couldn't you just prescribe something? An antibiotic, perhaps? I'm sure it's just a minor infection. I've dealt with worse things in my life, you know. I’m not… I’m not accustomed to these… procedures. And frankly, I find the whole thing… degrading. I appreciate your explanation, Doctor, but I must protest. Surely there's another way? Is it absolutely necessary for a diagnosis? I’d rather… rather wait and see if it clears up on its own. Perhaps a little rest and plenty of fluids.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Krok. It is a sensitive exam, and I wouldn’t suggest it lightly. However, to properly assess the cause of your discharge, and rule out more serious possibilities like prostate issues, infection, or even bladder problems, a digital rectal exam is the most reliable first step. It allows me to feel for any abnormalities, tenderness, or swelling. While an antibiotic might temporarily alleviate symptoms, it won’t address the underlying cause, and could even mask a more serious condition, leading to complications down the line. I can understand your discomfort, but I strongly advise proceeding with the exam. I will be as gentle and respectful as possible, and explain every step beforehand. We can stop at any point if you become too uncomfortable. Would you at least allow me to listen to your abdomen and palpate it?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Very well. But just the listening and… the palpating. No… no other procedures. And you must be gentle, Doctor. I’m an old man, my body isn’t what it used to be. And explain everything, as you promised. I want to know what you’re doing, every step of the way. I don’t want any surprises. And if I ask you to stop, you will stop, understood? I’m putting my trust in you, Doctor. Don’t abuse it. But no… absolutely no touching down there. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Perfectly clear, Mr. Krok. Just listening to your abdomen and gentle palpation. I will explain everything as I go, and stop immediately if you ask me to. I appreciate your trust. Alright. Let’s start by listening to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table, and try to relax. I’m going to use my stethoscope to listen for any unusual sounds. It won't be uncomfortable, just a little cold. Your bowel sounds are present, and there’s no evidence of any immediate distension. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for tenderness. I'll start here, on your lower right side… Does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: A little… a little discomfort. It's not sharp, more of a dull ache. Especially… there. It's not terribly painful, just… unpleasant. Like a bruise, perhaps. It’s been like that for a few days now. I hadn’t really paid much attention to it, to be honest. I assumed it was just old age. And please, be gentle, Doctor. You’re pressing rather hard. It’s making me uncomfortable. What are you looking for, exactly?
DOCTOR: Alright. A dull ache in your lower abdomen. I’m palpating to check for any masses, tenderness, or signs of inflammation. It's important to rule out any potential causes for your discomfort. I’m going to try pressing a little higher now… Any pain here?
PATIENT: Yes! A little… a little more discomfort there. Not terribly painful, but… noticeable. It feels… tight. Like a knot. Or… a fullness. It’s not constant, it comes and goes. But it’s definitely more pronounced now, with you pressing. Are you finding something? What is it? Don’t keep me in suspense, Doctor. It’s making me anxious. And please, be careful. You’re prodding around quite a bit. It’s very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, I do feel a slight fullness in that area. It’s not sharply defined, but it’s there. Based on what I'm feeling, and your symptoms, it could be a number of things – a mild infection, a slight enlargement of the bladder, or even constipation. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a urinalysis – a simple urine test to check for infection or blood. I would also recommend a blood test to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Do you agree with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. I suppose it’s unavoidable, isn’t it? I don’t like it, but… if it’s necessary. A urine test and a blood test, you say? Will they be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a dinner engagement next week, I wouldn’t want to miss it. And who will explain the results to me? I’d prefer to hear it from you, Doctor, not some… young technician. And please, let's not drag this out any longer than necessary. I’m an old man, I don’t have much time to waste. Yes, alright. Do the tests. But please, hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concerns, Mr. Krok. Neither test will be painful. The urine test is a simple collection sample. We’ll give you a cup, and you’ll just provide a sample. The blood test is a quick needle prick, and we’ll send the sample to the lab. The results typically take 24-48 hours. I will personally review the results and explain them to you. I promise to get back to you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all, Doctor. Just… hurry with the results, as you promised. And thank you for your… patience. I know I’m not the easiest patient. And please, let’s hope it’s nothing serious. I’d like to enjoy my remaining years in peace. Perhaps a glass of wine tonight will help settle my nerves. Yes, a good Shiraz. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I’ll be going.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re very welcome, Mr. Krok. I’ll get the lab orders ready for you now. A glass of Shiraz sounds like a good idea. Please let the receptionist know you’re leaving, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. And again, I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Have a good evening, Mr. Krok. .
