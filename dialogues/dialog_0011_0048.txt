DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Pleasure’s all yours, I suppose. My wife, she insisted I come. Says I’ve been…forgetful. Not that I notice anything wrong, but she worries. Been getting these little…episodes, she calls them. Just moments where I’m…not quite there. Doesn't make much sense, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s very common for spouses to notice changes before the individual does, Mr. Lason. And it’s good that you’re here to discuss this with me. These “episodes” your wife has mentioned – could you describe one for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I faint or anything dramatic. It’s more…a blankness. Like someone switched off a lightbulb for a second. I’ll be talking, maybe about the job – laying tile, you know – and then…nothing. My wife says I just stare off into space. Then I come to, and I don’t remember what I was saying, or sometimes even who I was talking to. It's embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been a tile setter for forty years, very good at what I do, and now…this. It’s not like a normal senior moment, she says.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds concerning, and it’s good you’re taking it seriously. How long have these episodes been occurring, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Not…not terribly long, I don’t think. Maybe…three months? Four? It started subtly. My wife would point out I repeated a story, or asked the same question twice in a short time. I dismissed it as just being tired. Lately, though, they’ve become more frequent. And longer. Last week, I was halfway through grouting a bathroom and… completely lost track of what I was doing. She had to remind me. A woman reminding me about tiling. It’s a disgrace.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with these episodes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. I get a little… unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I always figured that was just my knees. Old age, you know? And my vision isn’t what it used to be, but I’ve been wearing glasses for years. I haven't been sick, no headaches, no trouble speaking… just these blanks. It's just… frustrating. Like my mind is skipping. It’s never happened before, not like this. And it worries my wife, which, frankly, just makes me worry more. She tends to exaggerate.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. It's good you've been able to describe these episodes and associated symptoms so clearly. Now, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Well, nothing much to report, really. I’ve always been a healthy man. Worked hard all my life, ate well, mostly. Had my appendix out when I was a boy, that’s about it. No diabetes, no heart trouble, no high blood pressure. Just…regular check-ups. My wife keeps track of all that, I mostly ignore it. She’s always fussing over me and doctors. I’m on Medicare, that’s about all you need to know. And I take a daily aspirin, the doctor told me to years ago, just to be safe. Otherwise, healthy as a horse. Or, was healthy as a horse. Before all this.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That’s helpful. And your wife keeps track of things, that’s good. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries other than your appendix removed?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No, no other surgeries. Not that I recall. Maybe a few stitches here and there from work, a scrape, a cut… nothing major. I've been careful on the job. Tile work is precise, you can’t be clumsy and expect to last forty years. No, definitely no other surgeries. My wife would have mentioned it, she remembers everything. She's got a mind like an elephant, that woman. It's almost irritating, sometimes. But I suppose it's useful in situations like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tough one. My parents are both gone now, passed away years ago. My father… he died of a stroke, I think. My mother… she had some sort of… weakness in her legs, towards the end. Couldn’t walk anymore. But I don't really know much about it, it was a long time ago, and my family isn't one for talking about those things. My siblings… I have a brother and a sister. My brother is still alive, lives in Phnom Penh, I haven’t seen him in years. He’s always been…different. A bit eccentric. I don’t know what ails him, if anything. My sister passed away a few years ago, she had… I think it was cancer, but again, I don't recall the specifics. Not a lot of detailed medical talk in my family. We just… dealt with things.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s not uncommon. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would kill me. Drink? I used to enjoy a beer or two with dinner, back in the old days. But I haven’t had a drink in… well, I don't know how long. Ten, fifteen years, maybe? Doesn't agree with me anymore. Recreational drugs? Are you serious? I'm a Cambodian tile setter, not some… hippie. No, none of that. I lead a quiet life. Work, home, sometimes the temple. That’s it. A simple, respectable life. And now…these episodes. It's ruining everything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medication… within reason, of course. My wife always checks, she's very careful about that. But no, no known allergies. I'm a pretty straightforward man, Doctor. Not much complicated about me. Just a hardworking tile setter who's suddenly losing his mind. Well, perhaps not losing it completely, but…you understand. It's unsettling.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if that's alright with you. It will involve checking your vital signs, a neurological exam to assess your memory and reflexes, and listening to your heart and lungs. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. Get it over with. Just…try not to take too long, will you? I have things to do. And, frankly, I don't like being poked and prodded. My wife will be wanting me back soon, and she’s much more thorough than you are likely to be. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. If you could please have a seat here. We’ll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. Your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your reflexes are a bit diminished in your lower extremities, which is not uncommon for someone your age, but within normal limits. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions. Could you tell me the current year?
PATIENT: The current year? Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? It's… 2025. August, isn't it? Two-thousand and twenty-five. My wife tells me everything. It's hard to forget these things when someone's constantly reminding you. But I know the year, thank you very much. I'm not completely senile yet.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. And could you please repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? What three words? You haven't said any words yet. Are you trying to trick me? This is ridiculous. I have things to do, Doctor. Just tell me what's wrong with me, instead of playing games. It's a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: You are right to point that out, Mr. Lason. I apologize for the oversight. I sometimes fall into routine. I’m assessing your overall neurological function, and I noticed a slight decrease in your reflexes. I am also evaluating your gait and balance, which appear stable at the moment. Based on our conversation and this brief examination, the episodes you are describing – these moments of blankness – are concerning. While they could be due to a number of factors, including stress, fatigue, or even normal age-related changes, it is important to rule out other potential causes. I recommend a few further investigations to get a clearer picture of what is going on. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Investigations? What kind of investigations? More poking and prodding? More questions? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not fond of this at all. I told you, I'm a healthy man. Forty years of laying tile, never a sick day. This is all… unnecessary. But my wife will insist, won't she? She always does. Fine. What do you suggest? Just make it quick, and make it easy. I don't want to spend the rest of my life in a hospital, being examined by strangers.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. We won't subject you to anything excessive. I recommend a blood test to check for any underlying deficiencies or abnormalities. And I would like to schedule an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. The MRI is the most important test, as it will give us the most detailed information. It’s a painless procedure, and takes about an hour. In addition, I’d like you to keep a detailed log of these episodes: when they occur, what you were doing beforehand, and how long they last. That will be very helpful in understanding the pattern. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… unpleasant. All that loud noise, being stuck in a tube… I don’t like confined spaces. But I suppose if it’s necessary… Fine. But I want it over with quickly. And I want my wife to come with me. She'll want to see the results anyway. And a log? Another thing to remember? This is getting ridiculous. But alright, I'll try. But don't expect miracles. I have a lot on my mind. Forty years of tile work, you know. It’s a complicated business. And make sure the results are sent to my wife. She’s the one who understands all this medical jargon anyway.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. We will make sure your wife accompanies you to the MRI. And we’ll do everything we can to make the experience as comfortable as possible. The technician is very experienced and can help you relax. I will order the blood tests and schedule the MRI for you today. The results will be sent directly to both you and your wife. In the meantime, please keep the detailed log. It doesn’t need to be perfect, just as much detail as you can remember. I’ll also give you a handout with information about these episodes, as well as some resources for support. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have a bathroom to finish, you know. People are waiting. And I need to get back to my work before I forget how to lay tile. This whole thing is… disruptive. Handouts, logs, MRIs… It's all a bit much. But alright. Just make it quick, and make it easy. And send the results to my wife. She can decipher whatever nonsense you find. Now, if you'll excuse me… I need to get home.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I understand. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you the instructions for the MRI. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And thank you for coming in today. .
