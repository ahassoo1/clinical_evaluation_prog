DOCTOR: Hi Jeannemarie, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been… coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought it best to come see someone. It’s not a lot, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, coughing up blood… that definitely warrants a check-up. It's good you came in. Just to clarify, when you say "some blood", can you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… bright red. Not dark, you understand? And… it’s mixed with my spit, when I cough. Sometimes just a little, like tiny spots. Other times… a bit more. Not a huge amount, but… enough to see. It happened maybe three times this week. It is… concerning. I do not smoke, if that is important.
DOCTOR: Okay, bright red blood, mixed with spit, three times this week… and you don’t smoke – that’s good to know. That helps us narrow things down. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the coughing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been… a little tired, maybe? More tired than usual. But I thought that was just… being a bit older, you understand? And… a small ache in my chest, sometimes. Not a bad ache, but… noticeable. It feels… deep. Is that… important, Doctor? I do not want to bother you with things that are not important.
DOCTOR: No, please don’t worry about bothering me at all. That’s what I’m here for. The tiredness and chest ache are helpful information. The ache, is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. It is not always there. More when I cough, I think. And… when I take a deep breath. It’s not a sharp pain, you understand? More… dull. Like a pressure, maybe? It’s hard to explain. I am sorry. I am not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly fine, Jeannemarie. It’s helpful to know it comes and goes, and that it's more of a dull pressure, especially when you cough or take a deep breath. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… well, a long time ago, when I was younger, I had… pneumonia. But that was many years ago. And… my husband, he… passed away last year. He had heart trouble. I have been mostly healthy, though. I go to the doctor for check-ups, you know? Nothing serious ever found. I hope that is… good news?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is good news. And I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. Pneumonia a long time ago is relevant, thank you for telling me. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never any surgeries. I have been very lucky, I think. Just the usual things, you know? Childhood illnesses. But nothing… serious enough for an operation. And… nothing since the pneumonia. I hope this… blood… isn't serious either. It just worries me so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I don’t think so. I have a little trouble with pollen, sometimes, during the spring. My eyes get itchy and watery. But that’s just a little allergy. Nothing… serious. I can take allergy medicine, and it gets better. No food allergies, and no allergies to any medicine I know of. I have never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, seasonal pollen allergy, no known medication or food allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. Nothing at all. I try to stay healthy, you see? I eat good food, I walk every day… I try to take care of myself. That is why this… blood… is so concerning. It is very unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Okay. No current medications. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, do whatever you need to do. I just want to know what is happening. I am a little nervous, but… I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll listen to your lungs first. Take a deep breath in for me… and out… Good. Now another deep breath… and out… Okay, I hear some slight… crackling in your lower lungs. It’s subtle, but it’s there. And now I’m going to listen to your heart. Your heart sounds regular, normal rhythm. Let's check your oxygen saturation now. Your oxygen is 97%, which is good. And finally, let’s take your temperature. Your temperature is 98.6, normal. I’m also going to gently press on your chest to check for any tenderness. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Um… a little, Doctor. Not a sharp pain, but… a pressure. Like you said. Just a little pressure. More when you press… there. It’s not terrible, but… I feel it. I hope that is not… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the left side of your chest with palpation. Alright. Given your symptoms – coughing up blood, the slight crackling in your lungs, and the tenderness, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a sputum sample to help determine the cause. The X-ray will give us a better look at your lungs, and the sputum sample will allow us to check for any infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. An X-ray and… a spit sample. I can do that. I just want to know what is happening. Is it… serious, Doctor? Should I be very worried? I apologize for asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Jeannemarie. That's what I'm here for. It’s too early to say definitively whether it's serious, but coughing up blood always warrants investigation. The X-ray and sputum sample will help us narrow down the possibilities. It could be something relatively minor, like a bronchitis or a small infection. But it's important to rule out anything more serious, like pneumonia or, rarely, something else. We need to get those tests done first. I'll write you an order for both, and the technician will be able to help you with them right away. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I don’t think so. Just… where do I go? And… how long will it take? I have a… a small garden, and I promised to water the flowers today. I hope this… won’t take too long. I am sorry, I am being silly. It is just… I worry easily.
DOCTOR: You’re not being silly at all, Jeannemarie. It’s perfectly normal to worry. The technician is just down the hall to your left. They’ll take you to the X-ray room and collect the sputum sample. It shouldn't take more than about 30-45 minutes total. I'll review the results as soon as they’re available and we’ll discuss them together. In the meantime, if you experience any significant chest pain, increased bleeding, or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Down the hall to the left. 30-45 minutes. And… emergency room for chest pain, bleeding, or fever. I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. I feel a little better knowing what is happening. I will go now, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions at all while you’re getting the tests done. And I’ll see you soon to discuss the results. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will.
