DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, to be honest. Waste of time, usually. But… well, I threw up a lot of blood yesterday. Not a little, a lot. Thought I’d better come get it checked before… you know. It was pretty nasty stuff. I don't know what caused it. Just… happened.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Gentz, and I appreciate you coming in despite that. Throwing up a significant amount of blood is definitely something we need to investigate. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean? It was… red. Obviously. And chunky. Like… bits in it. Not just liquid, you know? Darker red, I think, not bright. Like… old. Is that a thing? I don't spend my days looking at vomit, Doctor. I work with… well, you probably know what I do. Not exactly a pristine environment, if you catch my drift. It wasn't… bubbly. Does that make sense? Honestly, it was just… awful. Look, I'm not good at this. It was blood. A lot of it.
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Mr. Gentz. It's perfectly understandable that you're not comfortable describing this – it is a distressing experience. “Darker red, like old” is helpful information, thank you. That can suggest where the bleeding might be coming from. And the "chunky" bits… were those partially digested food, or did they look more like clots?
PATIENT: Clots, definitely clots. Not… tomatoes or anything. Smaller ones, mostly, but some were… bigger. Like, maybe the size of a grape? A big grape. And it wasn't just after throwing up, either. There was blood in it while I was, too. A lot. It started… I don't know, after I had that… that lamb curry I got from that new place downtown. Maybe that had something to do with it? It smelled a little off, now that I think about it. But I was hungry.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. The timing, and the presence of clots, are important. And the fact that it occurred after the lamb curry is something we’ll definitely consider. Do you remember approximately how long after eating the curry the vomiting started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had it around… six, maybe seven o’clock in the evening. The throwing up didn’t start ‘til… well, it was late. Probably around eleven, twelve o’clock. A few hours, anyway. I was watching the news, and then… suddenly, I felt sick. Really sick. And then… well, you know. It wasn't a quick thing, either. Went on for a while. I kept trying to ignore it, hoping it would pass, but… it just kept happening. I’m not a complainer, Doctor. Usually. But this… this was bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, a four to five-hour delay is significant. And the fact that it persisted is concerning. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to ask you a few more questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever had any problems with ulcers, heartburn, or acid reflux?
PATIENT: Ulcers? No. Never been told I had ulcers. Heartburn… sometimes, yeah. After spicy food, mostly. But nothing major. I just take some… some antacid tablets. The pink ones. You know, the ones everyone takes. Doesn't really solve it, just… takes the edge off. As for that… acid reflux thing… I get a bit of indigestion sometimes. Especially if I eat late. But I don't really worry about it. Old age, probably. And I don’t exactly have a fancy diet, if you catch my drift. I eat what I can, when I can. This whole thing probably just upset my stomach. But the blood… that’s what’s worrying me. A lot of blood.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And you’re right to be concerned about the amount of blood. To rule out other possibilities, I’m going to need to ask about your past medical history a little more thoroughly. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think… not really. Not for anything serious, anyway. When my wife… when she passed, I spent a few days in the hospital with her. But that wasn’t me being sick, you understand? I was just… there. Before that… I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. They put a cast on it. But that was ages ago. Nothing… major. No surgeries, no long-term illnesses, nothing like that. I’m usually… pretty healthy, actually. Tough as nails, my wife used to say. But this… this blood thing is throwing me off. It's not normal, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Gentz, throwing up a large amount of blood is definitely not normal. It's good that you don't have any significant medical history, but that doesn't mean we can ignore this. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to need to perform a physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, check your vital signs, and… I'll also need to take a look at your stool sample, if you don’t mind. It will help us determine if there's any ongoing bleeding in your digestive tract. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A stool sample? Seriously? Look, Doctor, I’m not thrilled about any of this, to be honest. But if you think it’s necessary… fine. Just… tell me exactly what you need me to do. And try to be quick about it. I have… things to get back to. This whole thing is a waste of my time, but if I’m going to be poked and prodded, I want it over with. And can we just skip the prodding part if possible? I'm a private man, Doctor. And I'm not comfortable with… unnecessary examinations. Just tell me what you need for the… sample.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I completely understand your concerns, and I assure you I'll be as efficient and respectful as possible. We will absolutely skip any unnecessary examinations. The stool sample is simply to check for the presence of blood, which can indicate the source of the bleeding. I'll provide you with a container and instructions, and you can collect it in the restroom. It's a relatively simple process. First, however, I’d like to listen to your abdomen and check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. It will give me a baseline assessment of your condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. I’m not fond of being touched, Doctor. And please, don’t ask me a lot of personal questions. I’m here because I threw up blood, not because I want to discuss my life story. My wife… well, never mind. Just do what you need to do and let me get out of here. Blood pressure, pulse… whatever. Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I will be as quick and efficient as possible. This cuff will tighten around your arm for a moment, and I'll be listening with my stethoscope. Just try to relax. Your blood pressure is 140 over 90. Your pulse is 88 and regular. Now, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll be using the stethoscope to listen for any unusual sounds. Your abdomen sounds… normal, but slightly tender in the upper left quadrant. No significant bowel sounds are noted. I’m also going to quickly check your temperature. Your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, regarding the stool sample…
