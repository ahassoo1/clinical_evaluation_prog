DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don't even know why I'm here. My husband made me come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Your husband contacted the office regarding elevated blood pressure readings?
PATIENT: Elevated? That sounds…dramatic. He just checks it sometimes with one of those things you strap on your arm. He gets fixated on numbers, always has. It's usually fine. He just…panicked this time. Said I needed to see someone right away.
DOCTOR: I see. And when did he first notice these… elevated readings, Ms. Dudney?
PATIENT: About a week ago, I guess. He was testing it every day after that, which is just… irritating. He kept asking if I felt okay, like I wouldn't know if something was wrong. Honestly, I feel perfectly normal.
DOCTOR: And have you ever been diagnosed with hypertension before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've always been…healthy. We don't really go to doctors much. It's usually just for check-ups, and even those we skip if we're busy. My grandmother had her own remedies, and they worked just fine for her.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin sometimes. The gummy kind, because I don't like swallowing pills. And…sometimes I drink chamomile tea if I can't sleep, but that's it. My husband gets all those fancy health things, but I don't bother with them. They taste awful.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Ms. Dudney?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know of. I eat everything. My husband tries to get me to eat more…organic things, but I don't see the point. It all tastes the same. He's always fussing over labels. It's exhausting, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And could you briefly describe your typical daily diet?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you're asking about food? Look, I work. A lot. I'm a civil engineering tech, so I'm usually on site. Lunch is whatever's fastest - a sandwich, sometimes fast food. Dinner is usually whatever my husband makes, which is…usually okay. I don't spend my life planning meals, okay? It's not exactly a hobby of mine.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, I don't really…keep track of that stuff. My grandmother lived to be, like, ninety, so I guess we have good genes. My mom…she had some problems, but I don't remember what. It wasn't anything serious, I think. Everyone in my family is pretty…stubborn and works a lot. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. My husband doesn't even like alcohol. We're both very…responsible people. We have jobs, okay? We don't have time for…that. It's a waste of time and money.
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we proceed, Ms. Dudney, I'm going to need to take some basic vital signs. It's standard procedure. Then, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps perform a brief physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have a deadline to meet this afternoon, and honestly, I'm wasting a perfectly good day sitting here. Just…be quick about it.
DOCTOR: If you'll please have a seat. I'll start with your blood pressure, as that is the primary concern. Please remain still and keep your arm relaxed.
PATIENT: Whatever. Just…don't poke me too hard. I bruise easily. And try not to take too long.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is… elevated. 152/98. And your pulse is 88. I will now listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath. Breathing appears normal, heart sounds regular, though slightly strong. I'd also like to check your reflexes, if you don't mind.
PATIENT: Ugh. Strong? What does that even mean? Is that bad? Look, I told you, I feel fine. My husband just worries too much. It's probably just stress from work. Everything is always a big deal with him. Just tell me if it's something I need to worry about, and if not, can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: While your physical examination is unremarkable, your blood pressure reading is consistently elevated. We need to investigate this further. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We also need to repeat blood pressure readings at different times of the day, ideally at home with a blood pressure monitor. I will provide a referral to a lab for the blood work and a prescription for a home blood pressure monitor.
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? This is ridiculous. So I have to poke my finger and take more readings? My husband is going to be thrilled. Just…can't you just give me something to take? A pill or something? I don’t have time for all of this. Is this going to be expensive?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, simply prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis is irresponsible. We need to understand why your blood pressure is elevated before initiating any treatment. It could be a variety of factors. As for cost, your insurance should cover the majority of these tests, but I recommend you verify the coverage details with your provider. I will also provide a referral to a cardiologist for a consultation, should your blood pressure remain elevated despite lifestyle modifications. We need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. I will have the lab and cardiology referrals printed for you now. Do you have any questions regarding these referrals?
PATIENT: Ugh. A cardiologist? Really? This is getting out of hand. Fine. Just…can I go now? I have things to do. And honestly, don't expect me to jump through a million hoops. I'm a busy person. I'll…think about it. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Dudney. Please schedule these tests at your earliest convenience. I strongly advise you to follow these recommendations for your health. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headaches, please seek immediate medical attention. Here is a copy of your test results request form for your records. I wish you a good day. .
