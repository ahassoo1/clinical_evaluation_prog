DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look here, Doc, I ain't got all day. I see an advertisement, alright? About… fixin’ things. I want somethin’ fixin’. It’s my belly. Too big. Not happy with it. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: “Fixin’ things,” alright. Well, that’s… certainly a way to put it. When you say “too big,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What kinda question is that? It’s big! Like a… a barrel. You ever see a barrel, Doc? It sticks out. And it wobbles when I walk. It ain’t right. I used to be… tighter. Stronger. Now I just… jiggle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand. You’ve noticed a change in your abdominal area – an increase in size and some… instability. And you’d like to address it. Has this change been sudden, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually. Years, I suppose. Since my wife… passed. After that, everything went downhill, you know? Used to eat proper, good food. Now… well, I eat what’s easy. And plenty of it. Not excercisin' like I used to neither. Used to build houses, you know? Pile drivin’ takes it outta ya. Now I mostly sit.
DOCTOR: Right, so a gradual change coinciding with a shift in lifestyle and diet after your wife’s passing. And you’ve noticed a decrease in physical activity. Any other changes you've noticed alongside this – perhaps changes in your appetite, any pain or discomfort in your abdomen, or issues with your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. Just… uncomfortable. When I bend over. Gotta hold my belly sometimes. Bowel movements… regular enough. A little slow, maybe. But I take somethin’ for that. Used to be regular as clockwork, but… things change. Like I said. Everything changes.
DOCTOR: Alright. So discomfort with bending, and you manage some constipation with medication. What medication are you taking for that, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Don’t rightly remember the name. Some kinda… syrup. Brown, sweet. Bought it at the pharmacy down the road. The lady knows me, she always gets it for me. Says it’s good for “keepin’ things movin’”. That’s all I need to know, really. I ain't a doctor, I just take what works.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's good that you're addressing the constipation, but knowing the specific medication is helpful. We’ll try to get that information later. Now, let’s talk about your diet a little more. You mentioned eating “easy” food. Can you give me a typical day’s worth of meals and snacks?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I ain’t keepin’ a food diary. I eat! That’s what I do. Breakfast… sometimes toast. Maybe a little fruit. Lunch is usually somethin’ quick. Sandwich, maybe. And dinner… well, whatever’s easiest. Lotta rice and beans, sometimes chicken. And I like a little cake with my tea. What kinda answer you expectin’? I’m an old man, not a rabbit.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I understand you don't have a detailed record. Just a general idea is fine. Rice, beans, chicken, some fruit, toast, and cake. So, a fairly carbohydrate-heavy diet. Now, have you experienced any weight loss recently, or has it been mainly an increase in abdominal size?
PATIENT: No weight loss. Definitely gain. Clothes gettin’ tighter. Belt had to go up a notch. Two notches, actually. It’s all in the belly, though. Arms and legs… still skinny as a rake. That’s why I wanna fix the belly! Looks ridiculous. Like a… a watermelon under my shirt.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, weight gain concentrated in the abdominal area. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical examination, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Palpate? What’s that mean? You gonna poke my belly? Look here, Doc, I ain’t fond of bein’ poked and prodded. I’m an old man, I got sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: “Palpate” just means I’m going to gently feel your abdomen to check for any abnormalities. It’s a standard part of a medical examination, Mr. Trendler. It helps me understand what might be causing the changes you’re experiencing. I assure you, I’ll be as gentle as possible. If it becomes uncomfortable at any point, please let me know. It's important to rule out anything serious. Now, if you could just lie back on the examination table, we can get started.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't go diggin' around in there. And be quick about it. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie on your back with your knees bent, that would be perfect. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly faint. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Just relax. Your abdomen is quite distended, and there's some firmness in the lower quadrants. No tenderness to the touch. I also notice some mild fluid retention in your ankles. Any history of swelling in your feet or ankles before?
PATIENT: Fluid retention? You mean my feet get a little puffy sometimes? Yeah, especially at the end of the day. Been happenin’ for years. Never bothered me much. Thought it was just old age. Always been a bit of a water weight problem, to be honest. But like I said, never bothered me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, the distended abdomen, the firmness, and the fluid retention, combined with your dietary changes and the history of constipation… it's suggestive of a few possibilities. It could be something relatively benign, like a build-up of gas or a change in gut flora, but it's important to rule out anything more serious, such as ascites – a build-up of fluid in the abdominal cavity. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to order some blood tests. We’ll check your liver function, kidney function, and electrolyte levels. I also recommend an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your liver, gallbladder, and other abdominal organs. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ultrasound? Now you want to poke inside me? Look, Doc, I ain't keen on all this fancy stuff. I just want somethin' to fix my belly. Not a whole lotta tests and proddin'. Can't you just give me somethin' to take? A pill or somethin'?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration. But I can’t simply prescribe a “pill” without knowing the underlying cause of the problem. It would be irresponsible – and potentially dangerous. We need to identify what’s causing your abdominal distension and firmness before we can determine the appropriate course of treatment. The blood tests and ultrasound are necessary to do that. Think of it like this: if your car isn't starting, you wouldn't just throw random parts at it, would you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Blood tests and... whatever that other thing is. But I ain't comin' back for a whole lotta follow-ups. And I want somethin' to take now to make me feel better. Even if it's just a placebo. Just somethin.
DOCTOR: Alright. I can prescribe a mild stool softener to help with the constipation, which may alleviate some of the discomfort. However, I want to be clear: this is simply to manage the symptoms, not to address the underlying cause. We still need to proceed with the blood tests and ultrasound. I’m also going to give you a referral to a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive disorders. They’ll be able to interpret the test results and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan. I’ll have the lab requisition and the referral printed out for you now. Please schedule the blood tests as soon as possible, and contact the gastroenterologist’s office to book an appointment. Do you have any questions about these instructions?
PATIENT: Gastro... what? Look, Doc, I just wanna fix my belly. All this fancy doctor talk is makin’ my head spin. Just tell me when I can get the pill. And I don't want no more proddin’ and pokin’. And… one more thing. Can I get a doctor's note for work? Just sayin' I was here.
DOCTOR: “Gastroenterologist” is a specialist in digestive issues. As for the pill, you'll need the test results first. I've prescribed a stool softener to help with the constipation in the meantime. And yes, I can certainly provide a note for work. Here you go. It states you were here for a medical consultation today. Now, please schedule those tests and follow up with the gastroenterologist as soon as possible. I don’t want to see this problem worsen. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Nah. I think that’s all. Just… don’t expect me back anytime soon. And tell them fancy doctors to be gentle. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Just remember, Mr. Trendler, early detection is key. .
