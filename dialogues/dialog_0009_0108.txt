DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, but… well, things came up. It’s my stomach. Been bleeding. Not a little bit, either. It’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I understand. Bleeding from the stomach is definitely something we need to investigate. It’s good you came in. When you say “not a little bit,” could you describe that a bit more for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want to know, exactly? It's… blood. Coming out of where it comes out. Look, I’m not a doctor, okay? It wasn’t just a drop or two. It was enough to… notice. And it's happened a couple of times now, over the last week or so. Not every day, but enough to worry a reasonable person. Is that detailed enough for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. It sounds concerning that you’ve noticed a significant amount of blood over the past week. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me what the blood looks like?
PATIENT: What does blood look like? It’s… red. Obviously. But it wasn’t bright red, like when you cut yourself. It was… darker. Sort of brownish, almost blackish. And it wasn't all liquid, either. There were… bits in it. You know. Like… clumps. Honestly, I don't need to paint you a picture, do I? It wasn't pretty.
DOCTOR: No, you’re right, you don’t. That description – darker blood with clumps – is important information. It suggests the blood may have been partially digested. Have you also experienced any other symptoms along with the bleeding?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I've been tired. A lot. More than usual, and I'm always tired. And… my stomach's been upset, obviously. Aching. Feels… empty, even when I've eaten. And I haven’t been… regular, if you know what I mean. Look, is this going somewhere? What’s wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Tiredness, stomach ache, feeling empty, and changes in your bowel habits are all things we need to consider. To get a more complete picture, let's go through some other questions. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Look, I haven’t been trying to lose weight. I eat plenty. Maybe I haven’t been gaining weight, but that’s just because… well, things haven’t been great since my wife passed. My appetite hasn’t been the same. But I haven’t exactly been trying to slim down, if that's what you're asking. I wouldn't say I've lost a significant amount, but… the clothes might be a little looser. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That does count, thank you. Any unintentional weight loss, even if it seems small, is worth noting. Now, have you been experiencing any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Vomiting? No. Not really. I felt a little queasy once or twice, but nothing… dramatic. Just a bit of a churning in my stomach. I haven’t actually… thrown up. I don’t have the stomach for vomiting, if you know what I mean. It's… unpleasant. I'm a practical man. I don't deal well with messes.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like ulcers, gastritis, or anything else related to your stomach or digestive system?
PATIENT: Gastritis? Ulcers? Look, I’ve lived a long life. I’ve had the usual aches and pains. I had a bad case of heartburn a few years back, but nothing… serious. The doctor gave me some pills, and it went away. I don't remember any official diagnoses or anything like that. I'm not one for… fussing over doctors and hospitals. I've always been a strong man. I usually just… tough it out.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see… nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, I suppose. A long time ago. And… my wife had a hip replacement a few years back, but that was her, not me. Nothing else comes to mind. A few stitches here and there, but nothing a proper man would write home about. Is this getting us anywhere?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? My father… he wasn’t a healthy man. He had… problems. Heart trouble, mostly. And my mother… she died young, of something. I don't remember exactly what. It was a long time ago. As for other relatives... they all just sort of… died. Old age, mostly. It’s not like anyone in my family lived to be a hundred. We weren’t a family known for our long lifespans, if that’s what you're asking. No one with stomach trouble that I recall.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that even mean? I live alone now, obviously. Since my wife… passed. I used to work at the crematory, as you probably know. It’s… a practical job. Keeps you grounded. And… I don't really do much. I watch the news. Read the paper. Try to keep busy. I don't drink. Never have. And I don’t smoke. Is this all just… routine? What are you trying to find out?
DOCTOR: It's all part of getting a complete picture, Mr. Gentz. It helps me understand what might be going on. Now, do you take any medications regularly, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't believe in them. I took some antacids for the heartburn, like I said, but that was years ago. I prefer to… deal with things myself. I've always been a strong man. I don't need pills to tell me what to do. And supplements? No. That's just… nonsense. I get everything I need from my food. Simple, practical things. You know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to feel your abdomen. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Examine me? Look, I’m not a fan of being poked and prodded. But… fine. Go ahead. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And be gentle, alright? I'm not as young as I used to be. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Okay. I’m noting some tenderness in your upper abdomen, particularly on the left side. There's some guarding as well, which means your muscles are tightening when I press. It's not severe, but it's something to note. I don’t feel any masses, but it is definitely tender.
PATIENT: There is some discomfort, yes. I told you. It’s been aching. Especially up there, on the left. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. And it’s worse when I eat. What does that mean? Is it serious? You’re making me nervous now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz. It’s good you're telling me about the pain. The tenderness and guarding, along with the pain worsening with eating, are concerning. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. And I also recommend a stool test to check for blood in your stool and to rule out any infections. Additionally, given your symptoms, I think a CT scan of your abdomen would be very helpful to visualize your organs and see if we can identify the source of the bleeding and tenderness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… stool tests… a scan? Look, I don’t like any of this. It sounds expensive. And… invasive. I don’t have insurance, you know. I’m a simple man, I don’t need all these fancy tests. But… if it's the only way to find out what's wrong… fine. Do what you have to do. But be quick about it, alright? And tell me how much it’s going to cost before you do anything. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Gentz. I will absolutely work with the billing department to get you an estimate of the costs before we proceed with any tests. We also have resources available to help with financial assistance if needed. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to make this as affordable as possible. Now, regarding the tests, the blood tests will give us information about your overall health, including your red blood cell count, which can indicate if you’ve lost a significant amount of blood. The stool test will help us rule out any infections or other causes of bleeding. And the CT scan will provide detailed images of your organs, allowing us to identify any potential problems, such as ulcers, inflammation, or masses. I’m going to order these tests right away, and the lab and imaging departments will contact you to schedule appointments. Would you be able to provide a sample for the stool test today?
PATIENT: A sample… today? Look, I just had breakfast. That’s not going to work. Can’t I do that later? After… things settle? And I suppose I can go to the lab and get poked and prodded later too. Just… don’t expect me to be happy about it. I really don’t like all this fuss. It’s just… a stomach ache. It can’t be that serious. Just get it over with. The quicker it’s done, the better. And please, send me the bill estimate before you do anything. I need to know what I’m getting into.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz. I understand your frustration. Yes, you can collect the stool sample later today. The lab will provide you with instructions and a collection kit. It's best to collect it after a bowel movement, and they'll provide specific guidance on how to do that properly. And I've already put in a request for a cost estimate from the billing department. They should be able to provide you with a breakdown of the expected costs within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I want to emphasize the importance of following up with these tests. While it could be something minor, the bleeding and tenderness are concerning, and it’s important to rule out anything serious. I’ll also give you some instructions to take home regarding managing your symptoms while we wait for the test results. I recommend avoiding any foods that irritate your stomach, such as spicy or acidic foods, and staying hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Avoid spicy food? I barely eat anything spicy. And I drink plenty of water. It’s not like I’m doing anything wrong. Look, all this fuss… it’s just a waste of time. But fine. I’ll collect the sample. And I’ll avoid… whatever it is you told me to avoid. But if it turns out to be nothing serious, I’m sending you the bill for all this. What exactly are you looking for, anyway? What’s the worst that could be wrong?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gentz. It’s good you’re asking. The possibilities range from relatively minor issues like gastritis or ulcers to more serious conditions like inflammation of the intestines or, rarely, a mass. That’s why it’s important to get a thorough workup. We need to rule out the more serious possibilities before we can determine the cause of your symptoms. The tests will help us differentiate between these possibilities. The blood tests will look for signs of infection or anemia. The stool test will check for blood and any signs of infection. And the CT scan will provide detailed images of your organs, allowing us to identify any abnormalities. I will be in touch as soon as the test results are available, and we will discuss the findings and develop a plan of action. Do you have any questions about collecting the stool sample or anything else I've discussed today?
PATIENT: No. I think I’ve heard enough for one day. Just… tell me where to go to get poked and prodded, and I’ll do it. The sooner this is over, the better. I just want to feel normal again. I suppose I should be going now. Don’t expect me to be happy about any of this. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz. I understand. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, and the imaging center is at 456 Oak Avenue. The lab and imaging center staff will have all the necessary information about your orders. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day, Mr. Gentz. .
