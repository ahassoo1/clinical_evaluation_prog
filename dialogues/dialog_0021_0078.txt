DOCTOR: Right, Ms. Pitzel. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Havird. Well, to put it simply, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, or a jumpstart, as I wrote on the form. I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately, and I'm hoping you can help me figure out what that means.
DOCTOR: "Stuck," you say. Right. That's…vague. Let's try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I understand. It's hard to explain. It’s not any one thing, exactly. Just…low energy, I suppose. Not sick, not depressed…just…less. Less enthusiastic, less able to do the things I used to enjoy. And my sleep has been…off. Not terrible, but not restful. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: “Low energy” and “off” sleep. Plenty of people feel that way. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It’s been…gradual, really. I’d say at least six months, maybe longer. It started slowly, just feeling a little more tired than usual, but it’s definitely gotten worse in the last three or four months. I hadn't really paid much attention before, to be honest. Life gets busy, you know? But now…now it’s starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Six months. And has anything changed in those six months?
PATIENT: Not dramatically, no. My husband, Ricardo, and I celebrated our twentieth anniversary in April, which was lovely, but stressful to plan. And my daughter, Sofia, started a new job—she’s a teacher—so there’s been a lot of talk about that. She’s doing well, thankfully. Oh! And I did start helping a friend renovate her kitchen…a lot of lifting and painting. But nothing major that I can think of. Why do you ask? Is that important?
DOCTOR: Everything's important, Ms. Pitzel. It helps me get the bigger picture. Let’s talk about your sleep a little more. You said it’s “off”. Can you describe that?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I don’t have trouble falling asleep, usually. It’s more…staying asleep. I wake up several times during the night. Not every night, but often. And then I have trouble getting back to sleep. I’ll lie there for a while, thinking…worrying, sometimes. And even when I do sleep through, I don’t wake up feeling refreshed. Just…tired. Does that make sense? It’s a bit frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: Fragmented sleep. Alright. Do you snore, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Oh! Um…I don’t think so. Ricardo hasn’t mentioned it. He's a very sound sleeper, though, so he might not notice. I don't usually wake up feeling like I've stopped breathing, if that's what you mean. I don't know. I've never really paid attention to it. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: It could be, Ms. Pitzel. Many things could be. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Not really. A little stiffness in my lower back sometimes, after helping my friend with the renovations, but nothing I can’t manage with a hot bath. No chronic pain, no. Nothing like that. I do get occasional headaches, but they're infrequent and mild. Mostly just tension headaches, I think. From stress, probably.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any major illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Let me see… My mother had high blood pressure, and she had a stroke a few years before she passed away. My father had diabetes, but he managed it well for many years. Ricardo’s mother had arthritis, and his father…he had heart problems. Nothing really close, though. Not siblings or anything. Just parents. Why do you ask? Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: It's always relevant, Ms. Pitzel. Now, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I am terribly allergic to cats. It's quite bad, actually. And I get hay fever during the spring. Otherwise, no. No food allergies, no medication allergies. Just cats and pollen. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, over-the-counter or otherwise?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I try to avoid medications if I can. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if it gets really bad. But nothing regular. I prefer to try and manage things naturally, if possible. A good night’s sleep, healthy food, that sort of thing. Although, as we've established, the sleep isn’t cooperating lately.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a quick listen to your heart and lungs, just to be sure. Then we can talk about some potential…options. If you'll just lie back, please.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor Havird. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. A little rapid breathing, but not concerning at this point. Blood pressure is 130/85. Weight is…rather low for your height, Ms. Pitzel. 115 pounds. Anything change recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, yes, actually. I have been trying to…watch my weight a bit, lately. Ricardo is always telling me I should. I’ve been trying to eat a little healthier, and…well, maybe I’ve been cutting back a bit too much. It hasn’t been intentional, just…trying to be mindful. I do have a bit of a sweet tooth, you know? It's hard to resist a good pastry. Is that a problem? I haven't been feeling ill, just…tired. And perhaps a little stressed.
DOCTOR: Stress and restrictive eating… Alright. Now, a few questions about your… daily habits. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, not much, Doctor Havird. Just a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Ricardo enjoys a good beer, but I prefer wine. And not every night, mind you. Perhaps a couple of times a week. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I don’t think it’s contributing to my tiredness, if that’s what you’re thinking.
DOCTOR: Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Never. I can’t stand the smell of it. My mother smoked when I was a child, and it was awful. I promised myself I’d never touch the stuff. And I haven’t. No, never. I do try to be healthy, you know? I eat a balanced diet, I exercise when I can…I just haven’t been feeling myself lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. It sounds like you’re doing everything right, which is…frustrating. Given your symptoms, low weight, and reported restriction, we need to rule out a few things. I'm going to order some blood work: a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. It will give us a better picture of what’s going on. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds…sensible. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure out what’s wrong. I just want to feel like myself again. When can I get the blood work done? And will I need an appointment?
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: The lab is just down the hall. You don’t need an appointment. They'll take your insurance information. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up. It usually takes a few days. Here’s a requisition form. .
