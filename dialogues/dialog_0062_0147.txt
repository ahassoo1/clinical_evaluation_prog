DOCTOR: Hi Amy, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. That's good you're getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… hard to describe. It feels firm, not really painful, just… present. I noticed it maybe a month or so ago, and it doesn’t seem to be getting much bigger, but it hasn’t gone away either. It's located… sort of in the center, a few inches down from my belly button, I would say. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A firm, non-painful lump in the center of your lower abdomen, a few inches below your belly button. And it's been there for about a month, staying roughly the same size. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, appetite, or weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My appetite has been normal, I suppose. No real changes there. As for my weight, I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes haven’t felt any tighter or looser, so I assume it's stayed about the same. Bowel habits… no, nothing noticeably different. Everything seems… regular, if you will. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Amy. That's helpful information. "Regular" is good to know. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms at all – any fever, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, or any pain anywhere else, even if it doesn't seem related?
PATIENT: No fever, no nausea or vomiting. I have been feeling a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days? It’s hard to say if that’s related or just… life. No pain anywhere else, no. Just the… awareness of the lump. It doesn’t hurt to touch, but sometimes I just feel it, you know? A sort of pressure, maybe?
DOCTOR: I understand. A feeling of pressure is good to know. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen, then I'll gently feel around to assess the lump and surrounding areas. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just relax and take some deep breaths. Okay… I’m feeling a firm mass, approximately 3 centimeters in diameter, in the midline, about 5 centimeters below your umbilicus. It’s not particularly tender to the touch, and it doesn't seem to shift position easily. There's no guarding or rebound tenderness. Skin is normal overlying the area. No obvious hernias detected. Okay, Amy, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, we need to investigate this further to determine what's going on. Given the location and characteristics, there are several possibilities, and imaging would be the next step. I'm thinking a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis would give us the best view. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If that’s what you recommend, then I’m happy to proceed. What does that involve, exactly? And… is it something that requires a lot of preparation? I hope it isn’t too expensive… my Medicare coverage can be a little… complicated.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s smart to think about those things. A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your abdomen and pelvis. It's a relatively quick procedure – usually about 20-30 minutes. For this particular scan, you’ll likely need to drink a contrast solution beforehand to help highlight the structures in your abdomen. It tastes a little metallic, but it’s not harmful. As for cost, Medicare should cover the majority of it, but you're right to be cautious. We have a financial counselor who can help you navigate the coverage details and estimate your out-of-pocket expenses. I'll go ahead and order the scan, and then we can schedule a consultation with the counselor right after this appointment. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Scheduling a consultation with the financial counselor would be very helpful. I appreciate you thinking of that. So, the contrast solution… will that make me feel sick? I’ve heard some things about those kinds of things. And is there anything I need to do to prepare beforehand – fasting, anything like that?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern. The contrast solution can cause some mild side effects in some people – maybe a metallic taste in your mouth or a warm sensation when it’s administered. Rarely, people experience nausea or diarrhea, but it's usually mild and resolves quickly. We'll have you drink plenty of fluids afterwards to help flush it out. For preparation, you will need to fast for at least 4 hours before the scan, and we'll want you to drink a specific amount of clear liquids in the hours leading up to it to make sure you’re well-hydrated. The radiology department will provide you with detailed instructions when they schedule the appointment – I'll also make sure to send a copy to your primary care physician’s office for their records. Does that address your concerns about the scan?
PATIENT: Yes, that does, thank you. Knowing about the fasting and the clear liquids is good. And knowing they’ll give me detailed instructions is reassuring. So, you'll order the scan and schedule the financial counselor? Then I’ll just wait to hear from someone to set up the actual appointment?
DOCTOR: Exactly. I’ll go ahead and put in the orders for both the CT scan and the consultation with our financial counselor right now. You should receive calls within the next 24-48 hours to schedule both appointments. Okay, everything is submitted. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like pain, fever, nausea, or significant changes in your bowel habits – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. You've been very thorough and explained everything clearly. Thank you for your time and for taking my concerns seriously. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you think of any other questions. I'll see you again after the scan, and we can discuss the results. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Goodbye.
