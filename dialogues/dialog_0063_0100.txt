DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it's about a test, I think? Something they wanted me to do. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. Something about making sure I’m… alright. It was the insurance, I believe. Medicare, you know? They sent a notice.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare. Always something with Medicare. A test… Right. And you have no recollection what sort of test this was regarding?
PATIENT: No, not really. It was a form, a long one, and I filled it out… or someone helped me fill it out. Something about… substances, I think? Maybe checking what I’m taking? I take a little something for my nerves, but that’s about it. It’s all a bit fuzzy, I’m afraid. It was a drug test, wasn’t it? Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: A drug test. Well. That is… unusual. Though not entirely unexpected these days. Let’s try to clarify. You mentioned something for your nerves. What exactly is this medication?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It’s a little blue pill. Small, you know? Doctor Dubois prescribed it, a while back. He retired, I think. Now, what was the name… it starts with a ‘V’… or maybe a ‘B’? Oh dear. It helps me sleep, mostly. And keeps the… the jitters away. I’ve been taking it for… years, I suppose. A long time.
DOCTOR: A small blue pill… prescribed by a doctor who has since retired. Wonderful. And you have absolutely no recollection of the name?
PATIENT: No, I really don’t. I wish I did! It’s so frustrating. I used to be so good with names and dates, but… it just slips away now. I take it every night, that’s all I know for sure. Maybe if I looked at the bottle… but I didn’t bring it with me. Is it important to know the name? Will it change the test?
DOCTOR: It is always important to know what medications a patient is taking, Ms. Hughston. Especially when undergoing medical evaluations. We need to determine if this medication could be affecting the results of whatever test Medicare has requested. Let me see if Dr. Dubois left any records… though I doubt it. These things are rarely kept up-to-date.
PATIENT: Oh, I understand. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. It’s just… things get lost in the shuffle, you know? It’s been a long time. I just want to make sure everything is alright, and get this test over with. Is it a blood test? Or a… a urine test? I really don’t like giving samples.
DOCTOR: It appears Dr. Dubois prescribed you Valium, 5mg, as needed for anxiety. And yes, it is a urine test, Ms. Hughston. Standard procedure. I’m afraid your preferences are… irrelevant. Now, let’s proceed. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Valium… yes, that sounds right! That’s it! Oh, good, we figured it out. No allergies, no. Not that I know of, anyway. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. Nothing bothers me, thankfully. Just… forgetful, that’s all. So, the test now? Is it… complicated?
DOCTOR: No, the test is not complicated. It simply requires a urine sample. The nurse will provide you with a cup and instructions. And please, try to remember the last time you took your Valium, as that information is… vital. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. The last time… let me think. Yesterday, I think. Yes, yesterday evening, before bed. Just the one pill, like usual. Should I go wait in the waiting room, then? Or… do I wait here? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Yes, please wait in the waiting room. The nurse will call you when she is ready. And try not to… wander off. You may go now.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. I will. .
