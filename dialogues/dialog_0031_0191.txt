DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It's good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I came in to get tested for HIV. I wanted to get it checked, just to be sure, you understand. It’s… a personal matter, but I felt it was important.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. I understand completely. It’s very responsible of you to prioritize your health and get tested. It's a perfectly valid reason to come in, and I assure you, everything we discuss will be kept confidential. Before we proceed with the testing, could you tell me a little more about why you’re concerned about potential exposure?
PATIENT: That’s good to hear about the confidentiality, Doctor. Thank you. Hmm… well, it’s not that I think I’ve been exposed, precisely. It’s just… my husband and I, we’ve been married a long time, over forty years now. And, well, recently we’ve been… reconnecting, shall we say? More intimacy than we’ve had in quite a while. And it just occurred to me… it’s been a long time, and I hadn't thought about getting checked before. Better safe than sorry, you know? It’s just a precaution.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shaub. That’s very thoughtful of you, and it’s always wise to be proactive about your health, especially with changes in activity. It’s good you’re considering this. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your and your husband’s medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, my husband, his name is Olu, he’s generally quite healthy for his age. He has a bit of high blood pressure, but he takes medication for it and it’s well-controlled. He sees his doctor regularly. As for myself… I had a bout of malaria a few years back when we visited Nigeria, but I recovered fully. Other than that, I haven’t had any serious illnesses. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, you know? I haven't really had many consistent check-ups though, to be honest. It's always been 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it,' I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Shaub. It’s helpful to have that background information. And it’s good to hear that your husband's blood pressure is managed. Now, regarding your past medical history, you mentioned malaria. Were you treated here in the United States, or were you treated while visiting Nigeria?
PATIENT: I was treated when I was still in Nigeria, Doctor. We were visiting family, and I went to a local doctor there. It was quite a stressful experience, being ill so far from home, but thankfully I recovered well after a course of medication. It was several years ago now, perhaps five or six years. I don’t recall the exact details of the treatment, I’m afraid. It all happened rather quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub. That’s good to know. And it’s understandable that you don’t recall all the details after some time. To continue, have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions? No, Doctor, I haven’t. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never needed one, and I don’t believe I’ve ever been in a situation where one was necessary. I’ve always been quite healthy, as I said. Are you asking about that because of the test? Is it something important?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Ms. Shaub. Blood transfusions are a potential risk factor for certain infections, so it’s important to ask. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication before. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times over the years for minor infections, but never anything serious. I’m quite fortunate that way, I suppose. It’s a blessing, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Shaub. So, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not taking any medications at the moment. Just the usual… a bit of ibuprofen for aches and pains occasionally, but that's it. Nothing regularly, and certainly no vitamins or herbal supplements. I prefer to just… tough it out, usually. I’m not much for taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shaub. No regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen. That’s helpful to know. Before we proceed with the testing, I want to ask a few more sensitive questions, if you don’t mind. These are important for assessing your risk. Have you ever shared needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… a very direct question, Doctor. No, absolutely not. Never. I've never used needles, and I certainly wouldn't share one with anyone. That's… quite unthinkable. Is that a common concern? I hope I'm not answering incorrectly… I just want to be honest.
DOCTOR: You are not answering incorrectly at all, Ms. Shaub, and I appreciate your honesty. It's a standard question, and it's good that we're covering all bases. It's simply part of a thorough risk assessment. One final question, before we move on to the physical exam and testing. Have you ever engaged in sexual activity with someone who has told you they are HIV positive, or with someone whose HIV status you are unaware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… that’s a rather personal question, Doctor. Well, as I mentioned earlier, my husband and I have been married for over forty years. We’ve been faithful to each other throughout our marriage. We haven’t… engaged in sexual activity with anyone else. And we've always been careful, as any couple would be. It's a sensitive topic, and I'm not sure I understand why you’re asking… is it because of my age? It feels a bit… intrusive. I just want to reiterate that we've been a devoted couple for a very long time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Shaub, and I sincerely apologize if my questions feel intrusive. I assure you, I am asking these questions solely to provide you with the best possible care and ensure accurate risk assessment. It’s not based on your age, but rather follows a standard protocol for HIV testing. Given your long-term, monogamous relationship, and your responses to my questions, your risk appears to be very low. However, testing remains the most definitive way to determine your HIV status. Would you like to proceed with the blood test today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I would. Despite my low risk, I still want the peace of mind. If that’s the best way to be sure, then yes, let’s proceed with the test. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, and I apologize if I was a bit… sensitive earlier. It’s just a lot to process. What does the test involve exactly? Will it be painful?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to want peace of mind, Ms. Shaub, and you have no reason to apologize at all. It’s perfectly natural to feel a little anxious in this situation. The test itself is a simple blood draw. A phlebotomist—a trained professional—will draw a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm. There will be a brief pinch, like any other blood draw, but it shouldn't be painful. We’ll use a sterile needle and follow all safety protocols. The blood will then be sent to the lab for analysis. It typically takes 1-2 business days to get the results back. We’ll contact you as soon as we have them. Before we proceed, I would like to briefly perform a physical exam. Just a quick check of your vital signs and a general assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. A quick physical exam sounds fine. I trust your judgement, and I’m ready when you are. It’s just… getting this over with will be a relief, I think. I appreciate you being so patient and understanding with me. It’s not easy talking about these things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shaub. I understand completely. Please, have a seat here. First, I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. It's a routine check, just to get a baseline assessment. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning given your age and recent activity. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Do you have any difficulty breathing or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any difficulty breathing, and I haven’t experienced any chest pain. Sometimes a bit of discomfort in my joints, but that's just old age creeping in, I suppose. Everything else feels… normal. I haven’t coughed or felt unwell in any way recently. Is my blood pressure something I should be worried about? My husband has slightly high blood pressure, so perhaps it runs in the family.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about the lack of respiratory symptoms. And it’s not uncommon for blood pressure to run in families, Ms. Shaub. Your reading isn’t drastically elevated, but we can certainly monitor it during future visits. I’ll make a note to discuss lifestyle modifications—such as diet and exercise—that can help manage it. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Alright, Ms. Shaub. That concludes the physical exam. Everything appears normal. Now, I’ll have the phlebotomist come in and draw the blood sample for the HIV test. It should only take a few minutes. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You've explained everything very thoroughly, and I feel quite reassured. I appreciate your patience and kindness. Just… when you said ‘symmetrical,’ did that mean everything is alright? I sometimes worry about my memory, and I don't want to forget what you’re saying. It's silly, I know. Just… let’s get the test done, and I’ll be relieved to have it over with. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. And don’t apologize for asking questions—it’s always best to clarify anything you’re unsure about. "Symmetrical" simply means that everything is equal on both sides of your body, which is a good sign. I’ll call the phlebotomist now. It will only take a few minutes, and then you’ll be all set. And remember, we'll contact you as soon as the results are back, typically within 1-2 business days. Do you have any questions while I make the call?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I’m alright for now. Thank you again for everything. I'll just… sit here and try to relax. This has been quite a morning. I just hope everything is alright. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. Take a deep breath and try to relax. I’m sure everything will be fine. Hi, this is Dr. Rakosky. Could you please come to room 3 for a blood draw?
