DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Vanderwiele, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Maribeth Vanderwiele. And please, call me Maribeth if you prefer. I do hope this won’t take long, Doctor… Sink, is it? I have errands to run this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, Sink. Doctor Sink. And, well, we’ll try to be brief. But I need to understand why you’re here today. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my breathing. It’s been… troublesome. Specifically when I lie flat. It feels like… something is pressing on my chest, making it hard to get a good breath. It started a few weeks ago, maybe a month. Not constant, but enough to worry me. I don’t like it at all.
DOCTOR: Troublesome breathing, worse when lying flat… Right. And you said a month or so?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. It wasn’t sudden, it just… gradually got worse. I thought perhaps it was the heat, honestly. We’ve had a dreadful summer. But it hasn’t gotten any better, even with cooler evenings. That’s why I thought I should come see you. It’s just… uncomfortable. And a little frightening, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this… discomfort, is it more like a tightness?
PATIENT: Yes, tightness is a good word. A squeezing, really. Like a band around my chest. It doesn't hurt exactly, not a sharp pain, but it’s… constricting. Makes me feel a bit breathless, even when I’m just resting. And it’s definitely worse when I try to lie down. I usually have to prop myself up with pillows just to get comfortable enough to sleep.
DOCTOR: Pillows, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Several, actually. Two or three, sometimes even four. It’s the only way I can get any rest. If I lie completely flat, it feels much worse. Like I’m being… weighed down. It’s very peculiar. I haven’t changed pillows or anything like that, so I don’t understand why it’s suddenly become a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other symptoms associated with this… tightness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No, not really. No coughing, no wheezing. No pain in my arms or jaw. No swelling in my ankles. Just the difficulty breathing when I lie down. And sometimes, a little bit of… a fluttering in my chest, but it’s very slight. I’m not sure if that’s related. It comes and goes. I hadn't mentioned that, but you asked. I haven't been feeling ill otherwise – no fever, no chills, just this breathing trouble.
DOCTOR: Fluttering… Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet recently?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I check regularly, you know, just to be sure. My ankles are quite slender. I haven’t noticed any changes there at all. Like I said, no swelling, no coughing, no pain… just this uncomfortable tightness when I lie flat. It’s quite perplexing, isn’t it? I’ve never experienced anything like it before.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s move on to some basic history, then. Any past medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… let me see. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, back in the 1980s. And I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but I recovered fully. Other than that… not much. I’ve always been a fairly healthy person, all things considered. I take a small dose of medication for my blood pressure, but that’s all. Doctor, is this a serious issue, in your opinion? I do hope it's nothing too worrisome.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder, pneumonia… Blood pressure medication. What is the name and dosage of that medication, please?
PATIENT: It's Lisinopril, I believe. And the dosage is… let me check my little notebook. Here we are. Ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for… oh, goodness, perhaps five years now? It keeps my blood pressure stable, thankfully. My doctor at the Pueblo clinic prescribed it. Do you need any more details? I always try to remember these things, but… well, you know how it is.
DOCTOR: Ten milligrams of Lisinopril...Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. I'm not allergic to any foods, either. Nothing that I’ve discovered, at least. I used to be around a lot of cats as a child, but I never had a problem with them. So, no, no allergies to report. I pride myself on being fairly… resilient, I suppose. But this breathing...that's something new and quite troubling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And my father… he had heart trouble later in life, but I don’t recall the specifics. It was a long time ago. No history of lung problems on either side of the family, as far as I know. My siblings are all still living, and they seem to be in good health. Honestly, we don’t talk about medical issues much, to be frank. It's considered… impolite, perhaps. But I don’t believe there’s a significant family history of breathing problems.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. Never have, never will. I find smoking quite distasteful, honestly. Always have. It’s terrible for your health. No, I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I avoid being around smokers whenever possible. I do enjoy a good walk, though. Fresh air is much more appealing. I hope that’s a positive thing, in your opinion. Is this taking much longer? I have errands to attend to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: No smoking. Good. Alright, one final question for now. Tell me about your social history… do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I am divorced, and my husband passed away many years ago. I live in a small house here in town. I have a lovely garden that keeps me busy. I volunteer at the library a few days a week. And I see my grandchildren occasionally, but they live quite a distance away. It’s a quiet life, but I enjoy it. I’m independent, if that’s what you’re asking. I manage quite well on my own. Now, Doctor, are we getting anywhere with this breathing problem? I truly hope we can determine the cause soon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s listen to your chest, then. If you’ll please lie down.
PATIENT: Very well. I do hope you’ll be gentle. My ribs are… rather sensitive. And please, don’t take too long. I have errands to run this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale… and again… Alright. I do hear some diminished breath sounds on both lower lobes. And there’s a slight wheeze. Are you experiencing any chest pain at this moment?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain right now. Just the usual tightness, especially when I take a deep breath. And the feeling of… being weighed down. It’s a bit more noticeable when I’m lying flat, as you know. Is that… bad? What does "diminished breath sounds" mean, exactly? I don't understand medical jargon, Doctor. Please, use plain English. Is it something serious? I really dislike being kept in suspense.
DOCTOR: Diminished breath sounds means I’m not hearing as much air moving in your lungs as I would expect. It could be due to a number of things. The wheezing suggests some narrowing of the airways. It’s not necessarily serious immediately, but it does warrant further investigation. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a blood test to check for inflammation. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: An X-ray and a blood test… Oh dear. That sounds… rather involved. I was hoping it would be something simple. What are you looking for, exactly? And where would I go to have these tests done? I haven’t been to the hospital in years. And will it take long? My errands, you see…
DOCTOR: The X-ray will help us see if there's any fluid in your lungs or any other abnormalities. The blood test will check for infection or inflammation. You’ll need to go to the Rural General Hospital, the radiology department for the X-ray and the lab for the blood work. It shouldn’t take more than a couple of hours, all told. And frankly, while it’s not an emergency, we need to rule out some possibilities. I’m also prescribing you a short course of albuterol, an inhaler, to see if it eases your breathing. Here’s the prescription. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: An inhaler… Albuterol… Is that… a strong medication? And how often would I use it? I do hope it doesn’t have any unpleasant side effects. I’ve always been rather sensitive to medications, you see. And the hospital… is it far? I don’t drive much anymore. Oh dear. This is all quite… overwhelming. I just want to breathe normally again. Perhaps it’s best if I just rest and see if it improves on its own. Are you sure these tests are necessary?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Vanderwiele, while I appreciate your concerns, it's my professional opinion that these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your breathing difficulties. We can’t simply ignore these symptoms. The albuterol is a relatively mild bronchodilator; it helps open up your airways. It’s common, and the side effects are usually minimal – some nervousness or a slight tremor, but those are typically temporary. And yes, the hospital is about ten minutes from here; a friend or family member can drive you, or there is a shuttle service. Look, I understand you’re anxious, but we need to be proactive. Are you able to arrange transportation to the hospital for these tests, or would you like me to help you find a ride?
PATIENT: Very well. Proactive, you say? My granddaughter, Sarah, might be able to take me. Let me see… she lives about thirty minutes away. I’ll have to call her. 555-123-4567. Please, tell me again about the side effects of the inhaler. And is there anything else I should be aware of before I go to the hospital? I truly dislike feeling helpless. This is all so… disruptive to my routine. And my errands, of course. .
