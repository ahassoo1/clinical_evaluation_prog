DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin' to ye, Doctor Billman. It's this nausea, see. Been happenin' every mornin' now, for... oh, must be a fortnight, maybe a bit more. It’s just a queasy feelin', really. Not violent, just enough to put me off my breakfast. And the nurse mentioned somethin' about my heart... is that connected, d'ye think?
DOCTOR: A fortnight, you say?
PATIENT: Aye, a fortnight. Two weeks, give or take. It’s… consistent, that’s the thing. Every time I get up, it's there. Not all day, just the first hour or so. It makes startin' the day a bit… unpleasant, to be honest. I usually force somethin' down, but it doesn’t always stay down, if ye catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said the nurse mentioned something about your heart?
PATIENT: Aye, she did. She was askin' about feelin' tired, breathlessness... things like that. And she said somethin' about "heart failure." Now, I'm not one to worry unduly, but it does stick in yer mind, doesn’t it? I've been feelin’ a bit more puffed than usual, walkin' up the hill to the shops, but I put that down to gettin’ older. Is that what this nausea could be from, Doctor? It just seems… unlike anything I’ve had before.
DOCTOR: “Heart failure” is a strong term, Mr. Benic, and frankly, the nurse probably shouldn't have used that so freely. It can mean a lot of things, and jumping to conclusions is never helpful. But yes, nausea can be a symptom of heart issues, amongst many others. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We need to gather a bit more information. You mentioned puffiness... is that just when you’re walking uphill, or do you notice it at other times?
PATIENT: Just when I'm walkin' uphill, mostly. Or if I’m doin’ a bit of gardenin’. Bendin' down is a bit of a struggle sometimes too. But when I'm restin’, or just takin' things easy, I feel alright. No swelling in me ankles, or anything like that. And my appetite’s been normal, aside from this mornin’ sickness, of course. I eat a fair bit, to be honest. I like a good hearty breakfast when I can keep it down!
DOCTOR: Right. So, exertion-related shortness of breath. And you said you’ve noticed no swelling in your ankles, which is good. What about any chest pain or palpitations—any fluttering or racing of your heart?
PATIENT: No chest pain, thankfully. Never had that. And no flutterin’ or racin’, not that I’ve noticed. My heart feels… regular, I suppose. It’s a strong heart, always has been. My da lived 'til eighty-five, and he had a good, strong ticker too. Though, he didn’t have this nausea, mind ye. It just feels… different. Like somethin’ isn’t sittin’ right, more than anything. It's not a sharp pain, it's just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your… bowel habits, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Och, now you’re askin'! Well, they’re… regular enough. Not a problem there, thankfully. A bit slow sometimes, if I’m honest, but nothing out of the ordinary for a man o’ my age. I eat plenty o' fruit, mind ye, tryin' to keep things movin', but no troubles, not really. Is that… connected to this heart business, Doctor? I’m beginnin' to wonder if I’ve just got a bad stomach!
DOCTOR: Everything is connected, Mr. Benic, in one way or another. But frankly, I doubt your bowel habits are the primary issue here. We need to rule out some more serious possibilities. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Well, now that ye mention it… I think I might have lost a wee bit. Not much, mind ye. Maybe a stone, at most? But I've been walkin' a bit more, tryin' to stay fit. And, to be fair, my appetite hasn’t been what it used to be since this mornin' sickness started. So it's hard to say if it's deliberate weight loss or just… not eatin’ as much. I hadn't really paid it much attention 'til now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A stone... that's concerning. And the loss of appetite combined with the nausea… Alright, Mr. Benic. We need to get a few tests done. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, then I’ll need to order a blood test – a full panel – and an EKG. We’ll see what those tell us. It's probably nothing serious, but we need to be thorough. Now, if you'll just lie back on the examination table…
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible. I'm happy to do whatever ye think best, Doctor. I trust yer judgement. Just hope it’s not somethin' too drastic. I’ve got a garden to tend, ye see. And a few books to read!
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath… and hold it… Good. Another one… Hmm. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, but not alarming. Lungs sound clear, for now. Now, I’m going to need to take a look at your extremities… Let me just check your pulses…
PATIENT: Aye, go ahead. Everything feels alright to me, but I'm happy to be checked over. My da always said I had good circulation. Used to be able to warm up my hands in a snowball fight faster than anyone! Though, I doubt that'll help ye much with yer tests, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Your pulses are… normal, I suppose. Not particularly strong, but not weak either. Now, I'm going to need a sample of your blood. The nurse will be in shortly to take that. Don't eat or drink anything after you've given it. And try not to strain yourself getting up. Now, do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Not to anything I know of, anyway. My da always said I was a hardy soul. Though, I did get a bit of a rash once, when I was a wee lad, after eatin’ a particularly prickly thistle… but I doubt that counts! So, no worries there, Doctor. I can take anything ye throw at me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's hope we don’t have to throw anything at you. The nurse will be in shortly with the blood test forms and instructions. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and we’ll take it from there. Try to rest until then, Mr. Benic. Any questions?
PATIENT: Not at the moment, Doctor. Just… hopin' it's not somethin' too serious, as I said. I appreciate ye takin' the time to look me over. I’ll just wait here, then, and see what the nurse has to say. And thank ye again.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: Right then. Well, I suppose there's nothin' for it but to wait. Hopefully, it won’t be too long. .
