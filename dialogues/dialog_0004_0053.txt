DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having a bit of trouble getting things going, if you know what I mean. It's not a sudden thing, it’s been building up for… oh, maybe a month now? A month and a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, difficulty with urination. And you said this has been gradual, over about a month. Can you describe what you mean by “trouble getting things going”?
PATIENT: It just… takes effort. I have to push more than I used to. And it doesn't all come out at once, you know? It’s… a bit of a trickle, then stop, then a bit more. It feels like it’s not emptying completely, if that makes sense. It’s… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, just… not right.
DOCTOR: I see. So, hesitancy, straining to urinate, intermittency – starting and stopping – and a sensation of incomplete emptying. And no pain with urination. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… the color seems normal enough, I suppose. Usual pale yellow. The smell… hmm. No, I don't think so. Nothing that jumped out at me, anyway. I don't usually pay much attention to smells, to be honest. Is that bad? Should I be?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad that you don’t, Ms. Yadao. It's just good to be aware. Alright. And have you noticed any increased frequency – needing to go more often than usual – or urgency – a sudden, strong need to urinate?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I have been going more often. Especially at night. I wake up… oh, at least twice sometimes, needing to use the bathroom. It’s not every night, but it's happened enough times that it’s bothered me. And sometimes… sometimes I get that feeling really sudden, like I have to go right now. It’s a bit embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, nocturia – waking up at night to urinate – and urinary urgency. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And no pain in my belly, not at all. Just… this annoying problem with going to the bathroom. It’s really starting to wear me down, to be honest. Waking up at night is the worst. It throws off my whole day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh… well, I suppose they've been a little… slower. Not drastically, mind you. Just not as regular as they used to be. A bit more effort involved, if you understand. I haven’t said anything to anyone about it. Is that connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: It can be connected, Ms. Yadao. The bladder and bowel work closely together. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Do you have a list of medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I do. Just a few. Let me see… I take a little something for my blood pressure – Lisinopril, it’s called. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it last winter. And… that’s it, I think. Just those two. Oh, and sometimes I take a little something for aches, but that's only when I really need it. It's ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for hypertension, vitamin D, and ibuprofen as needed. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I don’t have that problem. I eat all sorts of things, no trouble at all. I do get a little itchy sometimes after using certain soaps, but it’s not a real allergy, just a bit of irritation. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, years ago, when I was quite a bit younger, I had my tonsils taken out. And… I had a hysterectomy, a long time ago. Maybe thirty years ago? Something like that. I don’t remember exactly. It was… routine, I suppose. No problems afterward, not that I recall. And I was in the hospital once for a bad bout of the flu, but that was ages ago. Nothing else comes to mind.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy and hysterectomy. Alright. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history. Do you have any family members – mother, father, siblings – who have had problems with their bladder or kidneys?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother… she had trouble with her kidneys when she got older. Not sure what exactly, just that she was always going to the doctor about them. And my brother… he had some kind of bladder infection when he was a boy, but he recovered just fine. My father was healthy as a horse, never had any problems. That’s all I can think of right now, honestly. I don’t talk to my cousins much, so I wouldn’t know about them.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, I need to ask about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband… well, my late husband… he used to smoke, but I always told him to do it outside. I always hated the smell. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on a special occasion. Nothing more than that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. That will involve listening to your abdomen, and a simple neurological exam. We'll also need to do a urinalysis to check for infection. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. A physical exam is… well, it's probably a good idea. And the urinalysis, yes, certainly. I just want to get this sorted out, if you know what I mean. It's been… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll excuse me for a moment, I'll wash my hands and then we can get started. Please undress from the waist down and put on a gown. It’s in the closet there. I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I will just… get changed then. Do you have a stool in there? My balance isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. Sorry about that. Here you go. Take your time. I’ll be just outside when you’re ready.
