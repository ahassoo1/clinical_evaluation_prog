DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… my sinuses. They are… not good. It’s been… a little while, I think. It’s hard to say how long. A few weeks, maybe? It feels stuffed up, and… pressure. Behind my eyes, mostly.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. And you said pressure, specifically behind your eyes… is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. More when I… bend over? Or when it is… very humid. Like today, maybe. It feels worse today than… yesterday, I believe. I’m sorry, it is hard for me to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse with bending over and humidity. And you mentioned feeling stuffed up… any discharge from your nose?
PATIENT: Yes… sometimes. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little… yellow, but not often. I try to keep it clean. It doesn’t… smell, if that is important? I don't know if that helps. It just… runs.
DOCTOR: Clear and occasionally yellow discharge, no foul odor. Alright. Have you had a fever, or any pain in your face—perhaps around your cheeks or forehead—with this?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. I… checked. And the pain… not really pain, exactly. More like… heavy feeling? In my forehead, sometimes. Like a lot of pressure, you know? Not a sharp pain, never sharp. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy, pressure-like feeling in your forehead, no sharp pain. Have you been experiencing any headaches along with this sinus congestion?
PATIENT: Yes… sometimes. Not every day. They are… not bad headaches. More like… a dull ache? Behind my eyes, again. Like the pressure is… all around my head, maybe. Not… like a migraine. I do not think so. They go away with… rest, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything to treat this yourself?
PATIENT: Um… yes. I tried… hot tea. And I try to… drink a lot of water. Sometimes I put a warm cloth on my face. That helps… a little. My husband, he gets some… medicine for his cold sometimes, and I take that, if he lets me. But it doesn’t really… do much. I don't know what it is for, exactly. Just for cold.
DOCTOR: Okay. Warm tea, water, warm compress, and sometimes cold medicine your husband shares. Do you know what's in that medicine, by any chance?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. He just says it is for his… stuffy nose. A little orange pill, maybe? I’m sorry, I do not pay much attention. I just… take it if he offers. It doesn’t do much, so… I don’t really ask. I just want to feel better. I do not know what is inside.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to get a better history of that medication later. Now, let's talk a little about other medical conditions. Do you have any health problems that you are currently being treated for?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. I… work a lot. I am a rotary drill operator. It’s… hard work. I am usually okay. I had a little… problem with my back a long time ago, but I see a… someone, for that. Not a doctor. Just… someone who fixes backs. But that is okay now. Nothing else. I don’t… get sick very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, you work as a rotary drill operator, had a previous back issue treated by a… chiropractor, and generally consider yourself healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I… I have always been healthy, mostly. Just the back… a little. But it was not a surgery. Just… adjustments. That’s what they call them. He cracks my back. But nothing cut open, never. I do not like hospitals, so… I try to avoid them.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. Good. Now, any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. Sometimes my skin gets… itchy, if I use… strong soap, maybe? But that is not an allergy. Just… sensitive skin. Nothing… serious. I can eat anything, as far as I know. My husband is allergic to… cats, but I am not. He sneezes a lot. But I am fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications regularly – even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes, for my back. The… the chiropractor gives me some pills. They are small, white. For the pain, if it gets bad. But not every day. And… like I said, sometimes I take my husband's cold medicine, if he offers. That’s it, I think. Mostly nothing. I try to avoid taking pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. White pills from your chiropractor for back pain, and occasionally your husband's cold medication. I want to examine your sinuses now, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is okay. I… I just want to feel better. Whatever you think is best. I will… I will do whatever you say. Please be gentle. My nose… sometimes it hurts a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will be as gentle as possible. Please sit back and I’ll take a look. Okay, I’m just going to shine a light in your nose… and gently press here and here. There’s some mild tenderness to palpation over your frontal sinuses, and a bit of congestion inside your nasal passages. No significant swelling or redness that I can see at this time. Your ears look clear.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. It… feels a little tender. I told you. It hurts when I bend over, like that. Is it… bad? I do not understand… congestion. Does that mean I am full of… stuff? My husband says I snore sometimes. Is that… the same thing? I am sorry. I worry a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to worry. Congestion simply means your nasal passages are a little blocked, that's the "stuff". It sounds like you likely have a sinus infection, or at least significant inflammation. The tenderness indicates some irritation. The snoring could be related, yes. It often is with congestion. It doesn't seem severe at this time, but it’s clearly bothering you. We'll need to rule out a bacterial infection to be sure. I’m going to order a complete blood count, just to check for signs of infection. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A… a blood count? Does that mean… a needle? I do not like needles, Doctor. My husband says it is quick, but… I get dizzy, if I see… blood. It makes me feel… weak. And will it hurt? What are you looking for, exactly? I am sorry to be… difficult. I just… I worry.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be worried, and you’re not difficult at all. Yes, a blood count requires a small blood draw. It is quick – just a few seconds of discomfort. We’ll have you lie down for it to minimize any dizziness. We're looking for elevated white blood cell counts, which would suggest your body is fighting an infection. If we find that, it means you may need antibiotics. If the count is normal, it’s more likely a viral infection, and we’ll focus on symptom management. I can ask the nurse to draw the blood and have you lie flat during the process. Would that make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be… very kind. To lie down. I… I think I would feel better. If the nurse is… gentle, that would be good too. My arms… they are very small. I worry they cannot find a vein. And… antibiotics? What are those? Will they make me… sick? I am sorry. I am asking too many questions, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Not at all. It’s good to ask questions; it’s important to understand what’s happening. The nurse is very skilled and experienced—she does this all the time, and she’ll be very gentle. Antibiotics are medications that fight bacterial infections. Sometimes they can cause mild side effects like nausea or stomach upset, but we’ll discuss those if we need to prescribe them. Right now, we don’t know if you need antibiotics, so don’t worry about that just yet. Let me order the blood count, and I'll have the nurse come in and take care of you right away. She will draw a small sample of blood. We’ll get the results back later this afternoon, and we’ll decide on the best course of action then. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds okay, Doctor. If the nurse is gentle. And if I can lie down. I will… try to be brave. I just… I want to feel better. Is there… anything I should do before the nurse comes? Should I drink something? Or… eat something? My husband says I should eat, but I do not want to… throw up. I worry a lot.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. You can drink a little water if you'd like, but don't eat anything right now, just in case. It's better to be on the safe side. And don't worry – we'll take it one step at a time. I'll let the nurse know you're a bit anxious about the blood draw, and she'll be extra careful. Just try to relax, and I’ll be here when you’re done. I’ll be in the office if you need anything. Is there anything else I can do for you right now, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. Just… the nurse. And… thank you. You are very… kind. I worry a lot, but… I feel better already, knowing you are… helping me. I hope it is not… bad. I hope it is just… something simple. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Boham. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. We'll take good care of you, and hopefully, it is something simple. I'll let the nurse know you’re ready. I’ll be right here if you need anything at all.
