DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's... well, it’s a bit hard to explain, really. My hearing… it goes sometimes. And I get so dizzy. It's scary when it happens. My husband… he had something similar, years ago. That’s why I wanted to get it checked out. I don’t remember all the details, though. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s perfectly alright to take your time. Hearing loss and dizziness can certainly be concerning. Let's try to figure out what's going on. Just to start, can you tell me a little more about when your hearing goes?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. When… hmm. It doesn't seem to be at a specific time. Sometimes it’s in the morning, sometimes at night… I really can’t pinpoint it. It just happens. And it feels like… everything spins. Not like being on a merry-go-round, exactly… but unsteady, you know? Like the room is tilting. Does that make sense? It doesn’t last long, usually, but it’s frightening while it does.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Mayhugh. Episodes of intermittent hearing loss with dizziness are definitely something we need to investigate. It sounds like what you're describing could be related to a few different things. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if anything triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers… oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I mean, I just go about my day… and then whoosh… it happens. Sometimes I'm just sitting and watching television, and other times I might be out gardening. It doesn’t seem to matter. Is that helpful? I really wish I could be more specific. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Don't worry about being specific – we'll work through it together. The fact that it seems to happen randomly is helpful information in itself. Now, has this hearing loss and dizziness been getting worse over time, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. I… I think it’s been a little worse, maybe? It used to be just a few times a year, I think. Now it feels… more frequent. But it's hard to be sure, honestly. It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes I just brush it off, and then other times it scares me so much I write it down. It’s all a bit muddled in my head.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it has been gradually increasing in frequency, which is a reason to investigate further. Okay, Ms. Mayhugh. Now, let's talk a little bit more generally. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or a feeling of fullness in your ears, at all?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Sometimes, yes. A faint ringing, like a high-pitched sound. It’s not constant, though. It comes and goes, just like everything else. And fullness… sometimes, yes. Like my ears are blocked, a little bit. But it doesn’t last long. It comes on with the dizziness, I think. Oh, dear, it’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Ringing and a feeling of fullness in the ears, especially when associated with the dizziness, gives us more information. Now, thinking about your overall health, have you had any recent illnesses like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... I had a little cold last month, I think. Nothing too bad, just a sniffle and a cough. It didn’t last long. And before that… not really. I try to stay healthy, you see. I eat my fruits and vegetables. But I'm an old woman now, so I get little things here and there. It's just part of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. A recent cold could sometimes be related to this, but let’s explore other possibilities. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see... My husband used to handle all the doctor’s appointments. I just went along. I think the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high once, a long time ago. But they gave me some pills and it went down. Other than that… not really. I don’t recall anything major. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, all my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. A history of even a past episode of high blood pressure is helpful information. And have you ever had any surgery or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. That was a long time ago, though. And… I was in the hospital when I broke my wrist, a few years back. That’s about it, I think. Nothing too serious. I try to avoid hospitals if I can, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a broken wrist. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just the pills the doctor gave me for my blood pressure. I can’t remember the name of them, though. And sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, when my joints are bothering me. It’s just an over-the-counter pain reliever, though. Nothing fancy. And occasionally, when I can’t sleep, I take a little something for that too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication, occasional pain reliever for arthritis, and something for sleep. It would be helpful if you could bring in a list of all the medications you take, including the names and dosages, at your next visit. Alright Ms. Mayhugh, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your ears, and do a quick neurological assessment to check your balance and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s going on with my hearing and dizziness. It's just… unsettling, you know? The thought of falling is frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Mayhugh. We’ll take our time and try to get to the bottom of this. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your ears. Ears appear clear. Tympanic membranes are intact. No signs of infection or fluid buildup. Okay, now I’m going to check your balance and coordination. Could you please stand up for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I can stand. Just a little unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I can manage. Please go slowly, Ms. Mayhugh. Let me know if you feel dizzy at any point.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and extend your arms out to the sides. Arms are symmetrical. Mild unsteadiness noted. Now, I’m going to ask you to touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed. Mild dysmetria on the right side. Now, I’m going to have you walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for a few steps. Mild ataxic gait. Okay, Ms. Mayhugh, you can sit down now. Alright. Those findings are also helpful.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Was I… was I doing alright? I felt a little wobbly, but I tried my best. What did you find, Doctor? Is it something serious? I'm getting a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Mayhugh. You did just fine. It's good you let me know you felt wobbly – that’s important information. Based on what you’ve told me and the results of the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of a condition called vestibular neuritis or possibly Meniere’s disease. These conditions affect the inner ear and can cause episodes of dizziness, hearing loss, and ringing in the ears. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis without further testing, though. I’d like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’m going to order an audiogram, which will assess your hearing, and a VNG test, which will evaluate the function of your inner ear.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Those sound… complicated. Is it something serious, Doctor? Will I… will I lose my hearing? And what is a VNG test? Will it hurt? I don’t like tests very much, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Mayhugh. It is a little complicated, and it’s natural to be worried. Vestibular neuritis and Meniere’s disease can cause hearing loss, but it’s not always permanent, and treatment can often help manage the symptoms and prevent further hearing loss. We’ll know more once we have the results of the tests. An audiogram is a simple hearing test where you wear headphones and listen to different tones. It doesn’t hurt at all. The VNG test is a little more involved, but it’s still painless. It involves wearing goggles and having you move your head and eyes while we record the movements. It helps us see how your inner ear is functioning. It might make you feel a little dizzy or nauseous, but it shouldn’t be painful. We’ll have someone there with you the whole time to make sure you’re comfortable. I’m also going to prescribe some medication to help with the dizziness, just to get you through until we have the test results. And I’ll give you some instructions on what to do if you feel a dizzy spell coming on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. That sounds… less frightening, I suppose. A little dizzy, but not painful. And medication to help with the dizziness… that would be good. Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. When can I have the tests? And will the medication make me sleepy? I like to watch my stories on television, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm glad that sounds a little better. I can get you scheduled for the audiogram and VNG test at the hearing center downtown next week. How does Tuesday afternoon sound?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon… hmm. Yes, that should be alright. As long as it doesn't interfere with my stories. And will someone explain the results to me? I don’t understand all that medical talk, you see. I’d like someone to go over everything with me, slowly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. The hearing center will schedule a follow-up appointment with an audiologist who will explain the results to you in detail, and they’ll be happy to answer any questions you have. I’ll also make a follow-up appointment for you here in the office in two weeks so I can discuss the results with you as well. Now, regarding the medication, I’m going to prescribe meclizine, which is an antihistamine that can help with dizziness and nausea. It can cause some drowsiness, so it's best to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while you’re taking it. You can take it as needed, but don't exceed the recommended dosage. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, meclizine… I’ll have to remember that. No driving, alright. Hmm… I don’t think so, Doctor. I think you’ve covered everything. Just… thank you. Thank you for listening. It’s been worrying me for a long time. And thank you for not laughing at me when I forget things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s my job to listen, and there’s absolutely no reason to be embarrassed about forgetting things. It happens to all of us. Here are the prescriptions for the meclizine and the order for the hearing tests. The hearing center will call you to schedule the appointments. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And remember to take it easy and avoid anything that might make the dizziness worse. I’ll see you in two weeks. Have a good day, Ms. Mayhugh.
