DOCTOR: “Bonjour, Madame Queener. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. Please, have a seat. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my legs, mostly. They are… puffy. Really puffy, after the treatments. It’s been a few months now, since the… you know. The cancer stuff. I just want it to stop, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: “I understand, Madame Queener. It sounds concerning that your legs are puffy, especially after your cancer treatments. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to find a solution. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about these treatments?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… there was… radiation, yes. And then… pills. Lots of pills. I don’t remember the names, I’m so sorry. My daughter wrote it all down, but I… misplaced the paper. It was at the hospital, a long time ago, and they said it would help, and it did, mostly. But now… this. It’s just annoying, really. Hard to get my shoes on, you know?
DOCTOR: “That is quite alright, Madame Queener. It is very common to have difficulty remembering medication names, especially after a stressful experience like cancer treatment. And it's perfectly valid to be annoyed by this – impacting your daily activities is frustrating. Could you tell me approximately when you finished your last treatment?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… spring, I think. Maybe April? Yes, April. Around Easter time, I believe. Everything feels so long ago now. It was definitely before the really hot weather started.
DOCTOR: “Thank you, Madame Queener. April gives me a good starting point. And you noticed the puffiness developing after the treatments concluded, in the spring?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It started… slowly, you know? At first I thought it was just because I wasn't moving around as much. But it just kept getting worse. Now, both legs are pretty bad, especially at the end of the day. It’s uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: “I see. So, gradual onset of puffiness in both legs, worsening over time, and more noticeable at the end of the day. That’s helpful information. To get a clearer picture, could you describe where on your legs the puffiness is located?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s not like… the feet, really. It’s more… the calves, I think. And a bit around the ankles. Not the top of the legs, just… down here. It's hard to explain! I'm not very good at this medical talk.
DOCTOR: “You’re explaining perfectly well, Madame Queener, please don't worry. It sounds like the puffiness is primarily in your calves and ankles. Is it present all day, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It’s worse at night. Definitely. Like, in the morning, it’s… not gone, but not as bad. But by the evening… oh, it's noticeable! I have to put my feet up, you know? It helps a little, but not much. I also try to wear looser socks.
DOCTOR: “Thank you. So, worsening throughout the day, with some relief when you elevate your legs and with looser socks. That's good self-care. Now, aside from the puffiness, have you noticed any other changes in your legs?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… they don't hurt, exactly. Just… heavy. And sometimes a little itchy, around the ankles. But not always. It's not a bad itch, just… annoying, like everything else.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so no pain, but a feeling of heaviness and occasional mild itching around the ankles. That's good to know. Now, I’d like to ask about other parts of your body, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any swelling anywhere else – in your hands, face, or abdomen, for example?
PATIENT: No, not really. My hands are fine, and my face… well, it's always a bit puffy, but that’s just my age, I think! And no, my tummy is okay. It’s just the legs, thankfully. I don't need any more problems, you know?
DOCTOR: “I understand completely, Madame Queener. It’s good to hear the swelling is limited to your legs. Now, thinking about your overall health, have you experienced any shortness of breath, fatigue, or changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the weight! I have gained a bit, I think. Maybe five pounds? It’s hard to say, I’m not very good at weighing myself. And… sometimes I get tired easier. But I’m old, Doctor! That’s just getting old, I think. Nothing to worry about.
DOCTOR: “I appreciate your honesty, Madame Queener. While weight gain and fatigue can be part of aging, it’s important to consider them alongside the other symptoms you’re experiencing. Now, I would like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… The doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high, years ago. But they gave me a pill for it, and I take it every day. That’s it, I think. No diabetes, no heart problems. Just the blood pressure. And, you know, the… cancer stuff.
DOCTOR: “Thank you. So, managed hypertension with medication, and a history of cancer treatment. Do you recall what type of cancer you were treated for, if you don’t mind my asking?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it was in the… breast. Yes, breast cancer. They did the surgery, and then the radiation, and the pills. It was a long time ago. My daughter could tell you more details, she has all the papers. But I try not to think about it too much, you know? It was scary.
DOCTOR: “I completely understand, Madame Queener. It’s perfectly natural to want to put difficult experiences behind you. And it's good you had successful treatment. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides the one for your breast cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes! I had my appendix out when I was young. And… I think I had a little something done on my knee, years ago. But it was a long time ago. Nothing important. It doesn’t hurt or anything.
DOCTOR: “Thank you. So, a history of appendectomy and a knee procedure. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Do any of your close family members have a history of blood clots, heart problems, or kidney disease?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Family… let me think. My mother… she had a bad heart, I think. She was always tired. And my brother… he had some problems with his legs, swelling, like me. But he lived in America, I haven’t seen him in years. It's hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: “Thank you, Madame Queener. A history of heart problems in your mother and leg swelling in your brother. That’s helpful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications other than the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Oh, just the one for the blood pressure, I think. And… sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. But not every day. It's just an over-the-counter pain reliever, nothing special. And sometimes a vitamin D pill, the doctor said I was a bit low. That’s it, I think.
DOCTOR: “Thank you. So, medication for hypertension, occasional over-the-counter pain reliever for arthritis, and vitamin D. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or other substances?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, and I don't use any fancy soaps or anything. I’m a very simple person, Doctor.
DOCTOR: “That’s good to know, Madame Queener. Now, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle? Well... I live alone, you see. I used to garden a lot, but it's hard now with the legs. I like to read, mostly. And watch television. And visit my daughter when I can. I try to eat healthy, but I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. It's not very exciting, but it's my life.
DOCTOR: “Thank you, Madame Queener. That gives me a very good understanding of your situation. Now, I would like to perform a physical exam. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your legs, including measuring the circumference of your calves. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out, if possible. The legs are really bothering me. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: “Alright, Madame Queener. If you could please lie back on the examination table, that would be wonderful. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope.” “Your heart rate is regular, and your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to examine your legs.” “The circumference of your right calf is 41 centimeters, and the circumference of your left calf is 42 centimeters. There is mild pitting edema in both legs, and your skin feels warm to the touch. I don't notice any significant tenderness. The pulses in your feet are present and strong.” “Based on my examination, the puffiness in your legs is likely due to venous insufficiency, possibly exacerbated by the previous cancer treatment. Venous insufficiency means that the valves in your veins aren't working as efficiently as they should, causing blood to pool in your legs. However, given your history of cancer, we need to rule out other potential causes, such as lymphedema or a blood clot.”
PATIENT: Oh… venous insufficiency? That sounds… complicated. And what was the other thing? Lymp… something? A blood clot sounds scary! So, what does that mean? What do we do about it?
DOCTOR: “I understand your concern, Madame Queener. It can sound overwhelming, but let’s break it down. Venous insufficiency is quite common, especially as we age. It simply means the veins in your legs aren’t as effective at returning blood back to your heart, leading to fluid buildup – the puffiness you're experiencing. Lymphedema is a buildup of fluid in the lymphatic system, and while it’s less likely in your case, it’s important to consider given your cancer history. A blood clot, or deep vein thrombosis , is a more serious concern, but based on my examination, I don’t suspect one at this moment. However, we need to be certain. To rule out a DVT, I would like to order a D-dimer blood test and an ultrasound of both legs. The D-dimer will check for the presence of a substance released when a blood clot breaks down. The ultrasound will visually examine the veins in your legs to look for any clots. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… blood tests and an… ultra-sound? More tests! I suppose so. If it’s to make sure, then yes. I just wish it was simpler. Will these tests take long? And… will they hurt?
DOCTOR: “I understand your frustration, Madame Queener, and I apologize for the additional tests. I wish it were simpler as well. The blood test is very quick – just a small sample taken from your arm. The ultrasound is painless. A technician will apply a gel to your legs and move a small handheld device over the area to create an image of the veins on a screen. It doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. The blood test results should be available within a few hours. The ultrasound will take about 30-45 minutes, and the results will typically be available within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, there are some things we can do to help manage your symptoms. I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible, wearing compression stockings, and staying hydrated. Would you like me to write you a prescription for compression stockings?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… like those tight things my mother used to wear? Oh dear. But if it helps… yes, please. A prescription would be good. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything so well. It's just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: “You are very welcome, Madame Queener. I'm glad I could help. Yes, those are the ones. They come in different levels of compression, and we can start with a lower level to begin with. “Alright, I’ve written you a prescription for compression stockings, and I’m also ordering the D-dimer blood test and an ultrasound of both legs. The nurse will schedule those tests for you before you leave. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss the best course of treatment. If the tests are negative, we can focus on managing your venous insufficiency with lifestyle changes and compression therapy. If the tests are positive, we’ll need to discuss further options, such as medication or referral to a vascular specialist. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. I just want to get this sorted out. And I’m glad you’re being thorough. Thank you, Doctor. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Or anything I should watch out for in the meantime?
DOCTOR: “You are very welcome, Madame Queener. For the blood test, you don't need to do anything special – just come in on an empty stomach, if possible. For the ultrasound, you can eat and drink as usual. In the meantime, please watch out for any new or worsening symptoms, such as pain, redness, warmth, or swelling in one leg, or any shortness of breath or chest pain. If you experience any of those symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just continue to elevate your legs, stay hydrated, and wear the compression stockings once you get them. The nurse will provide you with instructions on how to properly wear and care for them. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very kind and patient, Doctor. Thank you again. I just hope these tests don’t take too long. And I hope it’s not anything too serious.
DOCTOR: “You are very welcome, Madame Queener. I understand your anxiety, and I will do everything I can to expedite the tests and get you answers as quickly as possible. We’ll take it one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your tests and answer any remaining questions you may have. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new or concerning symptoms before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Madame Queener, and I will see you soon.”
