DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Uh... well, it's this pain. When I take a deep breath, it hurts. It's... hard to explain. It's just... there. Been bothering me for a little while now, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain with deep breaths… that’s certainly something we want to look into. “A little while now” – can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… hmm. Maybe a month? Or two? It’s… blurry. I mostly just try to avoid taking deep breaths if I can. It’s easier that way. I don't remember when it started, exactly. Just… gradually got worse, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, a month or two of gradually worsening pain with deep breaths. That gives us a starting point. And you're managing by just avoiding deep breaths, which I understand, but we want to find out why it's hurting to breathe. Is the pain in a specific location?
PATIENT: Specific location… It feels… mostly in my chest. Not right in the middle, more over… here. But sometimes it feels like it spreads a little. It’s not a sharp pain, more… dull ache? Hard to say, really. Everything feels a little fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly on the left side of your chest, a dull ache that sometimes spreads. That’s helpful. And you said it's related to taking deep breaths. Does anything else make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… Hmm. Lifting things, maybe? I used to do a lot of work, construction, you know. But now... not so much. And… when it’s cold. Cold air seems to bother it. Makes me want to curl up and stay inside. Does that make sense? It's all connected somehow, I figure.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Lifting and cold air are both things that could aggravate chest pain. So, to clarify, it’s worse with deep breaths, lifting, and in cold weather. Is there anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Better… Sitting still, mostly. Just… resting. Not doing much. And… warm things. A warm shower, or sitting with a blanket. But it doesn't go away completely, you know? It's just… less noticeable when I'm warm and quiet. Honestly, I'm just trying to take it easy these days. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting and warmth help, but the pain doesn’t completely go away. That’s good information. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, just to get a fuller picture. Have you had any cough, fever, or shortness of breath along with this pain?
PATIENT: Cough… not really. Maybe a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothing serious. Fever? No, I don't think so. I haven't felt hot or anything. And shortness of breath… Well, I try not to breathe too deep, remember? So… it's hard to say if I'm short of breath or just avoiding it. Everything feels a bit tight, if that makes sense. I don't know… It's all a mess, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough or fever, and you're being cautious with your breathing. "Tightness" is a good descriptor, thank you. To continue, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like heart problems, lung issues, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, boy… that’s a long time ago. I… I think the doctor said something about my blood pressure being a little high, years ago. But I don’t remember taking any medicine for it. And… something about my joints, when I was younger. Arthritis, maybe? I did a lot of heavy lifting in construction. But honestly, Doctor, I forget so much these days. It’s hard to keep track. I’ve been to a lot of doctors over the years.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure and possible arthritis. That’s helpful to know. And you’ve seen several doctors before. Do you remember any surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a kid, a long, long time ago. And… I think I had something on my knee fixed, after I hurt it at work. But that was… decades ago. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a blur. I don’t keep good records, and my memory… well, you know. It's just not what it used to be. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Ruocco, and you're doing great just telling me what you remember. Knowing about the appendix and knee surgery helps build a complete picture. Now, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… No, Doctor, I don't take anything regularly. Not anymore. I think I had some pills for my blood pressure, a long time ago, but I stopped taking them. The doctor said something about side effects, I think. Now, I just try to take it easy. I don’t like taking a lot of medicine. It makes me feel… funny. Honestly, I’m not a big fan of doctors or pills, if you want to know the truth. Can we get this over with soon? My back is starting to ache.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. And I respect your feelings about medication. We'll get through this as quickly as possible. It’s good to know you aren’t taking any regular medication right now. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I've never really had any bad reactions to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, if I brush against certain plants, but nothing serious. I don’t get a lot of rashes or anything like that. I mostly just stay inside, you know? Less chance of running into things. Is that all? I'm starting to feel tired, Doctor. Can we hurry this up a bit?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart, and I'll gently feel your chest to see if I can pinpoint the source of the pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, please. My bones are old and fragile. And… try to be quick, okay? This is making me nervous. I just want to know what's wrong and get out of here.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Ruocco. I will be very gentle. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. And another one… alright. Okay, heart sounds are normal. I’m feeling some tenderness here. It seems to be localized to your left lower rib cage. Now, I'd like to check your oxygen saturation with a clip on your finger. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Ouch! That’s where it hurts. See? I told you. Oxygen… what was that? Is something wrong? I don't like this, Doctor. I just want to go home and rest. Please just tell me what's going on. Is it my heart? I’m scared.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Mr. Ruocco. That’s why we’re doing these checks. And I understand your worry. The oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low, but not critically so. Based on what you’ve told me – the pain with breathing, made worse by lifting and cold, and the tenderness I’ve found, it could be a few things. One possibility is costochondritis – inflammation of the cartilage in your rib cage. That would explain the tenderness. Another possibility, given your low oxygen saturation and some diminished breath sounds, is a mild pneumonia, but we need to rule that out. I'm going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. It's quick and painless. Would you be able to walk down the hall to the X-ray room?
PATIENT: X-ray… pneumonia… Oh, boy. I guess so. I can walk, slowly. But… what if it is pneumonia? Will I have to stay in the hospital? I don’t want to stay in the hospital. It’s too cold and… and lonely. Can we just give me something for the pain? I don’t think I need an X-ray. I’m an old man, Doctor. Sometimes things just hurt. Can we just forget the X-ray? Please? I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ruocco. I truly do. And I wouldn't order an X-ray if I didn't think it was important. It's not about thinking you’re just old, it's about making sure we're giving you the right treatment. Pneumonia can be serious, especially for someone your age, but it’s also often treatable with antibiotics. We won’t talk about a hospital stay just yet. Let’s get the X-ray first, and then we can discuss the results and decide on the best course of action. The X-ray will give us a clear picture of what's going on in your lungs. It's a quick procedure, and I’ll be right there with you. If the X-ray comes back clear, then we can explore other possibilities, like costochondritis, and manage your pain appropriately. Would you like me to explain the X-ray procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you say. Just… make it quick, okay? And… be gentle. I don't want anything broken. Explain it, I guess. The less surprises the better. I just… I don't like doctors or hospitals. Never have. It always ends badly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Ruocco. I’ll explain everything. The X-ray technician will position you in front of a special camera. You'll need to hold very still for a few seconds while the picture is taken. It doesn’t hurt at all – it’s just a brief exposure to radiation, but the amount is very small and not harmful. It allows us to see the structures inside your chest – your lungs, heart, and bones. The technician will be in a separate room, so they won’t be exposed to the radiation. You'll be able to hear them give you instructions. It takes just a few minutes. After the X-ray, the image will be sent to me, and I'll review it as soon as possible. Then we'll discuss the results and decide on the best plan for you. I’ll walk with you to the X-ray room and make sure you're comfortable. Do you think you can manage walking down the hallway?
PATIENT: I guess so. My legs aren’t what they used to be. But… I can walk. Slowly. Just… no rushing. And please, don't leave me alone. I get… nervous in places like that. It feels… cold and scary. Can you promise me you won’t leave me alone? Just until we know what’s going on?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Ruocco. I promise I won’t leave you alone. I'll be with you every step of the way. We'll take it slow, and I’ll explain everything as we go. Let’s go, then. The X-ray room is just down the hallway. We'll get this done quickly and find out what's going on, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Just… be gentle. And… talk to me. Keep talking. It helps. What did you say your name was again, Doctor? I'm terrible with names these days. My mind… it's just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: My name is Dr. Gegan, Mr. Ruocco. It’s nice to meet you properly. And don't worry about forgetting names, it happens to the best of us. I’m happy to repeat it as many times as you need. “So, are you experiencing any pain while walking right now?
