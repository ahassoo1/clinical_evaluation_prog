DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let’s just get right to it. It’s this… stomach thing. Food comes back up, you know? Regurgitation, the paperwork said. It’s quite unpleasant, really. And it’s been happening more often lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing increasing regurgitation – food coming back up – and it’s quite bothersome. I appreciate you being direct, Mr. Altine; we will get right to it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: When did it start? Honestly, that’s a silly question. People don't keep calendars for when their stomachs act up. Probably… a few months ago? Maybe longer. It wasn't constant then, just… occasionally after a big meal. Now it's more frequent, especially if I lie down too soon after eating. It’s common sense, really. Don't tell me to avoid lying down, I already figured that out.
DOCTOR: You're right to try to figure things out yourself, and I apologize if my question seemed silly. It’s helpful to have a timeframe, though, even a rough one, to see if anything else has changed around the same time. So, a few months, increasing frequency, worse when lying down… I appreciate that information. Can you describe what comes back up?
PATIENT: What comes up? Honestly, it's food. What did you think, rockets? Partially digested food. Sometimes it’s… chunky. Sometimes it’s more liquid. Depends what I ate, doesn't it? It's usually… acidic. Burns a little going down the second time, if you must know. Look, are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going to play twenty questions? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting somewhere, Mr. Altine. And I apologize if it feels like twenty questions. It is important for me to gather a complete picture to understand what's happening. So, partially digested food, sometimes chunky, sometimes liquid, and often acidic... that helps. Does it happen after every meal, or are there specific foods that seem to trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: Specific foods? Of course there are specific foods! Everything greasy, for one. Fried chicken, pizza... you know, sensible things people enjoy. Spicy food doesn’t help, either. And anything with tomatoes. Honestly, I feel like I'm being interrogated about my dietary choices. It's not like I'm living on junk food, but I'm not exactly going to eat boiled chicken and rice every day, am I? It’s common sense.
DOCTOR: No, you absolutely shouldn’t have to eat boiled chicken and rice every day! You’re right to point that out. I'm not here to dictate your diet, just to understand what might be contributing to this. So, fried foods, spicy foods, and tomatoes seem to be culprits. Aside from the regurgitation, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… well, sometimes my chest feels a bit… burned, you know? Like heartburn, but not as bad. It usually happens after the… incident, if you want to call it that. And occasionally, I have a bit of a cough, especially at night. I assumed it was just the acid irritating my throat. Honestly, it’s probably nothing, but you asked. I really do hope we’re getting close to figuring this out. My wife is starting to worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, heartburn after the regurgitation, and a cough, particularly at night. That’s very helpful information, Mr. Altine. It sounds like the acid may well be irritating your esophagus and contributing to the cough. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will give me a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I don't like doctors poking and prodding, you know. But if you have to, go ahead. Just be quick about it. I have better things to do, even if my wife doesn't agree.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just listening to your heart and lungs… everything sounds clear there. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Does this cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. A little… tender, maybe, right here. But I've got a bit of a stomach, you know, so it's probably just that. Don’t make a big deal out of it. It's probably nothing. Honestly, I've probably just got indigestion. Is that all you’re going to do? Are we finished now?
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness in the upper abdomen, which is understandable. I’m just checking for any areas of significant discomfort. No major guarding or masses that I detect. Given your symptoms – the frequent regurgitation, especially with certain foods, the heartburn, the cough, and the tenderness in your upper abdomen – it sounds like you may be experiencing a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. It happens when stomach acid frequently flows back up into your esophagus. However, to confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, for goodness sake. More poking and prodding? I don’t like tests, Doctor. What kind of tests? And how long will they take? Honestly, if it's just GERD, why bother? I could just take some antacids and avoid fried food. I've been doing that for years, to be honest. Look, can’t you just write me a prescription for something and be done with it? My wife will have a fit if I’m away all day at the hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Altine, and I apologize if I'm causing you frustration. While antacids and dietary changes can certainly provide relief, it’s important to understand the cause of your symptoms and rule out other possibilities, such as a hiatal hernia or, less commonly, something more serious. The tests I’m thinking of are relatively straightforward. First, a simple blood test to check for any underlying issues. Then, I'd like you to have an endoscopy – a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end is gently inserted into your esophagus to visualize the lining. It’s usually well-tolerated, and we can provide sedation to make you comfortable. It will take a few hours, mainly for the preparation and recovery. I am concerned about the potential for long-term complications of untreated GERD, such as damage to your esophagus. I’d like to provide the best possible care and ensure we address this properly. What do you think?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Blood test, alright. That’s not so bad. But an endoscopy? A camera down my throat? Absolutely not. I've heard about those things, Doctor. No, I refuse. I’ll try the antacids and the diet. If that doesn’t work… well, I guess I’ll just have to live with it. Don’t try to convince me otherwise. It's my body, after all. Can we just be done now? I really must go. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. I respect your decision. We can start with the blood test, and I will prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor – a medication that reduces stomach acid – to try for a few weeks. We can reassess after that. I strongly recommend limiting fried foods, spicy foods, and tomatoes, and avoiding lying down for at least three hours after eating. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can discuss the endoscopy again. Here are the instructions for the medication and the lab test. Do you have any questions before you go?
