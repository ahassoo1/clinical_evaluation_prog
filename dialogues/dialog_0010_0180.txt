DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, look, I don’t have all day. It’s this tiredness. Just…so tired. And it’s not like a normal tired, you know? It’s…deeper. And I’ve been…eating dirt. Yes, dirt. Don’t look at me like that. It just…helps, a little. I don’t know why. It's ridiculous, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for being honest with me, Ms. Cantoran. It's important to share everything, even if it feels…unusual. You mentioned a deeper tiredness, and you’ve been consuming dirt. Let’s try to understand what’s going on. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Honestly? I…can't rightly say. It’s been building, I guess. Months, probably. Maybe longer? Time…blurs. My husband, he…he always kept track of things. Now…it's just…gone. It’s just gotten worse lately, that's all I know. More tired, more…the craving.
DOCTOR: Okay, months, gradually worsening. And the craving for dirt has also increased recently. Has anything specific triggered these symptoms, or do they seem to come on randomly?
PATIENT: Triggered? No. Not that I can think of. Life's just…life. Work, the house…it’s always something. Maybe the weather? It’s been hot, hasn’t it? I don’t know. I really don't. Look, I program those machines all day, I don’t think about feelings or…triggers. Just numbers and code.
DOCTOR: I understand. You work hard, and focusing on the practical is understandable. Let’s try to get a clearer picture. Besides the tiredness and the craving for dirt, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. My stomach…it’s been a bit off. Not sick, exactly. Just… unsettled. And…I’ve been feeling…cold. Even when it’s hot. I have to wear a sweater sometimes, even in the shop. People think I'm crazy. And I've lost weight. Not trying to, but…the clothes feel looser.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsettled stomach, feeling cold despite the heat, and unintentional weight loss. That's helpful information. About the stomach issues – can you describe what “unsettled” means?
PATIENT: Ugh, just… queasy, you know? Like I’m gonna be sick, but I never am. Just that feeling. And sometimes…pain. Not bad pain, just…a dull ache. It comes and goes. It's not like a sharp pain, thankfully. More like a constant…discomfort. Really, I just want to get this figured out so I can go back to work. I’m behind enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, queasiness and a dull ache in your stomach. And it comes and goes. Now, Ms. Cantoran, I'm going to ask some questions about your overall health. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? Oh, goodness. I don't even remember. A broken arm when I was a kid. The usual…flu, colds. Nothing serious. My husband…he took care of all that. Doctors appointments, remembering what pills to take…I just…didn’t pay attention. Honestly, I’m not good with that stuff. I really just want to know what’s causing this tiredness and…the dirt thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall details. We can work with what you do remember. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me think… No. No surgeries. Definitely not. I… I don’t think so. I’d remember something like that, wouldn’t I? No, never had surgery. My husband would have… he would have known.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my husband is…gone. Passed away a few years back. No children. I have a sister, I think. Haven't spoken to her in… a long time. We didn't get along. She always thought I was…odd. I don’t really talk about family. It's easier this way.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s perfectly alright. Ms. Cantoran, I'm going to ask about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband…he liked a beer now and then, but I didn’t. And drugs? Heavens, no. I work with machines all day, I need a clear head. I barely have time to sleep as it is. I just… want to feel normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or drug use. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Like I said, I don't really…do that stuff. I don't take pills. Just…the dirt, I guess. But that's not a medication, is it? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I just want to know what’s wrong with me so I can go back to work.
DOCTOR: You're right, this is getting to the point where we need to figure things out. Ms. Cantoran, I'm going to do a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. It might help us understand what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. I haven’t got all day. But don't poke around too much, okay? I don’t like being touched. And be quick about it. The shop is probably a mess right now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Blood pressure first. 110 over 70. Not bad. Now, let me listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. There's some tenderness in the upper right quadrant. And your spleen feels slightly enlarged. It's subtle, but it’s worth noting. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. I’m going to order some blood tests. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a iron level. We should also check your liver function. And I want to get a fecal sample to analyze, if that's alright. It will help us understand what might be causing the craving and consumption of dirt.
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Honestly, this is ridiculous. Fecal sample…? You want my… Never mind. Just…do what you have to do. Liver function, you say? What does that even mean? Is something wrong with my liver? Look, I just want to know what's causing this tiredness and why I'm eating dirt. And can we please hurry? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran. It’s important to be thorough, and these tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. Checking your liver function is a routine part of investigating abdominal pain and fatigue. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it’s important to rule out any potential issues. The spleen enlargement I detected is also something we need to investigate. The fecal sample will help us identify any parasites or deficiencies. I will give you the requisition forms for the blood tests and instructions for collecting the fecal sample. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please try to rest as much as possible and avoid consuming any dirt. I know it’s difficult, but it’s important to avoid introducing any further unknowns. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Avoid consuming dirt… easier said than done. Look, I'll try, okay? But don’t expect miracles. And… what about the tiredness? Is there anything I can do about that now? I can’t just sit around waiting for test results. I have bills to pay. I really need to get back to work. And…is this serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cantoran. It's good you're asking these questions. The tiredness is likely related to whatever is causing the other symptoms, so addressing those is the first step. While we wait for the results, I recommend prioritizing rest and a balanced diet as much as possible. Staying hydrated is also important. As for whether this is serious… it’s too early to say definitively. The symptoms you're describing – fatigue, abdominal pain, spleen enlargement, and the unusual craving – warrant investigation. It could be something relatively minor, like a nutritional deficiency or a mild infection, but we need the test results to rule out anything more serious. I'm not going to speculate until we have more information, but I want you to know that we are taking this seriously and we will get to the bottom of it. We will schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today to review the results. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or bleeding – please contact the office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you understand?
PATIENT: One week…Fine. Just…try not to keep me waiting. And I really don't want to go to the emergency room. Look, I'll try to rest and… eat better. But don't expect me to suddenly become a health nut. This is all just… a waste of time, probably. But alright. One week. Thank you, I guess. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Cantoran. We’ll do our best to expedite the results. Remember, if anything changes, don’t hesitate to contact the office. Take care, and I'll see you next week.
