DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. My name is Dr. Hembrey. It’s good to meet you. Now, can you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itch, see? It’s been driving me crazy. All over, really. Not everywhere, but… mostly on my arms and back. It just won’t quit, and it’s making it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: An itch, you say. And it’s been… how long has this been going on, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started, I’d say, maybe a month ago? At first, I didn’t think much of it, you know? Just a little dry skin, maybe. But it’s gotten worse and worse. Now it's really bothersome.
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And would you describe it as a constant itch, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. But when it comes, it really comes, you know? Like, I gotta scratch it, and then it feels a little better for a bit, but then it starts up again. It’s worse at night, definitely. Makes it hard to relax.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you noticed any rash accompanying the itch, or is it just the sensation itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I haven't really looked closely, to be honest. I just feel it, you know? I guess… no, I don’t think so. I haven't seen any big red spots or anything. Just the itch. Maybe a little redness after I scratch, but that's probably from the scratching itself.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything to alleviate the itch so far?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a little. I put some lotion on it, you know, regular lotion. That helps a little bit, for a few minutes. And I used some of that calamine lotion once, but it didn’t really do much. I don’t really like the smell of it, to be honest. It feels kinda… sticky?
DOCTOR: I see. Now, let’s go through some other questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me think... allergies. Not that I know of, really. I eat pretty much everything. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to get poison ivy when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago! I don’t go hiking anymore, so that hasn’t been a problem. Medications… I don’t take any regularly. Just some ibuprofen now and then for a little ache.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And are you currently taking any other medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no vitamins or anything like that. Just that ibuprofen when my knees bother me. And I hardly ever take it, to be honest. Maybe once a month, if that. I try to just rest when my knees hurt. Doctor told me years ago to just take it easy.
DOCTOR: And have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my gallbladder taken out a long time ago, maybe twenty years now? And I had a little bit of high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control for years. Just a little bit, you know? The doctor said it wasn’t anything to worry too much about. Other than that, not really. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… Well, my mother had diabetes, I think. And my father… he had heart problems. But that was a long time ago. I don’t really know much about their medical history, to be honest. We didn’t talk about things like that much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle? Well, I’m retired now, so I mostly stay home. I like to read, watch a little television. I go to church on Sundays. I don’t really do much traveling anymore. I used to, but… it’s just easier to stay close to home now. I don't smoke, and I don’t drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Cassimatis, I’d like to take a look at your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. It’s just… I hope it’s not anything serious.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat and I’ll take a look. We'll start with your arms and back, as you mentioned. Now, could you please loosen your clothing or remove anything that might be in the way?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. It's a little chilly in here, you know? But I can take it off if you need me to. Is it really necessary to take it all the way off?
DOCTOR: For a proper examination, Ms. Cassimatis, it is preferable to have full access to the skin on your arms and back. However, if you are uncomfortable, we can proceed with a limited examination. But please understand that may impact my ability to accurately assess the issue.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. I guess you’re right. It’s just… I don’t usually show my arms to strangers, you know? But if you need to see them, I'll… I'll take it off. Just… please be quick?
DOCTOR: I’m noting some areas of mild redness and dryness on your arms and back. There don't appear to be any obvious rashes or lesions, which is good. However, the skin does appear somewhat irritated. I’ll need to ask a few more questions to determine the potential cause. Have you changed any soaps or detergents recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear there's no rash. I was worried about that. Hmm… let me think. No, I haven't changed any soaps. I use the same one I've been using for years. That Irish Spring, you know? And the laundry detergent… no, that's the same too. Tide. I try to stick to what I know works, you know? I don't like trying new things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been exposed to any new environments recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I haven't been anywhere recently. Like I said, I mostly stay home. I went to church on Sunday, but that's about it. And I’ve been going to the same church for years! So, no, no new environments.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the itch – fatigue, fever, weight loss, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Nothing like that. I feel pretty much the same as always, you know? I sleep okay, I eat okay, I haven’t lost any weight. I might be a little tired sometimes, but that’s just because I'm getting older, I think! No, nothing else. Just the itch. It’s driving me crazy, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the examination findings, it’s possible this is a case of simple dry skin, possibly exacerbated by the weather or a mild irritant. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities, such as a mild allergic reaction or early signs of dermatitis. I'm going to order a complete blood count, or CBC, to check for any underlying inflammation. I'd also like to do a skin scraping to rule out any fungal infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… tests? I don’t like tests, Doctor. Are they… are they painful? And what if it is something bad? I don’t really like going to doctors, you know? I just want the itch to go away. Is a skin scraping… does that hurt a lot?
DOCTOR: The blood draw will cause a brief pinch, Ms. Cassimatis, but it's very quick. And the skin scraping is generally painless – it feels like a gentle scratching. It’s a very simple procedure. We need to rule out some possibilities to get to the bottom of this. It's very unlikely to be something serious, but we need the information to be sure. I’ll explain the procedures in more detail, and we can proceed at your pace. We'll get the tests done here in the clinic. Would you like me to have a nurse draw the blood and perform the scraping now?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary. But please be gentle, okay? And if it hurts, please tell the nurse to stop. I don't want to make a fuss, but I don't like pain. And… is it going to take long? I have a little bit of dinner to start, you know? My sofrito needs a good long simmer. Just… please be quick, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. I will inform the nurse to be as gentle as possible. It shouldn't take long – perhaps 15-20 minutes for both procedures. I'll have her come in now. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a mild emollient cream to help soothe your skin while we await the results. It’s over-the-counter, so you can pick it up at any pharmacy. It’s a simple moisturizer, but it can provide some relief. We'll discuss the results as soon as they are available, and formulate a more comprehensive plan. Do you have any questions before I call the nurse?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good, a cream sounds nice. And no, I don’t think I have any questions. Just… make sure they’re gentle, okay? I really don’t like needles. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you trying to figure this out. It’s just… this itch is driving me crazy. And I'm worried it's something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cassimatis. We will proceed carefully and systematically. I'll ensure the nurse is aware of your anxiety. “Nurse, could you please come in to draw blood and perform a skin scraping for Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. I guess I should… I should roll up my sleeves? And… where do they do the skin scraping?
DOCTOR: Yes, please roll up your sleeves. The nurse will likely scrape a small area on your forearm, and perhaps a small area on your back where the itch is particularly bothersome. She’ll explain the procedure in detail before she begins. Just relax, and let her know if you’re experiencing any discomfort.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Yes, that is all for now. I will leave you to the nurse. .
