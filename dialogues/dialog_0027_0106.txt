DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Fazzina. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you. It’s about my foot. It’s been… troublesome. A sore, really. A nasty one. Been bothering me for weeks now, and it just won’t heal. I’ve tried things, you know. Salves and whatnot. Doesn’t do a bit of good.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that hasn’t been healing for weeks. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it started small. Just a little red spot, really. I didn’t think much of it at first. I walk a lot, you see. Always have. But then it got bigger. And deeper. Now it’s… well, it’s quite painful. Especially when I try to put any weight on it. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. And it… it smells a bit, if I’m being honest. Not a pleasant smell, I assure you. My husband, God rest his soul, always said I had sensitive skin. But this is beyond sensitive. It’s just… awful. And the doctor back home… well, he wasn’t much help. Just told me to keep it clean. As if I hadn't thought of that!
DOCTOR: I see. So it started as a small red spot, has grown deeper and become painful, especially with weight-bearing. And it has a noticeable odor. You’ve already tried keeping it clean, and you weren’t satisfied with the advice from your previous doctor. Thank you for sharing that. To help me understand better, could you describe the appearance of the sore itself?
PATIENT: Appearance? Hmph. What do you want me to do, draw you a picture? It’s… red, of course. And not a nice, healthy red, mind you. It's a sort of… angry red. And there’s some yellowish stuff in the middle. Pus, I think they call it. It’s… not a pretty sight. And the skin around it is all swollen and kind of… hard. It’s not smooth, either. It’s all bumpy and uneven. Honestly, it looks infected. Which it probably is, considering it hasn't healed a bit. It's also quite a bit larger now. Maybe the size of a quarter? A little bigger, perhaps. Though I haven't measured it precisely. I don’t bother with such nonsense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's red, swollen, has yellowish discharge, and is roughly the size of a quarter. That does sound concerning. Now, Louine, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well… I’m tired, naturally. At my age, one is tired. But I’ve been more tired than usual, I suppose. And my legs ache, especially after I’ve been walking. Not just my foot, but my calves, too. And… oh! I’ve been thirstier than usual. Drinking more water, that is. Though, again, one does get thirstier as one gets older. But it seems… excessive. And I’ve been going to the bathroom more often, if you must know. It's a nuisance, really. Constantly interrupting my stories. And sometimes… well, sometimes my vision gets a little blurry. Just for a moment, mind you. Nothing serious. I just thought I was getting old. Is that what you want to know? A litany of old lady complaints?
DOCTOR: No, not complaints at all, Louine. These are all very important things to know. Increased thirst, frequent urination, leg aches, and blurry vision… those can all be connected. Let's take a look at your foot. Could you please take a seat and let me examine it?
PATIENT: Hmph. Connected, you say? Well, I suppose doctors are supposed to connect things. Though half the time, they just seem to poke and prod and give you a bill. Alright, alright. Don't rush me. There. Be careful now. It's quite sensitive. And don't you dare tell me to keep it clean again. I already know that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Louine. I see the sore here. It is approximately 2 centimeters in diameter, with a significant amount of surrounding redness and swelling. The tissue feels warm to the touch, and it’s quite tender when I press on it. There is some yellowish discharge present. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I see here, it appears you likely have an infected wound. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing, but this requires attention. I also want to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have diabetes or any other chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Well, the doctor back home did mention something about my blood sugar being a little high. A little. He said I should watch my diet. Said I ate too many mangoes. Mangoes! As if a few mangoes could cause all this trouble. He said it was “pre-diabetes,” or something like that. He didn't seem too concerned. He said it could be managed with diet and exercise. Though I’ve always been active. Walked every day of my life. I suppose he was right about the diet, though. I do have a sweet tooth. And I like my bread. White bread, of course. The good stuff. As for other conditions… my hips ache sometimes. And my knees. And I get a bit of indigestion now and then. But nothing a little baking soda can’t fix. Oh, and I had a gallbladder removed years ago. A long time ago. Does that matter? Is everything connected, as you keep saying? It’s rather exhausting, all these connections.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of pre-diabetes and a gallbladder removal. Thank you for telling me. The pre-diabetes is important because it can increase your risk of infections and make it harder for wounds to heal. Now, Louine, I want to be thorough. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or redness extending up your leg?
PATIENT: Fever? Not that I’ve noticed. I don’t bother with thermometers. They just give you a number to worry about. Though I do feel a bit warm sometimes. But that's just the weather, isn't it? Always hot here in August. Chills? No. I'm rarely cold. And redness up my leg? Hmm… Well, there’s a little bit of redness around my ankle, perhaps. But it’s always been there, I think. Just a little bit. Probably from my socks. I wear wool socks, you see. They’re quite comfortable. But not particularly fashionable. Is a little redness a problem? You’re making me nervous now, Doctor. Are you going to have to cut off my foot? Don’t tell me you’re going to cut off my foot!
DOCTOR: No, no, Louine, I’m not saying anything about cutting off your foot! Please don’t worry. The redness around your ankle is something I just wanted to check, as it could indicate the infection is spreading, but it's not necessarily a sign of that. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and white blood cell count. We'll also need to send a sample of the discharge from the wound to the lab for a culture to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, I’m too old for all this fuss. But… I suppose if you insist. I just want this sore to heal. It’s been bothering me for weeks now. And I don’t want it to spread. So… alright. Do the tests. But please be gentle. And don’t take too much blood. I get faint easily. And tell me what the results mean. I don’t want any of this “medical jargon.” Just tell me plainly what’s going on. And if it’s something serious, just tell me straight. I'm a sensible woman. I can handle it. Now, let's get this over with. Where do I sit?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Louine. I promise to be as gentle as possible, and we'll only take what's necessary. And I will explain everything in plain language, no medical jargon, I assure you. Please, have a seat right here. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them together and come up with a plan to get your foot healed. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic to start right away. This will help to fight the infection while we wait for the culture results to come back.
PATIENT: Antibiotics, you say? Good. Something is finally being done. I’m tired of waiting. And tired of all the poking and prodding. But… will these antibiotics make me sick? I've heard they can upset your stomach. I have a sensitive constitution, you see. And I don't like being sick. Is there anything I should do to prevent that? Eat yogurt? Take probiotics? Or is that just nonsense? And how long will it take to feel better? I have a bridge game next week. I can’t miss my bridge game. It's very important. And what if these antibiotics don’t work? Will you have to… cut off my foot then? Don't tell me you're going to cut off my foot again! Honestly, Doctor, you're making me very anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s address everything, one at a time. Yes, antibiotics can sometimes cause stomach upset, but it’s usually mild. Eating yogurt or taking probiotics can help to prevent that, so it’s a good idea. You’re right to be proactive. As for how long it will take to feel better, that depends on how severe the infection is and how well you respond to the antibiotics. We'll monitor your progress closely, and I’ll let you know what to expect. We will absolutely aim to have you feeling better well before your bridge game next week. And no, we will not be cutting off your foot. We will try antibiotics first, and if they don't work, we will explore other options. But amputation is a last resort, and we’re not even thinking about that right now. We're going to focus on getting you healed with the antibiotics. Now, the prescription is ready. It’s for amoxicillin-clavulanate. Take it with food, twice a day, for ten days. And please, call my office if you experience any side effects, like severe diarrhea, vomiting, or rash. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Amoxicillin-clavulanate… twice a day with food for ten days. Twice a day… with food. Yes, I can remember that. I always eat breakfast and dinner. Regular meals, you see. Very important for maintaining one’s health. Side effects… diarrhea, vomiting, rash. Well, that doesn’t sound pleasant. But I’ll keep an eye out. I suppose I have to. Hmm… What about my shoes? Can I still wear my sandals? Or should I wear closed-toe shoes? I have a very nice pair of pumps. But they’re not very comfortable. And what about walking? Should I stay off my foot? I like to walk. It’s good for my circulation. But I don’t want to make the infection worse. Honestly, Doctor, this is all very confusing. You’re giving me too many instructions. It's exhausting just thinking about it. And one more thing… will these antibiotics interact with my… shall we say, digestive aids? I take a little something to help with my indigestion. A small tablet after meals. It works wonders. But I don’t want it to counteract the antibiotics. Is that a possibility?
DOCTOR: Alright, let's tackle this one step at a time. Regarding your shoes, it’s best to avoid wearing sandals for now. Closed-toe shoes will help to protect your foot and prevent further irritation. You can wear whatever closed-toe shoes are most comfortable for you. As for walking, you don't need to stay completely off your foot, but please reduce your activity level for a few days. Avoid strenuous walking and try to rest as much as possible. Now, regarding your digestive aids, it's a good question to ask about potential interactions. What's the name of the tablet you take?
PATIENT: Here. It's called… Pep-Ease. It’s an over-the-counter tablet. For indigestion. Contains simethicone, I think. And something else. I don’t bother reading the labels. My daughter buys it for me. She worries about my digestion. It doesn’t usually interact with anything. But you never know, do you? Everything seems to interact with everything these days. Honestly, it's a miracle I’m still alive. It's probably just a waste of time checking, but my daughter would have my head if I didn’t ask. She’s a very sensible girl. A lawyer, you see. Always thinking about potential liabilities. It's exhausting just thinking about it all. The antibiotics, the shoes, the walking, the digestive aids… And now, I’m sure I’m forgetting something.
DOCTOR: Okay, Pep-Ease contains simethicone and should be fine to continue taking. It doesn’t interact with the antibiotic. Alright, Louine, I think we've covered everything. To recap: Take amoxicillin-clavulanate twice a day with food for ten days. Wear closed-toe shoes. Reduce your activity level for a few days. Continue taking Pep-Ease as needed. Call my office if you experience any side effects. Do you have any further questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. Though exhausting, as I said. And I do appreciate you taking the time to explain everything in plain language. Most doctors just mumble medical jargon and expect you to understand. I suppose I should go now. I have a bridge game next week, you know. I can’t miss my bridge game. Thank you again, Doctor. And if anything goes wrong… well, I know where to find you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Louine. I'm glad I could help. Please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And I hope you enjoy your bridge game! Have a good day!
