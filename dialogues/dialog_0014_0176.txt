DOCTOR: Alright, Ivette, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Osterholm. It’s these… hiccups. They just won’t stop. Been going on for two days now, at least. It's really quite annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. And not just little ones, either. Some are big. It’s making it hard to… well, do anything really. I manage a little resort, you see, and it's hard to talk to guests when you're constantly… hic …doing that.
DOCTOR: Resort management… that does require a bit of talking. Two days of constant hiccups… have you tried anything to get rid of them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, you name it! Holding my breath, drinking water upside down… my daughter told me about that one. Tried startling myself, which just made me jump, not stop hiccuping. Even a spoonful of sugar. Nothing seems to work. It’s just… hic …relentless.
DOCTOR: Right. Holding your breath, water… sugar. Standard attempts. And these hiccups… are they pretty constant, or do they come and go in bursts?
PATIENT: They come and go, but mostly come. There's maybe… ten, fifteen minutes a couple times where they quiet down, and then they start up again, sometimes worse than before. It's really interfering with everything. I had to send a guest away earlier because I couldn't properly explain the booking details with all the… hic …interruptions.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, pretty consistent hiccups with brief periods of relief. Have you had anything like this happen before, Ivette?
PATIENT: Not like this, no. I get the occasional hiccup, like anyone, after a fizzy drink maybe, or eating too fast. But never… hic …this long. And definitely not this many. It's just… odd. I haven’t changed anything in my diet or routine, so I don’t understand what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No changes in diet or routine. Let's run through a little bit of your medical history, just to rule things out. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was all sorted. Other than that… hic …just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. No serious illnesses, no allergies, nothing like that. I don't take any regular medication either.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, otherwise healthy. No allergies or medications. And family history… anything significant there?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes, but that’s about it, really. No history of… hic …anything neurological, if that’s what you mean. No one in my family ever had hiccups that lasted this long, that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, no long-lasting hiccups in the family. Okay. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want these… hic …things to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here for me. I’m going to listen to your breathing first. Deep breaths in and out, if you can. Breathing sounds clear. Heart rate is a little elevated, probably from the… hiccups. Now, open your mouth for me, please. Let me take a look at your throat. Throat looks normal, no obvious irritation or swelling. No sign of anything blocking your airway.
PATIENT: Okay. Everything looks normal, you say? It’s just… hic …really frustrating. I feel perfectly fine otherwise, which makes it even stranger.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything appears normal. Which, frankly, is the frustrating part. Sometimes hiccups are just… hiccups. But two days is a bit long. Given your history, and the physical exam, I don’t think it’s anything serious, but we should rule a few things out. I’m going to order a basic blood test to check your electrolyte levels and rule out any underlying metabolic issues. And just to be safe, I’m going to order a chest X-ray to make sure there’s nothing pressing on your diaphragm. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I mean, I'd rather be sure. Blood test and X-ray, yes. I just want to get back to running the resort. It’s… hic …difficult to explain things to tourists when you keep interrupting yourself.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology. It might take a day or two to get the results. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a medication called baclofen. It's a muscle relaxant that can sometimes help with persistent hiccups. Start with a low dose, as directed, and see if it makes a difference. Here's the prescription. And I’ll also give you a handout with some general advice for managing hiccups. It won’t cure it, but hopefully it can provide some temporary relief. We'll follow up once the results are back. If the hiccups get significantly worse before then – if you have trouble breathing, experience chest pain, or start feeling dizzy – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Emergency room… right. That’s good to know. No, I don’t think so. Baclofen… I’ll read up on it. Chest X-ray and blood test. Okay. Just… hic …hoping this works. Thank you, Doctor Osterholm.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ivette. We'll get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns. And the handout has the number for the clinic, if you need to reach us. Get those tests done as soon as you can, and we'll talk again soon. Hopefully, we can get these hiccups under control. .
PATIENT: Alright. I will. Thank you again, Doctor. Hopefully, it won’t be too long before they stop. hic …It’s a terrible thing, really. Goodbye.
