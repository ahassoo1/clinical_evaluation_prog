DOCTOR: Talofa Jaylyne, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this ringing in my ears. It’s been happening for a bit now and it's starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. That's also known as tinnitus. And you said it's been happening for a “bit now” – could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, tinnitus… that’s what I thought it was called. Um… let me think. It started maybe… three months ago? It wasn’t constant at first, just now and then. But the last month or so it’s been pretty much all the time. It’s… annoying, to be honest. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I understand, that sounds really frustrating. Three months, starting intermittent and now pretty constant… Okay. Is it in one ear or both?
PATIENT: Mostly in my right ear, I think. Sometimes I hear it a little in the left, but it’s definitely worse on this side. It’s not a loud ring, more like… a high-pitched whine, you know? Hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A high-pitched whine is a common description. And just in the right ear mostly. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… when it’s really quiet, it’s worse. Like at night, trying to sleep. And maybe if I’m stressed? I work as a waiter, so it can get pretty hectic sometimes. I haven't really noticed anything making it better, though. Just… hoping it goes away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so quiet environments and stress seem to be triggers. That's helpful to know. Have you been exposed to any loud noises recently – like concerts, machinery, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Work gets noisy with people talking, but nothing loud, you know? Not like a club or anything. I went to a wedding a couple months ago, there was a band, but I wasn’t right next to them. I don’t think that would be it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No, not really. Maybe a little tired, but that's probably just work. I haven't had any dizziness or trouble hearing things, just the ringing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness or hearing loss. And you haven't noticed any pain in your ears?
PATIENT: No pain, no. Nothing like that at all. Just… this constant whine. It’s just really getting to me when I try to relax. It makes it hard to focus.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick examination of your ears, just to rule out anything obvious. Then we can talk about potential causes and what we can do about it. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaylyne, your ear canals look clear, no signs of wax build-up or infection. Your eardrums look normal as well, no visible damage. I'm going to check your hearing briefly with a simple tuning fork test. Close your eyes for me. Okay, that sounds like it’s travelling evenly to both ears. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, just as a general check. Everything sounds normal there as well. Given your symptoms and what I’m hearing, it sounds like you're experiencing tinnitus. It's a common condition, and often – though not always – there isn't a single identifiable cause. Do you have any allergies, or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. And no medications either, I don't take anything regularly. I don't even really like taking Panadol if I have a headache. So, no cause… what does that mean? Is it just something I have to live with? That’s… a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jaylyne. “No cause” doesn’t necessarily mean we just ignore it. Sometimes tinnitus is linked to things like stress, muscle tension in the neck, or even minor changes in blood flow. Other times, it can be related to noise exposure, even if it wasn't recent or particularly loud. Because your exam was normal, and you don't have any other symptoms like dizziness or hearing loss, it's less likely to be something serious. We can start with some strategies to manage the symptoms. There are things we can try to help you cope with the ringing and reduce its impact on your daily life. Would you be open to discussing some of those options?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. Anything to make it better. I’m really tired of hearing that whine all the time. What kind of strategies are we talking about?
DOCTOR: Okay. One common approach is something called tinnitus retraining therapy, or TRT. It involves using sound therapy – like listening to white noise or nature sounds – to help your brain habituate to the ringing, so it becomes less noticeable. We can also explore relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises or mindfulness, to help manage any stress that might be contributing to it. There are also some over-the-counter options, like melatonin, which can sometimes help with sleep if the ringing is keeping you awake. I can also refer you to an audiologist, who specializes in hearing and tinnitus. They can do a more comprehensive hearing test and discuss more advanced treatment options if needed. How does that sound as a starting point?
PATIENT: That sounds… okay. The sound therapy I get. Stress, I can try to work on. But an audiologist… does that mean something is seriously wrong with my hearing? I just want it to go away, not have to go for more tests and stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Jaylyne. An audiologist referral doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong with your hearing. They can do a more detailed assessment to rule out any underlying issues and provide personalized recommendations. Think of it as gathering more information, just to be sure. They can also teach you specific techniques for managing your tinnitus, even if they don’t find anything abnormal. It’s a good idea to have a baseline test, and then we can monitor things from there. We can start with the sound therapy and relaxation techniques, and see how you do. If things don't improve after a few weeks, we can discuss the referral. Does that sound more comfortable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds better. Start with sound therapy and relaxation. And then, if it doesn't get better… we’ll talk about the audiologist. What kind of sound therapy are we talking about? Is it something I have to go somewhere for, or can I do it at home? I work long hours, so something at home would be easier.
DOCTOR: That’s a great question. You can absolutely do it at home. There are many apps and websites that offer sound therapy programs specifically designed for tinnitus. We can also discuss using a simple white noise machine or even just listening to calming music. The goal is to find a sound that’s pleasant and can help mask the ringing, especially at night. I can give you a list of recommended apps and resources. Start by listening to the sound therapy for about 30 minutes each day, and see if it makes a difference. I'm also going to give you a handout on relaxation techniques, including deep breathing exercises and mindfulness practices. Do you have any questions about any of that before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that sounds… manageable. Apps and relaxation, I can definitely try that. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you explaining everything. It’s a bit of a relief to have a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. I'm glad I could help. Remember, tinnitus is common, and many people find ways to manage it effectively. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns along the way. I’ll print out those resources for you now, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to see how you're doing. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, a month sounds good. That gives me time to try things out. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you in a month.
