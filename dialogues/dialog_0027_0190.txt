DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been… experiencing some unsteadiness. It’s difficult to explain, precisely. I feel… off balance, sometimes. It’s been happening for a little while now, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteadiness… and you said for a little while now?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… hard to say how long, exactly. Months, perhaps? It comes and goes. Not constantly, thankfully. It’s just… unsettling when it does happen. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right, comes and goes… and when it happens, can you describe how it feels?
PATIENT: It’s… like the room is tilting, sometimes. Or… like I’m swaying, even when I’m standing still. Not a dizzy spell, exactly. More… a loss of… grounding? It’s difficult to articulate. I apologize. Is that making any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that… that does make sense. Tilting, swaying… a loss of grounding. Okay. And does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I haven’t noticed anything specific, no. It doesn’t seem to be related to any particular activity. It’s happened when I’m resting, when I’m walking… even when I’m simply standing. I work in oil and gas, you see… Rotary Drill Operations. It’s… a physically demanding job, and I suppose I initially attributed it to that. But it’s persisted.
DOCTOR: Okay, rotary drill operations… physically demanding. Right. And have you experienced any other symptoms along with this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I’m aware of, no. No headaches, no blurred vision… no ringing in my ears. Just… the unsteadiness. Oh… My… my husband passed away last year. It’s been a difficult time, naturally. Perhaps… stress? But I wouldn’t think that would cause something like this. Would it?
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly manifest in physical ways, Lilyanna. It's important to consider all factors. Okay. Let’s move on to some other questions. Have you had any issues with your hearing or balance in the past?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I’ve always had… reasonably good hearing, I believe. And I’ve never experienced anything like this before. As a child… well, I don’t have many clear memories, to be honest. But as an adult… no, nothing. I do sometimes feel… a little more fatigued than I used to, but that could be the job, again. It’s long hours.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take a look at your medical history in the system. It says here you've had no prior significant medical issues. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. No allergies to medications, food… nothing. I’ve always been… quite healthy, all things considered. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. Though, clearly, something is going on now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your ears, your eyes, and do a quick balance test. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just sit here for me. First, let's take a look at your ears. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light. No obvious signs of infection in either ear. Any dizziness or ringing in your ears when I move your head like this?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. No dizziness… no ringing. Just… the usual sense of… imbalance, perhaps. It's not worse with the movement, if that makes sense. It's just… present. A faint sensation, like standing on uneven ground. Even when I'm perfectly still.
DOCTOR: Okay, now, can you stand with your feet together, and try to keep your balance?
PATIENT: Oh… It’s… difficult. I’m not as steady as I usually am. Perhaps it's the shoes? They have a small heel.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It is a little unsteady. And yes, the shoes could be a factor. Now, let’s try standing on one leg for a moment. Which leg feels more stable?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s… not good, is it? It’s… both legs feel rather unstable, actually. But I suppose… my left leg feels slightly more… grounded, perhaps. Though not by much. I haven’t fallen, thankfully, but I’m certainly not as steady as I normally am. This is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you mentioned your job is physically demanding?
PATIENT: Yes, very. Rotary Drill Operations… it involves a lot of standing, walking on uneven surfaces, climbing… and sometimes working in… less-than-ideal conditions. The platforms can be quite unstable, even with the safety measures in place. It’s possible this is related, of course. I just… hadn’t expected it to affect me this way. I’ve been doing it for several years now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your recent loss, the unsteadiness, and your physically demanding job, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. It could be related to inner ear issues, a neurological concern, or even be related to fatigue and stress. I'd like to order a few tests, just to be safe. First, a comprehensive blood workup to check for any underlying deficiencies or inflammation. Then, an MRI of the brain to rule out any neurological issues. And finally, I'd like you to see an audiologist for a hearing and balance assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds sensible. Thorough, certainly. MRI… that doesn’t involve radiation, does it? I’ve… read things. And the audiologist… that’s to check my hearing, specifically? Yes, I understand. That sounds… a little overwhelming, to be honest, but if it’s necessary… then yes, I’ll do whatever you recommend, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: No, the MRI does not involve radiation. It uses magnetic fields to create an image of your brain. And yes, the audiologist will assess your hearing and balance specifically. We’re just covering all bases, Lilyanna. It’s important to rule out any serious underlying causes. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab and schedule you an appointment with the audiologist. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Will the tests… take long? And… will they be painful? I understand they’re necessary, but… I’m not very good with medical procedures.
DOCTOR: The blood work will only take about 15-20 minutes, and it will involve a small needle prick – nothing more than a typical blood draw. The MRI will take about 30-45 minutes, and you'll be lying still on a table inside the machine. It can be a little noisy, but it shouldn’t be painful. You’ll have headphones to wear. And the audiologist appointment will involve a series of simple hearing tests. None of them should be uncomfortable. I’ll give you detailed instructions for each test before you leave. And if you have any concerns during any of the procedures, please don’t hesitate to let the staff know. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Fazzina. You’ve been very… patient and thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I… I feel a little less anxious now. If you need anything from me, please don’t hesitate to ask. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. It’s my job. We'll get these tests scheduled and go from there. Please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. Here are the instructions for the tests, and the contact information for the lab and the audiologist. Take care, and I'll see you soon. .
