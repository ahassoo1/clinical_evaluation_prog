DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom thing. Seems like I’m always going. More than I used to, that’s for sure. It’s… irritating, to put it mildly. Don't remember when it started exactly, just… recently, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing increased urinary frequency, and it's become bothersome recently. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Bothersome is… putting it nicely. It interrupts things, you know? I used to be able to… well, I think I used to be able to go longer between trips. Now, it feels like I just finish and then… not long after, gotta go again. Especially at night. Wakes my wife, poor thing. Though, honestly, she sleeps like a log, so maybe it doesn't bother her as much as I think. It’s just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency during the day and at night – what we call nocturia. And it's disrupting your sleep and daily activities. Is there any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. A little discomfort sometimes, but not… pain. Burning… hmm. Maybe a little. It's hard to say, Doctor. I’m not one to fuss about little things, you know? It's not like a fire, if that’s what you mean. Just… a little sting now and then. Mostly just the constant trips are what get to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no significant pain, just occasional stinging, and the main issue is the increased frequency. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color… now that you mention it… maybe a bit darker? I drink plenty of water, always have, but… yeah, darker than it used to be, I reckon. Smell… I don’t spend a lot of time smelling my urine, Doctor. Sorry to be blunt, but it's not a hobby of mine. My wife might notice, she’s got a good nose for things, but I haven’t asked her. She's busy enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Darker urine is something we’ll want to look into. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Let me think. Old age, that’s one. Seriously though… I had something with my heart a long time ago, they put a little… thing in it. A pacemaker, that's it. And my blood pressure… the doctor always says it’s a little high, but he gives me a pill for it. Can’t remember the name, sorry. As for diabetes… I don't think so. My wife always watches what I eat, keeps me from getting too carried away with the sweets. Never had any trouble with my kidneys, not that I know of. A lot of aches and pains, of course, but that’s just getting old, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, pacemaker for a heart condition, high blood pressure managed with medication, and no known history of diabetes or kidney problems. Do you know what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Now that’s a good question. Honestly, Doctor, I leave all that to my wife. She fills the little pill boxes every week. I just… take them. It’s a white one, I think. Smallish. She has a list somewhere, in the kitchen, with all our medications. I’m terrible with names and numbers these days. Don't hold it against me. It’s just… a lot to keep track of, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to have trouble remembering medication names. We can look it up in our system, or your wife can bring a list next time if that’s easier. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything besides your heart condition?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long, long time ago. And a hernia, years later. Aside from the heart thing, that's about it. Hospitalized… not much. A couple of times for the heart, of course. And I broke my arm once, falling off a ladder. But nothing major, nothing recent. Mostly just… getting old and creaky. It’s a wonder I haven't broken more things, frankly. Always been a bit clumsy.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy, hernia repair, and hospitalizations for your heart condition and a broken arm. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father had something with his heart, I think. Similar to mine, maybe. He passed away when I was young. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had trouble with her… joints, I think. Arthritis or something like that. Lots of aches and pains, like me. And my sister… she had… I don’t know. Something with her stomach, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I wasn't very good at remembering things even then. Honestly, Doctor, we weren’t a family that talked much about medical things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems and arthritis, potentially stomach issues as well. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would kill me. Drink… I used to, a little bit, back in my younger days. A glass of wine with dinner now and then. But I don’t much care for it anymore. Makes me feel… sluggish. Recreational drugs? What kind of a question is that, Doctor? I’m seventy-four years old! I don’t even know what the young people are doing these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drug use. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I get a bit itchy when I’m around cats, but that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… don't like ‘em. And I think I had a reaction to some kind of antibiotic once, years ago. Made me break out in a rash. But I can't remember what it was called. My wife handles all that too, keeps track of what I can and can’t take. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel like a bit of a burden, just rattling off all the things I don’t remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild sensitivity to cats and a past rash from an unknown antibiotic. It’s alright, you’re not a burden at all. It's helpful for me to have this information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. That’s just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s going to involve any… poking and prodding. My joints aren’t what they used to be. But yes, go ahead. Do what you have to do. Just try to be gentle, if you wouldn’t mind. And let me know if you find anything… alarming. I’m not a young man anymore, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 85. A little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular with a normal rate, pacemaker functioning as expected. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some fullness in your bladder. No tenderness to palpation. Alright, that was quick. It's good that there’s no pain. Based on what you've told me and the exam, the most likely cause of your increased urinary frequency is an overactive bladder, possibly with some bladder retention. It’s common as men get older. But to be sure, I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for infection, and a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you empty it. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Urinalysis… post-void… those are… big words, Doctor. Sounds serious. But if that’s what you think is best, then yes, go ahead. I trust your judgment. As long as it doesn't involve anything too… invasive. I'm not a fan of needles, if you know what I mean. And if it turns out to be something serious… well, I suppose we’ll deal with it then. Just try to keep me informed, alright? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The urinalysis is just a simple urine sample – you’ll just need to provide a cup. The post-void residual volume is done with a quick ultrasound – it doesn't involve any needles or discomfort. It's just like a quick scan of your bladder. The nurse will explain everything in detail. In the meantime, I recommend limiting caffeine and alcohol intake, and trying to urinate at regular intervals, even if you don't feel a strong urge. We can discuss medication options if the tests confirm an overactive bladder and these lifestyle changes aren’t enough. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… that sounds… manageable. Less coffee… my wife will be happy to hear that. She’s always telling me I drink too much. And regular intervals… I suppose I can try that. As long as it doesn’t involve setting an alarm, I can live with that. So, no needles, just a urine sample and a quick scan? Alright. That sounds… alright. Let’s get it over with, then. The sooner we know what’s going on, the better. Just… don't keep me waiting too long, alright? I’m not a young man, remember?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. The nurse will be in shortly to collect a urine sample and schedule the ultrasound. It shouldn't take long at all. And I’ll review the results with you as soon as they're available. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, Doctor. Just this… bathroom thing. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man ramble. And thank you for not making me feel like a complete idiot for forgetting everything. That’s half the battle, you know.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, and you certainly don’t make you feel like an idiot. It's perfectly normal to have trouble remembering things, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. The nurse will be right with you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Take care, Mr. Segretto.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate your kindness.
