DOCTOR: Hi Mackenzi, it’s nice to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Chriselda. Well, um… it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe I have a clearance appointment? It feels a bit… distant in my memory, truthfully. My husband… he helped with the arrangements, before… well. But I think it’s for cosmetic surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. A pre-operative appointment for cosmetic surgery. I understand things can be a little hazy when you're dealing with a lot, and it sounds like you've been through some changes recently. I see here you're scheduled for a tummy tuck with Dr. Lawson on August 15th. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Dr. Lawson… August 15th… Yes, that does sound right, now that you mention it. My husband spoke with him, I believe. He… he did most of the talking with the doctors. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s good to know it’s all documented, though. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's perfectly alright. We have all the information here. Before we proceed with clearance, I need to get a good understanding of your overall health. Let's start with a little bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s a bit difficult. I… I believe I was generally healthy. My husband always took care of the check-ups and things. I don’t recall any specific diagnoses, no. I might have had… slightly high cholesterol at one point? But it wasn’t serious, I don’t think. He handled all of that. I’m terribly sorry I can’t be more specific.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can work with that. It’s common for things to be a bit fuzzy, especially if you weren’t actively involved in managing your healthcare. Let's talk about any surgeries you’ve had in the past. Even minor ones are important to know about. Do you recall any previous surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, I believe. And… oh! I had a rather nasty fall a few years back, and I needed stitches on my arm. Nothing major, thankfully. Aside from those two things… I don’t think so. I really didn’t have much need for surgery before this. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Tonsils as a child and stitches on your arm. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: My family… That's a bit sensitive, truthfully. My parents… they both passed away when I was quite young. And I don’t have any siblings. My husband’s family… they live in Colombia. I wasn’t very close to them, I’m afraid. I don’t… I don’t really know much about their medical history, if that makes sense? I'm so sorry, I wish I could be more assistance.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mackenzi. You're not obligated to share anything you're not comfortable with. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s alright if details are difficult to recall or if you don’t have access to that information. Let’s shift gears a little. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me see. Before… I used to take something for… mild anxiety, I think. Just occasionally, when things got stressful. But I haven’t taken anything regularly in quite some time. And no, nothing over-the-counter or supplements, not at all. I try to eat healthy, mostly. I'm quite certain about that, at least. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No current medications or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. My husband always double-checked with the pharmacists, just to be safe, but I’ve never had any issues. It's wonderful to know that I don’t have any allergies, that’s one less worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, before everything… I enjoyed gardening quite a lot. My husband and I had a beautiful little garden. I spent most of my time outdoors, tending to the flowers and vegetables. Now… I don’t do as much, truthfully. It’s… difficult to find the motivation, sometimes. I try to take short walks when the weather is nice, but… it's not the same. I do enjoy cooking, though. I find it very therapeutic.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Gardening and cooking. Before we proceed, just one last question about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. Never. My husband and I… we both believed in a very healthy lifestyle. We didn’t partake in any of those things. I don’t even like the smell of cigarettes, truthfully. So, no, none of those things, never have. I'm certainly not a smoker, drinker or anything like that. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s great, thank you. Okay, Mackenzi, that gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to make sure everything is in order before your surgery. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I trust your judgment completely. I want to ensure everything is as safe as possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Breathing normally… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 128/78, pulse is 72 and regular. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Finally, I’m going to take a look at the surgical site. Surgical site appears clean, no signs of infection. Okay, everything seems to be in good order. I’d like to order some routine blood work, just to double-check your levels and ensure you’re healthy enough for surgery. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood work seems very sensible. Yes, please do. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary to ensure everything goes smoothly. Thank you for being so thorough, Chriselda. I feel much more reassured now. Do I need to do anything specific to prepare for the blood work?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. I'm glad I could reassure you. For the blood work, you'll need to be fasting for at least 8 hours beforehand, so no food or drinks except water. The lab is located just down the hall, and they'll give you specific instructions when you arrive. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have those, I'll review them and contact you to discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Um… 8 hours fasting, no food or drinks except water. Yes, I can manage that. That's… quite straightforward. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything so clearly. I suppose… I’m just a little anxious, understandably. But I feel much more confident now, knowing that you’re taking such good care of me. Thank you again, Chriselda. Truly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious before surgery. Just remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Once your blood work results are back, we'll have a better understanding of your overall health and can proceed with confidence. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here's a copy of the lab order and some aftercare instructions for the blood draw. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: That’s wonderful. Thank you so much. No, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve been incredibly helpful and kind, Chriselda. I truly appreciate your patience and understanding. I feel much more at ease now, knowing that I’m in such capable hands. I will be sure to call if I have any further questions. Thank you again, for everything. .
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Mackenzi. We’re here for you. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. See you soon.
