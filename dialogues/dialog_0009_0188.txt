DOCTOR: Good morning, Criston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I... um... my pee is orange. It started a few days ago. Not sure why. It worries my wife a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine, started a few days ago. That’s good you’re getting it checked out, and it’s wise of your wife to encourage that. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More… like, how dark orange? It's not super dark, like… more like a light orange, you know? Like… orange juice, but not as bright. And it doesn't hurt when I pee. Just… the color is different. I drink a lot of water, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, light orange, resembling orange juice but not as bright, and no pain with urination. That’s helpful. And you mentioned you typically drink a good amount of water—about how much would you say per day?
PATIENT: Um… maybe two, three big bottles? Like, the ones that are… one liter? I try to finish them. Sometimes more if it’s hot. I work outside sometimes, fixing things. So I drink when I'm thirsty. I don’t really keep track, exactly.
DOCTOR: Two to three liters a day is good hydration generally. It’s good you increase intake when you’re working outside. Now, have you noticed any other changes in your urine?
PATIENT: No… not really. Same as always, just… the color. No foam, no… bits, nothing like that. Just orange. And it doesn’t smell different. I checked. My wife made me check. She’s a little worried.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear—no changes in smell, consistency, or any other symptoms. Your wife sounds very attentive, which is wonderful. Let's talk a bit more broadly. Have you had any changes in your bowel movements recently?
PATIENT: No, no changes there. Everything is… normal. Like usual. Sorry if that's too much information. I just want to tell you everything. It's just pee is orange and I don't know why.
DOCTOR: No, not at all—it’s good you're sharing everything. It's my job to gather as much information as possible. Now, have you noticed any fatigue or feeling more tired than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a little? I work long hours, fixing things for people. So I'm always a little tired. But… maybe a little more than usual. Hard to say, really. It's been hot, so I figured it was just the heat. I haven't been sleeping as good, either. But that's probably just the heat too.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased fatigue, possibly related to the heat and disrupted sleep. And you mentioned fixing things for people – is that your full-time job?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m a technician. I fix machines and… things. Air conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines… all sorts of things. It's hard work, and sometimes dirty. I’m outside a lot, like I said. So maybe I'm just… dehydrated, even if I drink water. I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a technician, hard work, often outdoors. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to palpate your abdomen. Then I’ll check your skin for any signs of dehydration. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I hope you find out what's wrong with my pee. It worries my wife. She keeps offering me more water.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… everything sounds clear there. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Okay, no tenderness noted there. Your abdomen is soft and non-distended. Your skin feels warm and has good turgor—not obviously dehydrated. I do notice some mild dirtiness on your hands and forearms. Overall, you don’t appear significantly dehydrated, but we should still rule out other causes for the orange urine. I'm going to order a urinalysis – a simple urine test. It will check for things like blood, sugar, and infection. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I don't take any regular medicines, either. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache. But that's it. A urine test… okay. How long will that take? And will it tell me what’s wrong with my pee?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, no regular medications. Good to know. The urinalysis usually takes about 15-20 minutes to get the results back. It won't necessarily tell us definitively what's wrong, but it will help us narrow down the possibilities. Orange urine can be caused by a number of things, including dehydration – which we're not seeing strong evidence of – certain medications, or sometimes it can be a sign of a liver issue, though that's less common. We'll also check for a urinary tract infection. Let me get that test started for you.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. I hope it's nothing serious. My wife will be very happy to know you're checking it out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Criston, I have the results of your urinalysis. Fortunately, everything looks normal. No blood, sugar, or signs of infection. The specific gravity is slightly elevated, which can indicate mild dehydration, but it’s not significant. There are no abnormal findings that would explain the orange urine. Given the normal results, the most likely cause is something you’re taking, even intermittently, or possibly a dietary factor. Do you recall taking any vitamins or supplements recently?
PATIENT: Vitamins… um… I sometimes take a multivitamin, but not every day. And… oh! My friend gave me some pills for my muscles, after I hurt my back a few weeks ago. They're orange. I took a few of them, maybe three or four, over the last week. I forgot to tell you.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful information, Criston. Muscle pills, orange in color. It’s highly likely that’s the cause of the discoloration. Some vitamins and supplements, especially those containing beta-carotene or high doses of vitamin B, can cause urine to appear orange. I recommend stopping the muscle pills and see if the color of your urine returns to normal over the next 24-48 hours. If it doesn’t, or if you develop any other symptoms, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. I will stop taking them. Thank you, Doctor. You're very good. My wife will be so relieved. I'm sorry I forgot to tell you about the pills.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Criston. It's common to forget things, and I'm glad you remembered. We're here to figure things out together. So, just stop the muscle pills and monitor your urine color. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s everything. Thank you for your help. You've been very kind. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Criston. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day too, and please give your wife my best. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes.
