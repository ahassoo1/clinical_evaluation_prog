DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I have… pain. It’s been bothering me for a while now, and it’s getting worse. I want to get it checked, if you don’t mind, and hopefully get it fixed. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Reihner, you’re not a bother at all. That’s what I’m here for. “Pain,” you say. Can you tell me more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s in my back, low down. It started… hmm… about three months ago, I think. It was just a little ache then, after working. I do fence work, you see. Heavy lifting, bending… that sort of thing. It’s gotten sharper lately. And it doesn’t go away even when I am resting.
DOCTOR: Three months, starting with an ache after work, and now sharper, even at rest… Alright. And when you say "fence work," is that… building fences, or something else?
PATIENT: Yes, building fences. Real fences. Wood mostly, sometimes wire. It's… physical work. I’ve been doing it for a long time, since before… well. It’s how I make a living. And it’s getting harder to do, with this pain. It makes me worry.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s impacting your ability to work. That is concerning. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache, most of the time. But when I move wrong, or try to lift something… it shoots. Like a… a hot knife. And then it stays sharp for a bit. It goes down my leg sometimes, too. Not always, but when it does… it’s hard to walk.
DOCTOR: A shooting pain down the leg… That gives me a little more to consider. Is it only one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one. My right leg is fine. It’s always the left. And it’s not constant, the shooting part. It comes and goes. It’s hard to explain. I don't know all the medical words.
DOCTOR: You don’t need to know medical words, Ms. Reihner. Just tell me what you’re feeling, and I'll do my best to understand. So, the shooting pain is in your left leg. Does anything relieve the pain at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… not much, really. Sitting helps a little, if I sit just right. And sometimes, if I take a hot bath, it feels better for a short time. But it always comes back. Painkillers don’t do much, either. I tried some, but they didn't really help, and I don’t like taking them anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sitting and hot baths provide temporary relief. Painkillers aren't effective. Do you have any numbness or weakness in your left leg or foot?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything feels… normal, as far as I can tell. I can walk, I can stand. It just… hurts. Sometimes, when I've been working a long time, my leg feels a little tired, but not weak. I don't drop things, or anything like that. It's just… pain. A lot of it.
DOCTOR: Okay. No numbness or weakness. That’s good. Now, Ms. Reihner, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever had any injuries to your back?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Years ago, when I was younger, I fell off a horse. Broke my collarbone, but I also hurt my back pretty bad. They didn't have good doctors then, where I was living. Just wrapped it up tight, and told me to rest. It healed, but it never felt quite the same. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. A previous injury like that could certainly be contributing to the problem. And… did you receive any treatment for it at the time, besides having it wrapped?
PATIENT: No, not really. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t have much money. The doctor just wrapped it and told me to take it easy for a few weeks. I worked through the pain, mostly. I had to. There wasn’t much choice. I didn't go back for follow-up. I just… learned to live with it. Until now, I mean. This is worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, Ms. Reihner, do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time, as you can tell. I get Medicare, so they send me those… those papers sometimes, asking about things, but everything’s always been fine. I don’t take any regular medicines, except for a little something for my blood pressure, but that's all. It's been stable for years.
DOCTOR: Alright, stable blood pressure medication. And no other medical conditions. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, ever. I've never had to worry about that. Is that everything? I just want to get this figured out, if you don't mind. I have things I need to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Reihner, we’re almost there. Just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never smoked a day in my life. I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I definitely don’t use any… those things. I have never. I just want to get my back fixed, if that’s possible. I have fences to build.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, Ms. Reihner, I think it’s time we do a quick physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. I'll just need you to lie down on the examination table, and we'll take a look. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… I hope you can find something wrong. I need to know what’s going on, and if it can be fixed. It's getting harder and harder to work.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Reihner. We'll do our best to figure things out. Please, lie down on your back, if you can. I'll start by listening to your back, and then we’ll check your reflexes and strength. Okay, Ms. Reihner. I'm just going to listen to your back now. Take a deep breath in… and out. Good. I'm not hearing anything unusual. Now, can you point to exactly where the pain is the worst?
PATIENT: It’s… right here. And it goes down my left leg, sometimes, like you said. Not always, but it shoots down there. It feels… tight, too. Like a muscle is always pulled. And it hurts when I bend over.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some tenderness here… and here. There’s some muscle spasm as well. Now, can you bend forward for me, Ms. Reihner?
PATIENT: Ouch! That… that really hurts. I can't go much further. It feels like something is blocking me. And the pain shoots down my leg when I do that. I can't do that very well. It's been getting worse, you see? It’s hard to move.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. That's enough for now. Now, I'm going to lift your left leg straight up in the air. Just let it go loose. Tell me if you feel any pain. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: Yes. It hurts. Not right in my leg, but… right here. It shoots down my leg when you lift it up. Like a… like an electric shock. It’s… not good. I hope it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. That's enough for the physical exam for now. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may have a lumbar radiculopathy, which means a nerve in your lower back is being irritated or compressed. The history of a previous injury and the pain radiating down your leg are consistent with that. It could be caused by a herniated disc, spinal stenosis, or other issues. Now, to confirm this, I’d like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. That will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An MRI? Is that… is that serious? Will it hurt? And what will it show? I don't know anything about this… this lumbar thing. And what if it is bad? Can it be fixed? I just… I need to know. I have fences to build, you see. I need to get back to work. I just want to get this sorted. I don't like the sound of this at all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Reihner. It's natural to feel anxious when you're facing something you don't understand. An MRI is a painless imaging test that uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your spine. It doesn't involve any radiation. It will show us what's causing the irritation of the nerve, whether it's a herniated disc, stenosis, or something else. As for whether it can be fixed, that depends on what we find. Many cases of lumbar radiculopathy can be treated successfully with conservative measures like physical therapy, pain medication, and injections. In some cases, surgery may be necessary, but that's usually a last resort. We'll discuss all of your options in detail once we have the results of the MRI. For now, let's focus on getting that scheduled. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that sounds alright. Scheduling it is fine. But… how long will it take to get the results? And can I still… can I still work while I’m waiting? I need to know if I can keep building fences. I have customers waiting. And I need the money. It's… it's important. Please, tell me I can at least try to keep working.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about work, Ms. Reihner. It's good you're thinking ahead. The results of the MRI usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back. As for working while you wait, I recommend avoiding heavy lifting, bending, and twisting until we know more. It's hard to say definitively if you can continue working at all, but I would strongly advise you to modify your activity and listen to your body. If you experience any increased pain, numbness, or weakness, you should stop immediately. I'm going to write you a note explaining your condition and recommending these modifications. I’ll also give you a prescription for a mild muscle relaxant to help with the pain and spasm. We'll take this one step at a time, Ms. Reihner. Let's get the MRI scheduled, and then we'll discuss the results and come up with a plan that works for you. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that sounds acceptable. A note and the medicine… that's good. And getting the MRI scheduled. Yes. Please, just get it done as quickly as possible. I just want to know what’s going on, and what I need to do. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very helpful. When can we schedule the MRI? And… is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Reihner. I’m glad I could help ease some of your worries. Let me see… The closest MRI facility is at City Hospital. They have an opening tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes. Tomorrow at 2:30 PM is fine. That works. And… is there anything I should do to prepare for it? Anything I need to bring? I don’t want to make a mistake. And… will it take long? I have things I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve scheduled you for an MRI at City Hospital tomorrow at 2:30 PM. As for preparation, you'll need to remove any metal objects like jewelry, watches, and piercings before the scan. You’ll also need to complete a safety questionnaire to ensure you don’t have any contraindications. It should take about 30-45 minutes. The technician will be able to give you more specific instructions when you arrive. In the meantime, continue taking it easy and avoid any activities that aggravate your pain. I'm going to print out the note for work, the prescription for the muscle relaxant, and the MRI appointment confirmation for you. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Pirl. You've been very kind. I appreciate your help. I hope… I hope the MRI doesn’t show anything too bad.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Reihner. I’m glad I could help. We’ll take it one step at a time. Remember, we don’t know anything yet. Try not to worry too much. If you experience any worsening symptoms before your appointment tomorrow, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow to discuss the results. If you have any trouble getting to the appointment, give us a call. .
