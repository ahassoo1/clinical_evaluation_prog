DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Tayar, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh... travel. I need... paper for travel. My wife... she liked travel. Now... now I go. Need the paper. For go. Is that right? I don’t... I don't know what they call it. Paper for go places.
DOCTOR: “Paper for go places…” Right. Are you referring to a travel vaccination record, perhaps?
PATIENT: Vacc... what? Look, I just need what they ask for at the airport. Before... before. She always took care of it. Now... it’s for my trip. I go to... uh... Nepal. To visit family. But they need... something. Before I go. Is that what you do here? Make the… the thing?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you need documentation of your immunizations. We can certainly review your records, but frankly, I’m a bit confused. Are you saying you're travelling to Nepal, or from Nepal?
PATIENT: From. I… I live here now. But I go to Nepal. To see… my mother. She is old. I haven’t seen her... a long time. Before... everything. So I need... the paper. So they let me in. Is that what you do? Check I have… the right things? Before I go back? I don't understand all the questions.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you’re returning to Nepal to visit your mother. We need to ascertain what vaccinations Nepal requires for entry from the United States. Do you have any record of previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: Previous…? Like… when I was a little boy? In Nepal? I don’t... I don't think so. We didn’t… keep papers like that. Just... got the shots. Doctor man with a needle. That's all. Nothing written down. My wife… she had everything. Lists and folders. I don't… I lost a lot of things.
DOCTOR: Very well. We may need to repeat some vaccinations, then, to ensure you meet Nepalese entry requirements. Do you recall which vaccinations you received, even approximately?
PATIENT: Repeat…? Oh. No. I... I don't remember. So many years. Little boy, yes. Maybe… yellow fever? I think I remember something about… a yellow paper. But… everything is blurry. My head... it’s not so good. Before... it was better. I just want to go see my mother.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to proceed cautiously, then. Nepal does require proof of yellow fever vaccination for travellers arriving from certain countries – though the US is currently not on that list. But it's best to be safe. We'll also want to assess your general immunization status. Let's start with a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Exam…? Like… check my heart and… things? Is it… painful? I don't… I don't like doctors much. But… if you say so. If it gets me to Nepal. Okay. But… quickly, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard procedure, Mr. Tayar. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick look in your ears and throat. Please, sit here. And I assure you, it won’t be long. Relax your arm.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. But… is there a fee for this? My insurance… it’s not very good. My wife… she handled all that too. I don't… I don’t want surprises. Just tell me before you do things.
DOCTOR: Your insurance will cover the standard consultation and exam. We can discuss any potential additional costs – like vaccinations – before proceeding. Blood pressure is 130 over 85. Slightly elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Now, let's listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Okay… good. Not too much money. My wife… she always got the best insurance. A little cold here. And… and… I have a cough, sometimes. Not much. But… when the weather is bad.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear, but I do detect some mild wheezing. Any history of asthma, or allergies?
PATIENT: Asthma…? No. Never. My mother… she has asthma, sometimes. But not me. Allergies… maybe dust? When I clean. But nothing… serious. I don’t… I don't take medicine for anything. Not usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No… no fever. Not lately. I… I get tired, sometimes. But that's… because of work. And… and… everything. No chills. Weight… I haven't checked. Everything is… different now. I eat less. But… I just want to go see my mother.
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on this preliminary exam, and your description, it appears you may be experiencing mild post-viral symptoms. The wheezing suggests some airway inflammation, but it’s not acute. We still need to assess your vaccination status for travel to Nepal. I recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung issues. Would you consent to that?
PATIENT: X-ray…? Like… the machine? Is it… dangerous? My wife… she always said those machines were… not good. But… if you think it's important. To see my mother? Yes. But… quickly. And… and tell me how much it costs before you do it. I don’t… I don't want a big surprise.
DOCTOR: The X-ray involves minimal radiation exposure, and the benefits outweigh the risks in this case. It's a standard diagnostic tool. The cost will be approximately $250, though your insurance may cover a portion. We'll have the results in about an hour. In the meantime, I will need to review your chart further. Do you have any family history of serious illness – particularly respiratory issues, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Auto… what? My mother… she has old age. And… and she coughs sometimes. But that’s just… old age. My father… he died of a heart thing. Long time ago. We… we didn't talk about sickness much. Just… dealt with it. No… no one had… those fancy illnesses. Just… things. And… now I need to go to Nepal.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll proceed with the chest X-ray. A technician will come shortly to escort you. After that, we can discuss the necessary vaccinations for your trip. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… no questions. Just… can I call my mother after? To tell her I'm getting closer? I… I haven't spoken to her in so long. It will… make her happy. Is there… a phone I can use?
DOCTOR: There’s a phone by the reception desk. You can use it after the X-ray. I believe the call will be charged per minute, however. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. The technician will be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Thank you. Expensive phone… but worth it.
