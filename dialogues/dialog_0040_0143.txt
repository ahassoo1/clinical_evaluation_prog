DOCTOR: Right, well, let's get this over with. Mr. Verrall, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Smith Verrall. It’s… good to meet you, Doctor… Osga, is it? I think I read that somewhere. It’s just… a lot on my mind these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, Osga. Look, no need to bother with pleasantries. Just tell me what's brought you in today. Briefly, if you could. I have a very full schedule.
PATIENT: Oh, right. Sorry. It’s… about starting a family. I mean, thinking about starting a family. A friend… a good friend… suggested I come talk to someone first. Just to… make sure everything’s okay, you know? Before… well, before we try. It’s a bit… late in life, maybe, for this, but… here I am.
DOCTOR: “Late in life”?
PATIENT: Yes, well… I’m 66. Not exactly a young man anymore, am I? I just… want to be sure I’m not… causing any problems. For anyone. My friend said something about… things getting harder when you’re older. And… I don't really understand all of it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, your friend is… not entirely wrong. Look, at 66, things are harder. Significantly harder. We’re not talking about a simple process here, Mr. Verrall. Have you… had children before?
PATIENT: No, never. No children. Always… meant to, I suppose. Things just… didn’t work out. Life got in the way. That’s all. I… I don't really know what I should be telling you. Is there a list of questions? Would that be easier?
DOCTOR: A list. Yes. Eventually. First, let’s get some basics. Do you have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Let me think. I had… the flu, maybe, a few years back. Nothing serious. And my back, it aches sometimes. Old age, I think. I see a chiropractor now and then. Does that count? I… I don’t really go to the doctor much. I always figured if it wasn’t broken, don't fix it.
DOCTOR: A chiropractor is not a doctor, Mr. Verrall. And “old age” isn’t a diagnosis. Any high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? I… I don’t know. I’ve never had it checked, I don’t think. Not that I remember. Is that something I should have been checked for? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at this. I just want to make sure… everything’s alright. For the baby, if it… happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just take your vitals then. It's fairly standard procedure. I need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and weight. Then, we'll do a quick physical exam. Don't bother getting dressed yet.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you need. I… I haven’t weighed myself in ages. I think I put on a bit, maybe. Not much, hopefully.
DOCTOR: 160 over 90. Hmm. That’s… elevated. And your pulse is a bit irregular. Yes, definitely irregular. Weight is 141 pounds. Height?
PATIENT: Oh. Is that… bad? The blood pressure? I… I didn’t even know what it was supposed to be. And my height… let me think. I always thought I was about… six feet? Maybe a little less. Around 168 centimeters, perhaps? I'm not very good with numbers, you see.
DOCTOR: 168 centimeters is approximately five foot six. And yes, your blood pressure is significantly elevated. We need to address that before we even consider anything else. This significantly increases your risk of… complications. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything… cardiac related?
PATIENT: Cardiac…? Oh, no. Not that I remember. No heart problems, no. I mean, I get a little breathless sometimes when I climb the stairs, but that’s just… getting old, isn’t it? I never thought it was anything serious. I… I used to walk a lot, years ago. Before… well, before things changed.
DOCTOR: "Things changed?
PATIENT: Oh, um… just… life, really. Got a bit busier, more stressful. Less time for walking, more time… working. Then… my friend got sick. It took up a lot of my time, looking after him. It was… difficult. I just… stopped doing the things I enjoyed. I suppose that’s it. Not a very good explanation, is it?
DOCTOR: Let’s not delve into your life story, Mr. Verrall. We’re here to discuss your medical situation. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No. Nothing at all. Never really been one for taking pills. Always figured if I could avoid it, I would. I… I try to stay healthy. Eat my vegetables, mostly. Although I do enjoy a good biscuit with my tea. Does that count against me?
DOCTOR: Alright, well, given your age and blood pressure, attempting to conceive is… highly inadvisable. The risks are substantial.
PATIENT: Oh. Oh dear. I… I see. Substantial risks? What kind of risks? For… for the baby? Or… for me? I just… I thought… my friend said it might be possible. He said… sometimes people can still have families, even later in life.
DOCTOR: Possible, yes. Advisable, absolutely not. Risks for both, Mr. Verrall. For you, increased risk of heart attack, stroke… complications during… any potential pregnancy attempts. For the baby… increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities, birth defects, and… sadly, a high chance of miscarriage. I strongly advise you consider alternative options, such as… adoption. Or simply… accepting that starting a family may not be feasible at this stage in your life.
PATIENT: Oh. I… I see. That’s… a lot to take in. Miscarriage… That sounds awful. I… I didn't realize it would be so… dangerous. Adoption… My friend mentioned that, too. It just… wasn’t what I had in mind. I… I just wanted to… have a piece of me, you know? Something to… carry on after I’m gone. What… what about treatment? Could I… lower my blood pressure? Would that help?
DOCTOR: Treatment could lower your blood pressure, yes. But it's a long process, and frankly, at your age, the risks of the medication itself are considerable. And even if you did manage to get it under control, there's no guarantee that it would eliminate all the risks associated with attempting conception. Frankly, Mr. Verrall, I don't recommend it. I suggest you schedule an appointment with a cardiologist to discuss your heart health. And perhaps… a therapist to help you process your… desires. Here's a referral to a local cardiologist. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I see. A therapist… right. No. I… I don’t think so. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate your honesty. Just… one last thing. Is there anything at all I can do? Even if it’s just… a small chance? Is there any test we can do, to see if… if everything’s okay? Before… before I give up completely?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Verrall. I've already explained the risks. A semen analysis could technically assess your sperm count and motility, but honestly, given your age and blood pressure, the results are likely to be… unfavorable. And it won’t change the underlying health risks. But… fine. I'll order the test. Just to appease you. But don’t get your hopes up. And schedule that cardiologist appointment. Immediately. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. I will… I will schedule the appointment. Thank you for… everything.
