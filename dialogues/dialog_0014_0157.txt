DOCTOR: Hello, Tasmia. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, it’s probably just stress. My husband… well, he’s a lot. It’s probably nothing serious, but my primary care doctor wanted me to get it checked out, just to be safe. Can we hurry this up? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Stress. Of course. Well, we always want to be thorough, even if it feels like nothing serious. Just to cover all our bases, you understand. The nurse did mention elevated blood pressure readings. Have you been feeling any…symptoms alongside that?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Look, I feel tired, okay? Everyone's tired. And maybe a little headache sometimes. But I work full time, I have a house, I have a husband. What normal person doesn't have a headache? I don’t need a list of things to feel for. Is that going to take long?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “everyone” doesn’t necessarily have consistently elevated blood pressure. And headaches can be relevant. Just trying to get a complete picture here. Okay, let’s start with some basics. Do you have any history of high blood pressure in your family?
PATIENT: My grandma on my mom’s side, I think? She was… old. Everyone gets sick when they get old. And my uncle smokes. Does that count? He definitely has problems. But nobody really talks about it. It’s just… family. Can we move on? This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Right. Family history… noted. Okay. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just my birth control. And sometimes ibuprofen, if I really need it. Not often. Look, I eat okay, I try to exercise when I can, and I don't drink or do anything crazy. I'm not some unhealthy person. Is this going somewhere, or are we just making a list of things I don't do wrong?
DOCTOR: Very well. Allergies?
PATIENT: Pollen. Bad. Makes me sneeze. And dust, sometimes. That’s it. Really. I’m not allergic to cats or dogs or anything fancy. Just regular stuff. Can we please get this over with? My husband is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be certain. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, the usual. It won’t take long. Just sit back and relax… as much as you can, I suppose.
PATIENT: Fine. But if you poke me too hard, I will say something. And hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are…regular, but a bit forceful. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is, as the nurse indicated, elevated. 148 over 92. Reflexes are normal. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything seems… structurally normal. But the blood pressure is concerning. Have you had any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision? No. Not that I’ve noticed. It’s…fine. I see things. Look, I told you it was probably just stress. My husband has been…difficult lately. He expects a lot. Is that going to show up on some kind of test? Because I’m telling you right now, it’s not a medical problem, it’s a husband problem. Can we just write a note saying I’m stressed and send me home?
DOCTOR: Well, stress can elevate blood pressure, certainly. But we can’t rule out other causes without some basic blood work. Just routine things—check your kidney function, rule out any electrolyte imbalances, things like that. It's standard procedure. I’m going to order a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel. And I think it would be prudent to get an EKG just to see what’s going on with your heart. It's better to be safe than sorry, alright?
PATIENT: An EKG? Seriously? For a little stress? My husband is going to be furious if I’m gone much longer. Look, I really don't think this is necessary. I’m perfectly healthy. I just…have a lot going on. Can't you just give me something for my blood pressure? Something to calm me down? I don’t need a bunch of tests.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re frustrated, Tasmia. But I’m a doctor, and my job is to investigate potential problems, not simply prescribe medication without knowing the cause. We need to rule out anything serious before we consider long-term treatment. I'm going to order the blood work and the EKG. The nurse will draw your blood now, and then we can get you scheduled for the EKG. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a very low dose of a beta-blocker to help manage your blood pressure until we have the results. It's not a long-term solution, just something to take the edge off. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…hurry. And make sure it doesn’t interact with my birth control. My husband will have my hide if anything goes wrong. Do I at least get a note saying what’s going on, so I can explain why I was gone so long?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll write a note for your husband explaining that you came in for elevated blood pressure and are undergoing some basic testing. It won’t go into detail, just a general summary. The nurse will go over the medication instructions with you and explain any potential interactions with your birth control. Here you go. The nurse will be in shortly. Let’s get these tests ordered. .
