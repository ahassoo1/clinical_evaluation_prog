DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so let's get right to it. It’s my stomach. Food comes back up, you know? Regurgitation, the nurse called it. It's… unpleasant. And it happens pretty often, especially after I eat. Frankly, it’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Altine. It's certainly frustrating when something like that disrupts your day. “Regurgitation” is a good way to describe it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: When? Honestly, like I said, after meals. Doesn't matter what meals, really. Big meals, small meals…doesn’t seem to make a difference. Though, lying down too soon after eating is… not a good idea. I try to avoid that. But sometimes, you just want to relax after a good dinner, you know? It’s not my fault. And it’s mostly solids, not just liquid. Which is… worse.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that, Mr. Altine. Knowing it's mostly solids is helpful. And you’re right, lying down shortly after eating can certainly contribute. You mentioned it happens after most meals. Roughly how often would you say this occurs?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… most nights, yes. Three, four times a week, easily. Maybe more if I have a particularly…filling meal. Look, I eat normal food. Good food. It’s not like I'm eating spicy peppers all day. It's just…happening. It’s incredibly inconvenient, and I'm not getting any younger, you know? I need to be able to enjoy my retirement.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine, and your desire to enjoy your retirement is absolutely valid. Three to four times a week is quite frequent. Now, when the food comes back up, do you experience any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? Pain? No, not usually. A little heartburn sometimes, a burning sensation, but nothing I can't ignore. It’s mostly just… the unpleasantness of it all. And the taste, naturally. It’s not a good taste. I don't have trouble swallowing, or any coughing. It just… comes back up. Simple as that. I don't need a fancy diagnosis, just a fix.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Altine. No pain or difficulty swallowing is good to know. Heartburn, even occasional, is relevant, though. I’d like to ask a few more questions to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, even unintentional?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I'm a little too comfortable these days. Being retired has its downsides, let me tell you. I haven't been sick, haven't had any changes in my appetite, just… this. And it’s been going on for a while now, maybe six months or so. I just figured it would go away on its own. Clearly, it hasn't. Look, I eat like a normal person. I don’t understand why this is happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months is a significant duration. No changes in appetite and no weight loss are good indicators. Now, regarding your diet – you mentioned eating "normal food." Could you describe a typical day of meals for me?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not going to list everything I eat. It’s normal food. Breakfast? Eggs, toast, sometimes bacon. Lunch? A sandwich, maybe soup. Dinner? Meat, potatoes, vegetables. I don’t eat fast food every day, if that’s what you’re getting at. I enjoy a good steak, a roast chicken. I'm not a picky eater. It's all sensible food. Honestly, I take pretty good care of myself. I just… have this issue. It's really quite annoying. I don’t need a lecture on healthy eating, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Altine, and I wasn't intending to lecture you. Your description of your diet is helpful. It sounds quite balanced. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Pre-existing conditions? Not really. High blood pressure, years ago, but it’s managed with medication. Other than that? Nothing. I've been generally healthy my whole life. I don't smoke, I drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, nothing excessive. I’m a practical man, alright? I take care of myself. I don’t go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to, and frankly, this is becoming an absolute necessity. It’s ruining my evenings.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Altine. Knowing you have a history of managed hypertension is important. And the fact that you otherwise maintain a healthy lifestyle is very good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides those for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. I take it every morning, like the doctor told me. Nothing else. No supplements, no over-the-counter medications, nothing. I'm a simple man, remember? I don't clutter my body with unnecessary things. It's just… this reflux thing. It’s disruptive, unpleasant, and I’m running out of patience. What’s causing it? And more importantly, how do we fix it?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Altine. Lisinopril is helpful to know. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. I will listen to your heart and lungs, and gently palpate your abdomen. This will help me rule out any obvious causes and assess your overall condition. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not a fan of being poked and prodded, but if it’s going to get me closer to a solution, alright. Fine. Just be quick about it. I have things to do, you know. Don’t spend all day on it. And tell me what you're doing before you do it, I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I will explain each step as I go. First, I will listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. This is just to ensure everything sounds normal. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I will gently palpate your abdomen, feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't detect any tenderness or masses. No apparent guarding or rebound tenderness.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Everything feels… normal, as far as I can tell. It’s just that… burning sensation after eating, and then the food coming back up. It doesn’t happen every time, but it’s frequent enough to be incredibly annoying. So, what does that mean? What's causing it? I'm not getting any younger, you know. I want to enjoy my retirement, not spend it worrying about regurgitation. Give it to me straight, Doctor. Don’t beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, based on your history, physical examination, and the fact that you are taking Lisinopril, the most likely cause of your symptoms is medication-induced esophagitis, potentially exacerbated by gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Lisinopril, like other ACE inhibitors, can sometimes cause irritation of the esophagus. The intermittent nature of your symptoms, coupled with the heartburn you experience, also supports this possibility. However, to rule out other potential causes and confirm the diagnosis, I recommend a few further steps. Would you be amenable to an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus and stomach?
PATIENT: An… endo-what? Look, I don't like the sound of that. Is it painful? And what are we looking for, exactly? I don't need a camera shoved down my throat if it's just something simple. Can't we just try something else? Maybe a different blood pressure pill? I’ve heard those things have side effects. Honestly, I’m not thrilled about putting a camera inside me just to confirm what feels pretty obvious. Is there any other way?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Altine, and I assure you, we can explore alternative options before resorting to an endoscopy. It's a valid concern, and I wouldn’t recommend it lightly. An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus to visualize the lining and check for inflammation or damage. It's typically well-tolerated with sedation, and we can discuss that further if you're inclined. However, before that, we can try a trial of a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, such as omeprazole, to reduce stomach acid production. This can often alleviate symptoms of GERD and esophagitis. We can also discuss adjusting your lifestyle – elevating the head of your bed, avoiding late-night meals, and limiting trigger foods like caffeine and alcohol. Would you be willing to try a PPI for a course of eight weeks and see if your symptoms improve?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. A pill sounds a lot better than a camera. Eight weeks… that seems reasonable. What kind of side effects does this… PPI thing have? I don't want to trade one problem for another. And what if it doesn’t work? Then we’re back to the camera, aren’t we? I just want this resolved, Doctor. It’s been six months, and I'm tired of dealing with it. But, yes, let’s try the pill. Get it over with. Just tell me everything I need to know about it, alright? No surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I understand your concerns and want to ensure you are fully informed. Omeprazole, the PPI I’m recommending, is generally well-tolerated. Common side effects, when they occur, are mild and can include headache, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. Long-term use of PPIs has been linked to a slightly increased risk of certain infections and nutrient deficiencies, which is why we will monitor you during your eight-week trial. If your symptoms do not significantly improve after eight weeks, we would then discuss further investigation, including the possibility of an upper endoscopy. However, let's focus on the PPI trial for now and see how you respond. I will write a prescription for omeprazole 20mg once daily, to be taken 30 minutes before a meal. I also recommend elevating the head of your bed by 6-8 inches, avoiding eating within three hours of lying down, and limiting caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods. Do you have any questions about these instructions?
PATIENT: No. I think I understand. Pill before food, elevated bed, no late-night meals, lay off the booze and spicy stuff. Got it. And you’ll check me after eight weeks? Make sure it’s not making things worse? Alright. Let’s just get this prescription written and get it over with. I have a retirement to enjoy, you know. And honestly, I’m not getting any younger. The sooner this is resolved, the better. Thank you, Doctor. Let’s wrap it up, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I understand. I've written the prescription for omeprazole and I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in eight weeks to assess your progress. We will discuss your symptoms then and determine if any further investigation is needed. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any unusual side effects, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Here is your prescription, and the nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Altine, and I'm hopeful we can resolve this issue and get you back to enjoying your retirement.
