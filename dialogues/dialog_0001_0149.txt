DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell, is it?
PATIENT: Wynell. Yes, that's right. Though, honestly, all these papers... I don't even remember signing half of them. What exactly are we talking about today, young man? You don't look old enough to be a doctor, you know.
DOCTOR: Well, I assure you, the medical board doesn't ask about my age. But alright, let's get down to business. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s this…fuss. People keep wanting to do things. Poke and prod, run tests… Honestly, I just want to be left alone. I’ve lived a long life, you know. A very long life. And I’ve had enough of doctors telling me what I need. My daughter keeps pushing me, but frankly, she worries too much. What is the point of all that bother anyway?
DOCTOR: So, you're not really here with a specific complaint, you’re here because people are… encouraging you to get checked out?
PATIENT: Encouraging is putting it mildly. More like nagging. And it's my feet, mostly. They ache, of course. What feet don't ache at my age? But they're not… dangerous. They just are. My daughter keeps saying something about circulation, and swelling… I honestly don’t pay much attention. It all sounds like nonsense to me. I used to be a podiatrist, you know. I knew what was going on with feet. I could tell you what was wrong with your feet, probably. Though, I doubt I could remember now... Everything gets a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: A podiatrist, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! A very good one, too. Before… well, before things changed. Before my husband… oh, never mind. The point is, I know about feet. I don’t need anyone telling me what’s going on with them. They just want to give me pills and make me miserable. No, thank you. I've seen enough of that in my practice, believe me. People coming in with all sorts of problems because of the things doctors did to them. It's a racket, that's what it is.
DOCTOR: Right. So, let’s just clarify… you’re experiencing foot pain, but you’re primarily concerned about unwanted medical intervention?
PATIENT: That's a… a decent way of putting it, I suppose. The pain isn’t terrible. It’s just… there. A constant reminder, really. But I’d rather just deal with it myself. Honestly, I’ve managed perfectly fine for years. I don't need a young doctor like you telling me what I should be doing. I just want to be left in peace. Is that too much to ask? And honestly, your office is rather cold. Do you have a blanket?
DOCTOR: We can adjust the thermostat. But first, let’s try and get a little more information, even if you don't think it’s necessary. Where exactly is the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, really. It's not one specific spot. More like… a dull ache all over. Mostly in the soles, I think. And sometimes in the ankles. It's hard to say, honestly. Everything sort of blends together at my age. I used to be able to pinpoint everything immediately when I was practicing, but now… it’s all a bit of a muddle. I suppose it’s worse when I stand for too long. Though, I don’t do much standing these days. My daughter insists on taking me shopping, which is dreadful, really. All those hard floors…
DOCTOR: And is there any swelling associated with the pain?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Sometimes, maybe? I honestly can't say for certain. My ankles do feel a bit… thick, at times. But that could just be… weight, I suppose. Or old age. It's hard to tell. I’ve never really paid much attention to swelling. It's never bothered me enough to mention it to anyone. Honestly, all this questioning is making my head spin. Are you trying to trick me into agreeing to some sort of procedure? Because I’m telling you now, I won’t fall for it.
DOCTOR: No, ma’am, I’m not trying to trick you into anything. I’m simply trying to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Let's try this… have you noticed any changes in the color of your feet or toes?
PATIENT: Color… oh dear. That's a bit of a strange question, isn’t it? I suppose… they’re a bit paler than they used to be. But then again, I’m a bit paler than I used to be. Everything fades with age, you know. I haven’t been out in the sun much lately, so that could be it too. Honestly, I don't spend much time looking at my feet. They’re just… feet. What’s there to look at? Are you sure you haven’t got the wrong patient? Perhaps you meant someone else… a woman with a more… dramatic foot problem?
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any sores or blisters on your feet?
PATIENT: Sores… blisters? Oh, no. Nothing like that. I take pretty good care of my feet, considering. I clip my toenails, though my daughter always complains I don’t do it right. She fusses over everything, really. No, no sores, no blisters. Just… aches. And a bit of paleness. Honestly, I think I’m starting to feel a bit faint. Are you sure this office isn't too cold? Maybe I should go home. I'm not sure I like all these questions… It feels like an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me quickly examine your feet, just to get a visual assessment. It won’t take long. Can you please remove your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Must we? I have these rather nice stockings on. They're a bit delicate, you know. And my feet… well, they're not a pretty sight, I assure you. Years of practice, years of walking… they're not the feet of a young woman. But… I suppose. If you insist. Though, I warn you, don’t expect anything pleasant. My daughter always says I have terrible circulation, but I ignore her. Where should I put my shoes? And please, be gentle. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: You can place them over there. Okay, I see some mild edema bilaterally, and the skin appears somewhat pale. I'll also palpate your pulses briefly to assess circulation. Just relax.
PATIENT: Edema? Bilaterally? What does that mean? Honestly, I always hate it when doctors use fancy words. It makes me feel like I’m back in school, being lectured to. And touching my feet like that… it's rather impersonal, don’t you think? I used to do this all the time, to my patients, but it always felt… different. More caring. You’re just poking and prodding. And that’s awfully cold hands, young man. Are you sure you’re not catching a chill? Honestly, I think my daughter is right. I shouldn't have come. It's just a waste of my time. And it's making my feet even colder!
DOCTOR: Your pulses are present, but somewhat diminished. Alright, let’s just say your feet are showing some signs of reduced circulation. Now, I understand you're hesitant about further testing, and I respect that. But to rule out any serious underlying issues, such as peripheral artery disease, I recommend a simple ankle-brachial index test. It’s non-invasive, painless, and can give us a better understanding of what’s going on. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Ankle-brachial what? Honestly, the names these tests have these days! It sounds terribly complicated. And you keep saying “non-invasive,” but everything feels invasive when someone is poking around your feet. And diminished pulses… what does that mean? Is something seriously wrong? My daughter will have a field day with this, I just know it. She'll be telling everyone I'm on my deathbed. Look, I'm not sure. I really don't like the sound of any of this. Is this test… expensive? And will it take long? I have a hair appointment this afternoon, and I absolutely refuse to be late. Honestly, I think I just need to rest my feet and put up with the aches. That’s what my grandmother always did, and she lived to be ninety-five!
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s table the test for now. But given your history and the examination findings, I strongly recommend you see a podiatrist for a proper evaluation. They’re better equipped to address foot-specific concerns and can advise you on appropriate treatment options. I can provide you with a referral. And yes, it is likely your daughter will worry. But wouldn’t it be better to have a clear understanding of what’s going on, just for peace of mind?
PATIENT: A podiatrist, you say? As if I haven’t already been a podiatrist. Honestly, young man, are you even listening to me? I know about feet! I used to fix feet! I don't need another podiatrist. They'll just try to sell me expensive inserts and tell me to wear better shoes. It's a racket, that's what it is. And my daughter… she'll just insist I go to her podiatrist, the one who charges an arm and a leg for everything. No, thank you. I think I've had enough for today. I just want to go home and rest my feet. And get a nice cup of tea. I'm not interested in referrals, or tests, or anything else. Just… let me go. .
