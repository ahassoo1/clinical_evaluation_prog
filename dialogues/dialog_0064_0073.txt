DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the receptionist. It’s my stomach. Been…well, it’s been a mess. And nothing seems to fix it. Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time for this.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. The receptionist gave me a brief overview, but it’s always best to hear it directly from you. “A mess” is pretty broad, though. Can you tell me a little more about what’s been going on with your stomach?
PATIENT: It’s…diarrhea. Okay? Constant diarrhea. For weeks. I’ve tried everything. Over-the-counter stuff, you know, the stuff the commercials yell at you about. Nothing works. It just…keeps going. And it’s embarrassing, frankly. I haven’t left the house in days unless absolutely necessary. Is that enough detail for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. Weeks of diarrhea is certainly concerning, and I can appreciate how disruptive and embarrassing that must be. You mentioned trying over-the-counter medications…which ones specifically, if you recall?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think… Imodium, mostly. And…Pepto-Bismol. Pink stuff. That didn't do a thing. Honestly, they all feel like water running through me. Like I haven't even taken anything. And I don't even want to think about the…bathroom situation. It's just awful. Look, do you need a list of every single brand I’ve wasted money on? Because I can probably make one. It'll be long.
DOCTOR: No, a list isn't necessary, Ms. Woodring. Knowing you've tried Imodium and Pepto-Bismol is good enough for now. They’re common first steps. It sounds like they haven’t provided any relief, which is why we need to investigate further. Have you noticed anything with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Like…what do you mean? It's…diarrhea. It comes out of me. Is there a special way it’s supposed to be coming out? I don’t know. It's just…liquid. Sometimes there's…things in it. I don't really look, if you want to know the truth. It's disgusting. Are you trying to get me to describe the…contents? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, no, please don't feel you need to go into detail about the…contents. I apologize if my question was too direct. What I meant was, have you noticed any blood, mucus, or undigested food in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… sometimes there's a little bit of red. Not a lot. Just…a little. I figured it was just from… straining, you know? From being in the bathroom so much. It's not like… a huge amount. I just assumed it was from irritation. And yes, definitely undigested food. That’s…also part of why I’m here. It feels like whatever I eat just…goes straight through me. I haven't even been hungry lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important information, Ms. Woodring. The small amount of blood and the undigested food… those things warrant further investigation. Now, besides the diarrhea and the blood, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I've been really tired. Just…exhausted. Even more tired than usual, and I’m always tired. And my stomach… it cramps. Bad cramps. Like someone’s twisting a knife in there. And… I guess I've been a little nauseous sometimes. Not throwing up, just… feeling like I might. Everything feels awful, honestly. It's a miracle I even came in today. I just wanted it to stop. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Fatigue, cramping, nausea… those symptoms combined with the diarrhea and blood point towards a few possibilities. I want to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just listening to your abdomen and feeling around a bit. Will that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And don't poke around too much. I don't want to make things worse. Honestly, I don't see what good poking my stomach is going to do. But whatever. Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as gentle as possible, Ms. Woodring. I'm just listening for any unusual sounds and checking for tenderness. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen… just breathe normally. Okay. Sounds are a little…hyperactive, which isn't surprising with the diarrhea. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, right there! That hurts. Not like… stabbing pain, but… definitely tender. Everything feels tender, to be honest. But that spot especially. Are you trying to find where it’s all coming from? Because I’m telling you, something is wrong. It’s not just a little stomach bug, okay? I just know it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful information. Tenderness in the lower right quadrant… that’s something we need to investigate further. Now, I’m going to ask some questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think. My appendix came out when I was a kid. A long time ago. And…I was in the hospital for a few days once when I broke my wrist. That's it. Nothing major. And…my husband… he passed away a few years back. That's why I have the private insurance. But other than that, no. I'm a pretty healthy person, usually. This is…completely out of character for me. Honestly, it’s scaring me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and a broken wrist. And I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Woodring. That must have been very difficult. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or food?
PATIENT: No. None. I eat pretty much anything. And I haven’t had any allergic reactions to any medicines I've ever taken. I don’t take a lot of medicine, usually, but I haven’t had any problems when I have. I just…took the over-the-counter stuff for this and it didn’t do anything. That's the only medicine I've taken recently. Is this going to take much longer? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: No, we're almost finished with the initial part of the examination. Just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I told you, I don’t take a lot of pills. I don’t believe in loading up on medicine unless I absolutely have to. My husband always said…well, never mind. No medications, no vitamins, no supplements. Just…this awful diarrhea. Look, can we just get some answers? I’m tired of feeling sick, and frankly, I’m tired of talking about it. Is there anything you can do to help?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I assure you I’m doing my best to figure out what’s going on. Given your symptoms – the prolonged diarrhea, the blood, the cramping, the fatigue, and the tenderness in your lower right quadrant – I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be an infection, a flare-up of something else, or something more serious. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some tests. A stool sample to check for bacteria or parasites, and a blood test to look for inflammation and rule out other conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests. Of course. More waiting, more poking and prodding. Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Just…get it over with. And can you tell me what you’re looking for? I don't want to just sit here and wait for results without knowing what's going on. I need to know if it's something serious. Honestly, I’m starting to get really worried. Can you tell me, straight up, if you think it could be something bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concern, and I want to be honest with you. Given your symptoms, we need to rule out a few possibilities, some of which are more serious than others. An infection is possible, but we also need to rule out inflammatory bowel disease, like Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis, and, although you had your appendix removed as a child, we have to consider the possibility of a complication in that area. That’s why the tests are important. The stool sample will help us identify any bacteria or parasites causing the diarrhea. The blood test will help us assess the level of inflammation in your body and rule out other conditions. I’m not trying to scare you, Ms. Woodring, but I want to be thorough and make sure we get an accurate diagnosis. It’s most likely an infection, which is treatable with medication, but we need to confirm that first. The tests will give us the information we need to determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Inflammatory bowel disease? Complications from my appendix? This is ridiculous. I just have a bad stomach. I don’t have some fancy disease. But… fine. Do the tests. Whatever. Just… please tell me when I can expect the results. And can you prescribe something for the diarrhea in the meantime? I can’t keep living like this. Even over-the-counter stuff would be better than nothing at this point. I just want it to stop. Is that too much to ask?
