DOCTOR: Hi Lonell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Polczynski. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here today, if you will, to determine if my… situation qualifies for assistance with care at home. Or perhaps, hospice care, if that is the appropriate term. My daughter suggested I schedule this visit.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're exploring options for support at home, possibly including hospice care. That's a good step to take, and I'm happy to help figure things out. Let's start with what's been going on that makes you think you might need that level of care. Can you tell me a bit about what's been happening with your health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, as you likely see in my file, I am a surgeon. Or was a surgeon. I specialized in children, for many years. But about six months ago, I began to have… difficulties. With my hands, mostly. Tremors, a lack of precision. It made operating… impossible, naturally. Then, about two months ago, I was diagnosed with… a neurological condition. Parkinson's, I believe. It is… progressing. Walking is becoming difficult. Simple tasks, like dressing, require significant effort. My daughter, Elodie, is very helpful, but she has a family of her own. It is… a strain, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Parkinson's diagnosis six months ago, progressing over the last two months with increasing difficulty with mobility and daily tasks. It sounds like it’s significantly impacting your quality of life. And it's good Elodie is helping, but understandably it's a lot for her. Just to clarify, when you say "simple tasks like dressing," could you describe those difficulties a bit more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is… frustrating, to be honest. Buttoning shirts, for example. The buttons are so small. And the coordination… it is diminished. Also, pulling up socks. It sounds trivial, yes? But it requires such… focus. And strength. And sometimes, I simply… freeze. While attempting to get dressed. It is difficult to explain. A temporary inability to move. It is… unsettling. Elodie assists me with these things now. Mostly. It is… a decline, to put it mildly. I used to be entirely self-sufficient.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly frustrating, and it’s completely understandable why you're feeling that way. Difficulty with fine motor skills, buttoning shirts, pulling on socks, and those freezing episodes… those are all consistent with Parkinson’s progression. And it's a big change to go from being entirely self-sufficient to needing assistance. Let's talk a bit more broadly. Besides the hand tremors and difficulty with dressing, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes. There is… fatigue. A constant weariness. Even after a full night of sleep, I feel… depleted. And my speech… I believe it is slightly slurred at times. Not always, but Elodie has mentioned it. Also, my balance is… precarious. I have not fallen, thankfully. But I feel unsteady on my feet. And… sometimes, my thoughts are… slow. It is difficult to articulate. A slight… mental fog. These things began gradually, but have become… more pronounced in recent weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, slurred speech, balance issues, and some cognitive slowing… That paints a clearer picture. These all can be associated with Parkinson’s, and it sounds like they are becoming more noticeable. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or sleep patterns, besides the fatigue?
PATIENT: That is a… a fair question. My sleep is… disrupted. I wake frequently during the night. Not from pain, necessarily. Just… restlessness. I find myself… anxious. About the future, naturally. About becoming a burden on Elodie. About losing my independence. As for my mood… I would not say I am depressed, precisely. But I am… less cheerful than I once was. More… contemplative. And occasionally, I feel a wave of sadness. It passes, but… it is there. Elodie has suggested I speak with someone about this, a therapist perhaps. I have not yet done so.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. It's very common to experience anxiety and mood changes alongside a Parkinson’s diagnosis, and it's good that Elodie suggested therapy. It can be incredibly helpful to have someone to talk to. Now, let's briefly go over your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of, besides the Parkinson's?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course. But nothing significant in adulthood. I had my appendix removed many years ago. And a minor surgery on my knee, a torn meniscus, about fifteen years ago. But that is… inconsequential. I have always been in good health, otherwise. I exercised regularly, ate a balanced diet. It is… disheartening, to have this happen. A sudden… decline. I have never required much medical attention, until now. Do you require more detailed information? I have a complete medical record, if necessary.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. No other significant medical history, appendix removed years ago, minor knee surgery. It's understandable that this feels disheartening, especially with a history of good health. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides those for Parkinson’s?
PATIENT: Yes. I am currently taking… Levodopa, for the Parkinson’s, naturally. The dosage has been increased twice in the last six months. I also take… a medication for blood pressure. A small dose, prescribed several years ago. And… occasionally, I take a sleeping pill. Just when I cannot sleep. A low dose of… Temazepam, I believe. I can provide you with a complete list, if you wish. It is in my file, also. And I have it on my person, if necessary. It is… important to be thorough, I believe.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Levodopa, blood pressure medication, and Temazepam as needed for sleep. We'll take a look at those. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I have never experienced an allergic reaction to anything. I have taken numerous medications throughout my life, for various minor ailments, of course. But never had a problem. I do have a… sensitivity to certain smells, perhaps. Strong perfumes, for example. They sometimes trigger a headache. But that is not an allergy, precisely. And it is… inconsequential. Do you require any further information about this? I can assure you, my medical history is… unremarkable. Until recently, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just a sensitivity to strong smells. That’s good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of your current situation, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly. That is perfectly acceptable. I understand it is necessary. Please, proceed. I will do my best to cooperate. I trust your judgment, Doctor. And… I am prepared for whatever is required. Shall I remain seated, or… lie down?
DOCTOR: We'll start seated, and then I may ask you to stand and walk a few steps. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, could you open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. I open my mouth as instructed. Is something amiss? I have always had excellent dental hygiene. I visit the dentist regularly. I pause briefly, a flicker of concern crossing my face. Should I… rinse? Is that necessary?
DOCTOR: No, rinsing isn't necessary. Everything looks good – your mouth and throat appear healthy. I’m just doing a basic assessment. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but there’s some diminished breath sound on the lower lobes. That could be due to several factors and isn’t necessarily concerning at this point. Now, let's check your neurological function. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Certainly. I follow the doctor’s finger with my eyes, maintaining focus. Is this to assess… coordination? Or… something else? I trust you know what you are doing, Doctor. I blink slowly, a slight nervousness evident in my voice. I am… cooperating fully, I assure you. I simply wish to understand the purpose of each test, if possible. Is that acceptable?
DOCTOR: Yes, this is to assess your eye movements and coordination. You're doing great. Now, I'm going to ask you to tap your finger to your nose, alternating hands. Okay, and now, I’d like you to stand up when you’re ready. We'll just do a brief gait assessment – a short walk across the room. Take your time, and let me know if you feel unsteady.
PATIENT: Very well. I slowly rise from the chair, using my hands for support. My balance is… precarious, as I mentioned. I take a few tentative steps, walking slowly across the room, maintaining focus on each step. I pause midway, a slight tremor in my hands. This is… challenging. I am attempting to maintain my composure, Doctor. But… it is difficult. I continue walking, a noticeable slowness and rigidity in my movements. Is there anything… specific you are observing?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that. I'm observing a slightly shuffling gait, reduced arm swing, and some rigidity in your arms and legs. That’s consistent with Parkinson’s. It’s good you’re being cautious. Let's go back to the chair. Okay, I've completed the basic physical exam. I've noted the findings in your chart. Now, based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it does sound like your Parkinson’s is progressing, and it’s significantly impacting your daily life. We'll need to discuss the best course of action to manage your symptoms and ensure you have the support you need. Are there any specific concerns or questions you have at this point?
PATIENT: That… confirms my fears, does it not? It is… disheartening. My daughter, Elodie, suggested exploring home health care. Or… hospice care. I pause, a flicker of sadness in my eyes. I am not… ready to discuss hospice care, if I may be frank. But home health care… that seems… reasonable. Assistance with daily tasks, perhaps? Someone to help with… dressing, cooking, cleaning? And… perhaps someone to provide… emotional support? Elodie is concerned about me being alone, you see. I do not wish to be a burden on her. Is that… feasible? And… what are the costs involved? I lean forward slightly, a look of concern etched on my face.
DOCTOR: Yes, it sounds like home health care is a very reasonable next step. It can provide the assistance you need with daily tasks, like dressing and cooking, as well as emotional support, and alleviate some of the burden on Elodie. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, and it's good you're exploring options. Let's discuss what that would entail. Home health care typically involves a registered nurse visiting a few times a week to monitor your condition, medication adherence, and overall well-being. We can also arrange for a home health aide to assist with personal care and light housekeeping. Regarding hospice care, it's good to explore all options, but we don't need to discuss that in detail right now. We can revisit that if your condition changes. As for the costs, it depends on the level of care you require and your insurance coverage. I’ll have my assistant, Maria, contact your insurance provider to determine your benefits and out-of-pocket costs. She can also provide you with a list of reputable home health agencies in the area. Do you have any specific preferences or requirements for a home health agency?
PATIENT: That… sounds acceptable, Doctor. A registered nurse… that is reassuring. And a home health aide… that would be most helpful. I do not have any specific preferences for an agency, to be frank. Reputable… and reliable are my primary concerns. Someone trustworthy, you see. Someone who will treat me with… respect. I do… have a slight aversion to strong perfumes, as I mentioned. Perhaps… an agency that can accommodate that request? And… Elodie is a stickler for cleanliness. An agency that prioritizes… hygiene would be most appreciated. I trust your judgment, Doctor. You have been most… helpful. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any… paperwork I need to complete? Or… any specific preparations I need to make?
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll make sure to request an aide who is mindful of your perfume sensitivity, and we’ll prioritize agencies with a strong focus on hygiene. Maria will discuss all of that when she contacts you. As for paperwork, there's a release of information form that allows us to share your medical information with the home health agency. Maria will also bring that when she contacts you. As for preparations, just make sure your home is safe and accessible for the aide. And you may want to discuss your daily routine with Elodie so she can inform the agency. We'll also need to discuss any advance directives you may have. Do you have a living will or a durable power of attorney for healthcare?
PATIENT: Yes, I do have… both, actually. A living will, drafted several years ago, and a durable power of attorney for healthcare, naming Elodie, of course. I believe they are… in a file cabinet in my study. I will inform Elodie of their location. Is there anything else? I feel… somewhat overwhelmed, to be frank. But… reassured. You have been most… thorough, Doctor. And… compassionate. I appreciate your… guidance. I do not wish to impose on your time further. If Maria will be contacting me, I believe that is sufficient, for now.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent that you have those documents in place. That will make things much smoother. You’re not imposing at all. It’s my job to ensure you receive the best possible care, and that includes addressing all of your concerns. Maria will be in touch within the next 24-48 hours to discuss the next steps. She'll also answer any further questions you may have. Is there anything else I can help you with today before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all, for now. I believe you have addressed all of my concerns. I thank you for your time and… your guidance. I slowly rise from the chair, using my hands for support. Perhaps… I will see you again, if necessary. I offer a slight, grateful smile. Good day, Doctor. And… thank you again. I turn and slowly walk towards the door. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lonell. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. .
