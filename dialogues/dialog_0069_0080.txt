DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca, and I'm one of the internal medicine physicians here. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I don't really need anything, if that makes sense. I just gotta get some forms filled out for… Medicare, I think? My husband helped me with the appointment, and I mostly just showed up. He said I needed to come see someone for this paperwork.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like this is mostly an administrative visit to get some necessary forms completed for Medicare. We handle a lot of those here. Let me pull up your information… Ah, yes, I see it here. Thyra Fabing, date of birth… just confirming, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Date of birth is… hold on a sec… June 12th. June 12th is correct. It’s kinda hard to keep track sometimes, you know? Not that I’m forgetful or anything… just busy.
DOCTOR: Of course, it's easy to get busy. No worries at all. June 12th, noted. So, to clarify, your husband scheduled this appointment primarily for assistance with Medicare paperwork?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's it exactly. He said there were some new forms or something, and it was easier to have someone help with them here instead of trying to figure it out ourselves. He's good with computers, but… well, paperwork is a whole different beast.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Paperwork can be quite confusing. We’re happy to help. Do you know which forms specifically he mentioned, or did he just say "new forms?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think he said something about… enrollment? And… maybe something about a change of address? We moved a few months back, just across the reservation, but maybe that’s what it was for. I honestly wasn't paying super close attention, I just trust him to know what needs doing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Enrollment and change of address are common reasons for needing updated paperwork. Let me see what's on file… It looks like we do have a change of address request pending, and it’s possible there's an updated enrollment form as well. To make sure we have everything accurate, could you verbally confirm your current address for me, please?
PATIENT: Sure thing. It’s… 42 Eagle Feather Drive, Browning, Montana. 59417. That’s right. Just a little ways down from the community center. Is that what you needed?
DOCTOR: Okay, 42 Eagle Feather Drive, Browning, Montana, 59417. Perfect. And just to double-check, is that your primary residence?
PATIENT: Yep, that's it. Been there since… April, I think? Right after the snow melted. It's a lot bigger than our last place, which is nice. Got a little garden out back, finally.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely! A garden is wonderful. Okay, I've updated the address in the system. Now, let's focus on the enrollment forms. Just to be thorough, and since we're here, could you tell me if you have any changes to your insurance information, or if you've started seeing any new doctors or specialists recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing new on the insurance side. Still just Medicare. And… no new doctors. I usually just see Dr. Olsen for check-ups when I need 'em, and he's still the same. Nothing's changed there. I think that’s everything. Really, I just needed someone to fill out the paperwork. My husband does most of the organizing, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So, same doctor, no changes to insurance. It looks like the main form we need to complete today is the Medicare enrollment verification. It’s a bit lengthy, mostly confirming your benefits and personal information. I can walk you through it, and we can take it at your pace. Are you comfortable doing that now?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. As long as it’s not too complicated. I’m alright with forms, just… sometimes the questions are confusing, you know? I’m happy to try, though. And if I get stuck, I can ask, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Please don't hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. That’s what I’m here for. Alright, let's start with this first section. It asks for your full legal name... and it seems it's pre-filled with your information, just double-check the spelling. Then it asks for your date of birth – again, pre-filled, but always good to verify. Do you see everything looking correct there?
PATIENT: Yep, name looks right, and the date of birth is perfect. June 12th. I think that part’s all good. It's the next parts I'm usually worried about. All those questions about… health stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's perfectly normal. We can go slowly and only answer what you're comfortable with. This next section is about your health insurance history, specifically with Medicare. It just wants to confirm when your Medicare coverage started. Do you recall roughly when that was?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… after my husband retired, I think? He retired in… 2018, so maybe… 2019? Yeah, I think it was sometime in 2019. Does that sound right? It all kinda blends together after a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, 2019 sounds reasonable. I'm noting that as the start date. This next question is about any other health insurance you might have. Do you have any supplemental insurance, like a Medicare Advantage plan or a private insurance policy?
PATIENT: Nope, just Medicare. That's it. My husband wanted to keep it simple, and I agree. Too much paperwork is just… stressful, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. Keeping it simple is always a good approach. Okay, no other insurance noted. Now, this next section asks about your primary care physician. It has Dr. Olsen listed, which is excellent. Are there any changes to his contact information we should update?
PATIENT: Nope, Dr. Olsen is still the same. He’s been our doctor for years. Same office, same phone number. Everything is good there. He's a good doctor, we like him a lot. It's good to have someone you trust, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Having a trusted primary care physician is very important. Okay, Dr. Olsen’s information is confirmed. This next section is about emergency contacts. It asks for the name and phone number of someone to reach in case of an emergency. Would you like to add an emergency contact, or would you prefer to skip that section for now?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Let’s add my husband. He knows everything. His name is Thomas Fabing, and his number is… let me look it up… 555-123-4567. That’s right. 555-123-4567. He’s always the one to call.
DOCTOR: Okay, Thomas Fabing, 555-123-4567. Perfect. Now we’re getting to the end of the form. This final section is just a signature and date. Would you like to sign it now, or would you prefer me to print it and you can sign it at your convenience?
PATIENT: Let’s just get it over with now. I get easily distracted, and I might forget if I take it home. There you go. All done! I think that’s everything, right?
DOCTOR: Wonderful! Yes, that is everything. Alright, Ms. Fabing, I’ve officially processed your Medicare enrollment verification. I'll make a copy for your records, and you can keep the original. It shouldn't be any issues, everything looks good. Now, just to briefly touch on your overall health... you mentioned seeing Dr. Olsen for check-ups. When was your last physical exam with him?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... let me think. It was... I think it was last September? Right before the really cold weather started. He checked my blood pressure and everything, said I was doing alright. It's hard to keep track, you know? Time flies.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. September is relatively recent. And that's good to hear he said you were doing alright. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your health since that last check-up?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing much. My knees get a little creaky in the mornings, but that's just getting old, I guess. And sometimes my eyesight gets a little blurry, but I have those glasses I wear when I’m reading. Nothing serious, you know? I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think.
DOCTOR: That's great to hear. It's good that you're aware of those minor changes, and that you have glasses to help with your eyesight. Are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or new headaches?
PATIENT: Nope, none of that. I feel pretty good, honestly. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just from gardening, I think. Digging in the dirt is harder than it looks! I mostly just get tired. No pain or dizziness or anything like that. I think I'm okay. Really.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Gardening is hard work! It sounds like you’re generally in good health, and those minor symptoms are likely related to your activity level. Just continue to see Dr. Olsen for your regular check-ups. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Ms. Fabing?
PATIENT: Nope, I think that's everything. You were very helpful with the paperwork, and I appreciate you asking about my health. It’s good to know everything is alright. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fabing. I'm glad I could help. Here's the copy of the form for your records. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your gardening!
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you, Doctor. You have a good day too!
