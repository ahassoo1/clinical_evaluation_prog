DOCTOR: Hi Sharifa, welcome. I’m Dr. Rosanova. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s good to meet you too, I suppose. Though I usually don’t bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. It's just...my legs. They feel like jelly, really. It started a few days ago, after I had a terrible cold. Not just a sniffle, you understand. A proper cold. And now, walking is…difficult. It’s quite inconvenient, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. "Jelly legs" after a bad cold… that’s definitely something we should look into. Just to clarify, when you say a few days ago, can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It was... Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday, July 29th. I remember because that was the day my daughter called, complaining about her new boyfriend. Honestly, the cold was almost preferable. So, about three days ago, give or take. It’s gotten worse each day, naturally. I don’t just get better on my own, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, Tuesday the 29th. Okay, that’s helpful. And you said it’s gotten progressively worse. Can you describe what you mean by "worse"?
PATIENT: Well, at first it was just a bit shaky, like I’d been on a long flight. You know, that weak feeling. Now? Now I practically need a walking stick. It’s not painful, exactly. Just... utterly unreliable. I almost tripped getting out of the taxi this morning. Very embarrassing. I had to lean on the driver’s poor shoulder! Honestly, the service these days… It’s a definite struggle, and it’s making everything so much harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s progressed from shakiness to feeling unstable enough that you almost fell. And no pain, just weakness and unreliability. That’s important to know. Have you noticed it in both legs equally, or is one worse than the other?
PATIENT: Oh, it's definitely both. Though... if I had to pick one, the left one feels a little more… absent-minded, shall we say? It just seems to give way more easily. But honestly, I wouldn't trust either one to carry me very far right now. I had to practically haul myself out of the chair at the restaurant last night. And the looks I got! It's simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a little more pronounced on the left, but both legs affected. And no pain. Have you had any other symptoms along with this, like any fever, muscle aches, or anything like numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Definitely not. I wouldn't have come if it was just a cold. And no muscle aches, though I am feeling a bit generally run down, but that's probably the inconvenience of it all. Run down, yes. Numbness? No. Tingling? No. Just…weakness. A very frustrating weakness, I might add. It’s like they’ve forgotten how to leg, if you follow me. Honestly, I’m starting to think it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no muscle aches, no numbness or tingling, just weakness. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, neuropathy, or any autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. Autoimmune… no, nothing like that. Though my mother had something… arthritis, I think. It wasn’t pleasant. Diabetes? No, never. I watch what I eat, you know. Generally. I had a bit of a scare a few years ago with my blood pressure, but it went down with a change of diet and a lot less stress. Though, frankly, this situation is causing me a lot of stress. Nothing major, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I'm Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of diabetes or autoimmune diseases, a past issue with blood pressure that was managed with diet, and some general aches and pains. Medicare is helpful, thank you. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Yes, actually. I had my gallbladder removed… oh, must be fifteen years ago now? And… I had a rather unpleasant incident with my knee when I was younger, playing volleyball. Required some… patching up, let’s say. But nothing recently. And certainly nothing that would explain this. It just came on so suddenly, after the cold. Honestly, I’m starting to suspect it’s something I caught at the doctor's office. You get all sorts wandering in there, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago and knee surgery in the past. I understand your concern about catching something at the doctor's office, but we take precautions. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don’t believe in all that pharmaceutical nonsense, honestly. I had a brief dalliance with some vitamin D supplements last winter, but they didn’t seem to do much good, so I stopped. And that was it. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, and I rarely even get those. I prefer to let things run their course, you know? Though, clearly, this isn’t running its course. It’s just getting worse, as I’ve repeatedly said.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen. And no vitamin D supplements currently. No allergies to medications that you know of?
PATIENT: No allergies. I've never had any problems with anything, thankfully. I'm quite careful about what I put into my body, you see. Honestly, I suspect it's something… environmental. Perhaps a bug bite? Though I don't recall being bitten. Or… something in the water? I was swimming in the ocean last week. It was rather lovely, actually, but now I'm wondering if I picked up some sort of… parasite. It's all rather unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, no regular medications, and no recent bug bites. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But be careful! I might need a steadying hand. And please, don’t expect miracles. Honestly, I feel like a wobbly newborn foal.
DOCTOR: Take your time, that’s perfectly alright. Just stand as comfortably as you can. I’m just going to observe your posture and how you’re standing. Okay… I see a slight wobble, and you are leaning a little to the left. Let’s try a few simple tests. Can you lift each foot up slightly, one at a time?
PATIENT: Oh, this is…uncomfortable. Honestly, I feel quite undignified. Very well. There. Happy now? It’s not easy, you know. And it's definitely harder on the left side. It feels... weaker. Like it’s not fully connected. Honestly, I’m starting to think I’ve broken something. Or at least severely strained it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There’s definitely more effort required on the left side, and it does appear slightly weaker. Now, can you walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I feel like I'm eighty years old. Very well. There. Satisfied? It’s not pretty, I assure you. And I’m practically holding onto thin air. Honestly, I’m afraid I'm going to end up flat on my face.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see. Your gait is unsteady, and you are leaning to the left. Now, can you sit back down, please?
PATIENT: Oh, gratefully! Honestly, I’m exhausted. That’s quite enough physical exertion for one day, I think. Honestly, I'm starting to think I need a lie-down. And perhaps a strong cup of tea. So, what’s the verdict? Am I dying? Or just very, very old?
DOCTOR: Okay, Sharifa. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during the exam, it seems you're experiencing weakness in both legs, more pronounced on the left, that started after a cold. The unsteadiness and difficulty walking are concerning. There are a few possibilities we need to consider. Sometimes, a viral illness can trigger something called Guillain-Barré syndrome, which causes weakness and paralysis, but it usually progresses more rapidly. Another possibility is post-viral neuropathy, where the nerves are affected by the infection. It could also be something else entirely. I want to be thorough, so I'm going to order some blood tests to check for any inflammation or infection, and I'd like to schedule you for a nerve conduction study to assess the function of your nerves. This will help us determine the cause of your weakness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests and nerve studies… Honestly, it sounds dreadful. Guillain-Barré… paralysis? That sounds terrifying. And neuropathy… Is that something contagious? Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite anxious. Very well. If you insist. But please, be quick about it. And don’t poke me too much. Honestly, I’m not a fan of needles. And I certainly don't want to end up paralyzed. What exactly will these tests do? And how long will they take? Honestly, I have a bridge club meeting on Thursday, and I simply must be there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. The blood tests are fairly straightforward—just a small sample will be taken from your arm. They'll help us look for any signs of inflammation or infection. The nerve conduction study is a little more involved, but it’s not painful. Small electrodes will be placed on your skin, and we'll send a mild electrical impulse through your nerves to measure how quickly they’re firing. It might feel like a little tingling or buzzing sensation. It takes about 30-45 minutes. We'll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss the next steps. And I absolutely understand about your bridge club meeting—we'll do everything we can to get you diagnosed and treated so you can get back to your normal activities. To schedule the tests, the nurse will come in shortly and give you the paperwork and instructions. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, well. At least it’s not supposed to be painful. Though tingling and buzzing doesn’t sound particularly pleasant, either. Honestly, I'm starting to think I should have just stayed home and rested. But then I would have missed the bridge club meeting on Thursday… and I simply cannot miss that. Will these tests interfere with my medication? I don’t take much, as I’ve said, but I wouldn’t want anything to… react. And what if it is something serious? Will I need to be hospitalized? Honestly, I’m not cut out for hospital food.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. The tests shouldn't interfere with any medication you're currently taking, as you aren’t on much. And we’ll discuss the results thoroughly once we have them, so we can determine the best course of action. The possibility of hospitalization depends entirely on the results. If it’s something that requires more intensive treatment, we may need to consider it, but that’s something we’ll cross if we come to it. Right now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and getting a clear diagnosis. I want to reassure you that we'll work together to find the cause of your weakness and get you feeling better as quickly as possible. To reiterate, I'm ordering blood work to check for inflammation and possible infection and a nerve conduction study to assess nerve function. The nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork and schedule the appointments. Do you have any questions for me before I let her come in?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That's…slightly reassuring, I suppose. Though the thought of being hospitalized is still rather unsettling. Honestly, I prefer to deal with things myself, if possible. One thing…will these tests show if it’s something…permanent? If I’ll be walking with a cane for the rest of my life? Honestly, that would simply be dreadful. I simply must be able to play bridge. And I have a cruise planned for November. I’ve already paid for it.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Sharifa. It's understandable that you're worried about the possibility of something permanent. The tests will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on and the extent of any nerve damage. It's too early to say definitively whether it will be permanent, but we'll have a much better understanding after the results come back. Many conditions that cause weakness are treatable, and even if there is some nerve damage, there are often therapies and interventions that can help improve function and quality of life. We'll discuss all the options with you in detail once we have the results. We'll also talk about what you can do in the meantime to manage your symptoms and stay as active as possible. Your cruise in November is something we’ll certainly keep in mind as we develop a plan. Now, let me call the nurse in to get the paperwork started. Is there anything else at all I can address for you before she comes in?
