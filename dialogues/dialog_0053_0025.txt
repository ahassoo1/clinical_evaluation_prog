DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Laury is okay. I... I want to know more about where my family come from. My people, you know? I hear now you can do a test... with spit? To find out? I want to see if that can help me.
DOCTOR: A test with spit, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My niece, she told me. She said they can look at... the little bits inside your mouth, and tell you where your ancestors were from. Long, long time ago. She said it's called... DNA testing? It sounds like magic, but she said it's real. I want to know if I have more family... maybe in other islands? Or other places?
DOCTOR: Well, “magic” isn’t quite the right word, Mr. Laury. It’s genetics, and it can sometimes give you information about your ancestry. But it's not always straightforward. And frankly, it’s not really a medical issue, is it?
PATIENT: No, not sick. Just… curious. I’m old now, you know? Eighty-five. Want to know before… before I go. Is it okay if you help me? I have Medicare, if that matters. I just want to know… where I really come from. It's important to me.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Laury, my expertise is in internal medicine. I treat illnesses, manage conditions. Ancestry testing… that's more in the realm of personal history, genealogy. It’s not something I routinely offer here at the clinic. It doesn’t really fall under my scope of practice.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. So... you can’t do the test here? I thought… because it’s a doctor. I don’t know where else to ask. Maybe I should ask my niece again? She said a doctor could do it.
DOCTOR: It’s not that I can’t, Mr. Laury. It's that it's not… the best use of my time, or the clinic’s resources, frankly. We’re focused on keeping people healthy. There are companies that specialize in this sort of thing. Genetic testing services. I can give you a referral to a genetic counselor, if you’d like. They could discuss the pros and cons with you in more detail and point you in the right direction. That would be the most appropriate course of action. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: A counselor? What do they do? Is that like... talking to someone about my feelings? I just want the test, Doctor. I don't want to talk about it. I just want to know if my great-grandpa maybe came from Samoa, or something. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Laury, these tests aren’t always definitive. They can be… misleading. A genetic counselor can help you interpret the results, explain the limitations, and understand what the information really means. It's not just about getting a list of places; it’s about understanding the science behind it and avoiding false assumptions. Frankly, at your age, getting swept up in something like this… well, it’s not the most practical thing. But, if you insist, I’ll write a referral. But I strongly advise you to have a thorough discussion with the counselor before proceeding. It’s a significant cost, and the results may not be what you expect.
PATIENT: Cost… yes. That’s a worry. I don’t have much money. But… knowing is important. More important than… than saving it. Maybe just a little bit of knowing? If it’s not too expensive, and the counselor can help me understand… okay. Write the referral. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the information for a genetic counselor in the city. They'll be able to explain the costs upfront. Just be aware, these tests can be quite pricey, and insurance coverage varies. And again, I strongly suggest you discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks with them before making any decisions. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s all. Thank you for the paper. I appreciate your help, even if… even if it’s not exactly what I wanted. .
DOCTOR: Alright then. Get well, Mr. Laury. Or, stay well. Whatever suits you. .
