DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I'm one of the family medicine doctors here. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It's… nice to meet you as well. Land, it’s been a bit of everything lately, really. Mostly, I just haven’t been feeling right. I get sick to my stomach a lot, and I don't seem to be able to eat much before I feel full. It's… worrying, I suppose. Though, at my age, what isn't worrying?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get things checked out, Raymonde. It is always best to address these things. “Not feeling right” and changes in appetite can have a lot of causes, so let’s try to narrow things down. You mentioned feeling sick to your stomach and getting full quickly. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… it's not a sharp pain, not like a stomach ache. More like… a queasy feeling, all the time, almost. It comes and goes, but it's there. And the eating… I used to have a good appetite, always did. But now, just a few bites of anything and I feel stuffed. It doesn't matter what it is, really. Soup, a sandwich… even just a little bit of fruit. It's… strange. I don’t remember ever feeling like this before, but then again, my memory ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Raymonde. A constant queasiness and early fullness… we call that early satiety. It is good you’re noticing these changes. And it's perfectly normal for things to change as we get older, including our memory. To get a better picture of what might be going on, could you tell me about how long this has been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. It feels like it’s been a while, but pinpointing it… Land, that's hard. Maybe… a couple of months? It started slowly, just not feeling as hungry, then the queasiness started, and then realizing I couldn’t eat much at all. It’s gotten worse gradually, I think. Not a sudden thing, you know? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Raymonde. A couple of months is a good starting point. Gradual changes can be harder to notice right away. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the nausea and early fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well… I've been a little tired lately, more so than usual. And I’ve lost a bit of weight, I reckon. Not a lot, but my clothes feel a little looser. I also… well, I’ve been having a bit of trouble with… with keeping things regular, if you know what I mean. It's not something I usually talk about, but… you're the doctor. And I've just generally not felt like myself, you know? A bit… off.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Raymonde. It’s important information. Fatigue, some weight loss, and changes in your bowel habits, along with feeling generally unwell… These are all things we need to investigate. Before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, land. That’s another thing my memory struggles with. I… I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years or more. And I had a bit of trouble with my heart a long time back, but they fixed it with… with medicine, I think. Mostly, I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. I’ve always been active, you know? Worked hard, stayed busy. Oh! And I had pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered from that. I’m sure there’s more, but it’s just… a jumble in my head. I'm sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Raymonde. That’s very helpful to know. Gallbladder removal, some past heart trouble managed with medication, and pneumonia… We can always look things up in your records if needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, dear. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I take a little something for my blood pressure, a small white pill, but that’s about it. And… oh! I’m allergic to poison ivy, like everyone else around here. But that’s just a rash, nothing serious. I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Until recently, that is.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Raymonde. So, just the blood pressure medication and a poison ivy allergy. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My family… that’s a long story. My mother, she passed away when I was young, from… I think it was a heart condition, something with her valves. My father, he lived a long life, but he had diabetes towards the end. And… my brother, he had cancer, lung cancer, a long time ago. He didn’t… he didn't make it. There were others, but I can’t rightly recall what ailed them. It was a big family, and a lot of it happened a long time back.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your mother and brother, Raymonde. That must have been difficult. It's helpful to know about the heart condition and the lung cancer in your family. Now, just a couple more questions before we move on to a physical exam. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I used to be very active. Worked in the garden, helped my husband with the animals… He passed away a few years back, you see. Since then, I haven’t been as busy. I mostly stay home, read, watch television… I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat healthy, but… with not feeling well, it’s been hard to keep up with things.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your husband, Raymonde. It's understandable that you haven't been as active since then. It sounds like you've lived a very full life, and it's important to remember that it's okay to take things slower. Okay, Raymonde, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, if you would. My old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Raymonde. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Excellent. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender or uncomfortable. Okay, everything seems okay so far, but I do notice some slight tenderness in your upper abdomen, on the right side. It's not severe, but I want to make a note of it. Now, let's check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Alright, dear. That tenderness… yes, I have been feeling something there, off and on. Not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, sometimes. It doesn't bother me all the time, but it's there. It's good you noticed it. I was starting to wonder if I was just imagining things. Go ahead, do what you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know about that tenderness, Raymonde. It's good we're able to pinpoint where you're feeling discomfort. Alright, everything else seems within normal limits. Your reflexes are good, and I don't notice any other concerning signs. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. The nausea, early satiety, weight loss, fatigue, and the tenderness in your upper abdomen could be related to several things, including a problem with your gallbladder, stomach, or pancreas. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests and an abdominal ultrasound. The blood tests will help us check your liver and pancreatic function, and the ultrasound will give us a better look at your gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, land. Tests… Well, I suppose that's the only way to know, isn't it? Yes, dear, go ahead and order whatever tests you think are necessary. I trust your judgment. I just… I don’t want anything serious, you know? I'm an old woman, and I just want to be comfortable. But if tests are what it takes, then so be it. Will they be painful? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Raymonde. I wouldn’t recommend any tests if I didn’t think they were necessary. The blood tests will just involve a small prick of the finger or a blood draw from your arm – it’s usually quick and not very painful. The abdominal ultrasound is completely painless. You’ll lie on a table, and a technician will move a wand over your abdomen. It doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. As for the results, it usually takes a few days to a week for the lab to process everything. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or changes in your bowel movements, please don't hesitate to call my office or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… not too bad, I suppose. No needles is good. And I'll remember to call if anything gets worse. Hmm… let me think. Yes, I did have a bit of trouble sleeping last night, thinking about all this. Do you think that could be related? And… is there anything I can do to help with the nausea in the meantime? Something I can eat, or something I shouldn't eat? I just feel so… unsettled.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable that you’re having trouble sleeping, Raymonde. Worrying about your health can definitely disrupt your sleep. And yes, the nausea could be related to what’s going on. As for the nausea, there are a few things you can try. Eating small, frequent meals can sometimes help, rather than large, heavy ones. Avoid greasy, fried foods, and spicy foods. Bland foods like toast, crackers, or plain rice are usually easier to digest. Ginger ale or ginger tea can also help with nausea. Staying hydrated is important, so sip on clear fluids throughout the day. Avoid lying down immediately after eating, and try to get some rest when you can. If the nausea is severe, we can also prescribe an anti-nausea medication. Do you think you’d like me to write you a prescription for that?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good advice, dear. Small meals… I used to do that, years ago, when I was sick. I’ll try that. And ginger… yes, my mother used to make ginger tea when I had an upset stomach. I’ll give that a try too. A prescription… maybe not right away. I’ll try the tea and small meals first. I don’t want to take any more medicine than I have to. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little better just knowing what’s going on, and knowing there are things I can do. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Raymonde. I'm glad I could help. Remember, I'm here for you, so please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I'll have the lab orders printed for you now, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. In the meantime, try to get some rest, eat small meals, and drink plenty of fluids. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, dear, I think that's all. Thank you again. You've been very kind. I suppose I should be getting home now. It was nice meeting you.
DOCTOR: It was very nice meeting you as well, Raymonde. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you next week. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything before then. Have a good day.
