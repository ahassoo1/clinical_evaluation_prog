DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're here today for a consultation. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Hembrey, you said? Right. Well, it’s… my face. And legs. They’re swollen. Been that way a little while now, I suppose. Not sure how long, exactly. Things kinda blur these days, you know? It’s just… puffy. Makes it hard to see properly, too. Especially with my glasses.
DOCTOR: “Puffy,” you say. And it’s affecting your vision, on top of the swelling?
PATIENT: Well, not the swelling directly, Doctor. It's just... harder to get 'em to sit right on my nose when everything’s a bit… off. Like they’re always sliding down. It’s annoying, more than anything. And it looks… well, not good. I used to have a good face, you know. Before all this. I don't know what caused it, though. Probably just old age. Everything goes when you get older.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the appearance, Mr. Miner, but let’s focus on the swelling itself. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor? I couldn’t tell ya the exact date. Weeks, maybe? Months? It’s all a bit of a muddle. It wasn't sudden, that's for sure. Just… gradually got bigger. Like a balloon slowly filling up. I don't pay much attention to things like dates, never have. Always been more practical, you know? Fixing things, building things... dates don't fix nothin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: Triggered? Now you're talkin' funny words, Doctor. What do you mean triggered? Like...did I fall down or somethin'? No, I haven't had any accidents. Haven't been doin' much of anything, truth be told. Just mostly sittin' around since... well, since my wife passed. Less need for all the fixin' and buildin', you see? It’s different now. Everything's just... different.
DOCTOR: I see. So, this began around the time of your wife’s passing. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the swelling?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like feelin' sad? Of course I’ve been feelin’ sad! My wife's gone! What do you expect? But other than that… let me think. Hmm… No, not really. I get tired easier, I suppose. But that's just bein' old. And maybe a little short of breath sometimes, but I’ve always had a bit of a wheeze. No, nothin' else. Just… puffy. And sad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness no. Never been one for pills and potions. Always figured a good night's sleep and a bit of hard work was better than anything the doctor could prescribe. My wife, she had some things for her blood pressure, but I don’t take nothin’. Never needed to. Always been a strong Swede, me.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I've eaten pretty much everything over the years. Pickled herring, lingonberry jam, you name it. Never had a reaction. My wife, she was a bit sensitive to bee stings, but me? Solid as a rock. Now, are you gonna look at this puffy face, or are we just gonna talk about food and bees all day? It’s getting a bit drafty in here, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. Let’s have a look. Please sit forward slightly. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your ears. Then I’ll need to examine your face and legs more closely. It's important to rule out a number of possibilities.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Go ahead. But I'm tellin' ya, it's probably just old age. Just don't poke too hard, alright? And try not to take too long. I have some things I need to... well, I don't remember what, exactly. But things.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little elevated, but within normal limits for someone your age. Lungs are clear, but with slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Ears are unremarkable. Now, let’s take a look at your face. There is noticeable edema, particularly around the eyes and cheeks. No significant tenderness to palpation. Significant pitting edema bilaterally, extending up to the knees. Skin is warm and dry. I’m also going to check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Blood pressure? Just to be sure it isn't my heart, right? I never had much trouble with blood pressure, my wife was the one who always needed watchin'. I always figured it was all that salt she liked with her herring... But go ahead. Just be gentle with that cuff, alright? It always feels like it’s cuttin’ off the circulation.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated, Mr. Miner. 160 over 95. That, combined with the edema, suggests a possible cardiovascular issue, or kidney problems. It could also be related to a fluid imbalance. We need to run some tests to determine the cause. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a urinalysis, and an EKG. We may also need to consider an echocardiogram if the EKG is abnormal.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. Now you're talkin' fancy words again, Doctor. And all those letters! What's an EKG? And what's a…a meta-thingy? Look, I don't like tests. I always did poorly on tests. My wife, she always knew all the fancy words. She would’ve understood all this. Can't you just give me somethin' for the puffiness? A cream, maybe? Or a pill? Somethin' simple? I don’t want to be poked and prodded and have blood taken... It's not a good look on me, you know. Especially with this face.
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, I understand your reluctance, but simply addressing the symptoms without determining the cause would be irresponsible – and potentially dangerous. We need to rule out serious underlying conditions. The blood tests and EKG will provide crucial information. As for a “cream” or “pill”, I’m not going to prescribe medication blindly. That would be poor medical practice. I will explain each test to you in detail, and we can discuss the results when they are available. However, I strongly recommend that you proceed with the investigation. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Questions? Well… what do they do with the blood? Do they give it back? And what’s an echo-cardio-thingy? Sounds… invasive. My wife… she used to get so worked up about hospitals. Said they were full of germs. And they always took so much blood. I don't want to end up… like her. Weak and pale and full of tubes. Is it gonna hurt? And how long will it take? I don't have all day, you know. Things to… things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, the blood tests are a routine procedure. A small amount of blood will be drawn from your arm, and you will not even feel it. The blood is sent to a laboratory for analysis, and, no, it is not returned to you. It’s used to assess your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and overall health. As for the echocardiogram, it’s a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to create an image of your heart. A technician will place a probe on your chest, and it will not involve any needles or incisions. It’s completely painless. The blood tests will take about ten minutes, and the echocardiogram will take approximately thirty minutes. I understand your anxieties, but these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your swelling and ensure that you receive the appropriate treatment. We can discuss the results together, and I will answer any questions you may have. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials?
PATIENT: Latex…hmm. I don't think so. My wife, she was allergic to somethin' in makeup. Red stuff, I think. But I don't wear makeup, Doctor. Never have. Wait…the gloves! They always wear gloves. Those rubbery things. Could be latex, I suppose. I haven’t noticed nothin' wrong before, but maybe they’ve changed the kind. I don't know. It’s all a bit of a blur these days. Just… try not to use the red ones, alright? If you have any other colors. And maybe…a nice clean towel? It’s drafty in here, you know. This whole thing is makin’ me nervous. And cold.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Miner. I will make a note to use non-latex gloves during the blood draw. We will also ensure the technician uses non-latex gloves for the echocardiogram. I'm going to have the nurse draw your blood first. Then, we’ll schedule you for an echocardiogram as soon as possible. I’ll need you to change into a gown for the echocardiogram. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: A gown? Oh dear. I haven't worn a gown since…well, I don't even remember. Is it…paper? Will it be see-through? My wife… she always said I had a good figure. And what if it gets ripped? Or lost? I don't want to be walkin' around… exposed. And what if…what if other people see me? This is all a bit much, Doctor. A bit too much. Can't we just take a pill? A nice, strong pill? For the puffiness? Please?
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, I understand your anxieties, but I am not going to compromise your health to accommodate your discomfort. The gown is a standard procedure for the echocardiogram. It's necessary for the technician to properly place the probe on your chest. It is not see-through, and it will not be ripped or lost. And, quite frankly, the other patients and staff are far more concerned with their own health than with your attire. I am going to have the nurse explain the procedure to you in detail. She will ensure you are comfortable and that your privacy is respected. We will do everything we can to make this as easy as possible for you. But, I must reiterate: we need to determine the cause of your swelling. And that requires these tests. Are you willing to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Tests. Gowns. Rubber things. It’s all a bit ridiculous, if you ask me. My wife, she would've had a fit. But… if you insist. Just… just get it over with, alright? And be gentle. And try not to take too long. I have… things. Things to… things. And please… no red gloves. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I will inform the nurse to proceed. Please remain seated. She will be with you shortly.
