DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather difficult to put into words precisely. It’s this… frequent need to, shall we say, relieve myself. More often than is comfortable, certainly. It’s been going on for… some time, I believe. Though pinpointing when it started… that escapes me, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Right. Frequent urination. And you say “some time”?
PATIENT: Yes, “some time.” Perhaps a few weeks? A month or two? It's… frustrating, because I can’t seem to recall the exact beginning. Things… aren’t as sharp as they once were, you understand. It’s not a sudden change, more of a… gradual increase in frequency, if that makes sense. I haven't noticed any pain, thankfully. Just… inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Inconvenience. And is it… during the day, night, or both?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor, I believe. Though perhaps more noticeable at night, now that I mention it. I find myself… waking up a couple of times to visit the facilities. It hasn’t been severely disruptive, but it’s… unsettling. I used to sleep through the night without issue. And during the day, I'm simply finding myself needing to go… more often than I used to. It feels like I've been drinking a great deal more water, though I don't believe I have.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s see… Any changes in your fluid intake at all?
PATIENT: That’s an interesting question. No, not consciously. I drink… tea, mostly. And water, of course. I don’t believe I’ve increased the amount, no. Though, I suppose it's possible. I do enjoy a cup of tea with my afternoon reading, and perhaps I’ve been having… more reading sessions lately? It’s difficult to say definitively. I honestly don’t keep track of such things.
DOCTOR: Any fever, chills, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever or chills? No, not that I’m aware of. I haven't felt unwell in that regard. As for weight loss… that’s a tricky one. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. I suppose I might have lost a little… but it could just be the summer heat. I do find my appetite… fluctuates, you know? Sometimes I eat quite well, other times less so. I wouldn’t say it’s a significant weight loss, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… normal variations, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burning sensation? No, Doctor, thankfully not. No pain at all, as I mentioned before. It’s simply… the frequency. It’s not a comfortable feeling, constantly needing to go, but it isn't painful. I do occasionally feel a little… weak afterwards, but that could simply be from getting up in the night, you understand. I'm not a young man anymore.
DOCTOR: Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? That’s a… a serious question. I don’t believe so. My family… I don’t recall anyone suffering from diabetes. I’ve never been specifically diagnosed with it, if that’s what you mean. I’ve had the usual check-ups over the years, but I don’t remember any mention of such a thing. It’s possible, of course. Memory… isn't what it once was. But to my knowledge, no. No history of diabetes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick urinalysis. Just need a sample. And then we’ll check your blood sugar. It’s standard procedure given the symptoms. Follow me.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. A urinalysis and a blood sugar check… sounds sensible. Lead the way, please. I trust your judgment. I’m quite happy to cooperate in any way I can. It’s just… all a bit unsettling, this whole situation.
DOCTOR: Right this way. I'll be just outside. A sterile cup is in there. Try to collect a mid-stream sample, if you can. And please, wash your hands thoroughly afterwards.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Mid-stream sample… I believe I remember being instructed on that procedure before. I’ll do my best. And I assure you, I am quite particular about hygiene.
DOCTOR: ...
PATIENT: All done, Doctor. I believe that's everything. Hopefully, it's sufficient. And I did wash my hands, thoroughly, as instructed.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get these results in a few minutes. While we wait, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking anything?
PATIENT: Medications… That’s… a good question. Let me see. I take a small dose of… Lisinopril, I believe. For my blood pressure. It’s been quite stable, thankfully. And… occasionally, an antacid, if I have indigestion. But that’s it, really. Nothing else of any significance. Just the Lisinopril, and the occasional antacid. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Dosage of the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Let me see… I believe it’s… 10 milligrams. Yes, 10 milligrams, taken once daily. In the morning, with my tea. Though, I must confess, I sometimes forget. It’s not a strict regimen, you understand. I try to be diligent, but… memory, as I’ve mentioned, is not what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay. The urinalysis is back. Elevated white blood cells and bacteria present. Looks like a urinary tract infection.
PATIENT: A… urinary tract infection? Well, that explains the… frequent need to go, I suppose. Though, I must confess, I didn't experience any burning sensation, as you asked. Is it… serious? And what does one do about a urinary tract infection? I’ve never had one before, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: It’s common, especially as you get older. And sometimes doesn’t present with the classic symptoms. We’ll need to prescribe antibiotics. Nitrofurantoin, 100 milligrams twice daily for seven days. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better sooner. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve taken antibiotics in the past, for… a chest infection, I believe, many years ago. No adverse reactions, to my recollection. Though, it was quite some time ago. My memory… isn't what it once was. But to my knowledge, no allergies. Nitrofurantoin, you said? Seven days… I believe I can manage that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the prescription. Take it to your pharmacy. And drink plenty of fluids – water, mostly. And if you don’t feel any improvement within 48 hours, or if you develop a fever, chills, or back pain, contact me immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Plenty of fluids, and contact you if no improvement within 48 hours… or fever, chills, or back pain. Yes, I believe I’ve got that. No, Doctor, I don’t think I have any further questions at the moment. You’ve been most thorough. Thank you for your assistance. I appreciate your patience, especially considering my… occasional lapses in memory.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, get well soon, Mr. Verbos. And try to remember to finish the entire course of antibiotics. That will be all.
