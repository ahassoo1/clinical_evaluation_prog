DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I'm Dr. Press. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for, oh… maybe three days now? Not all the time, but… a sharp pain. Like a little hammer, sometimes.
DOCTOR: A sharp pain, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like… tap, tap, tap. Not a big hammer, a little one. And it’s on the back… here. It makes me… not want to turn my head so fast, you know? Sometimes makes me a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: And is this dizziness constant, or does it happen with the pain when you turn your head?
PATIENT: It comes with the pain, Doctor. When I try to look around quick, or if I bend over… then it spins a little. Not all the time, just when I move my head. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. But it makes me worried. I don’t like feeling… off balance.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any other symptoms along with the headache and dizziness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, I don’t think. And no… blurry vision. I eat okay, so no stomach trouble. Maybe a little tired, but I am ninety years old, Doctor! I get tired easily. Is that what you mean? Anything else… no, I don’t think so. Nothing really stands out.
DOCTOR: Have you experienced any recent trauma to the head, even a minor bump?
PATIENT: Trauma? No, no. Nothing like that. I haven’t fallen or… hit my head on anything. I used to work around the rail yard, you know? Lots of bumps and bruises then, but nothing recent. Maybe I bumped it on the doorframe last week, but it didn’t hurt… not until these headaches started. Does that count? It was just a little tap.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No medicines, Doctor. Never been much for them. Just a little cream for my skin sometimes, but that’s all. And allergies… no, I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. Well, almost everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Brum, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, balance, and range of motion. Then we’ll see what’s going on. If you could just sit up a little straighter for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. I’ll sit up straight. My back isn’t what it used to be, but I can try. Just let me know if I need to do something special.
DOCTOR: First, let's take a look at your ears. Just relax and keep your head still. … Okay, ears look clear. Now, I'm going to check your eyes. Follow my finger with your eyes, don't move your head. … Good. Now, I want you to squeeze my hands as hard as you can. … Alright. And now I'm going to test your reflexes. … Hmm. A little diminished, but not unexpected at your age. Now, stand up slowly for me, if you can. … Good. Now, I want you to close your eyes and try to touch your nose with your finger. And now the other side. Alright. Now, try to turn your head to each side, and tell me if you feel any pain. … And how about bending your head forward and backward?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I’m doing my best. Turning my head… no, not too bad. A little stiff, but no sharp pain. But bending back… … that’s where it hurts. Right at the back of my head. Like a little… pinch. And it makes me feel a little dizzy again. Just for a second. It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, it makes sense. Alright, Mr. Brum. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it could be a muscle strain, perhaps aggravated by a minor bump, though we can’t be certain without further investigation. However, given your age and the dizziness, I want to be cautious. We need to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order a CT scan of your head, just to be on the safe side. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… a CT scan? What is that, Doctor? Is it… painful? And what does it do? I don’t want any… big machines if it’s going to hurt. I’m a little scared. I just want to know what’s wrong with my head. Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Brum. A CT scan is a type of X-ray, but it takes pictures of the inside of your head. It's not painful. You'll lie on a table, and a machine will rotate around you. It's quick, and you won’t feel anything. It helps us to see if there’s anything pressing on your brain or causing the pain. It's standard procedure when someone your age is experiencing a headache and dizziness. It’s better to be safe than sorry. We need to rule out things like a small bleed or something else that could be causing this. It doesn't mean there is anything serious, it just means we’re checking. Do you have anyone who can drive you to the imaging center?
PATIENT: Okay… no pain, you say? Just a picture? That’s… good. A little scary, but good. A picture… alright. I think I can handle a picture. And yes, my daughter, Elena, she can drive me. She lives close by. She worries about me, always has. She’ll want to know everything, of course. So… I go to this… imaging center, they take a picture, and then you’ll tell me what it shows? How long will that take, Doctor? I don’t want to wait too long to know. This worrying is… hard.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. You'll go to the imaging center, they’ll take the scan, and then the results will be sent to me. It usually takes 24 to 48 hours for the report to come through. I’ll have my assistant call you as soon as I have it, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Here's the referral form. It has the address and phone number of the imaging center. Make sure to bring your insurance information, even though you said you weren’t insured, they may need some information. And bring a list of any medications you’ve taken in the past, just in case. In the meantime, avoid any strenuous activity, and if the pain gets significantly worse, or you experience any new symptoms like weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… 24 to 48 hours. I can wait. I’ll call Elena right away. She’s good at these things. And I’ll try not to move my head too much. No insurance, but I’ll take the paper just in case. And no new symptoms… I’ll remember that. Weakness, numbness, talking… okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. It’s just… it’s good to know someone is looking at it. Even if it’s just a picture. I hope it's nothing bad. Is there anything else I need to know before I go?
DOCTOR: No, I don’t believe so. Just get the scan done as soon as possible. My assistant will be in touch to schedule your follow-up. Have a good day, Mr. Brum. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. I will. Have a good day too. .
