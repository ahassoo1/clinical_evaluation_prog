DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good to see you too, I guess. New to this… place. Just moved here. Doctor said I need to… check in, for the old people card? Medicare, I think it’s called. Old age, you know? Everything gets… loose. Not sick, just… old.
DOCTOR: Right, Medicare… yes, I see that here. So, you're mainly here for a welcome to the clinic visit and to get things established with your insurance, is that right?
PATIENT: Established? Like… a good relationship? I don’t need friends, I need… someone to tell me if I’m falling apart. Which I probably am. Look, I do makeup, okay? For the theater. Lots of… faces. And I need my face to not fall apart while I’m doing theirs. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, that’s perfectly good enough. So you want a general check-up, to make sure everything is… structurally sound, for your work. Makes sense. We can absolutely do that. Let's start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly before this?
PATIENT: Regularly? Hmph. When I had to. Back home, it was… different. Lots of waiting. And doctors who didn’t know what they were doing. I don’t… remember much. Maybe? I had a doctor. For a little while. Something about my… pressure? It was high, I think. But I feel fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure… that’s good to know. We'll definitely want to check that today. And don't worry, we'll get everything sorted out here. Do you remember when you were diagnosed with the high blood pressure, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Like… a long time ago? Before… before my divorce, maybe? She liked doctors. Always complaining. Always something. I just… let her go. Probably ten years? Fifteen? Who keeps track of these things? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, roughly ten to fifteen years ago. Okay. And were you ever put on any medications for it?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmph. Pills? Maybe. She gave me pills. Lots of pills. Little white ones, I think. Or maybe blue? They didn't… do anything. I stopped taking them. She got mad. It all… blurs together, you know? I'm a makeup artist, not a pharmacist!
DOCTOR: Right, that's… understandable. Okay. So, we’ll just do a quick check of your blood pressure today. Then we can talk about anything else that's bothering you. Any other medical problems you remember having?
PATIENT: Problems? Always problems. My back hurts. From bending over people's faces all day. And my knees. They creak. Like an old door. That's… normal, isn't it? For someone my age? I don't go around complaining like some people. I just… work.
DOCTOR: Back and knee pain… yes, that's common with the type of work you do and… with age, certainly. Alright. Let’s take a look at your blood pressure first. Then, if you're comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Exam? You mean… poke and prod? Hmph. Fine. But don't expect much. I'm a canvas, not a… a healthy specimen. Just be quick about it. I have things to do. Faces to paint.
DOCTOR: Alright, quick and efficient is the goal. If you could just have a seat on the table here... I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But if you find anything wrong, don’t tell me everything. I don't need bad news. I have enough problems already. And… be gentle. This isn't some young person's body anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds… a little fast, but no murmurs that I can detect. Lungs sound clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. Now, let's check your reflexes... Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common with age. Blood pressure is 150/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that.
PATIENT: 150… what does that mean? Is that bad? I told you I was old. Everything is falling apart. You’re just… confirming what I already know. This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: It means we'll want to monitor it, Mr. Szmyd. It's slightly elevated, but not immediately alarming. We can try some lifestyle changes – diet, exercise, stress management – and see if that helps. We can also discuss medication if necessary, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We'll do some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health, okay?
PATIENT: Blood work? More needles? Hmph. Fine. But don’t expect miracles. I’m not a young man anymore. I just want to keep working. That's all. Keep painting faces. That's all I ask. And... don’t make me come back here too often. I have a life, you know. A busy life. Mostly faces.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. We'll take things one step at a time. Blood work will help us get a baseline, and we can go from there. I'll have the nurse draw a few vials. Then we can schedule a follow-up to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable? As acceptable as it can be, I suppose. But tell the nurse to be quick. I don’t like needles. And… be sure she knows I'm a professional. I'm not some… nervous patient. I just have important things to do. Faces.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll let her know. I'll have her come in right away. Let's get that done, then we can finalize everything. Is there anything else I can address today, before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… get it over with. I have… clients waiting. Important people. Faces that need fixing. And frankly, I'm bored already. This is a waste of my time, you know. A perfectly good face, wasted on… tests.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll just step out and let the nurse come in. We’ll try to make this as quick and efficient as possible. I’ll be back shortly to discuss the results after the bloodwork. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Szmyd.
PATIENT: .
