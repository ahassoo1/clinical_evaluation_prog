DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been getting in my side… my flank, I think they call it. And I seem to be getting urinary tract infections quite a bit these days. It’s been going on for a while now, and it’s… troublesome. I was told it has something to do with my kidneys.
DOCTOR: Alright, flank pain and recurrent urinary tract infections. That is troublesome, as you say. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about this flank pain?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s… hard to describe exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes, mostly on my right side, but sometimes I feel it on the left too. It doesn't come every day, but when it does, it keeps me up at night sometimes. It’s worse if I drink a lot of fluids, I've noticed. And… I think it gets worse if I move around too much. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull ache, intermittent, right-sided primarily but sometimes on the left, worse with fluid intake and movement… We’ll certainly explore that. And you mentioned recurrent UTIs. How often would you say you’re getting those?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it used to be maybe once or twice a year, but lately… it feels like every few months. Perhaps three or four times in the last year? It’s enough to be a bother, I can tell you that. I get the usual symptoms – burning when I go to the bathroom, and the urge to go constantly, even when there’s nothing there. I take the pills the doctor prescribes, and it clears up for a bit, but then it comes back again.
DOCTOR: Okay, so approximately three to four UTIs in the last year, with typical symptoms of burning and frequent urination, relieved temporarily with antibiotics… I see. We definitely need to investigate why you're experiencing these recurrent infections. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I have been told I have something with my kidneys… Polycystic Kidney Disease, that’s what they called it. I was diagnosed a good many years ago, maybe twenty years now. I don't recall all the details. I saw a specialist back then, but I haven’t been to one in a long time. It wasn’t causing me much trouble for a while, but I suppose that’s changed now, with the pain and the infections. Is that what you were getting at?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Polycystic Kidney Disease is important information, and it certainly explains some of what you’re describing. The recurrent UTIs can be a common complication of PKD. Okay. And beyond the PKD, any other medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never been told I have high blood pressure or diabetes. My heart… well, I get a little breathless sometimes when I walk up hills, but the doctor always said it was just my age. I try to stay active, you know? I like to garden when the weather is good. Otherwise, I haven’t had any serious illnesses, really. I take a vitamin D supplement, that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, or any other allergies that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve taken all sorts of pills over the years, and never had a reaction. Not to any food, either. I eat pretty much anything, though I try to stick to healthier things these days. I do enjoy a little bit of chocolate now and then, but who doesn’t?
DOCTOR: Certainly. A little chocolate is perfectly acceptable! Now, let’s talk a bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, that’s a difficult question, Doctor. My family wasn’t one for talking about such things, to be honest. My mother… she passed away when I was quite young, from a heart ailment, I believe. And my father… he wasn't very healthy either, but I don’t recall the specifics. He worked very hard, manual labor, and I think that took a toll on his body. I have a brother, but we haven’t spoken in many years. I don’t know anything about his health. I suppose there's not much I can tell you, really. My family history isn't very… detailed.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Espinueva. It’s common for family medical histories to be incomplete. We'll proceed with what we do know. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. What sort of things would you like to know? I live alone, you see. Never married, never had children. I used to work as a receptionist, at a doctor’s office, of all things. Retired now, though. I mostly keep to myself, but I enjoy gardening, as I mentioned. I don’t smoke, never have. And I only drink a little bit of alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion. Nothing excessive. I’m not very active socially, but I’m content, you know? A quiet life suits me just fine.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Espinueva. A quiet life can be very fulfilling. Now, let’s proceed with a physical examination. I’d like to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also palpate your abdomen, and I'd like to check your flanks for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I'm used to being poked and prodded, working at a doctor's office and all. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148/92, pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are within normal limits, and lungs are clear. Now, during the abdominal palpation, I’m noting some tenderness in your right flank. Not severe, but present. I also feel a slight fullness in that area. Did you experience any discomfort with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's where I feel the pain most often. It's not a sharp pain, but a dull ache, like you said. And yes, I suppose I do feel a fullness there sometimes. It’s hard to describe. It feels… swollen, perhaps? It's not constant, but it comes and goes. It's a bit uncomfortable when I lie on my right side, so I try to sleep on my left. Does that make sense? I hope you can figure out what’s going on. It's been worrying me a bit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Espinueva. The tenderness and fullness in your right flank, correlating with your pain, is important information. Given your history of Polycystic Kidney Disease, recurrent UTIs, and the findings from the physical exam, I suspect your PKD is contributing to your symptoms. The cysts can cause flank pain and pressure, and they can also increase your risk of UTIs. However, to confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some additional tests. Would you be agreeable to a urine analysis, a complete blood count, and a renal ultrasound?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to have them done. A urine analysis, blood count, and ultrasound… yes, that sounds good. I trust your judgment. I just want to get to the bottom of this and feel better. It's been bothering me for quite some time now. When can we get these tests done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write the orders for those tests now. The laboratory is just down the hall, and they can draw the blood right away. They'll also need a urine sample, and I'll give you a container and instructions. The renal ultrasound will need to be scheduled, and my assistant, Sarah, will help you with that before you leave. We should have the results back within a week. In the meantime, I want you to continue to drink plenty of fluids – unless it worsens your flank pain, in which case, moderate your intake. And please, contact the office immediately if you experience any fever, chills, or worsening pain. Is there anything I can clarify for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. Plenty of fluids, moderate if the pain gets worse, and contact you if I have a fever or worsening pain… yes, I understand. I’ll see Sarah about scheduling the ultrasound. Thank you very much for your time and attention. I feel a bit better already, just knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. That’s what I’m here for. Sarah will be right with you to schedule your ultrasound. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in and contact you to discuss them further. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get this figured out together. Have a good day, and thank you for coming in.
