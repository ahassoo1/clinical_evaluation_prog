DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. The usual. Honestly, I can’t really remember why I need it, just that someone said I do. Medicare covers it, thankfully. Let’s just get it done, if you don’t mind. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. It's not uncommon to feel that way. Medicare does often recommend preventative lab work for individuals your age, and it’s a good idea to stay on top of these things. To ensure we're doing the right lab work for you, could you perhaps tell me if your primary care physician specifically requested certain tests, or if this is a general annual check-up?
PATIENT: Ugh… a primary care… right. I think it was Dr. Elkins? She’s… somewhere in town. I haven't seen her in a while, though. Look, I mostly just get a call saying “get your blood drawn.” I don’t really do details, if you catch my drift. Is there a standard list you use for… folks like me? That'd be easiest. Honestly, I just want to make sure everything's… ticking. You know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Croonquist. Many patients find the details a bit overwhelming. Yes, we do have a standard panel we often use for preventative care, particularly for individuals around your age. It generally includes a Complete Blood Count, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel – which checks your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar – as well as a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. We also typically check your Vitamin D levels. Does that sound like what you were anticipating, or are there any particular concerns you’ve had that we should address with additional testing?
PATIENT: Vitamin D… sounds right. All that stuff sounds… important, I guess. Honestly, Doctor, if you think that’s what I need, then I trust your judgment. I haven't felt anything wrong, exactly. Just… old. Everything feels a bit… slow, but that’s probably just the years piling up. No, I don’t think I need anything extra. Let’s just do the standard stuff. The quicker we get it done, the better.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Croonquist. We will proceed with the standard preventative panel then. Before we head to the lab, just to be thorough, could you quickly confirm any allergies you may have, and a list of any medications you are currently taking – including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I used to be a bit sensitive to dust, but that was years ago. Medications… that’s a good question. I take… a little blue pill every day, for… well, you know. And sometimes ibuprofen, when my knees act up. That’s it, I think. Nothing fancy. I honestly forget half the time if I even took the blue pill today. Don't write that down, though. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Croonquist. We'll simply note you take medication for erectile dysfunction and ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. It’s important to be aware of potential interactions, even with over-the-counter medications. Now, before we proceed, would you mind if I quickly listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you have to. I always feel a bit… poked and prodded. But fine. Get it over with, I suppose. I haven’t got all day. Just be gentle with my knees, okay? They're not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. I will be as gentle as possible. This won't take long. Alright, Mr. Croonquist. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We can monitor that during future visits. Now, could you please follow me to the lab?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Lead the way, Doctor. Honestly, all this fuss over a bit of blood… I used to work on power plants, you know. That was stressful. Not this. Just… get it done. The sooner the better. Let's go.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. I understand your feeling. The lab technician is expecting us. It should be relatively quick. .
