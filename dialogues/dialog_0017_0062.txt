DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I am Dr. Blim. Please, have a seat. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Blim. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue, and I appreciate you taking the time to see me. I am here regarding a matter with my workplace, specifically a request for an exemption… or perhaps an accommodation… concerning the requirement to wear masks and certain protective equipment. It’s causing me some difficulties, and I was advised to seek a professional opinion to document the situation.
DOCTOR: An… accommodation. Right. Well, Mr. Knabenshue, with all due respect, I deal in medicine, not workplace disputes. However, if it requires a medical assessment, we can proceed. But I assure you, I won’t be writing letters advocating for exceptions based on… preference. Now, can you elaborate on these “difficulties” you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: I understand completely, Doctor. I wouldn't ask you to involve yourself in a dispute. My intention is solely to determine if there's a medical basis for my discomfort, should one exist. It's not a matter of preference at all. The difficulty… well, it's a feeling of… restriction. A tightness in my chest, a bit of dizziness, and a general unease when my face is covered for extended periods. It’s difficult to explain, and it’s not something I’ve ever experienced before this recent requirement at work. It began almost immediately after we were mandated to wear the N95 respirators. It’s… unsettling, and it impacts my ability to focus on my duties. I work with vulnerable individuals, and I need to be at my sharpest.
DOCTOR: "Tightness in the chest, dizziness, unease…" Sounds rather… vague, Mr. Knabenshue. Are you experiencing any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not shortness of breath. It’s not that I can’t breathe, it’s more… a feeling of being constricted, like there’s pressure. It’s a difficult sensation to describe, I apologize. It's not painful, exactly, but deeply uncomfortable. I haven’t noticed it outside of work, only when required to wear the mask for a full shift. Would it be helpful if I tried to explain the type of mask we are required to wear? Perhaps that would clarify things.
DOCTOR: No, no, the specifics of the mask aren't critical. It's an N95, I understand. These vague symptoms… they could be anything, frankly. Anxiety is quite common these days. Have you experienced any significant stress lately?
PATIENT: I understand your point, Doctor. And I appreciate your honesty. I have not experienced any significant stress recently, no. My work is demanding, certainly, but it is work I find fulfilling. I manage the caseload well, and I have a strong support system outside of my profession. This feeling is… new. It’s not related to worry or anxiety, not that I can discern. It's a purely physical reaction, it seems. Perhaps… a sensitivity? I’m not sure. I was hoping you could perhaps help me determine if there's a medical explanation for this discomfort.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a basic physical exam. I need to listen to your lungs, check your heart rate, and take your blood pressure. Then we'll see what, if anything, is actually going on. Please, remove your shirt and shoes. We’ll start with auscultation of the chest.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I will comply without issue. I understand the need for a thorough examination. Please let me know if you require anything further. I trust your assessment.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Heart rate is normal. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but nothing concerning given your age. No wheezing, no crackles. Respiratory effort appears normal. Any pain with palpation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain whatsoever with that palpation. It feels… normal. Just the regular sensation of your touch, nothing more. I am relieved to hear my lungs and heart appear to be in good condition, however. I admit, I was somewhat worried there might be an underlying issue contributing to this discomfort.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Knabenshue, everything appears within normal limits. Objectively, there is nothing to explain your symptoms. This could be a case of… somatization. Or, frankly, a heightened awareness of normal bodily sensations. I can document that you underwent a physical exam and no abnormalities were found. Will that suffice for your employer?
PATIENT: I see. That is… not what I had hoped to hear, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness, of course, but it is disheartening to learn there is no discernible physical cause. I suppose documenting the exam is a start. However, will that truly satisfy my employer? I fear they will require more than simply a statement of “no abnormalities.” Would it be possible to perhaps explore other avenues? Perhaps a referral to a specialist, someone who focuses on… environmental sensitivities, or even psychological factors if you believe that is a more likely explanation? I am willing to pursue any reasonable path to resolve this issue.
DOCTOR: A specialist, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. If you believe it is warranted. I understand that my symptoms are… vague, and that this may not fall neatly into a typical medical diagnosis. But I am genuinely experiencing distress, and I am committed to finding a solution that allows me to continue performing my duties safely and effectively. A referral, even a consultation, could provide further insight. I am willing to cover the cost myself, if necessary. I simply want to ensure all possibilities have been explored. Perhaps a referral to an allergist would be appropriate, to rule out any unforeseen sensitivities?
DOCTOR: Very well. I suppose an allergist wouldn't hurt, though I highly doubt it will yield any significant findings. I’ll provide you with a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed. She’s… thorough. Be warned, she will likely order a battery of tests, most of which will be unnecessary. But it seems you are insistent. Here is the referral information. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Blim. I greatly appreciate your willingness to accommodate my request, despite your skepticism. I understand your concerns, and I will proceed with the referral to Dr. Reed. I appreciate your time and expertise. If you’ll excuse me, I’ll contact Dr. Reed’s office to schedule an appointment. Have a good day, Doctor. .
