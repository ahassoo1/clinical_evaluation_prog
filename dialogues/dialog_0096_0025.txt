DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie, good to meet you. Eighty-five years young, eh?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Eighty-five. People say I look good for my age, though. But… that not why I here, right? I want to know… about my family. Long, long ago.
DOCTOR: Your family history, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I make little boats… little houses… from wood. Always I think… who build first? Where they come from? I hear stories… Marshall Islands… but… maybe more? Maybe other places? I want to know for sure. That why I think… DNA test? You understand?
DOCTOR: A DNA test… Well, Mr. Scobie, that’s… an interesting request. It's not exactly a typical medical concern. Are you experiencing any health problems that make you concerned about your ancestry?
PATIENT: No, no problems. Body good for eighty-five. But… my heart… my heart want to know. Like… finding a missing piece? You know? Not sick. Just… curious. Is okay to do test even if no sick?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Scobie, while I appreciate your… enthusiasm, those tests aren't really covered by Medicare for genealogical purposes. They’re expensive, and frankly, often don't provide definitive answers. A lot of the information is… unreliable. It's not something I routinely recommend, especially when you're feeling well. Are you having any issues with memory, or any family history of genetic diseases that you're worried about?
PATIENT: Expensive? Oh. I… I don't have much money. Just the Medicare. And no… no memory problems. And family… mostly fishermen. Strong people. No… what you call it? Sickness in family? No. I just… want to know where I from. Is there… maybe cheaper test? Or… can you tell me something about Marshall Islands people? Maybe you know?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Scobie, I can certainly look up some general information about the Marshall Islands. Historically, the islands have a rich cultural heritage, with a strong seafaring tradition. The population has a history of exposure to radiation from past testing, which can have some health implications, but you don’t seem to be presenting with any of those. As for cheaper tests… there are some direct-to-consumer kits, but I really can't vouch for their accuracy. They're not medical-grade, you see. What exactly are you hoping to gain from knowing more about your ancestry?
PATIENT: Hmm… I make boats, like I say. Little houses. I want to make them… right. Like my grandfathers made. But… I don’t remember how they did. Maybe the test… tell me what kind of wood they use? What kind of houses they build? Maybe… tell me stories I forget? Is silly, I know. But… I feel like… a piece missing. Like a boat without a sail. I want to finish the boat, you understand?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, a DNA test isn't going to tell you what kind of wood your grandfathers used, or the specific techniques they employed. Those are skills and traditions passed down through generations, not encoded in your genes. Perhaps… talking to elders in your community, or researching traditional Marshallese boatbuilding techniques would be a more fruitful approach?
PATIENT: There… not many elders left. Most gone now. And I… I left islands long time ago. Didn't learn so much. That why I think maybe… the test? Even small piece of story? You… you can’t do anything? Even small test? Just to see… a little? I pay… if I have money.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Scobie, I understand your desire to connect with your heritage. It's admirable, truly. But I’m a medical doctor, not an anthropologist. Offering unnecessary tests, especially expensive ones, just isn’t ethical. I can, however, provide you with some resources for Marshallese cultural organizations. They might be able to help you find information or connect with people who can share traditional knowledge. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that would be good. Thank you, Doctor. Even small help… is good. Maybe… maybe they have stories. Maybe they remember. Stories are good. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Here you are. This list includes a few organizations dedicated to preserving Marshallese culture. They have websites and contact information. I also want to reiterate that if you begin experiencing any health concerns, please don't hesitate to come back and see me. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Scobie?
PATIENT: No… no, that is good. Thank you very much, Doctor. You have been very kind. I will… look for the stories. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Take care, Mr. Scobie. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
