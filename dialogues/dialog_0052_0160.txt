DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. It’s about time someone got around to seeing me. Look, I’m just… tired. Really tired. And it’s not just regular tired, you know? It’s…deeper. And I’ve been…well, I’ve been eating dirt. Yes, dirt. Don’t look at me like that. It helps, okay? It’s just…a craving. Is that what you wanted to know? Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Hardenburgh. It takes courage to be open about these things. I understand you're experiencing significant fatigue, and you’ve also been consuming dirt. I assure you, I’m not here to judge, but to understand what’s going on and how we can best help you. Could you tell me a little more about this fatigue?
PATIENT: Help? Honestly, I doubt anyone can help. It’s just…always there. It doesn’t matter how much I sleep – and I sleep plenty, thank you very much – I wake up feeling like I ran a marathon. It’s been getting worse for months, I guess. I just thought it was getting old, you know? But then…the dirt started. And now it’s…it’s just a constant thing. I try to ignore it, but it’s…difficult. What do you want to know exactly? Don’t waste my time with silly questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh. It sounds incredibly draining to feel constantly exhausted despite getting adequate sleep. And I appreciate you being so forthcoming about the dirt consumption – it’s important information. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe when this fatigue started, specifically?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifically? Honestly, I don’t know. Maybe…six months ago? Seven? It all blurs together when you’re tired all the time. It started gradually, you know? Just a little more tired each day. I chalked it up to the weather, then to…well, everything, really. I’ve got a lot going on. It wasn’t like a sudden thing, if that’s what you want to know. Just…slowly getting worse. And then the dirt started, and it felt…better, so I kept doing it. Happy now? Are we getting somewhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hardenburgh, we are getting somewhere. Thank you for clarifying that it began gradually. It's helpful to know it wasn't a sudden onset. And I understand you’ve found some relief with consuming dirt; that's a crucial piece of information. Now, could you tell me a little more about how you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t ask me to describe feelings. Honestly. Like…weak. Just…completely weak. Everything feels like a huge effort. Even getting out of bed is a struggle. And it’s not just physical, you know? It’s…mental, too. Foggy. I can’t concentrate. I forget things. But I do remember things, perfectly well, when I need to. Don’t think I’m senile or something. It’s just…hard to explain. It’s just…blah. Everything feels blah. Are you writing all this down? You better be.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hardenburgh, I am documenting everything you're telling me. I understand it's difficult to put these feelings into words, and you are explaining it very well. The weakness, the mental fog, the difficulty concentrating…these are all important details. Now, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, appetite is…gone. I don’t really feel like eating. Everything tastes…wrong. And yes, I’ve lost weight. I haven't weighed myself in a while, but my clothes are looser. I’m already thin, mind you, so I don’t need to lose any more. People tell me I look…pale. I don’t bother with mirrors anymore. It’s just…depressing. Now, are we still on this? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hardenburgh, we are still working through this, and I appreciate your patience. It’s helpful to understand the full picture. The loss of appetite and weight loss are significant. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about other areas of your health. Have you noticed any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? No, not really. Maybe a little…uncomfortable sometimes, but nothing major. Nausea? No. Vomiting? Definitely not. Bowel habits…look, I don’t want to talk about my bowel habits with a stranger. This is ridiculous. Honestly, what does any of this have to do with me eating dirt? Just get to the point, already. I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. I’m asking about these things because they can sometimes be related to the symptoms you're experiencing. We need to rule out different possibilities. Let’s move on. Have you noticed any unusual bleeding or bruising?
PATIENT: Bleeding? No. Bruising? A little, maybe. I bump into things, you know? I'm not as steady on my feet as I used to be. But nothing unusual. Honestly, I’m a bit clumsy. It’s just…part of getting old. Look, are you going to ask me about every little thing that’s wrong with me? This is getting ridiculous. Just tell me what’s wrong, already. What am I lacking? Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick answer, Ms. Hardenburgh. I assure you, I'm working as efficiently as possible to understand the cause of your symptoms. We're gathering information to narrow down the possibilities. To help me do that, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Honestly, who hasn't? I had the flu, probably a dozen times. Pneumonia once, a long time ago. Nothing serious. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I don’t go to doctors unless I absolutely have to, you know? They just poke and prod and tell you to take pills. Waste of time and money. I haven’t been to a doctor in…years. Probably five years, at least. Now, are we getting anywhere? I really need to get going. This is taking forever.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s helpful to know that you haven’t had any major medical issues in the past. And I understand your reluctance to seek medical attention. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I've always been too scared. And frankly, I don't trust doctors enough to let them cut me open. I've heard too many horror stories. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself, thank you very much. Now, can we please wrap this up? I'm starting to feel dizzy. And it's not just the fatigue, I think it's this whole…interrogation.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hardenburgh. It's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about surgeries. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake! Family history? Honestly, my family? A mess. Everyone died of something or other. Heart problems, cancer…the usual. My mother had…I don’t even remember what, it was years ago. And my father…well, he didn't take care of himself. It’s all a blur. Honestly, I barely knew either of them. It's not like any of this is relevant. Just get to the point! What am I lacking? Is it iron? Vitamin D? Just tell me already! I'm getting a headache. And I don’t have time for this. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand your frustration and your desire for a quick answer. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and I apologize for taking up your time. However, gathering a thorough history is essential to making an accurate assessment. Now, I'm going to conduct a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your abdomen. Would that be alright?
