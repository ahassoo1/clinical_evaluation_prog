DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my skin. It’s been so itchy, you wouldn't believe. Just driving me crazy, really. It started a few weeks ago, I think… maybe a month? It's hard to keep track, honestly.
DOCTOR: Hmm, itchy skin, you say. A month, alright. And is it all over, or just in certain spots?
PATIENT: Mostly on my arms and back, I’d say. And my legs a little. Not on my face, thankfully! It's just… a constant little prickle, you know? It doesn’t really look bad, just… feels awful. I’ve been putting lotion on it, but it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Right, so arms, back, legs… not the face, good. And lotion isn’t doing a lot for it. Have you tried any other creams or anything?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I had some hydrocortisone cream from… well, a long time ago. Used a little bit on my arm, but it didn't really do much either, to be honest. I mostly just try to ignore it, but it's hard when you’re trying to sleep, you know? It just gets worse at night.
DOCTOR: Hydrocortisone, alright. And you said it’s worse at night… are you noticing anything else with it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little more tired lately. Just generally run down. But I figured that was just… getting older, you know? I don't know if that's connected or not. And… sometimes, it feels a little bumpy, like tiny little… I don’t know, hives? But they don't really look like hives, if that makes sense. Small and flat.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tiredness and some slight bumpiness... It’s good you’re telling me all of this. Now, have you been exposed to anything new lately?
PATIENT: New? Oh, goodness… let me think. Not really. I haven't traveled anywhere. I haven’t changed my laundry detergent. My grandson visited last month, he was playing in the garden… maybe something from the garden? He brought some flowers inside, I think. But that was weeks ago. I really don’t know. Honestly, Doctor, I’m just confused. It just started out of nowhere.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it could be a number of things. We’ll need to take a closer look. Let’s have you lie down on the exam table, and I'll take a look at your skin.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Just tell me where you want me to lie down, and I'll get right up there. Is it okay if I keep my glasses on?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely keep your glasses on. Just lie on your back for now, and I’ll start with your arms and back. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay. There we go. Just let me know if I need to move any. This is a little cold, isn't it? But that's alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m seeing some very subtle redness on your arms, and a few small, flat bumps. It’s not a severe rash, but it is there. And on your back… similar. A little bit of dryness too. No broken skin, no blisters… is it itchy all over, or are there specific spots that are worse?
PATIENT: It's… hard to say, honestly. It's just a general itchiness, but I think my lower back is the worst. And the backs of my arms, right here. It feels… prickly and sort of… burning sometimes? Not a bad burn, just… uncomfortable. And it seems to get worse if I scratch it, which I know I shouldn’t do, but it’s hard not to!
DOCTOR: Right. Prickly, burning… and scratching makes it worse, as it usually does. Alright, Ms. Cassimatis, I want to rule a few things out. It could be something as simple as dry skin, but given the burning sensation and the itchiness, we need to be a bit more thorough. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a liver function test. We also should consider a possible allergic reaction, although you haven’t mentioned anything new.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests? Are they… serious tests? I don't really like needles, Doctor. And I don’t have insurance, so… will they be expensive? I just want to know what’s causing the itch, you know? It's just so annoying.
DOCTOR: Now, now, don’t get yourself worked up. They're routine blood tests. A simple blood draw. And yes, I understand you’re concerned about the cost. We can discuss that with the billing department. It’s better to rule things out, rather than guess and potentially have it get worse. We need to see what your body is telling us. And frankly, at your age, it's important to keep an eye on these things. I’ll write up the orders now. The lab is just down the hall. They'll take care of you.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright then. I suppose you’re right. It’s just… it’s a little scary, going to all this trouble for an itch. But if you think it's best... Just please tell me if anything comes up that is… really serious? I don’t want any surprises. And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t take more than a few days, Ms. Cassimatis. I’ll have the nurse call you with the results. And of course, if anything is concerning, we will contact you immediately. Here you go. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, try to avoid scratching, and we'll see what the tests tell us. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. I'll just… wait for the nurse, then.
