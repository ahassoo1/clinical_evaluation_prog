DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Venus. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Quicksey. It is… a pleasure, I suppose. Though, not a happy pleasure. I am here because… well, my memory. It has been… troubling me lately. I do not… forget everything, you understand. I remember dates, numbers… very clearly. But small things. Recent things. It is… disconcerting. I am Venus Alvara.
DOCTOR: I understand, Venus. It can be very concerning when you notice changes in your memory, even if it's not a complete loss. You said dates and numbers are clear, but recent events are more difficult to recall?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. For example… yesterday, I made a telephone call to… to arrange for someone to… to collect some… things. From my garage. Very important things. And I… I cannot recall who I called. Or even what things I asked them to collect. It is… frustrating. And a little frightening, to be honest. I am usually very… organized.
DOCTOR: I see. That is unsettling, Venus, especially when it deviates from your usual organized self. And it’s good that you recognize the change and are addressing it. To get a better understanding, could you tell me approximately when you first started noticing these memory lapses?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is… a difficult question. It has been… gradual. Perhaps… six months ago? No, not six months exactly. More like… eight? It began with… misplacing items. Keys, spectacles… things one usually knows where they are. Then… forgetting names. Not important names, you understand. Acquaintances. People I see infrequently. But now… it is more significant. Like the telephone call. And… I sometimes find myself repeating questions. Or… tasks.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over approximately eight months, starting with misplacing items and progressing to difficulty recalling recent events and some repetition of questions or tasks. That’s helpful information. Now, Venus, have you noticed any other changes alongside the memory issues?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… … My blood pressure has been… elevated, Doctor. Very elevated. My physician… the one before he retired… prescribed medication. I take it regularly, as directed. But it does not… always seem to help. Sometimes I feel… dizzy. And… a little… confused. Not all the time, you understand. But more frequently than… before. And… I have been… more tired. Much more tired. Even after a full night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have elevated blood pressure, episodes of dizziness and confusion, and increased fatigue. These could certainly be related to the memory concerns, or they could be separate issues. Do you happen to know what medication you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It is… Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, daily. I keep the bottle… in the kitchen. It is a… white bottle, with blue writing. I have been taking it for… oh, goodness… at least five years, perhaps longer. It did help, initially. But lately… it seems less effective. I have… not mentioned it to anyone, as I have not seen a physician since… before the pandemic.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venus. That’s very helpful. And it's good you remembered the dosage. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I had… a difficult childbirth, many years ago. A breech presentation. But I recovered fully, thankfully. And… I broke my arm, as a child. A silly accident, involving a tree. But otherwise… I have always been… quite healthy. I eat… reasonably well. Though I do enjoy a good pastry, occasionally. And I walk… when the weather permits. I try to maintain… a sensible lifestyle.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Venus. It sounds like you've generally been very healthy. And enjoying a pastry now and then is perfectly fine! Now, has anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or other close relatives – experienced memory problems or been diagnosed with conditions like Alzheimer’s disease or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is… a difficult question. My mother… she did become… forgetful, towards the end of her life. But it was attributed to… old age, mostly. She lived to be ninety-two, which is… a long time. And my father… he had… heart problems. Very serious heart problems. He passed away… quite suddenly. As for siblings… I have no siblings. I was… an only child.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venus. That provides some helpful context. Now, to get a better understanding of your current cognitive function, I’d like to do a brief cognitive assessment. It’s a series of simple questions and tasks that will help me evaluate your memory, attention, and other mental abilities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… test? I suppose… yes. But I warn you, Doctor, I am not fond of tests. I have always performed… adequately, but I have never enjoyed them. And I am rather… tired, as I mentioned. But if you believe it is necessary… then I will cooperate. Just… please be brief.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venus. I understand. It won’t be anything strenuous, and I’ll keep it as brief as possible. It’s simply a way for me to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date? It is… August 2nd, 2025. A Friday, is it not? I do keep track of such things. It is… important to be organized.
DOCTOR: That’s correct. Very good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: We are in… a rural community. I do not know the precise name of the town, Doctor. I was brought here by my… friend. She handles all such… logistical matters. I am afraid I am not very good with… geography.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. Now, I’m going to say three words, and I want you to try and remember them. Please repeat them back to me after I say them. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. Though I warn you… I have a very good memory. It is… selective, perhaps, but generally quite good. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. I have them.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you to do a simple calculation for me. If you have ten apples, and you give three to your friend, how many apples do you have left?
PATIENT: Seven. I have seven apples left. A simple calculation, Doctor. Though I do not enjoy… arithmetic. It always was… my weakest subject.
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: I already told you the year, Doctor. It is 2025. Have you not been listening?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Venus. My apologies. I’m just trying to get a comprehensive picture. I ask these questions repeatedly to assess consistency. Now, let’s return to those three words I asked you to remember earlier – apple, table, penny. Can you repeat them back to me now?
PATIENT: … Apple… yes, I remember apple. And… table. But the third word… it escapes me. I am afraid… I cannot recall it. It is… very frustrating.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Venus. That’s perfectly normal. It can be difficult to recall things, especially with a bit of distraction. Now, let's move on to a different task. I’m going to ask you to copy this simple drawing for me. Please try to copy it as accurately as possible.
PATIENT: Intersecting… pentagons? This is… rather difficult. I have not… drawn anything in many years. My hands are… not as steady as they once were. I will… do my best. But I make no promises.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venus. That’s perfectly alright. You did your best. Now, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your daily activities. Are you having any difficulty with things like managing your finances, preparing meals, or taking your medication?
PATIENT: … Well… the finances are… handled by my friend, mostly. She is very… efficient. As for meals… I do manage to prepare simple things. Soup, mostly. Toast. But… I have been forgetting to… eat, occasionally. And the medication… yes, sometimes I forget. It is… a small oversight. But… concerning, nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venus. That’s very helpful information. Based on the brief cognitive assessment and your responses to my questions, you are experiencing some cognitive difficulties, specifically with recent memory and executive function. The inaccuracies in the drawing also suggest some spatial difficulties. Now, I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms. I also recommend a brain scan, such as an MRI, to get a more detailed look at your brain structure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A brain scan? Is something… seriously wrong, Doctor? I do not… care for scans. And blood work… I dislike needles. But… if it is necessary… then I suppose I must. What are you looking for, exactly? And will it be… painful?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Venus. A brain scan and blood work are simply to help us understand what might be causing your memory difficulties. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious is wrong. The blood work will check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and electrolyte imbalances. The brain scan will allow us to look for any structural abnormalities or signs of stroke or dementia. The blood draw will cause a brief pinch, but it's usually very quick. The brain scan is painless; you'll simply lie still inside a scanner for about 30-45 minutes. I would also like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the tests and develop a plan of action. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you believe it is… necessary. Blood work and a scan. And a follow-up appointment. But… please, be as quick as possible. I have… commitments. And I do not enjoy spending time in… medical facilities.
