DOCTOR: Right, Odell Tayar. 22 years old. Okay. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh... travel. I need... paper for travel? My wife... she liked to go places. Now I need to go too. Somewhere. I don't remember exactly where anymore. It was her plan.
DOCTOR: Okay... travel. And you’re needing some paperwork for it?
PATIENT: Yeah, paperwork. And... shots, maybe? She always got shots before we go. Lots of them. Small ones. Big ones. I don't... I don't know which ones. It's all a bit blurry, you see? It's been… a while.
DOCTOR: Right, blurry. Okay. So, you're thinking you might need travel vaccinations… and potentially some documentation for travel. Just to be clear, are you planning a trip now, or are you getting things in order for a future trip?
PATIENT: Now. I think so. A man… from the agency… he said I needed to come here. Soon. He didn’t say where exactly. Just… somewhere warm. Somewhere she always wanted to go. I just need… the things. The paper and… the sticks.
DOCTOR: Okay… agency. Let’s see if anything comes up on your record. Hmm. Nothing specific about an agency visit. Alright. Just to be thorough, do you happen to remember any details about why you’re traveling?
PATIENT: Why...? No. Not really. It’s… a promise. To her. She wanted me to… see the mountains. And the… the blue water. She had a picture. Lots of blue. I think it was… far away. Very far. She booked it all. Before… everything. I just need to go, you know? To… finish it.
DOCTOR: Okay. A promise. That's… understandable. Alright, let's start with a quick check-up, just to make sure you're fit for travel. Have you been feeling alright generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Yeah. Fine. I… eat. I sleep. Sometimes I forget where I put things. Like my glasses. But… mostly fine. No cough. No… fever. Just tired, maybe? Old tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, no fever. Just tired. Alright. Let’s take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, just as a baseline. Could you please sit back and relax for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Relax. Is it… a long check-up? I have things to do, you know. Paper to get. Places to go.
DOCTOR: It won't be long, Odell. Just a quick listen, a few questions. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Nothing to panic about, but something we should be aware of. Okay, just breathe normally… and I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness...? No. Not really. Unless I walk up a hill. Then maybe a little. But… hills aren’t important right now. Mountains are important. She liked mountains.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, everything sounds clear in your lungs, but the blood pressure is a bit of a concern. We should discuss that. Before we get to that, can you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Diagnosed...? No. Not that I know of. She took care of all that. Doctors and… pills. She always remembered. I just… went. She said I was… strong. Enough strong.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? No. Never. No knives. She… wouldn't let them. She said… too risky. I get seasick. That’s the closest I got to a doctor. She gave me little pills for that. Green ones.
DOCTOR: Okay. No surgeries. Just the seasickness pills. Let's talk about those pills for a moment. Do you still have them?
PATIENT: Uh… maybe. Somewhere. In the box. The big box. She had lots of boxes. With… things. I haven't really looked through them much. Too many memories. And… I don't remember what they looked like, exactly. Green, I think. Small, round, green.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Let's talk about allergies. Any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No. Not really. Except… dust. Sometimes makes me sneeze. And… sadness. Makes my nose run. But… that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that's not an allergy. Alright, let’s move on. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. She didn't like smoke. Made her cough. Drink? Sometimes. With her. Wine. Red wine. Not much. Drugs? Never. She said… bad for the mountains.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Odell. This is… a bit difficult, because I'm trying to get a clear picture of your health, and it sounds like your wife handled most of your medical care. Do you remember any doctors she took you to?
PATIENT: Doctors...? Uh… there was a man. Tall man. White coat. He gave me a shot. In the arm. Big needle. But… I don't remember his name. Or where it was. Just… a needle. And… she held my hand. She always held my hand.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of grief, Odell. And it’s making it difficult to remember details. That’s perfectly understandable. We need to figure out what vaccinations you may have had, and what, if anything, you need before traveling. Considering your memory issues, and the lack of clear records, I’m going to recommend a full panel of travel vaccinations to be safe.
PATIENT: Full panel...? Lots of needles? That's… expensive, isn’t it? And… painful. She didn’t like me being in pain. Can’t we just… get the green pills? And the paper?
DOCTOR: Odell, I understand your concerns. And I wish we had more information to work with. But without knowing what vaccinations you've already had, we have to err on the side of caution. It’s better to be safe and protected, especially if you’re traveling to a remote area. As for the cost, let’s see what your insurance covers. And I’ll do my best to make the process as comfortable as possible. I'm also concerned about your blood pressure. We need to manage that, regardless of the travel. I’m going to write you a prescription for a medication to help lower it, and schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor your progress. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Prescription...? More pills. I… I don't like pills. She gave them to me, but… I always forgot to take them. And they made me feel… strange. Can't we just... go? Finish what she wanted? The mountains, the blue water... It won't take long.
DOCTOR: Odell, I understand you want to honor your wife’s wishes. And I want to help you do that. But I’m a doctor, and my priority is your health and safety. Traveling without proper vaccinations and managing your blood pressure could be dangerous. I'm going to write a referral to a specialist, a geriatrician, who can help assess your memory issues and overall health. They can also discuss your concerns about medication and find a plan that works for you. And I'll schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the specialist’s recommendations. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Specialist…? More doctors. I just… want to go. To the mountains. It’s all I have left. Please. Can't we just give me the paper? And the green pills? I'll be careful. I promise.
DOCTOR: Odell, I hear you. And I understand how much this trip means to you. I truly do. But I can’t, in good conscience, send you on a trip without ensuring you’re as healthy as possible. It would be irresponsible of me. I'm going to write a prescription for a low dose blood pressure medication, just to start. And I will provide you with a basic travel health checklist, information on preventing common illnesses. But I strongly advise you to see the specialist. We can discuss the vaccinations further after you’ve been evaluated. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Paper… and pills. Just… please, make it quick. I… I don’t want to be here all day. The mountains are waiting.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. I’ll get the paperwork printed for you now. Here you are. This is a basic travel checklist, a list of recommended items to pack, and some information about common travel illnesses. And here’s the prescription for the blood pressure medication. Please take this to the pharmacy. The pharmacist can answer any questions you have about the medication. And remember, it's important to schedule an appointment with the specialist. I'll have my nurse give you the referral information before you leave. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… thank you. I guess. I need to go now. The mountains…
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. You take care. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will walk you out. Safe travels. .
