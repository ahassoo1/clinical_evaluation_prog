DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I’m Dr. Sham. It’s… nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sham. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Well, I suppose you could say I’m looking for a bit of a… well, a fresh start. I’m feeling… not quite myself lately. A little sluggish, you know? I want to feel more like me again. I’m eighty-seven years young, and I’d like to enjoy these years! I’m hoping you can help me get a little “jumpstart” to my health.
DOCTOR: Alright, a “fresh start” and a bit more energy. That's a good goal. "Not quite yourself" is… helpful, but could you tell me a little more specifically what that means?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s not any one thing, you see. I used to walk every morning, down to the beach and back. Now, I find myself… needing a bit of a rest halfway through. And I don’t have the same… pep, I suppose, for my garden. I used to spend hours out there, but now… just a little while. It’s hard to explain. I just feel…old. Not that old necessarily, but… worn out. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Ms. McNabb. Fatigue and a decrease in your usual activities. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… my memory isn’t what it used to be, of course. But I don’t think it’s worse lately, just… old age. And I’ve been sleeping… well, I sleep a lot. Not necessarily a bad sleep, just… more of it. And sometimes I feel a little… achy. Not constant pain, just… little twinges here and there. Especially in my knees, and my back sometimes. Oh! And I haven’t been as hungry lately. Not that I don’t eat, just… not the same appetite. Is that too much information? I tend to ramble.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. McNabb. That's helpful. Memory changes, increased sleep, aches and pains, decreased appetite… We’re building a picture here. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s a good question. Let me think… years ago, when my husband was still alive, I had my gallbladder removed. That was… a long time ago now. And the doctor told me once I had a little bit of arthritis, but he never really did anything about it. Just said to stay active. And I’ve had the usual… the flu shots every year, and a pneumonia shot a few years back. Oh, and I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for… oh, I don’t know, twenty years maybe? I take a little pill every morning. I can’t remember the name of it right off hand. I’m sorry. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. High blood pressure is important to know. Do you recall any surgeries other than the gallbladder?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… No, I don’t believe so. Just the gallbladder. I did have a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist, but that wasn’t a surgery. They just put it in a cast. And… oh! I had my cataracts removed, one in each eye, a few years apart. That was very helpful, I could barely see before that! But that wasn’t really a surgery, was it? Just… a procedure. I always get those mixed up. Is it important if it wasn’t a big surgery?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. McNabb. It all helps us get a complete picture. And yes, cataract removal is a surgical procedure. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, although I try to watch my salt intake. My doctor always told me to, with the blood pressure. But no, no allergies. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve been very lucky, in that regard. Though, I do get a little itchy sometimes after I’ve been gardening. But that's probably just the plants, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a likely explanation. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, I take a little vitamin D pill every day. The doctor said my levels were a little low. And sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I take a little over-the-counter pain reliever. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. Just when I need it, though. Not every day. And… oh! And I take a little stool softener sometimes, if I’m feeling… well, if I’m constipated. Sorry to be so blunt. It just happens sometimes. Is that all? I always worry I’m forgetting something.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. McNabb. It’s good to know everything you’re taking. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s a tough one. My mother… she had heart trouble, I believe. She passed away when I was quite young. And my father, he had diabetes. He lost his leg, poor man. And my brother… he had high blood pressure, like me. And… oh! My aunt, on my mother’s side, she had something with her bones. Osteoporosis, I think it was called. She broke her hip when she was older. Does that help? I always get everyone mixed up. There were so many of us.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. That gives us a good idea. And finally, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Lifestyle… Well, as I said, I used to walk every morning. But now it’s… less frequent. I live alone, you see. My husband passed away ten years ago. I have a daughter, but she lives on the mainland. We talk on the phone, but she can’t visit very often. I enjoy gardening, when I have the energy. And I like to read. Mostly mysteries. And I try to watch what I eat. Though I do have a bit of a sweet tooth, I confess! I drink a cup of coffee every morning, and a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing too much, you understand. Just a little treat. Is that what you meant by lifestyle?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, Ms. McNabb. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. You just go right ahead. It’s been a while since I’ve had a good check-up, so I’m sure I need it!
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here for me. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just take deep breaths, if you could. Heart sounds are… regular, but a little diminished. Lungs are clear, but I do hear some mild… wheezing on exhale. Nothing terribly concerning at this point. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 145 over 85. Pulse is regular at 78. And now, let's take a look at your knees. Any pain with bending these?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that does hurt a little, Doctor. Especially when I bend them. It's not a sharp pain, more of a… ache. And sometimes they feel a little stiff, especially in the morning. It’s been getting worse lately, I think. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but it’s hard to. It makes it difficult to walk. Do you think it's serious? I do worry about falling again.
DOCTOR: I feel some crepitus and a little swelling. It looks like you have some osteoarthritis in both knees, which is consistent with your age and symptoms. It’s not an emergency, but it is something we need to address. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s also common with age. Overall, your neurological exam is… within normal limits. Okay, Ms. McNabb. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found in the exam, it sounds like you’re dealing with a combination of things - osteoarthritis in your knees, some mild fatigue, and possible early signs of reduced mobility. Your blood pressure is a little high, and we should keep an eye on that. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Arthritis… I suppose I expected that. My mother had something with her joints, I remember. So… what does that mean? Will it get worse? And what can we do about it? I don’t want to be stuck inside all the time. Is there anything I can take? Or exercises I can do? I’m willing to try anything, really. I just want to feel better again. And my blood pressure… is that serious? Should I be worried? I apologize for all the questions. I just… I’m a little overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: You're not overwhelming me at all, Ms. McNabb. Those are all very good questions. Let’s take them one at a time. The osteoarthritis is likely to progress slowly over time, but we can definitely manage it to minimize your pain and improve your function. We can start with some simple things. Weight management is helpful, even a little bit can make a difference. Regular, gentle exercise – things like walking, swimming, or even just range-of-motion exercises at home – can help strengthen the muscles around your knees and reduce pain. We can also talk about over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, but we need to be careful about long-term use because of potential side effects. Regarding your blood pressure, it's slightly elevated, but not at a critical level right now. We can try lifestyle modifications first – a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, and stress reduction. I can also prescribe a medication to help lower it if needed. I'd like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any other potential causes of your fatigue. I also think it would be helpful to get an X-ray of your knees to assess the severity of the arthritis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood work and an X-ray… whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’ll try my best to eat better and exercise more. It’s just… hard sometimes. Living alone, you see. But I’ll try. What about the pain? Will the over-the-counter medicine be enough? I don’t want to get hooked on anything, and I do worry about side effects. And… is there a physical therapist you recommend? Someone who could show me the right exercises? I don’t want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. We'll start with the lowest effective dose of over-the-counter pain relief and monitor your response closely. If that’s not enough, we can explore other options, including prescription medications or even injections. But we'll take it one step at a time. I'm writing you a referral to a physical therapist named Sarah Chen. She has a good reputation and specializes in treating osteoarthritis. She can develop a personalized exercise program for you and teach you proper techniques to minimize your risk of injury. I’ll also order the blood work and X-ray now. The lab is just down the hall, and the radiology department is on the second floor. I want you to know I’m here to help you. We'll work together to get you feeling better. Do you have any questions about the lab work or the referral?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much. Sarah Chen… I’ll look her up. And the lab… yes, I think I can manage that. Is there anything special I need to do before the blood work? Fasting, or anything like that? And… how long will it take to get the results? I do worry about waiting. But… I feel much better already, just knowing we have a plan. Thank you, Doctor Sham. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McNabb. That’s my job. For the blood work, yes, you’ll need to fast for eight to twelve hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks except water. As for the results, it usually takes about three to five business days for us to get them back from the lab. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they're available to discuss the results and create a more detailed treatment plan. In the meantime, try to stay active, eat a healthy diet, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to support you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all for now. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. I'll schedule the lab work tomorrow and I’ll look forward to hearing from the office about the follow-up appointment. Thank you again, Doctor Sham. You’ve given me hope. Have a lovely day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McNabb. I’m glad I could help. And you have a lovely day as well. Don't hesitate to call if anything comes up. It was a pleasure meeting you.
