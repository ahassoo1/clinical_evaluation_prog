DOCTOR: Hi Brad, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, it’s… well, it’s my stomach. Been bleedin’ a bit. Not a good bit, mind you, but enough to bother a guy. It started a few days ago. Honestly, I thought it was just somethin’ I ate, but it hasn’t let up. You know? It’s… messy. And frankly, a bit scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad, I understand. Bleeding from the stomach is definitely something we need to look into. It's good you came in to get it checked out. When you say a few days ago, can you pinpoint roughly when it started?
PATIENT: Let me think… Tuesday, I reckon. Yeah, Tuesday morning. I had… some lamb. From that new place down on Elm Street. Maybe that was it? Though I’ve eaten worse, honestly. It wasn’t immediately after, though. It was later that evening, I noticed… things weren’t right, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Tuesday evening. And it wasn’t a large amount initially, just enough to cause concern?
PATIENT: Nah, not a flood or anything. Just… when I went to the bathroom, there was some blood in the stool. Darker than usual, you know? Like… coffee grounds, almost. And it's been happening a little bit every time since. Not every time, but most times. It's not a gushing thing, but it’s enough to make a fella think twice about what he eats, and, well, everything else. I’m not a delicate flower, but this isn’t pleasant. Especially since… well, since my wife passed. Don’t want to add this to the list.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Brad. It’s completely understandable that you wouldn’t want to add any extra stress to your plate right now. Dark, coffee-ground-like stool is definitely something we need to investigate. It often indicates bleeding higher up in the digestive tract. Just to clarify, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Higher up, huh? Great. Just what I needed. Look, I ain’t one for complainin’. I toughed out thirty years in the heat, dealin’ with… things most folks wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. But yeah, other stuff. Been feelin’ tired, real tired. And… weak. Like I could barely lift a bag of cement these days, which is saying somethin’. And my stomach’s been… achy. Not sharp pain, just a dull, constant ache. And honestly? A bit nauseous. But I figured that was just worryin’ about the bleedin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. Fatigue, weakness, a dull ache in your stomach, and nausea alongside the bleeding… that gives us a clearer picture. Have you noticed any vomiting at all?
PATIENT: Vomitin’? Now that you mention it… yeah, once. Yesterday morning. Didn't think much of it, figured it was somethin' I ate. It was… darkish. Not bright red, but kinda brownish. Not a lot, just a little. And I felt kinda shaky afterwards. Honestly, I just chalked it up to bein’ old.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. That’s important information. The dark vomit along with the stool and fatigue is concerning. It’s good you came in. I’m going to need to ask a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. Had some trouble with penicillin when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. No problems since. I don't take nothin' regularly. Just the occasional aspirin for a headache, but that's about it. And I'm tellin' ya, doc, I don’t need fancy pills. Just tell me what's wrong and I’ll get it fixed. I ain’t one for sittin’ around waitin’ for things to get better on their own.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brad, I appreciate your directness. No penicillin allergies, and you only take aspirin occasionally. That’s helpful. Now, have you had any previous medical conditions or surgeries that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Huh. Let me think… Had my appendix out when I was a teenager. That was… a long time ago. Aside from that… nothin’ major. Broke my arm once fallin’ off a roof, but that healed fine. I'm generally a pretty healthy fella, doc. Tough as nails, really. Except for this bleedin’ thing, of course. Makes a man feel kinda useless.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. Appendectomy as a teenager and a broken arm – good to know. You said you generally feel healthy aside from this current issue. And just to get a complete picture, do you have a family history of any medical conditions, particularly anything related to the stomach or intestines, like ulcers, Crohn's disease, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father… he had some trouble with his stomach, years back. Always complainin’ about heartburn and indigestion. Went to the doctor a lot, but they never figured nothin’ specific out. Said it was just “nervous indigestion” or somethin’. He smoked like a chimney, so it could’ve been that. My mother… she was pretty healthy, actually. Lived to be eighty-five. No real problems that I remember. No cancer or nothin’ like that. Just… old age eventually got her.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brad. History of stomach issues in your father, but otherwise a fairly healthy family history. Now, I’m going to ask about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I ain't a lush, alright? I enjoy a beer now and then, especially with a good meal. Maybe a couple on a Saturday night. Used to drink more when my wife was still around, but… not so much anymore. Doesn't seem right to enjoy things without her. I don't get drunk or nothin'. Just a couple to unwind, that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad, a couple of beers on Saturdays. And do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Quit about ten years ago. Smoked for… well, too long. Started when I was a teenager, like a lot of folks. Tried to quit a dozen times before finally managin' it. It was tough, real tough. But I did it. Best thing I ever did, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Brad. Quitting smoking was a very good decision. Alright, one last question for the history. Are you currently employed, and if so, what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: Yeah, I work down at the crematorium. Not a glamorous job, I’ll tell ya. But it’s honest work. Been doin’ it for… fifteen years now, ever since I retired from construction. Keeps me busy, keeps me out of trouble. It's… a necessary job, you know? Someone's gotta do it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brad. It sounds like a challenging but important job. Okay, that gives me a good overall picture. Given your symptoms – the dark stools, fatigue, nausea, and history of stomach issues in your father – I think we need to do a quick physical exam and run some tests to figure out what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Fine. Just get it done with, doc. I ain't got all day. And don’t tell me nothin’ fancy. Just tell me what’s wrong and what needs fixin’. Straight to the point, if you please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Brad. Straight to the point. If you don’t mind, could you lie down on the table for me?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don’t go pokin’ around too much. I’m an old man, not a rubber band.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brad. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just try to relax. Hmm… there's some mild tenderness here, in the upper abdomen. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, like I been punchin' a wall. It’s worse when you press down hard, though. Just ease up a bit, doc. You're not tryin' to break me, are ya?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Brad. Just assessing the tenderness. Okay, listening now… Bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished. I’m also going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we'll need to do a stool sample and get some blood work done. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds like a whole lot of fussin' to me, but… alright. Just get it over with. The sooner you tell me what's wrong, the sooner I can get back to somethin' useful. Blood work… fine. Stool sample… well, that's just unpleasant. But if you gotta, you gotta, I suppose. Just try to be quick about it.
DOCTOR: I understand it's not pleasant, Brad, but it's important for getting an accurate diagnosis. I'll get the nurse to bring in the supplies for the stool sample and draw the blood. While we're waiting for the nurse, do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Look, doc, straight answer. What are ya thinkin'? Is it somethin' serious? I ain't got time for fancy talk, just tell me if I need to worry or if it’s just somethin' I ate. And if it is serious… what kinda serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Brad. Straight answer. Given your symptoms – the dark stools, fatigue, nausea, and tenderness in your abdomen, along with your father’s history – it could be something serious. It's too early to say definitively, and that's why we need the stool sample and blood work. Possible causes we need to rule out include things like a stomach ulcer, gastritis , or even bleeding higher up in the digestive tract. In rare cases, it could be something more serious, like a growth or a tumor, but we won’t know until we have the test results. It's important not to jump to conclusions, but it is something we need to investigate thoroughly. The tests will help us determine the cause and the best course of action. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A tumor… great. Just what I needed. Look, doc, I ain’t one for worryin’ over things I can’t control. But… a tumor… That’s… not good. So, you're sayin’ there’s a chance it’s somethin’ like that? Not that I expect a miracle, but… What kinda treatment are we talkin’ if it is somethin' like that? Surgery? Radiation? I ain't got the stomach for any of that.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you're worried, Brad. And it's good you're asking these questions. To be clear, I’m not saying you have a tumor. I'm simply saying it’s one of the possibilities we need to rule out. The vast majority of the time, these symptoms are caused by something less serious, like an ulcer or gastritis, which are treatable with medication. If it were to be something more serious, like a growth, treatment options would depend on the type, location, and stage of the growth. It could involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these. We would discuss all the options in detail if that becomes necessary, and you would have plenty of time to ask questions and make an informed decision. Right now, the most important thing is to get the test results back. I've sent the nurse in to collect the samples. Once we have those, we can get a clearer picture of what's going on and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to relax and not worry too much. We’re doing everything we can to figure this out.
PATIENT: Fine. Easier said than done, but… alright. Just get those tests done with, doc. The waitin's the worst part. And look, if it is somethin’ serious… and I gotta go through all that… surgery and… the rest… I don't want my wife’s insurance company lookin’ at this. She always handled the bills. And I don't want her niece breathin' down my neck about it either. She's… particular. I just want it handled quietly, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Brad. Your privacy and concerns are very important to me. I will absolutely ensure that your medical information is handled with the utmost confidentiality, and I will work with you to navigate any insurance or financial concerns without involving anyone you don’t want involved. We can discuss all your options and create a plan that respects your wishes and concerns. I'm here to support you through this, and we'll take things one step at a time. The nurse should be in shortly to draw your blood and collect the stool sample. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. For now, try to take it easy. Is there anything else I can do for you at this moment?
PATIENT: No. Just… just get it over with, doc. And… thanks. I appreciate you listenin’. It’s… hard, talkin’ about this stuff. Especially after… after my wife. Just… get those tests done.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. I understand. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. I'll make a note to be extra sensitive to his concerns regarding privacy and insurance. He's clearly going through a lot. The nurse will be right with you. Just take a deep breath, and we’ll get through this together. .
