DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggard. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It's August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Mande. Well, it’s a bit… strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really unwell after eating fava beans. My skin and eyes are yellowing, and I just feel… weak. It started a few days ago, and it's getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mande. That is a bit unusual. Yellowing of the skin and eyes, and weakness… that sounds concerning. To help me understand what’s going on, let's start with a little more detail. When you say "a few days ago," can you pinpoint roughly when you first noticed these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It was definitely after I had a big plate of stew with fava beans. Probably… last Friday, so the 26th of July? I felt okay that evening, but then Saturday morning I started feeling tired. And then I noticed my eyes looking a bit off in the mirror – a little yellow, I thought. It's gotten more noticeable each day since then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting around July 26th, after consuming fava beans. And the yellowing has progressively worsened. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and yellowing?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My stomach has been a bit upset – not full-on sick, but kind of… queasy. And my urine is much darker than usual, almost… brownish. I haven’t had a fever, if that matters. And I’ve been feeling quite thirsty, more so than normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, queasiness, dark urine, and increased thirst along with the fatigue and yellowing. That’s helpful. Now, have you ever experienced anything like this before, or had any similar reactions to foods in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I eat all sorts of things, and I've never had a problem like this before. I've had fava beans before, many times, and always enjoyed them. That’s what’s so strange about it all. It’s like suddenly, my body decided it doesn’t like them anymore. I haven’t changed anything else in my diet, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t take anything regularly. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, if I have a headache. Nothing else. I try to stay healthy, so I mostly eat well and get enough sleep. I haven’t taken anything new at all recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or recent changes there. Do you have any allergies to anything – foods, medications, environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. My family always said I was lucky that way. No bee stings, no rashes… nothing. I really don’t think allergies are the problem here, but I’m happy to answer anything you need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, liver problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was it. Other than that, I've been pretty healthy. Regular check-ups, the usual things, but no serious illnesses or diagnoses. My doctor always said I had a strong heart, and my blood pressure was always good. I’m not sure if having my gallbladder removed could be related to this somehow, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago. We’ll keep that in mind. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings – had any medical conditions, particularly anything related to the liver, blood, or digestive system?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… My mother had some problems with her digestion when she was older, but it was never really diagnosed. Just… stomach trouble. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had diabetes, but that was a long time ago. No one else, as far as I know, had any serious health problems, especially nothing with the liver or blood. We’re a fairly healthy family, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to clarify, when you say "stomach trouble" with your mother, was it similar to what you’re experiencing now – nausea, indigestion?
PATIENT: No, not really. She mostly complained of heartburn and bloating. Nothing like this queasiness and… the yellowing. Hers was more of a chronic discomfort, and she just lived with it for years. She didn’t ever go to the doctor about it much, to be honest. It was just… something old people got, she thought. This feels different. Much more… alarming.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, Mande, this is giving me some cause for concern. The symptoms you’re describing – the yellowing of the skin and eyes, fatigue, dark urine, and queasiness after eating fava beans – are suggestive of a condition called Favism. It’s a genetic condition where people are deficient in an enzyme, and fava beans can trigger a breakdown of red blood cells. To confirm this, I’d like to do a physical exam and order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a G6PD enzyme assay to check for the deficiency. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Favism? I’ve never heard of that. A genetic condition… oh dear. Well, if that’s what it sounds like, then I suppose testing is the best thing to do. Yes, Doctor, please. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s wrong and get it sorted out, if possible. Blood tests sound fine. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you want to get to the bottom of this, Mande. Favism can be serious, depending on the severity of the enzyme deficiency and the amount of fava beans consumed. In some cases, it can lead to hemolytic anemia, which means the red blood cells are being destroyed faster than they can be replaced. That can cause fatigue, jaundice – which is the yellowing you're experiencing – and in severe cases, can require hospitalization and even a blood transfusion. However, it’s important not to panic. Many people with G6PD deficiency live perfectly normal lives by simply avoiding fava beans and certain other triggers. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture of your enzyme levels and help us determine the best course of action. Let’s start with a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and look at the color of your skin and eyes. Then we’ll head over to the lab for the blood work. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Avoiding fava beans doesn’t sound too terrible, if that’s all it takes. But the thought of needing a transfusion… oh dear. Yes, please, let’s do the exam. The sooner we know something, the better. I’m ready when you are, Doctor. Just… be gentle, if you would. I’m a bit nervous, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mande. I understand your nervousness, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright, if you could lie back for me?
PATIENT: Here we go… Just tell me what you're doing as you go along, if you don't mind, Doctor. It helps to know what's happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mande. I will explain everything as I go. First, I'm listening to your heart rate and rhythm. Take nice, deep breaths. Now, I'm listening to your lungs to check for any unusual sounds. Again, deep breaths in and out. Now, I'm gently feeling your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright so far. My heart usually beats pretty steady, I think. And no, my abdomen doesn't feel tender anywhere in particular. Just… a bit uncomfortable, maybe, from all the queasiness. But not specifically painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. I'm just checking around your liver area. And now, I'm going to briefly check your skin color more closely. Yes, I do see some noticeable yellowing of the skin and the whites of your eyes, which is consistent with jaundice. It’s mild to moderate at this point. Alright, Mande. That’s all for the physical exam. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings, I think it’s very important to get those blood tests done as quickly as possible. I’ll have the nurse draw the samples now. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… get the tests done, and hopefully we’ll have some answers soon. The sooner the better. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. I understand your anxiety, and we'll get those tests processed as quickly as we can. I'll have the nurse come in and take you to the lab now. I’ll review the results as soon as they come back, and we'll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, please try to avoid fava beans and any other foods that might trigger similar symptoms. And if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – severe fatigue, dark urine, or abdominal pain – please head to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No fava beans, and if things get worse, go to the emergency room. I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I'll just wait here, then, until the nurse comes.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll let the nurse know you're ready. Please don’t hesitate to call out if you need anything at all. .
