DOCTOR: Hi Ivette, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s the hiccups. They just...won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and it’s really getting to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for two days, that's definitely annoying. And you said they won’t stop – meaning they’re pretty constant?
PATIENT: Pretty constant, yes. It’s not like a few and then they go away. It’s…hic, hic…almost every few minutes. It’s exhausting, honestly. I tried holding my breath and drinking water, all the usual things, but nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, usual remedies haven’t helped. Any particular things seem to trigger them, or did they just start randomly?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I don’t think anything specifically triggered them. I was just…having lunch with a friend, a normal lunch, and then hic…they started. We were talking, laughing…it was a nice lunch! And then, poof. Hiccups. I haven’t noticed anything else since then that makes them worse or better, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they started during a normal activity, and haven't been linked to anything specific since. Have you had hiccups that lasted this long before?
PATIENT: No, never. I get hiccups sometimes, like anyone, but they always go away pretty quickly. Usually within a few minutes, maybe an hour at the most. Hic…This is…different. It's really worrying me, to be honest. It feels strange, like something is…off.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern – hiccups lasting this long is unusual. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history, just to make sure we aren’t missing anything. Do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out maybe ten years ago, and I get a little bit of arthritis in my hands, but that’s it. Nothing major. I don’t take any regular medications, either. Just…hic…the occasional pain reliever for my hands if they’re acting up.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, and some arthritis in your hands. No regular medications. And you said occasionally a pain reliever for your hands - what do you usually take when you need it?
PATIENT: Oh, just over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, sometimes naproxen. Nothing prescribed. I try not to take it too often, it doesn't always help much anyway. Hic…I mostly just try to rest my hands when they bother me.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen or naproxen as needed for arthritis. Okay, and any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything, I haven't had any reactions to anything. Hic…I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. My mother was allergic to shellfish, but I didn’t inherit that!
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, just a couple more questions, and then I'd like to listen to your chest and do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe a couple of times a week, but that’s it. And I definitely don’t do any drugs. Hic…I’m a pretty boring person, honestly. Just trying to get rid of these hiccups!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So no smoking, minimal alcohol, no drug use. Alright, let’s have a listen to your chest and I’ll just do a quick exam. Could you please sit back and take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Hic…deep breath… Hic…deep breath. Is this how you do it? I always feel a bit silly doing this.
DOCTOR: Okay, your lungs sound clear, good. I'm just feeling your abdomen now – everything feels normal here. No tenderness or anything concerning. Your heart rate and blood pressure are also within normal limits. Do you notice any pain anywhere when you take a deep breath?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Just the hiccups, of course! Hic…It’s really just…annoying. It feels like something is…vibrating in my chest, but it doesn't hurt. It’s hard to explain. Just…a strange sensation. Hic…Do you have any idea what could be causing this?
DOCTOR: It’s good you can describe it that way. Sometimes persistent hiccups can be caused by something simple like irritation to the diaphragm, or even just a bit of gas. But because they’ve lasted this long, and we haven’t found an obvious cause, I'd like to order a couple of tests just to be on the safe side. A chest X-ray and some blood work. The X-ray will rule out anything in your lungs, and the blood work will check for things like electrolyte imbalances, which can sometimes cause hiccups. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it can rule things out, it’s worth doing. Hic…I just want to get rid of these things! Chest X-ray and blood work…okay. Will I need to do anything special to prepare for them? Like, should I not eat before? Hic…I always worry about these things.
DOCTOR: No special preparation for the X-ray – you can eat and drink normally. For the blood work, you will need to fast for about 8-12 hours beforehand, so no food or drinks except water. We can get you scheduled for both this afternoon. In the meantime, I’ll give you a prescription for a medication called baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant that can sometimes help with persistent hiccups. It’s not a guaranteed fix, but it’s worth trying. We’ll see how you respond to that, and then we’ll go over the test results when they come back. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…like a plan. Fasting for the blood work, baclofen…okay. Is there anything I should be looking out for with the baclofen? Any side effects I need to know about? Hic…I always read the little pamphlets, but they scare me sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s good you read the pamphlets, it's always a good idea. The most common side effects are drowsiness and dizziness, so be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you. Some people also experience nausea or weakness. If you experience anything more serious like confusion, difficulty breathing, or a rash, stop taking the medication and contact me immediately. The pamphlet will have a full list. Start with a low dose, as prescribed, and see how you feel. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Low dose, watch for drowsiness or dizziness, and contact you if anything serious happens. Hic…It’s a lot to remember, but I’ll write it down. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. Hopefully, we can get these hiccups under control soon!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I'm glad I could help. We'll get those tests ordered and see how the baclofen works. Here's a prescription for the baclofen and a lab order for the blood work and X-ray. And here's a note you can take to the lab. If you don't feel any improvement after a few days on the baclofen, or if you experience any concerning side effects, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We'll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. I have the prescription, the lab order, and the note. Thank you again, Doctor Amussen. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit. Hic…I’m still hiccuping, but at least we’re doing something about it! I’ll see you when the test results are back.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Feel free to call if anything changes. Have a good day, Ivette, and I hope those hiccups subside soon.
