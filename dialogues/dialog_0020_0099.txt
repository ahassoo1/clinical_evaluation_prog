DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I received some results from a test… a gastrointestinal endoscopy, I believe it was called? And the findings weren’t quite what I expected, so my primary physician suggested I come in for a further discussion.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gastrointestinal endoscopy. I see. And your primary physician thought it best to have me review the results with you directly. That’s good. Do you recall when you had the endoscopy performed?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It was on the 17th of June, this year. At St. Jude’s Hospital, with Dr. Ramirez. A very kind man, though I confess I wasn’t entirely comfortable during the procedure itself, but he explained everything clearly afterwards.
DOCTOR: June 17th… Dr. Ramirez at St. Jude’s. Excellent. Let me see if I can pull up the report here. Ah, yes, here we are. Now, before we dive into the specifics, can you tell me a little bit about why Dr. Ramirez recommended the endoscopy in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly. For several months, I’ve been experiencing… discomfort, shall we say. Primarily in my abdomen. Not constant pain, but more a feeling of fullness, bloating, and occasional nausea. And my appetite… it hasn’t been what it once was. My doctor initially thought it might be something dietary, but the changes didn’t seem to help, so she ordered some tests, and that led to the endoscopy.
DOCTOR: Okay, abdominal discomfort, bloating, nausea, and decreased appetite. And this has been going on for several months. And dietary changes didn't provide relief. I understand. The report here indicates some findings in your stomach… it mentions inflammation and a few small polyps. Do you have a copy of the report with you, or would you prefer I go through what’s written here?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have a copy with me, Doctor. I thought it best to let you explain it, frankly. I get a little lost in the medical phrasing sometimes. Inflammation and polyps, you say? Is that… serious? I must admit, I do worry. My late husband, he… well, he had some health difficulties, and I’ve always been a bit anxious about anything concerning the stomach.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your worry, Denis, especially given your history. It’s good you’re asking questions. Inflammation and polyps can be concerning, but it’s important to remember that many polyps are benign – not cancerous. The report indicates these polyps are small, which is a good sign. The inflammation… that could be caused by a number of things – acid reflux, an infection, even certain medications. We need to investigate further to determine the exact cause. The report recommends a biopsy of the polyps and a follow-up endoscopy in six months, if the biopsy results are normal. Have you had a biopsy before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. A biopsy… that means taking a small piece of tissue, doesn’t it? Is it painful? I apologize for all the questions, but I’ve always been… a bit squeamish, I suppose. And what exactly would the six-month follow-up involve? Would it be the same procedure as before?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Denis. It’s good to ask questions—it’s my job to make sure you understand everything. A biopsy does involve taking a very small piece of tissue for examination under a microscope. It helps us determine if the polyps are benign or if they need further attention. As for pain, most people don't experience much discomfort during the biopsy itself. You may feel a slight pressure or cramping, but it’s usually very brief. The procedure is typically done during the endoscopy, so you won’t need a separate procedure for the biopsy. The six-month follow-up would be another endoscopy, similar to the one you had before. It allows us to monitor the polyps and ensure there are no changes. Before we discuss scheduling the biopsy, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your overall health. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe I have any allergies. I haven't taken many medications over the years, thankfully. Just some pain relievers occasionally for arthritis in my hands, but nothing consistent. And I don’t recall ever having a reaction to anything, food or otherwise. I’ve always been quite… resilient, I suppose. Though this stomach trouble is rather unsettling, as I said.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Just some occasional pain relievers for arthritis. Alright. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let’s see. I was diagnosed with mild arthritis, as I mentioned, about ten years ago. Nothing debilitating, just some stiffness in my hands and occasionally in my knees. Other than that, I’ve been quite fortunate, really. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. My late husband, he had some heart trouble… that required regular visits to the cardiologist, but I’ve always been very healthy, knock on wood. I did have my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but that’s the extent of any major surgeries.
DOCTOR: Mild arthritis, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and otherwise healthy. That’s good to know. And how about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s a bit more complicated, I’m afraid. My parents both lived to be quite old, but my mother’s side… they had a history of stomach issues. Not cancer, specifically, but ulcers and other digestive problems. My grandfather had a particularly bad stomach, and my aunt suffered from chronic indigestion for years. It wasn’t a pleasant topic of conversation, I must say. My late husband’s family… they were generally healthy, though his father did have high blood pressure. Is that the sort of information you need, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. A history of stomach issues on your mother's side is good to know, especially given your current symptoms. And high blood pressure on your husband's side. We’ll keep that in mind. Before we move on, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’ve never smoked. My late husband… he used to smoke a pipe, but he quit many years ago, thankfully. I’ve always considered it a rather unhealthy habit. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I wouldn't say I drink heavily. Perhaps one or two glasses a few times a week. And I try to maintain a healthy diet, mostly fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Though this stomach trouble has made it rather difficult to eat much at all lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, occasional wine, healthy diet. That's good. So, it seems like we have a good picture of your overall health and lifestyle. Given your symptoms and the findings on the endoscopy, I recommend we proceed with the biopsy to determine the nature of the polyps. Would you be comfortable scheduling that today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I believe that’s the best course of action. The uncertainty is… unsettling, as I mentioned. I would very much like to get this resolved, if possible. Yes, please. Let’s schedule the biopsy. When would be a suitable time? I do have a bridge club meeting on Wednesdays, and I volunteer at the local library on Fridays. Otherwise, my schedule is fairly open.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's see… we have an opening next Tuesday morning at 9:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday morning at 9:00 AM… yes, that sounds perfectly fine. That would give me time to get ready and not feel too rushed. Tuesday it is. Now, what does the biopsy entail exactly? Will it be the same as the endoscopy? And is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Tuesday at 9:00 AM it is. The biopsy will be performed during a repeat endoscopy, so it’s similar to what you experienced before. Dr. Ramirez will likely be performing it again, or another gastroenterologist from the same practice. During the procedure, a small instrument will be passed through the endoscope to take tiny tissue samples from the polyps. As for preparation, you’ll need to fast for at least eight hours before the procedure – no food or drinks after midnight. You’ll also need to arrange for someone to drive you home afterward, as you’ll be given some medication to help you relax, and you won’t be able to drive yourself. We'll give you a more detailed list of instructions when you check in on Tuesday. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds manageable. Fasting overnight and having a ride… perfectly reasonable. I can certainly arrange that. I have a dear friend, Elena, who would be happy to take me. Will the procedure… will it be uncomfortable? I recall feeling a bit… gassy and bloated afterward last time. Is there anything I can do to mitigate that? And how long does it usually take? I do have a lunch appointment at 1:00 PM, and I wouldn’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: That's good you can arrange a ride. As for discomfort, you might experience some mild bloating or cramping during the procedure, similar to last time. The medication we give you should help to minimize any discomfort. You may also feel a bit of pressure or a sensation of fullness. The procedure itself typically takes about 30-60 minutes. After the procedure, you’ll need to stay in the recovery room for about an hour or so while we monitor you. Most people are able to resume their normal activities later that day, but it's best to take it easy. Elena, your friend, can stay with you while you recover and drive you home. Do you have any other questions before we move on?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that answers most of my concerns. Just the fasting, the medication, and the potential for bloating… all manageable. Elena will be a great help, I’m sure. I suppose I should be preparing for the results then. How long does it usually take to get the biopsy results back? And will you be the one to contact me with the findings?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's good to prepare. The biopsy results usually take about 5-7 business days to come back from the lab. I will be the one to contact you with the findings – either by phone or through our patient portal, whichever you prefer. We’ll discuss the results in detail and determine the best course of action. I want to assure you, most polyps are benign. But it’s important to get them checked out to be sure. Is there anything else I can answer for you before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Beinborn, I believe that covers everything. You have been exceptionally helpful and patient with my questions. I truly appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It has eased my anxiety considerably. So, just to recap: Tuesday at 9:00 AM, fast overnight, Elena will drive me, and I’ll expect a call in about a week with the results. That’s correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is absolutely correct. Tuesday at 9:00 AM, overnight fast, Elena for transportation, and you can expect a call within a week with the results. We will be in touch to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Here’s a printed summary of the instructions, just in case. Do you have any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, this is perfect. Thank you again for your time and your kindness. I feel much more at ease now. I believe I am all set. I look forward to hearing from you next week. Have a wonderful day, Doctor Beinborn.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the office if any questions or concerns arise before Tuesday. You have a wonderful day as well, and I look forward to speaking with you next week.
