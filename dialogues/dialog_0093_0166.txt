DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Thank you. I’ve been experiencing some…well, numbness in my leg. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I figured it was best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Tarin. Numbness can be concerning, and it's wise to get it evaluated. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about this numbness?
PATIENT: Certainly. Um…it’s mostly in my left leg, starting at the thigh and going down to my foot. It doesn’t happen constantly, but it’s frequent enough that I’ve noticed a pattern. It seems worse after I’ve been…standing for a long time, or if I’ve been working on a project and really focused – you know, not moving around much. It’s not painful, exactly, just… absent. Like it’s not really there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Tarin. Thank you for describing it so clearly. So, it’s primarily in your left leg, from the thigh down to the foot, and it’s exacerbated by prolonged standing or periods of focused work where you’re relatively immobile. And you describe it as a lack of sensation, rather than pain. To get a better picture, could you tell me approximately how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Approximately… let me think. It started subtly, maybe three or four months ago. At first, I just thought I was sitting awkwardly, or had slept on it wrong. But it hasn’t really gone away completely, and it’s become more noticeable in the last month or so. I’d say the last month is when I really started to pay attention to it and realize it wasn’t just a temporary thing. Does that help narrow it down?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Tarin. So, onset was gradual, about three to four months ago, with a noticeable increase in frequency and awareness over the past month. Now, aside from the numbness, have you experienced any other symptoms in that leg?
PATIENT: Hm…let me consider. No, not really. No pain, as I mentioned. No weakness, no tingling, no changes in temperature…nothing like that. It’s just the numbness. I haven’t noticed any swelling either. I suppose…maybe a little fatigue in the leg after a long day, but I work long hours sometimes, so that’s not unusual. Is that something to note, Doctor? The fatigue?
DOCTOR: That's good information, Tarin. The absence of other symptoms is helpful. And yes, fatigue can be relevant, so thank you for mentioning it. It’s good to have a complete picture. Now, let’s move on to some other aspects of your health. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing significant. I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries. I broke my wrist when I was a child – playing hockey, naturally – but that healed completely. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. Regular check-ups, the usual vaccinations…nothing else to report. I’m generally quite careful about looking after myself.
DOCTOR: Excellent. A clean medical history is always a good starting point. And I appreciate you being proactive about your health. Have you ever had any surgeries, Tarin?
PATIENT: As I mentioned, just the broken wrist when I was a child, Doctor. It was set and healed without needing surgery. No other surgical procedures, ever. I’ve always been lucky enough to avoid needing them. Is this a common thing, you think? People coming in with numbness like this?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And no, Tarin, you are not alone. Numbness in the extremities is a fairly common complaint, and there are many potential causes. That’s why it’s important to gather as much information as possible to determine the root cause. Now, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother has…well, she has arthritis, mostly in her hands. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had diabetes. He managed it for a long time, but it did cause some complications later in life. As far as I know, nobody else in the family has had anything particularly serious. No history of neurological issues, if that’s what you’re thinking. I believe that’s the extent of it, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Tarin. A family history of arthritis and diabetes is good to note. We’ll keep those in mind. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Of course. I work as a special effects artist and animator, so a lot of my time is spent at a computer. I’m usually sitting for long periods, as you can imagine. I try to take breaks and stretch, but it's not always easy when I’m on a deadline. I don’t smoke, and I drink alcohol occasionally – socially, mostly. I try to eat a healthy diet, although ordering takeout is a bit of a weakness. And I try to get some exercise when I can – hiking in the summer, mostly. Does that give you a general idea?
DOCTOR: That provides a very good overview, Tarin. A sedentary job with occasional periods of focused work, no smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and an attempt at a healthy lifestyle. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. No allergies that I am aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I can eat pretty much anything. I haven’t had any issues with insect bites or anything like that either. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Tarin. No known allergies is very helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I don’t take any regular medication, and I rarely even take pain relievers. I try to avoid them if possible. I might take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s about it. Definitely nothing prescribed by a doctor or taken on a regular basis.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Tarin. That completes my initial questioning. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your leg and neurological function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed at your own pace. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your reflexes in both legs. Please relax your legs and allow them to dangle freely. This will help me assess your nerve function. Your reflexes are within normal limits on both sides. Now, I'm going to test your muscle strength. Could you please push down firmly on my hands with your left leg, resisting my pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Yes, of course. I’m applying pressure now. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. Your strength appears to be normal in your left leg. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. I’m going to gently touch your leg with this tuning fork. Please tell me when you feel the vibration. I’m noticing a slight decrease in sensation on the outer aspect of your left thigh and lower leg, but it's subtle. Now, I’m going to palpate your leg, feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. There’s no significant tenderness or swelling. Finally, I'll briefly check your gait. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is that alright? I’m walking now.
DOCTOR: Your gait appears normal, although I did notice a slight hesitation when extending your left leg. Alright, Tarin. Based on my examination, I'm not finding any major neurological deficits. Your reflexes and strength are normal, and your gait is mostly normal. However, I did note a slight decrease in sensation on the outer aspect of your left thigh and lower leg, as well as a slight hesitation during left leg extension. These findings, combined with your history, suggest a possible issue with the peripheral nerves in your leg, potentially related to compression or irritation. It’s unlikely to be something serious, but it warrants further investigation. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: That…doesn’t sound too alarming, thankfully. A slight decrease in sensation and hesitation…is that something that can be fixed, Doctor? And what sort of investigation are you thinking of? Is it something that would require…surgery, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Those are very reasonable questions, Tarin. It’s good you’re asking. Generally, these types of issues often respond well to conservative treatment. Surgery is rarely necessary. I’m thinking we should start with some imaging – likely an MRI of your left leg – to get a clearer picture of the nerves and surrounding tissues. This will help us rule out any structural abnormalities or nerve compression. In the meantime, I’d also recommend some physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your leg muscles and improve your flexibility, which can help alleviate any nerve irritation. We can also discuss some over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, to help manage any discomfort. However, I generally prefer to avoid medication unless absolutely necessary. Do you have any concerns about undergoing an MRI, or starting physical therapy?
PATIENT: An MRI sounds…manageable. I don’t have any metal implants or anything like that, so I don’t foresee any problems. Physical therapy sounds good as well. I’ve heard good things about it. I’m generally not opposed to trying exercises, if it can help. I suppose my biggest concern is…what if it is something serious? Is there a chance this could lead to any permanent damage?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Tarin, and I appreciate you voicing them. While it's always important to be realistic, the likelihood of permanent damage is relatively low, given your current presentation. The most common causes of peripheral nerve issues are compression or irritation, often related to posture, repetitive movements, or minor injuries. These issues typically respond well to conservative treatment. However, it's important to rule out more serious causes, such as nerve entrapment, spinal stenosis, or peripheral neuropathy. That’s why the MRI is important. If the MRI reveals a significant abnormality, we may need to consult with a neurologist – a specialist in nerve disorders – for further evaluation and treatment. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll take things one step at a time. So, my plan is to order the MRI. I’ll also give you a referral to a physical therapist. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that exacerbate your symptoms, and continuing to monitor your condition. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. One step at a time is a good approach. Avoiding exacerbating activities makes sense, and I’ll definitely keep an eye on it. Could you tell me a little more about the MRI process itself? What should I expect, and how long will it take to get the results? And is there anything I need to do to prepare for it?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Tarin. I’m glad you asked. The MRI is a non-invasive imaging procedure that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your leg. You’ll lie on a table that slides into the MRI machine. It's important to remain still during the scan, as any movement can blur the images. The scan typically takes about 30 to 60 minutes. It can be a bit noisy, so you’ll be given earplugs or headphones to wear. There’s no special preparation required for the MRI, but it’s important to inform the technician if you have any metal implants, pacemakers, or other medical devices. You should also remove any jewelry, watches, or other metal objects before the scan. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to be reviewed by the radiologist. Once I receive the report, I’ll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any other questions about the MRI process or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything quite clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to address all of my concerns. I’ll schedule the MRI as soon as possible and will follow up with you once I receive the results. Thank you again for your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Tarin. You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could provide some clarity and reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I’ll look forward to hearing from you. Wishing you all the best, and please take care.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor Bakan. I will certainly do that. Have a good day.
