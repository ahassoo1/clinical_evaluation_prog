DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Soodeen. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you. Well, my leg… it’s been swelling up. It started after… after all the treatment for the… you know. The bad stuff. It's just… puffy. And a little sore sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. You mentioned treatment – are you referring to cancer treatment?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s it. Cancer treatment. A long time ago now, thankfully. It was… breast cancer. And I had… everything they do. Pills, and… the machine. Radiation, I think it was called. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. Treatment can be quite a lot to process. And when did you first notice the swelling in your leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a month or so after I finished everything. Not during, definitely not. A month, maybe six weeks. It was just… a little bigger than usual one day. I thought it was just from sitting too long, but it hasn’t gone down.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is it one leg or both that’s swollen?
PATIENT: Just the left one. The left. The right one is… normal. I check it all the time, I do. See? This one is… not right.
DOCTOR: I see. It does appear to be some swelling in your left lower leg and ankle. Is there any pain associated with the swelling?
PATIENT: It’s not bad pain, Doctor. More like… achy. Especially at the end of the day. If I’ve been on my feet too long. And sometimes it feels… warm. Not hot, but… warmer than my other leg, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the skin?
PATIENT: Changes…? Well, it feels a little… tight. And maybe a bit shiny. I don't know if that means anything. It's hard for me to tell, honestly. My eyesight isn't what it used to be. Is shiny bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re noticing these details. Shiny skin can sometimes be associated with swelling, but it’s not always a cause for concern. Do you have any history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots…? Oh dear. I… I don't think so. The doctors never said anything about that. I had a lot of tests during the cancer, but they didn't mention clots. No, I don’t think I’ve had clots. But I’m not sure… it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure pills. A small blue one, every morning. And a vitamin D, the doctor told me to take it, because I don't get much sun. That's it. I don't like taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Queener. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check the pulses in both of your legs. We will also need to check your temperature and blood pressure. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… try not to poke too much, alright? It's a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: I will be as gentle as possible. Take a deep breath for me, please. And another… Good. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now I’m going to check the pulses in your legs. I’m feeling a slightly weaker pulse in your left leg compared to your right. Let’s measure your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/82. Finally, let's take your temperature. Your temperature is 98.6.
PATIENT: Okay. That all sounds… normal, doesn't it? Is something wrong, Doctor? You seem to be looking at me very carefully.
DOCTOR: Ms. Queener, based on the exam, and your history, I'm concerned about the possibility of post-thrombotic syndrome. This is a condition that can develop after a blood clot in the leg, even if you weren’t aware of having one. The swelling, ache, warmth, and slightly weaker pulse are all consistent with this. However, we need to rule out other possibilities first. I’m going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg to see if there’s a clot present, and to assess the blood flow. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… a clot? Oh dear. I never had a clot! I would have known, wouldn't I? It sounds… scary. An ultrasound… is that… does that hurt? Will it take long? I have a bridge game on Thursday…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Queener. It's true that some clots don't always cause obvious symptoms, especially early on. The ultrasound is non-invasive – it doesn’t use radiation and it shouldn't be painful. It's like a pregnancy scan, we use a gel and a probe on your skin. It will take about 30-45 minutes. I'm ordering it now. We'll schedule it for as soon as possible, hopefully tomorrow. And we’ll get the results back quickly. Until then, I recommend elevating your left leg whenever possible and wearing compression stockings. Do you have compression stockings?
PATIENT: No, I don't have stockings. Never bought any. What kind do I need? And… elevation? How high? I have a small footstool… Will that do? I hope this isn’t… serious, Doctor.
DOCTOR: We will need to get you some compression stockings, grade 1 or 2, that go up to just below your knee. I’ll write you a prescription for those. As for elevation, try to get your leg above the level of your heart as much as possible. The footstool is a good start, but if you can prop it up on a couple of pillows while you’re resting, that would be even better. It’s important to rule out a clot. If it is a clot, we can start treatment right away to prevent complications. However, many times, it's just post-thrombotic syndrome, which we can manage with compression, elevation, and sometimes medication. Here is the prescription for the compression stockings. The technician will schedule your ultrasound before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so… Compression stockings… and pillows… Right. It’s a lot to remember. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if it’s a bit frightening. I just… I hope it’s not too serious. And I really do need to make it to my bridge game. I suppose I'll go talk to the technician now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Queener. We’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. And we’ll take it one step at a time. Yes, please go speak with the technician; they'll schedule your ultrasound. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, Ms. Queener, and try not to worry too much. We’ll get this sorted out.
