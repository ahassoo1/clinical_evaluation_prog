DOCTOR: Good morning, Aurthur. I'm Dr. Neeraj Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet ye as well. Well, it’s this nausea I’ve been havin’ most mornings. It’s been goin’ on a wee bit now, and frankly, it’s gettin’ right bothersome. The nurse said somethin’ about my heart… is that what this is about? I have heart failure, ye see.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Nausea is certainly unpleasant, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. And yes, I do see in your chart that you have a history of heart failure. It’s definitely possible that could be related, but nausea can have many causes. To get a better picture, could you tell me a bit more about this nausea?
PATIENT: Aye, of course. Let me think… it usually starts soon after I wake up, before I’ve even had a chance to have a proper drink. It’s not like proper sickness, ye ken? No… well, not usually. Sometimes there’s a bit of that, but mostly it’s just a really queasy feelin’. And it lasts… oh, maybe an hour or two? It’s hard to say exactly. I’ve noticed it’s been a bit worse the last couple o’ weeks, and I’ve been feelin’ a bit more tired than usual as well. I've been tryin' to eat lighter in the evenings, but it doesn’t seem to be makin’ much difference, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So it’s mainly in the mornings, before you’ve eaten, lasts an hour or two, and has been worsening over the last couple of weeks, accompanied by some increased fatigue. No vomiting, but a queasy feeling. Are you noticing anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Aye, good question. Hmmm… well, I find bein’ stressed makes it worse, definitely. I’ve had a wee bit o’ bother wi’ the paperwork for my pension, and that's been weighin’ on my mind. And… now that I think about it, if I lie flat for too long, it seems to get a bit worse as well. I usually need to sit up for a bit to feel better. Not a full-on panic, but uncomfortable, ye ken? I try to avoid lyin’ down for too long if I can, just in case. It's a bit of a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Right, stress and lying flat seem to exacerbate it. That's good information. And you mentioned a bit of discomfort, not quite a panic, when lying down. Now, let's talk a bit more broadly. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite, other than the lighter evening meals?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fair enough. My appetite… well, it’s not much less, but I’m no' as hungry as I used to be. I find I pick at me food more than actually sittin’ down and enjoyin’ a proper plateful. And I've been feelin' a bit… bloated, after I eat, even if it’s just a small amount. Not painful, mind ye, just uncomfortable and full really quickly. I used to be able to eat a good hearty breakfast, but now… not so much. And I've lost a wee bit o' weight, I think, but I haven't weighed myself properly in a while. My trousers are feelin' a bit looser, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite, bloating after eating, and you’ve noticed some weight loss, though haven’t weighed yourself recently. A bit looser fitting trousers. Now, let’s go through a quick review of systems, just to get a full picture. Have you been experiencing any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Aye, right. Chest pain… no, not really. There's been a wee bit o’ discomfort sometimes, but not sharp or sudden, just… a heaviness, maybe. It doesn’t come on wi’ exertion or anything, just… there sometimes. And shortness o’ breath… not any more than usual, I suppose. I get a bit puffed walkin’ up hills, but I always have, wi’ the heart condition and all. It hasn't worsened recently, if that makes sense. I’ve been tryin’ to take things easy, and I’ve got me wee puffer if I need it, but I haven’t had to use it any more than normal. Would ye like me to describe the heaviness in me chest a bit more? It’s hard to explain, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do describe it a bit more. Any detail helps. And you mentioned using your puffer—is that salbutamol?
PATIENT: Aye, it's the blue one, the salbutamol. As for the heaviness… well, it’s not a pain, like a stabbin’ pain or anything. It’s more like… a pressure, right across me chest. It comes and goes, and it’s usually worse when I’m lyin’ flat, or after I’ve been eatin’. It’s hard to describe… it’s not terribly uncomfortable, but I’m aware of it. It’s just… there. And it doesn’t seem to be linked to any particular activity. I've been tryin' to ignore it, to be honest, thinkin' it was just the heart condition playin' up. Does that make sense? It's not somethin’ I’d rush to the hospital for, if that's what ye're askin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a pressure across the chest, worse when lying flat or after eating, not linked to activity, and you’ve been managing it without needing the hospital. It sounds like you've been quite observant of your body. Now, let's move on to a bit of your medical history. Aside from the heart failure, do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Aye, I suppose I do. I've got a bit o’ arthritis in me knees, it flares up now and then. It's no’ terribly bad, I manage it wi’ some over-the-counter painkillers and keepin’ active as much as I can. And I had a bit o’ trouble wi’ me prostate a few years back, but that's been sorted now. I used to be a smoker, but I gave that up about ten years ago, thankfully. Other than that, no’ much. I’ve been fairly healthy, all things considered. Though I've noticed me ankles swellin' a bit lately, especially in the evenings. I thought it might be the arthritis playin' up, but… I don’t know. Is that somethin' ye should be worried about? I used to put me feet up, but it doesn't seem to be makin' much difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the knees, history of prostate trouble that's been resolved, and you quit smoking ten years ago - excellent. You've also noticed some ankle swelling, especially in the evenings, despite putting your feet up. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any regular medications, besides the salbutamol puffer?
PATIENT: Aye, let me think. There’s the ramipril, for me blood pressure, I’ve been takin’ that for years. And there’s the furosemide, that’s a water tablet, for the heart failure. I take one o’ those every mornin’. And sometimes, when me arthritis flares up, I take paracetamol, but that's just as needed, no’ regular like. I also take a vitamin D supplement, the nurse suggested it, said it was good for me bones. That’s about it, I think. I try to keep it simple, really. I'm fairly good at rememberin' them, touch wood. Do ye need to know the doses? I can tell ye if ye like.
DOCTOR: Yes, please, if you could tell me the doses that would be helpful.
PATIENT: Aye, right. The ramipril is 5mg, one tablet every mornin’. The furosemide is 40mg, also one tablet every mornin’. And the paracetamol… well, that’s just two tablets when I need it, usually 500mg each. The vitamin D is just one tablet a day, it’s a wee one. I keep them all in a pill organiser, so I don’t get confused. Old age and all that, ye ken? I’m fairly disciplined about takin' them, usually wi’ me breakfast. Though sometimes I forget if I’m away visitin’ or somethin’. But mostly, I’m alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ramipril 5mg, furosemide 40mg, paracetamol as needed, and vitamin D – good. And you generally manage them well with a pill organiser. Now, just a few questions about your family history… Has anyone in your family had heart problems, like yourself?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s a good question. Me father… he had a weak heart, they said. He didn’t look after himself, smoked like a chimney and drank a bit too much. He passed away when he was in his sixties, heart trouble. Me mother… she was alright, as far as I know. No’ much heart trouble on her side. And me sister… she’s still alive, thankfully, but she’s got high blood pressure, so she takes tablets for that. Other than that, no’ much heart trouble in the family, as far as I’m aware. There's a bit o' diabetes on me mother's side, but that's all. We weren’t a family for talkin’ about these things much, if ye ken what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for families not to discuss health matters openly. And finally, just a few questions about your social history. Do you live alone, or do you have family nearby?
PATIENT: Aye, I live alone, aye. Me wife passed away a few years back, bless her soul. It’s been quiet since then, but I get by. I’ve got a son, lives about an hour away, comes to visit when he can. He’s got a family of his own, so he’s busy. And I’ve got a few neighbours, good folk, always lookin’ out for me. I keep myself busy, go for walks when the weather’s nice, do a bit o’ gardenin’. I used to go to the pub a couple o’ times a week, but I don’t bother much wi’ that these days. It’s not really me sort o’ thing anymore. Mostly, I just enjoy the peace and quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone but have a son nearby and supportive neighbours. Right, well, that’s a lot of information, thank you for being so thorough. Based on everything you’ve told me, and your history of heart failure, the nausea, the fatigue, the bloating, the chest pressure… it sounds like we need to consider a few things. Given your symptoms and medications, and the fact you've noticed some ankle swelling, it’s possible your heart failure is slightly decompensated, meaning it's not quite as well controlled as it should be. The nausea and bloating could be related to fluid retention, and the chest pressure could be a sign of worsening heart function. However, it's important to rule out other causes. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible to me, Doctor. I'm happy to be examined. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel better, and get to the bottom of this. The chest pressure’s been worryin’ me a bit, to be honest. So aye, please, go ahead. I’ll do whatever ye think’s best. Just let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable. I’m an old man, ye ken, everything creaks a bit!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It won't be uncomfortable, just a standard exam. Okay, so your blood pressure is a little high, your heart sounds are a bit muffled with a murmur, there are some crackles in your lungs, and you have some swelling in your ankles. This supports the possibility of worsening heart failure. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, kidney function tests, liver function tests, and a BNP level. BNP stands for B-type natriuretic peptide, and it’s a hormone released when the heart is under stress. It can help us confirm or rule out heart failure. I’d also like to get an ECG, or electrocardiogram, to check the electrical activity of your heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and an ECG… fine. I'm happy to have them done. As long as it'll help ye figure out what's goin’ on, I’m all for it. I don't mind a bit o' pinprickin' if it means I can feel better again. I suppose the nurse will take some blood? And will I need to lie down for the ECG? I'm not a fan o' hospitals, but I understand it's necessary. Just let me know what I need to do, and I'll do it.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will take some blood, and you will need to lie down for the ECG. It involves placing some electrodes on your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity – it’s painless and doesn’t take long. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to recommend a few things to help manage your symptoms. Firstly, I’d like you to reduce your salt intake. Salt can cause fluid retention, which will worsen your heart failure. Secondly, I'd like you to monitor your weight daily. If you notice a sudden weight gain, it could be a sign of fluid retention, and you should let me know immediately. And thirdly, I'm going to adjust your furosemide dosage slightly, from 40mg to 60mg, to help get rid of some of the excess fluid. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds alright, Doctor. Less salt… I can manage that, I suppose. It’ll mean less bacon, mind ye, but I can live with that! Monitorin’ me weight… that’s easy enough. I’ve got scales at home. And adjustin’ the furosemide… fine. I trust your judgement. 60mg, ye say? I’ll make a note of that. So, just to be clear… less salt, weigh myself every day, and take 60mg o' the water tablets. Is there anything else I need to be aware of? Should I be lookin' out for any specific symptoms? I just want to make sure I'm doin' everything right. It's easy to get confused wi' all this medical talk, ye ken.
DOCTOR: Yes, you've got it exactly right. Less salt, daily weight monitoring, and 60mg of furosemide. And yes, it's important to be aware of certain symptoms. If you experience any shortness of breath, especially when lying down, or if your ankles swell significantly, or if you experience any chest pain, please contact me immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Also, if you feel dizzy or lightheaded, let me know. These could be signs of a more serious problem. We’ll get these tests done and have a look at the results. Once we have those, we can discuss a more long-term management plan. For now, focusing on reducing your salt intake, monitoring your weight, and adjusting your furosemide dosage should help alleviate some of your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Aye, that's a fair enough summary, Doctor. I think I've got it all sorted. Shortness o' breath, swollen ankles, dizziness… I’ll keep an eye out for those. Hmm… well, I was wonderin’… is there anything I can do to help me heart, besides the medication and diet? Any exercises or somethin'? I used to enjoy a bit o' gardenin', but I've been a bit cautious lately, worryin' about puttin' too much strain on it. And is there any food that's good for me heart, ye ken, somethin' I can add to me diet? I’m always lookin’ for ways to improve things, if possible. And… well, I suppose I'm just a bit worried about how long all this is gonna take. I just want to feel normal again, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Aurthur. It’s good you're thinking about proactive ways to improve your health. Regarding exercise, gentle activity is good, but it’s important not to overdo it. Walking is excellent, start with short distances and gradually increase them as you feel comfortable. Gardening is fine too, but take frequent breaks and avoid lifting heavy objects. Listen to your body – if you feel breathless or chest pain, stop and rest. As for diet, a heart-healthy diet focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats. Foods rich in potassium and magnesium, like bananas, spinach, and beans, can also be beneficial. Reducing saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium is also important. As for how long this will take, it’s difficult to say definitively. It depends on the results of the tests and how well you respond to the treatment. We’ll monitor your symptoms closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed. It’s a process, but we’ll work together to get you feeling better. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood and perform the ECG. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a more long-term plan. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Aye, that's re-assuring to hear, Doctor. Gentle exercise, good food… I can manage that. And I understand it's a process, not a quick fix. No, I think that’s all for now. Ye’ve been very helpful, and ye’ve put me mind at ease. I appreciate yer patience, and yer clear explanations. I’m just glad I came in to see ye. Right, I’ll just wait for the nurse, then. Thank ye again, Doctor Auelua.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aurthur. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you.
