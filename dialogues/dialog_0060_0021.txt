DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascandola. I’m Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s my foot, see? It’s been swelling up. Not all of a sudden, but… over the last week or so, it’s gotten bigger. Mostly just this one, my right foot. It’s a little painful too, especially when I walk.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little painful and swelling in your right foot over the last week. Alright. And is this pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. It's worse after I've been on it a lot, you know? Like, if I'm standing for a long time at work, or if I walk too far. When I sit and rest it, it gets better. Not gone gone, but better. Does that make sense? I don't know all the fancy words for these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Parascandola. Don’t worry about fancy words. So, it’s aggravated by standing and walking, relieved by rest. Has anything specific happen that you can recall that started it?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific? Not really. I haven’t twisted it or anything. Just… started noticing it getting puffier. I do a lot of walking for work, you know, going between buildings for loan stuff. Maybe that? But I’ve been doing that for years. It just feels different now. A little warmer too, if that helps. Not burning hot, but… warmer than my other foot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no injury that you recall, it’s gradually worsened over the last week with increased activity, and you’ve noticed some warmth in the foot compared to the other one. We'll need to take a look at it. Let me just grab my stethoscope and we’ll do a quick exam. Could you please sit up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. No problem. Is it gonna be cold? I don't like cold feet.
DOCTOR: No, it won’t be cold. Just a quick listen and a feel around. Alright, I'm feeling your pulses now. They feel a bit diminished on the right side compared to your left, and yes, the foot is warmer to the touch. I'm also noting some redness around your ankle. Have you had any injuries to this foot in the past, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Redness, huh? I hadn't noticed that. No, can't say I've ever really injured it. Maybe a few stubbed toes over the years, but nothing serious. I work a lot, on my feet, like I said. Sometimes I forget things… but I'm pretty sure I haven't twisted it or broken anything. Is something wrong? Is it bad? I don’t have insurance, you know. It's hard to pay for things.
DOCTOR: Okay, well, let's not jump to conclusions. Stubbed toes can sometimes cause issues later on, and being on your feet all day certainly doesn't help. The diminished pulses and redness are a little concerning, though. It could be a developing blood clot, or it could be something else. We need to rule things out. I’m going to order a D-dimer test, which is a blood test that can help us determine if there’s a blood clot present. We’ll also want to get an X-ray to rule out any bone issues. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, in case we need to consider further imaging?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? I… I don’t think so. Never had anything like that before. I've had a few shots at the doctor's office, you know, for… travel stuff, years ago. But no dyes or anything. I get a little nervous with needles, but I can handle it. What does this D-dimer test do exactly? And how long will it take to get the results? I have work, you know, I can't be missing too many shifts.
DOCTOR: Okay, good, no known allergies to dye. The D-dimer test is a simple blood draw, it looks for a protein fragment that's released when a blood clot breaks down. It’s not a definitive test, mind you, a positive result will mean we need to do more testing, like an ultrasound, to pinpoint exactly what's going on. It’s usually pretty quick, the lab can get results back within a few hours, but it depends on their workload. I’ll get the order in for you now, and the nurse will come in to draw the blood. The X-ray won’t take long either. We’ll get this sorted out quickly. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Ultrasound… okay. More tests. I guess that’s better than nothing. Just… I don’t want anything serious. I need to work. No, I don't think so. Just… how much is all this gonna cost? You said I don't have insurance, right? Is there anything I can do? I’m on a fixed income.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Parascandola. It’s a valid worry. Let me be upfront – without insurance, these tests will be out-of-pocket. The D-dimer is relatively inexpensive, around $75 or so, but the X-ray will be significantly more, perhaps $200-$300. I’ll see if we can offer a discount for self-pay patients, and our billing department can explore payment plan options with you. We also have a social worker who can help you look into potential financial assistance programs. It won't be a quick fix, but we can try. Let’s focus on getting these tests done first so we have a clear picture of what’s going on, then we can tackle the financial aspect. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… alright. That sounds… better than just being told it’s expensive. A payment plan would be good. And the social worker… yes, that could help. I haven’t had to ask for help before, but… things are tight. So, the blood test first, then the X-ray? When can I get the blood test done? I have to go to work later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, blood test first, then the X-ray. The nurse is just finishing up with another patient, so she should be able to get to you within the next 15-20 minutes. We’ll get you taken care of as quickly as we can. While you're waiting, I’ll just write up a referral for a vascular specialist, just in case the tests show something concerning. It’s better to be prepared, you know. We'll hold off on scheduling anything until we have the results. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Vascular specialist… okay. More doctors. No, I think that’s all for now. Just… please don't let it be anything too bad. I need to work. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Like, keep it elevated? Or ice it? Should I be walking on it? I don't want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Parascandola. While we wait for the results, I recommend keeping your foot elevated as much as possible – when you're sitting, prop it up on a pillow or something. Ice it for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, but always wrap it in a cloth to protect your skin. And try to avoid putting too much weight on it if you can. Walking short distances is fine, but avoid prolonged standing or strenuous activity. We'll have a clearer idea of what’s going on once we have the blood test results. The nurse should be with you shortly. Do you have any allergies to bandages or topical numbing agents?
PATIENT: No allergies to bandages. I used them a few times when I was a kid, scraped my knees playing soccer. Topical numbing… I don’t think so. Never used anything like that. Alright. I guess I’ll just wait. Thank you, Doctor. You've been… helpful. Even if it's a lot of tests.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Parascandola. I understand it’s a lot, and I appreciate your patience. We’ll get this sorted out. I'll check back in with you as soon as the results are available.
