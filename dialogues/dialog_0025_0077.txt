DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Good morning to you too, Doctor. They tell me I gotta come get checked 'cause of… the place I work. Dust and all. I feel fine, though. Never been sick a day in my life, nearly. Waste of time, if you ask me. But the company, they insist.
DOCTOR: Right. The company… occupational health, I presume?
PATIENT: Occupational… yeah, that’s it. Fancy word for “make sure I ain’t gonna die on the job”, eh? They sendin' me 'cause of the coal mine. Been workin’ there… long time. Too long, maybe. But I need the money. And I ain't feelin' nothin'. No cough, no trouble breathin’, nothin'. Just… dust. All the time, dust.
DOCTOR: I see. And you say you've never had any trouble breathing at all?
PATIENT: Never! Not even when I was a young man runnin' up and down hills. I was strong like bull. Now, maybe a little slower... old age, you know? But breathin'? Always been fine. You think this dust is gonna make me sick now, after all this time? Seems unlikely.
DOCTOR: It’s not about whether it will make you sick, Mr. Bigger. It's about ruling things out, establishing a baseline. Long-term dust exposure can lead to… well, several conditions. We need to document everything. Have you had any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I wake up, I go to work, I come home, I sleep. Same as always. Maybe a little tired these days… but that’s just bein’ eighty-six years old, eh? I ain’t a young man anymore. You expect me to have the energy of a boy? That ain't realistic, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any… wheezing when you exert yourself?
PATIENT: Wheezing? No. I grunt a little when I lift somethin' heavy, maybe. But that’s just my bones complainin', not my lungs. I’m a strong man, still. Stronger than most these young fellas, I tell ya. I lift those coal bags all day, and I don’t wheeze! What is wheezing, even? Like a whistle? I don't whistle.
DOCTOR: It's a high-pitched sound when you breathe, Mr. Bigger. Like air being forced through a narrow passage. But alright, no wheezing. Have you had any… chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Now you're talkin' nonsense, Doctor. I've had aches and pains all over, like any old man. But no pain. Just… oldness. And I work hard! You get aches and pains when you work hard. What kind of doctor asks an eighty-six year old if he has pain? Everybody has pain! Stop askin' silly questions.
DOCTOR: It's important to differentiate between normal aches and pains, Mr. Bigger, and something more serious. Let’s move on. Have you noticed any changes in your cough, or have you had any cough at all recently?
PATIENT: I told you already! I don't have a cough! Never have. Always been strong, remember? No sickness. No wheezing. No pain. No cough. What more do you need to know? I'm healthy as a horse, despite what the company thinks. They just worryin’ too much. Wasting my time and your time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. I’d like to listen to your lungs, and check your oxygen saturation. It's a simple procedure. Can you sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Straight? I am sittin’ straight! As straight as my old bones will let me. What are you lookin’ for? And this… oxygen saturation? Sounds like somethin' for sick people. I breathe just fine. But alright, do whatever you gotta do. Just make it quick. I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally, Mr. Bigger. Deep breaths in and out. Okay. Your breath sounds… diminished, bilaterally. There are some scattered rhonchi in the lower lobes. And your oxygen saturation is 92%. That’s a little low for someone your age, even with normal activity. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, heart rate is regular but a bit fast. I also note some mild clubbing of your fingers. Have you ever been told you have… swollen fingers or toes?
PATIENT: Swollen? Now you're just makin' things up! These fingers are fine! Been diggin’ coal with ‘em for sixty years, they're a little rough, that’s all. Rough and strong! I ain't never noticed no swelling. You expect me to look at my fingers every day? I got work to do, Doctor! Stop lookin’ so worried, you're makin' me worried now. What does “rhonchi” even mean? Is that bad? You’re talkin’ like a foreigner. Just tell me straight, am I sick or not?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, rhonchi are abnormal breath sounds indicating mucus in the airways. And yes, it’s a concern, especially given your history of coal mine work and the low oxygen saturation. Clubbing of the fingers is often seen in chronic lung disease. It seems we need to consider the possibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. It doesn’t necessarily mean you're gravely ill, but it requires further investigation. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and pulmonary function testing to get a clearer picture. I’m also going to prescribe you a bronchodilator to see if it helps ease any potential airway obstruction. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: COPD? You're tellin' me I got a disease? Because of some dust? After all these years, now you tellin' me? And an X-ray? More tests? Look, I don’t like all this fuss. And a “broncho-what?” I ain’t takin’ no fancy pills just because you heard some funny sounds in my chest. I feel fine! Coal dust ain’t never hurt nobody. You're makin' a mountain out of a molehill. I think I'll just go home and forget the whole thing. Waste of time, I tell ya. A complete waste of time. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your reluctance, but ignoring these symptoms won’t make them disappear. COPD is a progressive condition, and early intervention can significantly improve your quality of life. The bronchodilator is simply to open your airways and make breathing easier, and it’s a non-invasive treatment. However, if you absolutely refuse treatment and further testing, I will document your decision in your chart. But I strongly advise against it. You're at risk, and I'm concerned about your well-being. At the very least, I want you to understand the importance of avoiding further dust exposure. Perhaps you should discuss your concerns with your employer regarding safety precautions. Now, do you have any questions before I prepare the paperwork for the X-ray and pulmonary function testing?
