DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Voytek. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, dear. Wynell, yes, that's me. Honestly, I don't rightly remember why I'm here. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… not wanting things done? I don't hold with all that poking and prodding, you know. Seems unnecessary. I’ve lived a long life without it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to feel that way. Your daughter was concerned about a preventative health check-up, and making sure we’re on top of things. We want to keep you healthy and independent for as long as possible. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me if you've been experiencing any specific symptoms – anything at all that's been bothering you lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, land sakes. At my age, something’s always bothering me. My feet, mostly. They ache, you know? Always have. I am a podiatrist, you see. Spent a lifetime on my feet. Though I’m retired now, thankfully. Can’t stand on them like I used to. But aches and pains… that’s just getting old, isn’t it? Not something you need a doctor for.
DOCTOR: You're right, aches and pains are common as we age. But it’s good to rule out anything more serious, even if it turns out to be just typical wear and tear. Since you mentioned foot pain, is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Mostly when I’ve been… well, doing things. Standing too long, even just walking around the house. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull throb. Like they’re full of lead, you know? And sometimes they swell up a bit, especially if it’s warm. But honestly, I just put my feet up and ignore it. That’s what my mother always did.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull throb that comes and goes with activity and swelling, especially in warm weather. That gives me a little more information. Now, aside from your feet, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think. Everything’s a bit… fuzzy these days, you know? Memory’s not what it used to be. I forget things… names, mostly. And where I put my glasses. Though, they’re usually on my head. But no, not really any big changes. I still enjoy my gardening, when the weather’s nice. And I like to watch my stories on television.
DOCTOR: It's very common to experience some memory changes as we get older, Wynell. That doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. Now, are you having any difficulty with your balance?
PATIENT: Balance? Well… sometimes I feel a little unsteady when I stand up quickly. Not a fall-down kind of unsteady, just a little… wobbly. It's probably just getting old, like everything else. My daughter keeps fussing over me, telling me to be careful. She worries too much, that girl.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little unsteadiness when standing up quickly. That’s helpful to know. Now, thinking about your overall health, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I had something last winter. A terrible cough, it was. Kept me bedridden for a week. My daughter made me drink all sorts of awful herbal teas. And I had a little something back in the spring, a sniffle and a sore throat. Nothing serious, though. Just old age creeping in, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough last winter and a cold in the spring. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh, just a little something for my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. And sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, when it’s really bad. But mostly, I try to avoid taking pills. Don’t trust ‘em, you know? Too many side effects.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure and something for arthritis as needed. Do you know the names of those medications, Wynell?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes, no. I don't bother with names. My daughter handles all that. She fills the little pill boxes for me every week. Pink ones are for morning, blue ones for evening, I think. I just take what she gives me. Names… they just go in one ear and out the other.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Wynell. We can look up the medications based on the color of the pills. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get a little itchy when I ate shellfish, but that was years ago. And sometimes my skin gets a bit red when I’m in the sun, but that’s just being fair-skinned, isn’t it? Nothing serious, dear. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your heart, lungs, and take a look at your feet. It’ll just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, poking and prodding, is it? Well… I suppose so. But don’t go poking around too much. I don't like being fussed over. And be gentle with my feet, you hear? They’ve seen a lifetime of work.
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. Very gentle. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Deep breath, you say? There. Is that good enough? My lungs aren’t what they used to be, you know. Spent too many years breathing in dust from the garden.
DOCTOR: That’s good, thank you. I do hear a little wheezing, which is common with a history of gardening and potential dust exposure. Now, let's take a look at your feet. Could you please remove your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Oh, here we go. There you are. Don’t judge, dear. They’ve carried me a long way. And they’re not the prettiest sight, I’ll admit.
DOCTOR: They’ve certainly seen a lot of wear and tear, Wynell. I see some significant calluses, which is expected with your history. And I do notice some swelling around the ankles. Do you experience pain when I touch here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! A little tender there. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, you know? It’s been worse lately, especially when the weather’s warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness to the touch, especially around the ankles, and swelling. I also notice some redness in a few areas. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it appears you may have some mild arthritis in your feet, likely contributing to the pain and swelling. The redness could indicate some mild inflammation. It's important to rule out other potential causes though. Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, goodness no. My mother always said I had a sweet tooth, but never diabetes! I eat my share of sweets, I’ll admit. A little chocolate after dinner, sometimes a piece of pie. But never anything serious. My daughter keeps an eye on my sugar, though. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And do you have any family history of arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis… hmm. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had terrible trouble with her hands. Couldn’t knit anymore, she said. Always complained about the pain. But that was a long time ago. I don't rightly remember much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, family history of arthritis in the hands. Based on everything we’ve discussed – your symptoms, the examination findings, and your medical history – it’s likely you’re experiencing arthritis in your feet, possibly exacerbated by the warm weather. To confirm this and rule out other potential causes, I'd like to order some blood tests and an X-ray of your feet. The blood tests will check for inflammation and rule out other conditions, and the X-ray will help us see the condition of the bones and joints. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood tests and X-rays? Oh, land sakes. All that poking and prodding… Seems like a lot of fuss over a few aching feet. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary, dear. I don't want to be a bother. Just… try to be quick about it, will you? And don’t go sticking needles in me too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Wynell. We'll take it one step at a time. The blood draw will be quick, and the X-ray is painless. The lab is just down the hall, and I’ll have the order sent over to them now. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan to help manage your pain and improve your quality of life. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your feet whenever possible, applying ice packs for 15-20 minutes at a time, and avoiding activities that worsen your symptoms. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Elevate my feet, ice packs… yes, I suppose so. My daughter always tells me to do that too. She's a good girl, always looking out for me. Alright, dear. I’ll try my best. But don’t expect miracles. Old age is a stubborn thing, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Wynell. But we can certainly try to make you more comfortable. Once the lab results are back, we’ll have a better understanding of what’s going on and can develop a plan tailored to your needs. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… not really. I suppose… how long will it take to get the results? And will it hurt? I don’t like waiting, and I really don’t like pain.
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about 3-5 business days to get the results back to us. We’ll call you as soon as they're available to schedule a follow-up appointment. And no, the blood draw itself shouldn’t be painful – just a quick pinch. There might be some mild soreness afterward, but it usually goes away quickly. Now, I'm going to have my nurse schedule the lab work for you and give you some written instructions on how to prepare. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For listening, and for not making me feel like a silly old woman complaining about her aching feet. My daughter worries so much, she always wants me to get every test imaginable. Tell her I said hello.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Wynell. And I'll be sure to tell your daughter hello. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try to rest your feet!
PATIENT: Now, if someone could just help me find my shoes… I seem to have misplaced them again.
