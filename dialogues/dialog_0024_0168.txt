DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to the point. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, frankly. But my husband suggested I come in. I’m… dating someone new, and I want to make sure I’m not… you know… bringing anything unpleasant into the mix. It’s just common sense, really. One has to be careful these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, “common sense,” as you say. While I appreciate preventative measures, let's be precise. You are requesting screening for sexually transmitted infections, correct?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, you can put it however you like, Doctor. I simply want to be… thorough. It’s not as though I’m expecting anything, mind you. I’ve always been very particular about… everything. But a check-up is a check-up, isn’t it? And frankly, he's… younger. One can never be too safe with these things.
DOCTOR: Very well. To be thorough, we need a detailed history. Have you had any symptoms – any unusual discharge, sores, itching, burning?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not! Doctor, I assure you, I am meticulously clean. No discharge, no itching, no anything of the sort. I would notice immediately, naturally. I maintain a very… fastidious personal hygiene routine. It would be quite shocking if I did have anything. Honestly, the thought! I simply wanted to be… proactive.
DOCTOR: Understandable. And when was your last sexual encounter with this… partner?
PATIENT: Well, that is… a personal question, isn’t it? But since you insist… it was approximately three weeks ago. We’ve only been… seeing each other for a little over a month. It's not a serious commitment, you understand. More of a… companionship. But one still needs to be sensible. He assures me he’s… clean, but one can't always trust a gentleman’s word, can one? Especially at his age.
DOCTOR: “His age”?
PATIENT: Oh, well… he’s… significantly younger. About twenty years, actually. It's not the most conventional pairing, I suppose, but he’s… charming. And quite attentive. Though, naturally, one has to consider all factors. That’s why I’m here, isn’t it? To be absolutely certain. It’s not about him specifically, you understand. It's about… due diligence. It's simply responsible behaviour.
DOCTOR: Let us move on. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections in the past?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I would never. Doctor, I take exception to the implication! I’ve been married for… well, a very long time. And before that, I was a very careful young woman. I am not… that kind of person. The very idea! I’ve always been very particular about my health and my… reputation. Honestly, it's quite insulting to even ask.
DOCTOR: Very well. Past medical history, then. Any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, just my nerves, Doctor. And a touch of arthritis in my hands. It flares up from time to time, mostly in cold weather. Nothing serious, really. My primary care physician monitors it. Medicare covers everything, of course. And I take my glucosamine faithfully. Otherwise, I’m quite healthy for my age, I assure you. I maintain a very… balanced diet, and I walk regularly. Though, truthfully, the cold damp weather does make it rather difficult at times.
DOCTOR: Medications?
PATIENT: Just the glucosamine, as I mentioned. And a low-dose aspirin, the doctor suggested it years ago, just as a preventative measure. And occasionally, a little something for my nerves. Nothing consistent, really. Just when they get… agitated. It’s a small dose, I assure you. My husband keeps track of everything. He's very organized, thankfully. I tend to… forget these things sometimes. Though, I recall quite well what we’ve discussed today, naturally. It’s just… little things.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with a physical examination, then. Please, lie down on the table. We'll start with a basic check of your vitals, and then I’ll need to perform a pelvic exam. I understand this may be…uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh. A… pelvic exam? Doctor, are you quite certain that’s necessary? I explained I’m in perfect health! And frankly, I find the thought… rather intrusive. Is there truly no other way to determine… whatever it is you're trying to determine? I mean, couldn’t a simple blood test suffice? I don’t see why I need to… undergo all of that. It seems… a bit extreme, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, with all due respect, a blood test will not detect all sexually transmitted infections. A physical examination is necessary to obtain an accurate assessment and ensure your health. It is standard procedure. If you wish to be thorough, as you stated, you will permit me to conduct the examination. Otherwise, I suggest you schedule an appointment with another physician. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But don’t expect me to be comfortable. And do be quick about it, please. Honestly, the indignity of it all! My husband will be most displeased when I tell him I had to… undergo all of this. He always says I worry too much, but he doesn't understand. One must be vigilant, Doctor. Absolutely vigilant. And please, no unnecessary… probing. I do have sensitivities, you know.
DOCTOR: Please lie on your back with your feet in the stirrups. I will minimize discomfort as much as possible. Now, I will begin with a visual inspection of the external genitalia. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. External genitalia appear normal. No visible lesions, discharge, or inflammation. Now, I need to perform a speculum examination. This may cause some pressure. Breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Oh! That is rather… uncomfortable! Honestly, Doctor, couldn’t you be a little more gentle? It feels… invasive. And cold! I don’t appreciate this at all. Is there any sign of… anything? Please, just tell me if there’s something wrong and be done with it! My nerves are simply dreadful, and this isn’t helping.
DOCTOR: Cervix appears normal in color and shape. No obvious lesions or discharge noted. Minimal tenderness upon palpation. However, there is some… increased friability of the vaginal tissues. Now, I will collect a sample for a Pap smear and STI testing. This will be a quick swab. Alright, that’s all. Please remain still while I remove the speculum. I will send the samples to the lab for analysis. The results should be available in approximately one week.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I feel absolutely violated. And the coldness! It’s simply dreadful. What does “increased friability” even mean? Is it… serious? I knew I shouldn’t have come. This has only increased my anxiety. And what if it's… something unpleasant? My husband will be furious. Absolutely furious. Please, tell me, is there any immediate cause for alarm? Don't leave me in suspense!
DOCTOR: “Increased friability” indicates some sensitivity and inflammation of the vaginal tissues. It can be caused by a number of factors, including hormonal changes, irritation, or mild infection. It is not necessarily indicative of a serious condition, but it does warrant further investigation. The STI testing will determine if there are any current infections present. We will discuss the results when they are available. Until then, I recommend avoiding sexual activity. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Avoiding sexual activity? Honestly, Doctor! That's rather… inconvenient. And what if it is something unpleasant? Will I need… medication? Injections? My husband will never let me hear the end of it. He's very particular about… everything. And what about my reputation? This is all simply dreadful. Can you at least tell me what the most likely cause of this “inflammation” might be? Is it… something I did?
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I understand your anxiety, but speculating on the cause without knowing the lab results would be irresponsible. Inflammation can be caused by numerous factors, including hygiene products, friction, or even stress. As for medication, that will depend entirely on the test results. Until then, please refrain from self-treating and await the findings. I’ve documented everything. My nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Very well. But I expect a thorough explanation when the results come back. And I want to be assured that whatever this is… is treatable. My husband will want to know everything, you understand. Everything. And if it is something… serious, I expect you to handle it with the utmost discretion. My reputation is at stake. Alright. I suppose I'll be going now. I trust your nurse will contact me promptly. And please, no unnecessary delays.
