DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Let me see… well, it’s a bit hard to explain, honestly. My memory isn't what it used to be. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And headaches. There’s a history of that in the family, I think. My brother… he used to get terrible headaches, and then… well, it’s all a bit foggy now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Tofani. It’s perfectly alright if things are a bit foggy – that’s very common. We’ll take our time and figure things out. So, you’re experiencing some weakness and headaches. Could you tell me a little more about the headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the headaches. They aren't constant, thank goodness. It comes and goes… usually on one side of my head, I think? It’s a throbbing kind of pain, not a steady ache. And sometimes, I get a little… dizzy with them? It’s hard to describe. They don’t happen every day, maybe once or twice a month? It’s been like that for… oh, goodness, a long time now. I suppose it’s just something I’ve learned to live with, but my daughter worried it was… more than that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so throbbing headaches, usually on one side, sometimes with dizziness, happening maybe once or twice a month for a long time. And your daughter is concerned. That’s good she’s looking out for you. Now, let’s talk about the weakness. Can you tell me where you’re feeling weak?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, she's a good girl, my daughter. Always looking after me. The weakness… that’s a bit harder to explain. It’s not like I can’t do things, you understand? It's just… sometimes my arm feels heavy. My right arm, I believe. And my leg, sometimes, feels a little clumsy. It’s not all the time, and it comes and goes. It’s like… it just doesn't feel as strong as it should. It happened a couple of times this past month, but it’s been on and off for a while, like the headaches. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Ms. Tofani. Weakness in your right arm and leg, coming and going, similar to the headaches. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me if anything seems to trigger these episodes of weakness or headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A trigger… let me see. I don't know if anything specific causes them, really. Sometimes it seems to happen when I’m tired, perhaps? Or if I’ve been doing a lot of things around the house. But other times it seems to come out of nowhere. I haven’t noticed any particular food or anything like that. My daughter asked me that, too, and I told her I hadn’t noticed. I do get a little stressed sometimes, with all the grandkids and everything, but I don’t know if that’s related. It’s just… it’s hard to pinpoint. I wish I could be more helpful!
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Ms. Tofani. It is often hard to pinpoint triggers. It’s good you’ve thought about it. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… High blood pressure… I think the doctor mentioned something about that years ago. He put me on a little pill for it, but I took it for a while and then… well, I suppose I stopped. I didn’t feel any different, and I have so many pills already! As for diabetes or heart problems… no, I don’t think so. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I used to walk every day, but I haven't been doing that as much lately. My memory… it’s just terrible for remembering things like that. I'm sure my daughter has all the paperwork, if you need it. She keeps everything so organized!
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Tofani. We can certainly check your chart for the details. It's good to know you were previously diagnosed with high blood pressure. And your daughter keeping the paperwork is very helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries… let me think. Yes! I had my gallbladder out years ago. It was… oh, goodness, must have been forty years ago? And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist. I fell in the garden, silly me! But other than that… I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. I've never been a fan of hospitals, so I try to stay away from them! I prefer a good cup of tea and a lie-down, if I’m feeling poorly.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal forty years ago and hospitalization for a broken wrist. That's good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, the family… that's a good question. My brother, like I said, he had terrible headaches. Migraines, I think they called them. He suffered something awful with those. And my mother… she had some sort of trouble with her heart later in life, but I don’t remember the details. She was in and out of the hospital a lot towards the end. My father… he was a strong man, always healthy. I don’t recall any serious illnesses in his family. It’s all a bit… foggy, you understand? It was a long time ago, and I wasn't paying much attention to those things then.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Tofani. It's very common for those details to be difficult to recall. So, a history of migraines in your brother and some heart trouble in your mother. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I've never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t had a drink in… well, decades! My husband used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but he passed away a few years ago. I just don’t have much of a taste for it, and I don’t really see the point. I prefer a nice cup of tea, like I said. And maybe a little biscotti with it, if I’m feeling indulgent! I try to eat healthy, but I do love my pasta, you understand? A little bit won’t hurt, I always say.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Tofani. A little pasta never hurt anyone. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Well, I take a little pill for my blood pressure, even though I don't always remember to take it. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when my joints are acting up. It's… a yellow pill, I think? And I used to take a vitamin D supplement, but I ran out a while ago and haven't gotten around to replacing it. Oh, and sometimes I take something for my indigestion, after a big meal! But that’s it, I think. Nothing major. It's hard to keep track of everything, you understand? My daughter helps me with all that, mostly. She keeps everything organized in a little box.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand it can be difficult. So, you're taking medication for blood pressure, arthritis, and sometimes for indigestion, and you used to take Vitamin D. Okay, Ms. Tofani. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. My heart’s been alright, I think, but it never hurts to check. And my reflexes… well, they aren’t what they used to be! Go ahead, please. Do what you need to do. I’ll just sit here and try to relax. It’s a bit nerve-wracking, all this medical stuff, you understand? But I’m glad I came. Hopefully, you can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Tofani. We'll take our time. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally, please. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. That’s not terribly high, but it’s something we should keep an eye on. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Could you please extend your arms and squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Whatever you say. Squeeze my hands, you say? Here you go. Not as strong as they used to be, I’m afraid. Getting old, you know? Everything starts to… weaken. I do try to keep them moving, though. I still do a little gardening, when the weather is nice. But it’s harder now, I’ll admit. It takes me longer to do things, and my back gets sore.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. A little weaker than expected, but not significantly so. Now, could you please close your eyes and tell me which direction I’m moving my finger?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Close my eyes, you say? Here we go… um… is it… up? No, wait… is it to the… right? Oh, goodness, I'm not very good at this, am I? It's hard to tell when my eyes are closed. I always need good light to see properly. Is it right? Or left? I’m so sorry, Doctor. I’m just making a guess.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Tofani. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty with that. It doesn't necessarily indicate a problem. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’ll gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly so. Okay, Ms. Tofani. That completes the physical exam. Based on the information you’ve provided and the exam findings, you’re experiencing headaches and weakness in your right arm and leg. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your reflexes are a little diminished. Your neurological exam is otherwise normal.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… complicated, doesn’t it? What does it mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? My daughter will be so worried. I just want to feel better, you know? It’s hard to do things when I’m feeling weak, and the headaches make me so tired. Is it my age? Is it something I did? I just want to know what’s going on, so I can… well, so I can get back to normal. If that’s even possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Tofani, and it’s perfectly natural to be worried. It’s not necessarily serious, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Based on your symptoms and the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Given your age and the intermittent nature of the weakness and headaches, we need to rule out some common causes. One possibility is a transient ischemic attack, or TIA, which is a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain. It can cause similar symptoms to a stroke, but the symptoms usually resolve quickly. Another possibility is a migraine with aura, which can sometimes cause weakness and dizziness. It's also important to consider other causes, like a vitamin deficiency or a side effect of your medication. To rule out these possibilities, I’d like to order some blood tests and a brain scan. The blood tests will check for vitamin deficiencies and other underlying conditions. The brain scan will help us look for any signs of stroke or other abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Brain scan… that sounds… scary, doesn't it? But I suppose if you think it's necessary, Doctor, I trust your judgement. Blood tests I can handle, I suppose. It's just… everything feels so overwhelming. A stroke… that sounds dreadful. Will the scan hurt? And will it take long? I have a bridge game on Thursday, you see. I wouldn’t want to miss that. And my daughter… she's always so busy, it might be hard for her to take me. What exactly will the scan show? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know what's going on, so I can get back to my life, you know? It’s just hard feeling like this, always worrying about something.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Tofani. A brain scan doesn’t hurt at all. It’s a non-invasive procedure, like having a really detailed X-ray. You’ll lie on a table, and a machine will take pictures of your brain. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. The scan will help us see if there are any signs of stroke, bleeding, or other abnormalities in your brain. It will also help us rule out other causes of your symptoms. The blood tests are simple – we’ll just take a small sample of your blood. It will also give us a lot of information about your overall health. It may take a few days to get the results of the tests. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Regarding your bridge game, we can schedule the scan for Friday, so it doesn’t interfere with your game. I’m sure your daughter can take a day off to help you with transportation. If not, we can arrange for someone else to help. We'll figure it out. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. Once we have the results, we can make a more informed decision about your treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, Friday sounds much better. And it's good to know the scan won't hurt. And my daughter… she’ll manage, I’m sure. She always does. So, blood tests and a brain scan. And then we wait for the results. It’s just… waiting is the hardest part, you know? I always worry about what the results might show. Will you explain everything to me when we get the results? I don't understand all that medical jargon, you see. I just want someone to tell me what's going on, in plain English. And what I need to do. And will you be the one to explain it to me? I’d feel much more comfortable if it was you. It’s just… I’m not good with strangers, you see. I prefer to deal with someone I trust.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Tofani. I will be the one to explain everything to you when we get the results. I understand that medical jargon can be confusing, and I promise to explain everything in plain English. I will take the time to answer all of your questions and make sure you understand what’s going on. We’ll discuss all of your options and decide on the best course of action together. I understand that you prefer to deal with someone you trust, and I’m happy to be that person for you. I’ll be here every step of the way. I’m going to write you a referral for the brain scan and a requisition for the blood tests. The scan center is located just down the street, and the lab is in the same building. Here you go. The papers contain all of the information you need, including the phone numbers and addresses of the scan center and the lab. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear, Doctor. Knowing you’ll explain it all in plain English makes me feel much better. And you being the one to tell me… that's a relief. Let me see… the scan center… and the lab… yes, I think I know where those are. My daughter took me there once for something else, I think. Um… yes, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. I might have some questions later, once I’ve had a chance to think about everything. But for now, I just want to go home and relax. Thank you, Doctor Sieh. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I appreciate it very much. I think… I think I’ll be alright now. Just need a good cup of tea, I suppose. And maybe a little biscotti.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Tofani. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here for you. And please, do take it easy. Get some rest, and enjoy your tea and biscotti. I’ll see you in a few days when we have the results. Take care, Ms. Tofani.
