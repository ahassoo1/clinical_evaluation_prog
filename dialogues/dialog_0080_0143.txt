DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Verrall, welcome. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. Thank you. Well… it’s a bit… complicated. My, uh, my partner and I… we’re thinking about having a baby. And I thought… maybe I should talk to someone first. Just to… make sure everything is okay. I’m getting older, you know? It’s been a long time since… well, since I thought about this.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you to consider, Mr. Verrall. It is always a good idea to check in before making such a big decision, especially with time passing. And you’re right to think about things proactively. To get a better picture of things, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Have you had a regular doctor you’ve seen consistently?
PATIENT: Oh… uh… not really. I travel a lot for work… sales, you know? Always on the road. I usually just… go to clinics when something really hurts. I don’t… keep a regular doctor. I'm a Sales Engineer, so always moving around. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's not bad, Mr. Verrall, but it does mean we'll need to gather a bit more information today. Traveling for work can definitely make consistent care challenging. Okay, so let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – things like heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure… maybe? The doctor said something once, a long time ago, when I was in… Turkey, I think? But I don't remember taking any pills for it. I was very busy with work then, and I… well, I forgot. Everything gets a little fuzzy. And… no, I don't think so, nothing major. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible high blood pressure – we’ll definitely check that today. And that’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… I don’t think so. Nothing that I know of. I eat everything. I like spicy food! I’ve never had a reaction… not that I remember, anyway. Maybe a little sniffle sometimes, but that’s probably just the dust from traveling.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I try to stay healthy with… uh… food and walking, you know? I walk a lot when I'm at work, visiting clients. That’s it, really. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That's a hard one. My father… he had something with his heart, I think. He was always tired. He died when I was young, though, so I don't remember much. My mother… she was healthy, I think. Strong woman. And… I don't have any siblings. It's just me. I don’t know much about my grandparents, either. We didn’t talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's understandable. Knowing some family history is helpful, but it's not always possible to have all the details. So, let’s shift gears a little. Before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… oh dear. I travel a lot, like I said. I eat when I can, wherever I am. Sometimes it’s good food, sometimes… not so much. I try to get some exercise, walking around cities, but it’s not regular. I don’t… drink much, maybe a little wine with dinner sometimes. And… I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit. Maybe twenty years ago?
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better picture. Twenty years since quitting smoking is excellent! Now, just to clarify, when you say “not regular” exercise, about how many days a week, on average, would you say you’re getting some physical activity?
PATIENT: Hmm… Oh, that's a hard one. Maybe… two or three days a week? Sometimes less when I’m very busy. It really depends. Sometimes I’m just running from meeting to meeting, and don’t have time for anything else. I try to walk when I can, but it's not a schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, getting back to why you're here today… you mentioned you and your partner are thinking about having a baby. Have you started trying yet, or are you still in the planning stages?
PATIENT: No, no, not yet. We’re still… talking. Thinking about it. That’s why I came. I want to make sure everything is… alright, first. It’s been a long time, you know? I’m older now. I don't want to cause any problems. That's all.
DOCTOR: That's very sensible of you, Mr. Verrall. It's good to be prepared. Alright, to get a better understanding of your current health and address your concerns, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. Just… don't be surprised if I’m a little… stiff. All that traveling. And… I don't remember the last time I had a proper check-up.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Verrall. We’ll take it easy. Let's start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Can you just roll up your sleeve for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Here you go. It might be a little tight, haven't worn short sleeves in a while.
DOCTOR: Okay… blood pressure is 145 over 88. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Your blood pressure is a little elevated. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? Is that okay? I haven't had anyone listen to my heart in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to quickly check your reflexes and do a brief neurological exam. Do you have any pain anywhere that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little ache in my back sometimes, but that's probably from the traveling and old age. Nothing major. Just a bit stiff. Do you need me to… do anything? I’m not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: No, just relax. Okay, reflexes are normal. Strength is good in all extremities. Now, I just want to quickly take a look in your ears and throat. Can you open wide and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Okay. Ahhhh… Is that good enough? It's been a while since I've done this too.
DOCTOR: Everything looks normal there too. Your ears and throat look healthy. Alright, Mr. Verrall, that completes the quick physical exam. Based on what we've discussed and the exam findings, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and we'll want to investigate that further. Given your age and the fact that you haven’t had regular check-ups, I recommend a few blood tests to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to make sure… everything is okay for… if we decide to go ahead. I don’t want to cause any problems.
DOCTOR: Good. The blood tests will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels. And given your possible history of high blood pressure, I’d also like to do a urine analysis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Uh… all those things? Sounds… a lot. But yes, if you think it’s necessary. Whatever you need to know. I… don’t understand what all those things are, but if it helps… then yes. When can I… do these tests?
DOCTOR: They're just standard tests to get a good picture of your overall health, Mr. Verrall. They'll help us identify any potential issues and ensure you're in the best possible shape. We can do them right here in the clinic. There’s a lab just down the hall. I’ll give you a lab requisition form. They'll draw a small amount of blood and collect a urine sample. It should take about 30 minutes. Once the results are back – usually in a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay. A few days… that sounds alright. Thirty minutes… I can spare that. A lab requisition form… yes. So, I just… go down the hall? And they'll… take blood?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Just take this form to the lab – it’s room 203, just down the hall on your left. They’ll need your insurance information, but don’t worry if you don’t have insurance; they can work with you. They’ll ask you some basic questions and then take a small sample of blood. It’s usually just a quick prick of the finger or a small draw from your arm. After that, they’ll ask you to provide a urine sample. Once you’ve completed the tests, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with my office. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Room 203… small prick… urine sample… No insurance… that’s okay. I… haven't had insurance for a while. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… helpful. I feel a little better now, knowing we’re… checking things.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. That’s my job. And that's excellent to hear. It’s always good to be proactive about your health. If you have any questions at all before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here's a card with our number. Once we have the lab results, we can discuss them and create a plan that’s right for you.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor Rosanova. I will… call if I need to. Goodbye.
