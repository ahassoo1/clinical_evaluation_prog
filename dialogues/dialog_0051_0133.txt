DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I just need some forms notarized, actually. Some health forms. I need them verified, that’s all. I’m trying to get this done quickly if that’s alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. Though, this isn't usually a service we provide directly. We are a medical clinic, focusing on health care, not document verification. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s…awkward. I was told specifically by someone on the phone here that you all did it. They said it was no problem at all. I don’t even remember who I spoke with, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Is there anyone else around here who might be able to help?
DOCTOR: Hmm…that’s…unfortunate. It’s possible a newer staff member offered that service, and it’s not fully established yet. Let me check with the front desk to see if anyone is authorized to perform notarizations. Please give me just a moment. “Janice?
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you looking into it. I’m really hoping to get these done today; they’re for a…well, it’s a bit complicated. But it needs to be done soon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. I understand. Let’s see what we can do. While I wait to hear back from Janice, perhaps you could tell me a little bit about why you need these forms notarized?
PATIENT: Well, it’s for a little program…a senior assistance program. They need all sorts of paperwork, and this is the last thing I need to get done. It’s to prove…to prove I’m who I say I am, I suppose. And that I’m…competent enough to manage my own affairs. It’s a little insulting, honestly, but it's the only way to get the help. It just feels like a lot of jumping through hoops sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Melvenia. It can be incredibly frustrating dealing with paperwork, especially when it feels unnecessary. It sounds like a very important program, though, and getting the assistance is the priority. Janice: “Dr. Glazewski?
PATIENT: Yes, Janice? What did you find out?
DOCTOR: Janice: “It seems there was a miscommunication. We used to offer limited notary services, but the staff member who was authorized has left, and we haven’t yet found a replacement or re-established the process. I apologize for the confusion.” I’m so sorry, Melvenia. It appears the information you received was incorrect. We are unable to provide notary services at this time. I truly regret the inconvenience this has caused you. Perhaps I can recommend a local notary public?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, that's just…wonderful. A local notary, yes, that would be helpful. I don’t really drive much anymore, so somewhere close would be best. Do you happen to know of any that are…reputable? I wouldn’t want to just trust anyone with my information, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. That's a very sensible concern. Let me see… There's a public notary at the community center, just a few blocks down on Elm Street. They have good reviews, and it's a well-established organization. I believe their hours are 9 to 5, Monday through Friday. Here you are. I’ve also listed a couple of other options, but the community center is probably the most convenient and trustworthy. Would you like me to write a brief note explaining the situation, in case they need verification from a medical provider?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, Doctor, thank you. A note would be wonderful. It’s just…sometimes explaining things is so tiring. And I worry they’ll think I’m making it all up. You’ve been very kind, Doctor, even though you couldn’t actually help with the notarization. I really appreciate you taking the time to look into it and writing the note. I think…I think that’s all I needed.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Melvenia. I'm glad I could offer some assistance, even if it wasn't the solution you initially hoped for. It’s perfectly alright to feel frustrated, and I understand your concerns about having to explain yourself. Here you are. This should hopefully suffice. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Have a good day. Oh, and…thank Janice for me, will you? Even though she wasn’t the one who gave me the wrong information. It wasn’t her fault.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Melvenia. And I certainly will thank Janice. Have a wonderful day as well. .
