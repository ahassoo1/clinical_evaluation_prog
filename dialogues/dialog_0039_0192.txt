DOCTOR: Hello Delron, welcome. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Dr. Kamahele, right? Look, it’s pretty simple. I’m here for this… this exam. For the army. Gotta get this done. They want me to take it, so here I am. Don't really see why I need a doctor for that, but rules are rules, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right, an exam for the army. Okay, I understand. Just to be clear, is this a new enlistment, or are you currently serving?
PATIENT: New. Completely new. I’m fifty-one years old, you know. Not exactly a young recruit. Though I keep myself fit. Better than most these days, I’ll tell you that much. Still, never been in the army before. Always wanted to, though. Now's the time, I reckon. My wife says I'm crazy, but… well. What does she know?
DOCTOR: Well, that’s wonderful that you’re pursuing this! It’s never too late to follow a dream. And it’s good you’re in good shape. To get started, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? What do you want to know? I work with machines all day, you know? Engines, mostly. Pretty physical work. I don't sit around. No major problems. Had a bad knee once, playing football when I was younger, but it's fine now. Mostly. Doesn't bother me unless it's really cold. I eat okay, I guess. My wife cooks. She likes… vegetables. I prefer a good steak, but you can't win 'em all, eh? Do I have to list every little ache and pain? Seems a bit silly.
DOCTOR: No, not every little ache and pain! Just the significant things. You mentioned a previous knee injury. That’s helpful to know. Are there any other injuries or illnesses you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I had the flu, maybe, a few times. Nothing serious. Tonsils out when I was a kid. And… oh! I broke my wrist falling off a ladder when I was fixing the roof. That was… fifteen years ago, maybe? Healed up fine. No problems with it now. I’ve never been… hospitalized, if that’s what you mean. Never needed to be. I’m a tough Swede, you know? We don’t complain much.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Delron. And yes, it sounds like you're quite resilient. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. Never been one for pills. My wife tries to get me to take something for my… well, never mind. But I refuse. I believe in a good night’s sleep and hard work, not fancy drugs. She says I’m stubborn. She's probably right. But no, no medications. Not a single one. And I don’t want any, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, like pollen or insect stings?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not really. I mean, I don't like bee stings, but I'm not allergic to them, if you catch my drift. My eyes get a little itchy when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that's all. Nothing serious. My wife makes me take some… some herbal tea when that happens. She says it helps. I don't know. Probably just makes me feel sleepy. No, nothing I'm seriously allergic to. Pretty tough constitution, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good. So, no significant allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history? Ugh. Now we’re getting into tricky territory. My mother… she had bad knees, like me. Passed away when I was young. My father… he worked too hard, I think. Heart trouble, eventually. My sister is… fine, I guess. Lives in Gothenburg. Doesn’t talk to me much. And that’s about it. We weren’t a close family, if you want to know the truth. Lots of silence. Not much talking about… feelings, or health problems, or anything like that. Is this really important? I mean, what good does knowing what happened to people I barely know do me?
DOCTOR: It can be helpful to have some idea, Delron. Knowing if there’s a family history of heart disease or other conditions can sometimes give us clues. But it’s okay if you don't have a lot of information. We can proceed even without it. Your mother’s knee problems and your father’s heart trouble are good to know, though. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, lungs, and just generally get a sense of your overall condition. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you need to do. Get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. Just… try to be quick about it, alright? I’ve got things to do. Machines don't fix themselves, you know. And my wife will be wondering where I am. She makes a good stew, you know. A really good stew. So, let’s get this over with. Blood pressure, you said? Fine. Do your worst.
DOCTOR: Alright, Delron. Just relax. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: There. Not bad for an old Swede, eh? Go on, get it done. I've had worse. Much worse. Though I can't rightly recall what those were. Old age, you know. Makes you forget things. But not this exam. I won’t forget this exam.
DOCTOR: Okay, just breathe normally. 140 over 90. A little elevated. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly fast. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Fine. Whatever. Never been much for tests. Always preferred doing things, not getting tested on them. Hurry it up, would you? My shoulder is getting stiff. All this standing around… not good for a man my age.
DOCTOR: Good reflexes, a little brisk, but within normal limits. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? Walked. Perfectly fine. See? Not falling apart just yet. A bit creaky, maybe, but perfectly functional. I tell you, this is a waste of time. I could be fixing a carburetor right now. A perfectly good carburetor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Delron. That was helpful. Now, I’d like to take a look at your knees. Could you sit back down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Here we go. The knees. Figures. My knees. Always been trouble with my knees. Go on, have a look. But don’t expect any miracles. They’re old knees. Like the rest of me.
DOCTOR: There’s some crepitus in both knees, and a little tenderness on the medial joint line of the right knee. Range of motion is slightly limited. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Do you have any pain right now?
PATIENT: Pain? Not… right now. It's usually worse when it's cold. Or if I overdo it. Been working on that old tractor, you know? Needed to get it running for harvest. A bit much, probably. But it needed doing. No, no pain right now. Just a bit stiff, that’s all. Like an old engine that hasn’t been started in a while. Needs a bit of oil, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Delron, based on the physical exam and what you've told me, your blood pressure is a little elevated, you have some crepitus and tenderness in your knees, and you report some stiffness. Given your age and the requirements for army enlistment, we'll need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture of your overall health. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a urinalysis, and some X-rays of your knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays? Urinalysis? Now you’re just trying to find something wrong with me! I told you, I’m perfectly fine! But… Fine. Do whatever you need to do. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time and money. Just get it over with. I’ve got things to do, you know? A carburetor isn't going to fix itself. So let’s get these tests done, and get me out of here. The sooner I’m done with this, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Delron. I understand your frustration. We just want to make sure you're in the best possible condition for enlistment, and these tests will help us do that. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity that aggravates your knees. Once I have the results, we can discuss them and make a plan. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just tell me when I can leave. And try not to take too long with those tests, alright? My wife will be wondering where I am. And her stew… it doesn’t keep forever, you know. So, let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Delron. You can head down to the lab now. They’re expecting you. It should take about an hour. I’ll call you as soon as the results are available. Thank you for your patience. .
