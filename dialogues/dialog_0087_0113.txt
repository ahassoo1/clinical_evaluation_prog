DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes. Well, it’s… it’s this waterworks thing. Going too often, you know? It's a nuisance, really. Not like it used to be, everything just… goes. Now it's all stop-and-start. My wife, bless her heart, she says I'm always running to the bathroom. She worries, you know how wives are.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. And it’s good your wife is paying attention. Just to clarify, when you say “going too often,” could you estimate how many times you’re urinating during the day, and how many times at night?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… I’m not good with numbers these days. Let me think… During the day? More than I used to. A lot. Maybe… six, seven times? Something like that. At night… well, that’s the problem. Waking up. Two, maybe three times? It varies. It's just… unsettling. I haven’t been sleeping as well, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, six to seven times during the day and two to three times at night. And you've noticed it's impacting your sleep. Has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm. Not really. We haven’t… well, we haven’t been traveling. Just the usual. Gardening, mostly. I still manage the tomatoes, you know. My wife does the flowers, she's got a real green thumb. I drink my coffee like always, maybe a bit more on hot days. Everything's pretty much the same as it’s been for… oh, a long time. It just started happening, one day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how would you describe the stream of urine itself?
PATIENT: The… stream? Oh, dear. Well, it’s not… powerful, like it used to be. It’s more of a trickle, really. I have to… push a bit, sometimes. And it doesn’t feel like I empty everything, you know? Like there’s always a little bit left. It's frustrating. A man should be able to… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand, Mr. Segretto. That's helpful information. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. It's not painful, just… uncomfortable. A little bit of a… ache, sometimes, after I go. But not while. And no burning. Just… old age, I suppose. Everything starts to ache eventually, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color? Smell? Heavens, I don't pay that much attention to my… waterworks. It looks like… pee, you know? Yellowish. I suppose. And it smells like… well, like urine. I haven't noticed anything… unusual. My wife would probably notice if it smelled bad, she's got a good nose. But she hasn't said anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of diabetes, or any prostate problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, not that I know of. My father had something… heart trouble, I think. But not diabetes. And prostate… hmm. The doctor mentioned something years ago, a check-up, but he said it was nothing to worry about. Just… old man stuff. I don’t recall the details, to be honest. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me think. Just a little something for my blood pressure, a small white pill. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take ibuprofen. That’s about it. Nothing fancy. And sometimes, a little something for my heartburn, but not every day. My wife handles most of that, I can't remember the names of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and something for heartburn occasionally. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to check your abdomen and listen to your heart and lungs. We’ll also need a urine sample to rule out infection. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. A little poking and prodding won’t hurt, I suppose. And a sample… well, alright. Where do I… do my business? I hope it’s not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Segretto. There’s a restroom just down the hall. I’ll leave you a sterile cup. Please collect a midstream sample—that means start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup mid-stream, and finish urinating. Once you've collected the sample, please bring it back to me, and we can proceed with the exam. I'll wait here. Take your time.
PATIENT: Alright. A mid-stream… right. Sounds complicated. I’ll do my best. It’s just… getting older, you know? Everything’s a bit more… of an effort. I’ll be back in a bit.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Segretto. I’ll be right here when you get back.
