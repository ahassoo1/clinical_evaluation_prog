DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Selbitschka. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… well, I’ve put on weight, and I don’t understand why. It’s been happening for a few months now, and it’s quite concerning. I haven't changed my diet or exercise routine, so I was hoping you could help me figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Concerning, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, concerning. I’ve always been… quite stable in my weight, you see? And now, suddenly, my clothes don’t fit, and I feel… heavier. It's not just a few pounds, Doctor. It’s… noticeable. And frankly, a little frightening. I’m usually very careful with what I eat.
DOCTOR: Well, “noticeable” is subjective, Ms. Selbitschka. People often misjudge these things. However, let's proceed systematically. First, can you quantify this weight gain?
PATIENT: Quantify…? Oh. Right. Well, let me think… I weighed myself in April, before my niece’s wedding, and it was 168 pounds. I weighed myself again just this morning, and it was… 183. So, 15 pounds in about four months, I suppose. I remember distinctly because the scale hadn't changed in years before that.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds. Alright. And you state unequivocally that your diet and exercise habits have remained consistent?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, unequivocally. I prepare most of my meals myself, and I eat the same things, generally. Chicken, vegetables, a small portion of potatoes. And I walk for at least thirty minutes every day, weather permitting, of course. If it's raining, I use the treadmill. It hasn't changed. I assure you. My husband even commented on it – he said, “You’re still at it, Reneisha?” He thought it was admirable, but now he’s noticing the change, too.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Most patients overestimate their adherence to a routine. Let’s move on. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think. No… not really. I’ve been a little… tired, perhaps. But I always attributed that to the summer heat. And maybe a little more… thirsty than usual. But nothing dramatic, Doctor. No pains, no dizziness, no changes in my… bowel habits, if you don't mind me saying so. Just the weight, and the slight tiredness and thirst. It's all rather perplexing.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and thirst… predictable with the heat. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any regular medications. I occasionally take ibuprofen for a headache, but that's it. And I haven’t taken any in weeks, perhaps months. I prefer to manage things naturally whenever possible. I really try to avoid medication if I can.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband always jokes I could eat anything, but that’s not quite true, of course. But I have no known allergies. I wish I knew what was causing this weight gain, though. It’s quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Selbitschka, given your history, or lack thereof, we will need to conduct a basic physical examination and some blood work. Please step onto the scale again for confirmation.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well, Doctor. If you think that’s necessary. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. I just… I was hoping for a simpler explanation. Here we go again. Hopefully it's not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: 184 pounds. As I suspected, a slight discrepancy. Now, please step on the height measuring device. And try to stand as straight as possible. We need accurate measurements, Ms. Selbitschka.
PATIENT: It's a little awkward, but I'm trying my best, Doctor. I haven't had my height measured in years. Is that alright? I hope I’m not doing it incorrectly.
DOCTOR: Five feet four inches. Alright. Now, let's check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt and bra and sit back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, dear. Very well, Doctor. If that’s what you require. It’s a little… abrupt, but I understand it’s necessary. Please let me know if you need me to do anything else.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s palpate your abdomen. Please lie flat. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not particularly. It feels… normal, I suppose. A little pressure, naturally, but nothing painful. I sometimes feel a little bloated after dinner, but that's not unusual for me. Is everything alright? You seem… quite thorough.
DOCTOR: No obvious masses or abnormalities detected. Thyroid feels normal. Now, let's check your reflexes. Left reflex is 2+, right reflex is 2+. Within normal limits. Now, we'll need to draw some blood for a complete blood count, thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. The nurse will be in shortly to take those samples.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I hope the results are informative. Is there anything specific you are looking for with these tests? Or… is it just a general check to rule things out? I'm a little anxious, I must admit. I just want to know what’s causing this weight gain. It’s unsettling not knowing.
DOCTOR: Ms. Selbitschka, with your limited medical history, we must explore all possibilities. The tests will help rule out thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, and other common causes of unexplained weight gain. But frankly, these tests are often inconclusive. It could simply be fluid retention, a change in metabolism, or… … a number of factors. The nurse will be in momentarily. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Very well, Doctor. I understand. Thank you for your time. I will wait for the nurse, then. If you think of anything else I should be aware of, please let me know.
DOCTOR: As I said, Ms. Selbitschka, the nurse will be with you shortly. I will review the results as soon as they are available. Until then, I suggest you maintain a balanced diet and regular exercise routine. And try not to dwell on it. It’s likely nothing serious. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
