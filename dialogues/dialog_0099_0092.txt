DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Guilds, yeah, that’s me. Uh… well, I been… short of breath, I guess. And my mouth feels like the desert, always gotta sip water. Eyes too, feel kinda gritty. It’s been… a while now. Not sure how long, you know? Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: “Old age,” you say. While some changes are expected with age, we should still figure out what’s going on. It's good you came in. "Short of breath"… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, details… always with the details. Okay, okay. It’s not like I’m runnin’ marathons, see? But… even just walkin’ to the mailbox now… feels like I gotta stop and catch my breath. Used to be nothin’. And it's not a coughin’ kinda breathlessness, just… can't get enough air. Happens more when it's hot out, I think. Though, everything feels hot these days. Don’t remember it bein’ this bad before… maybe.
DOCTOR: Right, not exertion-related, worsened with heat. And you mentioned a dry mouth and gritty eyes as well. Are those symptoms constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, mostly. I mean, I always got a bottle of water with me. And I blink… a lot. Feels like there’s sand in my eyes sometimes, even when I do blink. Not fun, let me tell ya. Used to have nice eyes, my mama said. Now? Just… dry. Honestly, I figured it was just the air conditioning. Everything’s so dry these days. Makes a man thirsty, it does.
DOCTOR: Alright. Dry mouth and eyes, shortness of breath… These symptoms together could be a number of things, unfortunately. Before we jump to conclusions, let’s go through some basics. Do you have any other symptoms – any fever, chills, muscle aches, or a change in your appetite?
PATIENT: Fever? Nah, don’t think so. Feelin’ warm sometimes, but that’s just Florida, right? Chills… not really. And my appetite? Eh… it's gone down a bit. Not much of an eater these days. Everything just tastes… bland. Lost my taste for good Cuban food, can you believe it? That's when you know somethin’s wrong, you know? It's a shame, really. Used to love a good ropa vieja. But… no chills, no fever. Just… tired. A lot of tired.
DOCTOR: Right. Loss of appetite, fatigue, dry mouth, gritty eyes, shortness of breath… Okay. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like diabetes, heart problems, lung issues?
PATIENT: Uh… medical history… that’s a long time ago. Doc used to tell me my blood pressure was a little high, years back. Gave me some pills. Took ‘em for a bit. Didn't like 'em, made me feel funny, so I… stopped. Don't remember what else. Old age, you know? Things get… foggy. Never had any lung trouble, no. Used to smoke, but I quit… oh, goodness, fifty years ago? More? I don't rightly remember. Just high blood pressure, I think. And maybe some arthritis in my knees, but who doesn’t these days?
DOCTOR: "Stopped taking the blood pressure medication years ago?
PATIENT: Yeah, a long time ago. Doc kept botherin' me about it, but… those pills weren't for me. Made me feel… sluggish. And honestly, I felt fine without ‘em for a long time. Then… well, things started gettin’… this way. You know? Hard to say if it was the pills or not. It was a long time ago. Docs always makin' a fuss. I didn't like feelin' like a guinea pig.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. We need to get a better understanding of what's going on. Given your symptoms and history—or lack thereof, frankly—we're going to need to run some tests. I'd like to start with a basic blood panel, including a check of your kidney function and electrolytes. We should also check your oxygen saturation. And, if you don't mind, I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more fuss. Fine, fine. Do what you gotta do. Just… don’t stick me too much. I hate needles. Oxygen saturation… is that the thing with the clip on my finger? That’s not so bad. Lungs and heart… well, I guess. Long as it doesn’t take too long. Just get it over with, doc. I got things to do. Mostly… nothin', but still.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with the oxygen saturation. This just clips onto your finger, shouldn’t take more than a few seconds. 91%. That's a little low, Mr. Guilds. I'd also like to check your blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. Please sit back and take some deep breaths. Your blood pressure is elevated, 160 over 95. I’m hearing some mild crackling in your lungs, and your heart rate is a little fast. Given these findings, and your history of stopping your blood pressure medication, I'm concerned about possible heart failure and/or pneumonia. We'll need a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Heart failure? Pneumonia? Now you’re scaring me, doc. Crackling in my lungs… that doesn’t sound good. X-ray? Is that… dangerous? I told you those pills weren’t for me! Maybe I should've just stuck with the high blood pressure. Better a little sluggish than… whatever this is. I don't like this one bit. Is this gonna be expensive? I’m on Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, please try to remain calm. An X-ray is not dangerous; it uses very low levels of radiation. It's a standard procedure to help us understand what's happening in your lungs. And yes, I understand your concerns about Medicare, we will file everything appropriately. But frankly, dismissing a potential medical issue because of a dislike of medication is… unwise. We need to know what’s going on. The crackling in your lungs could indicate fluid buildup, which can happen with heart failure or pneumonia, and we need to rule out either of these things. I’m going to order the chest X-ray immediately, and I’d like you to get it done today. Until we have the results, I’m going to prescribe a low dose of a diuretic, a water pill, to help reduce any potential fluid overload. It’s better to be cautious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Water pill… more pills. You just keep givin’ me pills. Fine, fine. But I’m tellin’ ya, I don't react well to 'em. And that X-ray… I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded. But… if you think it’s necessary. Do I gotta go somewhere special for this X-ray? Is it far? I ain't got a car, you know. And what about this Medicare… will it really cover it? I don’t want no surprise bills.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Guilds, the X-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street. It’s a short walk – I can have a nurse escort you if you prefer, though it's quite manageable. And yes, Medicare will cover it, as long as it's deemed medically necessary – which, based on your symptoms, it absolutely is. I will have the nurse provide you with the necessary paperwork. Frankly, your reluctance to follow basic medical advice is concerning. We're trying to help you. I'm prescribing the diuretic to alleviate potential fluid buildup. If it is heart failure, it's crucial to manage it promptly. The nurse will also explain the potential side effects of the diuretic. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Mama always said I was a strong kid. Never had much trouble with sickness. But… oh! There was that time I took some pills for… somethin'. Gave me a rash, I think. Red bumps all over. But I don’t remember what kind of pill it was. It was a long time ago. And it wasn't a serious rash. Just… itchy. Honestly, doc, I just want to feel normal again. This whole thing is… a bother. A big bother. And I don’t want no red bumps. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. "A rash from some unknown pill"... noted. We’ll be sure to document that. It’s always best to be cautious. The nurse will review your medications and allergies carefully. I’m ordering the chest X-ray and prescribing a low dose of furosemide—that's the diuretic. I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to review the X-ray results and assess your response to the medication. I strongly advise you to refrain from self-treating and follow my instructions. If you develop any new or worsening symptoms—especially shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your legs—go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
