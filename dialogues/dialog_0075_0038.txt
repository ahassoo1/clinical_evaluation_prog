DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Honestly, it’s a little… difficult for me to say precisely. I was advised to come in to discuss… arrangements. Future arrangements, I believe. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… well, should something happen. I think it has to do with a form? An Advance Directive, perhaps? I apologize, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Evann. It's perfectly common to feel a little unsure when discussing these things. Advance Directives are important, and it’s very responsible of you to be proactive. Essentially, it’s about documenting your healthcare wishes if you were unable to speak for yourself. It includes a living will and a durable power of attorney for healthcare. Before we delve into the specifics of those forms, could you tell me a little more about why you think this is something you need to address now?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. It’s not a recent development, not a sudden worry. More of a… growing awareness. My divorce was rather… final, and it left me without a designated person to make those sorts of decisions. And… well, I don’t have any close family nearby. Truly. Just a few distant cousins I haven’t spoken to in years. It's less about expecting something to happen, and more about… ensuring things are handled appropriately. If that makes sense? I don’t want to be a burden, and I want my wishes respected. But what those wishes are… that’s where I’m a little lost. I do know I… dislike being fussed over. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Evann. It’s very thoughtful of you to consider these things, and wanting to avoid being a burden is completely understandable. And yes, knowing you dislike being fussed over is very helpful. It gives us a good starting point. Just to clarify a bit for my records, and to make sure I have a complete picture – you said your divorce was recent?
PATIENT: Relatively recent, yes. Finalized just last year. It… wasn’t amicable. Which is another reason, I suppose, why I’m here. My… my former spouse would likely not make decisions I’d agree with. I’m not comfortable leaving that possibility open. It’s a difficult subject, I apologize. Perhaps we should focus on the forms themselves? I’m… not very good at recalling details from that time. It’s best to move forward, I think.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. We can certainly focus on the forms. Your comfort is my priority. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to move forward, especially given the circumstances of your divorce. Before we jump in, though, just for completeness, are you currently experiencing any health concerns?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I walk daily, and I’m quite diligent about my diet. I’ve had the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose, but nothing… significant. I see a dentist regularly, of course. And an optician, as you can probably tell. But no serious illnesses or ongoing treatments. I don’t take any regular medications, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Evann. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is wonderful. And no regular medications, that's good to know. Let’s talk about your weight. I see here you are 183 centimeters tall and weigh 123 pounds. Is that your usual weight?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, that is… correct. I’ve always been rather… slight of frame. It’s been consistent for many years. My former spouse often remarked on it, I recall. But it hasn’t affected my health, as far as I know. I eat well, I assure you. Perhaps I’m just… naturally petite? It's never been a concern, so I haven’t sought any… medical advice about it. Is there a reason you ask, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Just routine, Evann. Your height and weight are within normal limits, but given your weight being relatively low for your height, I want to ensure you're maintaining adequate nutrition. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes for unintentional weight loss, even if you feel healthy. Are you experiencing any fatigue, changes in appetite, or difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: Fatigue… occasionally. But I attribute that to simply getting older. And the walking, perhaps. It's a vigorous walk. As for appetite… no, not really. I eat when I’m hungry, and I enjoy my meals. And sleep… well, I’ve always been a light sleeper. I wake easily. But I wouldn’t say I have difficulty sleeping, precisely. More that I don't sleep for long stretches. It’s been that way for years, truthfully. Are you concerned? Should I be seeing someone about my sleep?
DOCTOR: It's good you're aware of those patterns, Evann. The fatigue, light appetite, and waking easily... these could be related to something else, even if you feel generally healthy. While it may be nothing serious, it's best to investigate a bit further, just to be safe. To get a better understanding, would you be open to a simple blood test?
PATIENT: A blood test… I… dislike needles. A great deal. But… if you think it’s necessary, yes. I suppose I can endure it. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And if you could assure me the technician is… skilled? I’ve had unpleasant experiences in the past. What exactly are you looking for with the test? Perhaps knowing that would… ease my apprehension.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. I understand your apprehension; many people dislike needles. I will personally ensure a skilled phlebotomist is assigned to draw your blood, and I will be right there if you need anything at all. The blood test will check your basic metabolic panel – electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, blood sugar – to rule out any underlying imbalances. We’ll also check your thyroid levels, and a complete blood count to look for any signs of anemia or infection. It's a fairly standard test, and it shouldn’t take long – about 15-20 minutes in total. Would you prefer to have it done right away, or would you like some time to think about it?
PATIENT: Right away, I think. Prolonging it won’t… improve matters. The sooner it’s done, the better. Although… perhaps I could sit down during the procedure? I’m prone to… feeling faint. And please, do let me know when you’re about to… insert the needle. No surprises, if you please. Thank you, Doctor. For being… understanding. It’s a relief to find someone who listens.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Evann. You can absolutely sit down, and I will explain every step of the process beforehand. I’ll also warn you just before the needle insertion. It's completely understandable to feel anxious, and I want to make this as comfortable as possible for you. Let me just quickly review some allergy information. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a particularly strong reaction to anything. Perhaps a mild sensitivity to certain perfumes, but nothing severe. And definitely no latex allergy. I’ve had dental work done regularly, and I’ve never experienced any issues. I don't wear jewelry, either, so I haven't encountered any nickel allergies. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies to report, Doctor. I’m rather… unremarkable, medically speaking. It’s probably just the weight.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Evann. No known allergies is helpful. And it's perfectly fine to be "unremarkable," as you put it. It means you’re likely very healthy! Okay, let’s proceed with the blood test. The phlebotomist, Marie, is very experienced and gentle. She’ll be in shortly to take your blood. Just let me know if you feel lightheaded or unwell at any point during the process. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… reassurance that this isn’t about anything serious. You’re not concerned about… something grave, are you? I'm getting a little anxious. Perhaps I should have just focused on the Advance Directive. It all feels… rather overwhelming. But if you truly believe it's necessary, then I trust your judgment. Just please, keep me informed. And be gentle. That's all I ask. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Evann, I completely understand your anxiety. It's perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed. And no, I’m not concerned about anything grave. I’m simply being thorough. Your weight being lower than average, combined with your reported fatigue, warrants a simple check to rule out any potential underlying causes. It's a routine precaution, and it doesn't mean there’s anything to worry about. Think of it as a little peace of mind. I will be here throughout the entire process, and I will explain everything to you step-by-step. Marie is very skilled, and she'll be as gentle as possible. Here she is now. Marie, this is Evann, and she’s a little anxious about the blood draw. Could you please take extra care with her?
PATIENT: It’s… good to meet you, Marie. Please, take your time. I’m not in a hurry. Just… be gentle. That's all I ask. Thank you both. I appreciate your patience. Perhaps we can return to discussing the Advance Directive after this is over? It sounds far less… invasive.
DOCTOR: Marie: "Absolutely, Evann. We'll take our time, and I’ll explain every step as we go. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort." Dr. Panjoj: "We will definitely return to the Advance Directive after this, Evann. You're doing great. Just focus on taking deep breaths, and we’ll get through this together.” Dr. Panjoj: "She prefers to sit for the draw, if you don't mind."
