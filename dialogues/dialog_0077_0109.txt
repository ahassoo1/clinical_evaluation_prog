DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for maybe three days now. Not… not real bad all the time, but it’s there. Like a… a dull ache, you know?
DOCTOR: A dull ache in the back of your head for three days. I see. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, yes. Mostly when I… when I move my neck. Or if I’m… thinking hard. Not always, but a lot of the time. It's… strange. I used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now… it bothers me.
DOCTOR: Hmm, that's useful information, Mr. Brum. So, it’s related to neck movement and concentration. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not really. Maybe… a little tired. But I'm ninety years old, Doctor! I am supposed to be tired. No dizziness. No blurry vision. Just the head pain. And the tiredness, but… that’s probably just old age.
DOCTOR: That’s fair enough, Mr. Brum. And I appreciate you clarifying that for me. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any recent injuries to your head or neck?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Nothing I can remember, anyway. I work with the trains, you see? Rail yard. Been doing it a long time. Lots of bending and lifting, but no falls or bumps to the head. I try to be careful. It's… dangerous work, if you're not paying attention. But I am always paying attention. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Rail yard work. And no recent head trauma. Good. Now, regarding your medical history – do you have any chronic health conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor… back in Guatemala… he said something about that, a long time ago. I don’t take any pills for it now. Arthritis… yes, in my hands. Makes it hard to… well, to do small things. But it doesn’t hurt all the time, you know? Mostly just stiff. I haven’t seen a doctor regular in… a long time. It’s expensive, and… well, I haven't needed to. Until now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Brum. High blood pressure in the past and some arthritis. And you haven't been regularly followed by a physician for some time. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I take a little… a little aspirin sometimes, if I have a bad pain. But not for the head. Just for my knees, maybe. I don’t like taking pills if I don’t have to. Makes me feel… funny. And they're expensive, you know? I try to… tough it out. Most of the time.
DOCTOR: No regular medications, occasional aspirin for knee pain. Alright. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything! Back in Guatemala, we ate a lot of… strange things. Never had a problem. I’m not a picky eater, you see. My wife… she was the picky one. Bless her soul. But no, no allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Brum. And I’m sorry for your loss. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, your reflexes, and gently examine your neck to see if I can pinpoint the source of the pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you think is best. You are the doctor. I’ll just… sit here? And try to relax. It's hard to relax when my head hurts, but I’ll try. You go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. If you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be wonderful. I’m going to start by checking your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148/92. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your history. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. Cranial nerves are intact. And now I'm just going to gently feel along the muscles in the back of your neck… There is some tenderness here, on the left side…and a little muscle spasm. It doesn't seem to be radiating anywhere, thankfully. Alright. Based on the exam, it seems we're dealing with some tension in the neck muscles, likely contributing to your headache. The elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor as well.
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. My neck does feel tight. Been doing a lot of lifting lately, helping my grandson with his… his things. He moved, you see. Lots of boxes. Maybe I strained something. Is it… bad? Do I need… pills?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound serious, Mr. Brum. Likely a muscle strain, aggravated by the lifting. No need to panic. We can try a conservative approach initially. I'm going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief – either ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed on the package. Heat or cold packs can also be very helpful. And try to avoid heavy lifting for a few days, if possible. If the pain doesn't improve within a week, or if it gets significantly worse, we'll need to consider further investigation, perhaps an X-ray to rule out anything more serious. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds… good, Doctor. Ibuprofen… yes, I think I’ve used that before. And heat… my wife used to say heat was good for everything. I can try that. And I’ll… I’ll try not to lift anything. It's hard, my grandson… he needs help. But I can tell him to be patient. How much… ibuprofen should I take? I don’t want to take too much.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible question, Mr. Brum. The standard dose of ibuprofen is 200-400 milligrams every 4-6 hours, as needed for pain. However, given your age and the potential for interaction with any underlying conditions, I’d recommend starting with 200 milligrams every 6 hours. And please, don’t exceed 800 milligrams in a 24-hour period. I'll also write down these instructions for you to take home, along with some information on how to apply heat and cold packs safely. And it's important to stay hydrated while taking ibuprofen. We should also monitor your blood pressure at home if you have a cuff available. If it remains consistently elevated, we may want to discuss starting medication to manage that. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't have one of those. Never needed one before. My grandson… he might have one. He’s always buying those things. I’ll ask him. He likes to take care of me. So, ibuprofen… 200 milligrams, six hours. And ask him about the cuff. That sounds… good. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything I should not be doing? I want to make sure I don't mess this up.
DOCTOR: You're doing wonderfully, Mr. Brum. Asking questions is the best thing you can do. Avoid strenuous activity for a few days, as we discussed. And try to maintain good posture – keep your shoulders relaxed and avoid hunching over. If you're experiencing any new symptoms – such as dizziness, numbness, weakness, or fever – please contact the office immediately. And most importantly, don’t hesitate to reach out if the pain worsens or doesn’t improve after a week. I'm also going to give you a handout on neck strain prevention, with some simple exercises you can do once the acute pain subsides. We'll also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to assess your progress. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A week sounds… perfect. I can come back then. Thank you very much. You’ve been very kind. I think… I think I’ll go home now and rest. And ask my grandson about the pills and the machine. Thank you again. You're a good doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and rest well. And please, ask your grandson to call us if you need assistance scheduling that follow-up. .
