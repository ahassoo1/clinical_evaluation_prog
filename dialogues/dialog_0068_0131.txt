DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. Or… is it Saven?
PATIENT: Morning! It’s Saven, with an ‘e’ at the end. Mykeisha Saven. Nice to meet you, Doctor… Sham, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Doctor Sham. Please, have a seat. So, Ms. Saven, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my blood pressure. It’s been a bit high lately, and my sister told me I really should get it checked out. She worries, you know? She’s a nurse.
DOCTOR: Right, a good nurse-sister is always a plus. High blood pressure… Okay. And when you say “lately,” can you give me a sense of how long that's been?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe the last couple of months? It’s hard to say exactly. I don’t really keep track, but I noticed it when I went to get a flu shot at the pharmacy. The pharmacist said it was a little high then, and I felt a bit off after, kinda dizzy. Then I checked it again a few weeks ago at home, and it was up again.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you recall roughly what the numbers were when the pharmacist checked it, or when you checked it at home?
PATIENT: I think the pharmacist said something like… 140 over 90? Maybe? And at home… honestly, I don't remember the second number, but the first was around 145, I think. It's just… numbers kinda blur together for me. I don’t usually pay attention to stuff like that unless someone tells me it's wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a starting point. And have you been experiencing any other symptoms along with this… dizziness?
PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes I get headaches, mostly in the back of my head. And I feel tired a lot, even when I sleep okay. Not like, fall-down tired, just… worn out. Oh, and my vision gets a little blurry sometimes, but I thought that was just my eyes getting older, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you having any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, none of that. No chest pain at all, and I can breathe just fine. My ankles don’t bother me, no swelling. I would know, I like wearing sandals, so I'd notice!
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or is this a new concern?
PATIENT: No, never. This is all new to me. I’ve been pretty healthy, to be honest. I get my yearly check-ups, but nothing major has ever come up. That’s why I was surprised when the pharmacist mentioned it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you know your family history regarding blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mom had high blood pressure, I think. She was always going to the doctor, but she never really talked about specifics. And my grandfather… he had a stroke, but that was a long time ago, when I was little. I don’t know much beyond that, really. They didn’t really share much about health stuff in my family.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, once a day. And sometimes I take Tylenol if my head really hurts, but that’s it. Nothing else, promise. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat all kinds of foods, and I haven't had any issues with any prescriptions I’ve gotten for a cold or flu, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work at a senior center, helping folks with their daily stuff - getting dressed, eating, that kind of thing. It’s a pretty active job, always on my feet. I don't really exercise exercise, but I'm moving around all day. I eat pretty normally, I guess. I like to cook, mostly Caribbean food, but I try not to eat too much salt. It's hard though, because everything tastes better with a little seasoning!
DOCTOR: Right. And do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink alcohol either. Never really liked it, to be honest. I prefer a nice glass of lemonade, or some ginger beer. Much better for you!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at your vital signs. I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I'm used to doctors poking and prodding, haha. Hopefully it won't be too bad!
DOCTOR: Okay. Just relax your arm for me, please. And breathe normally. Okay... 158 over 92. 160 over 90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are normal; no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Your reflexes are normal. Alright. Everything seems normal on the physical exam, aside from the elevated blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… higher than I thought. Is that really bad? I've never had a number that high before.
DOCTOR: Well, it's elevated, yes. It's not an immediate emergency, but it does need to be addressed. Given your family history and the consistently high readings, it seems likely you have what we call hypertension, or high blood pressure. We'll need to do some further testing to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any underlying causes. I'd like to order some blood work and a urine test. It will also be helpful to get an EKG, just to check your heart's electrical activity. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, sure. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on, and get it sorted out. Blood work and a urine test, and that EKG thing… sounds good. When can I do those?
DOCTOR: Good. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and collect a urine sample right away. The EKG machine is just down the hall, and we can get that done quickly. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to start you on a low-dose medication to help control your blood pressure. It's a common medication, and most people tolerate it well. I'll explain it to you in more detail once we have the lab results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds alright. A little scary starting a new medication, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. As long as it helps bring those numbers down… Okay, let's get the blood work and EKG done. And please explain everything to me clearly once you have the results, okay? I don't understand all the medical terms.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will, Ms. Saven. The nurse will be in shortly to get started. I think for now, we’ll start you on a low dose of Lisinopril. It’s a common ACE inhibitor. We’ll need to monitor your kidney function with follow-up blood work, but it should be well-tolerated. I want you to also start a low-sodium diet and try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks so we can review the lab results and see how the medication is working. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, Lisinopril… got it. Low sodium, more exercise… I can definitely try that. Two weeks sounds good for a follow-up. Thank you, Doctor Sham. I feel a bit better knowing we have a plan now. I guess I'll go wait for the nurse then.
DOCTOR: Right. I'll let the nurse know you're ready. Take care, Ms. Saven. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment.
