DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Ruocco, welcome. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just...pain. When I breathe deep. It's been…a little while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. Things aren’t so clear these days, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be hard to keep track. “A little while” is perfectly fine to start with. Can you tell me a little more about this pain when you breathe deep?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s…sharp. Like a little poke, right here. Not all the time, though. Mostly when I try to take a big breath. Like when I’m lifting something heavy at work…or used to. I don’t do much lifting anymore. It doesn’t go all the way through, if that makes sense. Just…there. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and thank you for trying to explain it. “Sharp, like a poke” is helpful. And it’s good you’ve noticed it’s worse with deep breaths and exertion. Is it a constant pain, even when you're not breathing deeply or lifting anything?
PATIENT: No, no. Not constant. It comes and goes. Mostly when I do something. Or think about doing something. Old age, you know? Everything hurts a little more when you think about it. But when I’m just sitting…it’s usually okay. Mostly. Sometimes I feel a little…tightness, maybe? But not like a real pain. Just…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s triggered by activity and deep breaths, and sometimes you feel a bit of tightness even at rest. That’s helpful to know. When did you first start noticing this pain – even roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s…a good question. I think…maybe last year? Or the year before? It was around the time…my wife and I…well, never mind. It was a while ago. I just remember it started slowly. Didn’t bother me much at first. Just thought it was…getting old. I really can't say exactly when it started. Sorry. Everything’s a bit…fuzzy.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all, Mr. Ruocco. It's perfectly understandable. "Last year or the year before" gives us a good starting point. Has anything specific made it worse recently – any particular activity, or has it just gradually been increasing?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that you mention it… I helped my grandson with some yard work last month. Just moving some branches, you know. Not heavy stuff. But after that, it bothered me a little more. Just for a day or two. I thought it was just from overdoing it. But maybe…maybe that had something to do with it. I don’t know. Everything aches after doing anything these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seemed to be aggravated by that yard work last month. And it's been a gradual increase overall. Now, have you had any cough, fever, or shortness of breath along with this pain?
PATIENT: Cough? No, not really. A little tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothing bad. Fever…no, I don't think so. My wife always took care of checking those things… Shortness of breath…well, I get a little winded sometimes when I walk up the stairs. But I always figured that was just…being old. I haven't noticed anything different lately. Nothing that made me worry, anyway. Not until this pain started getting a little…sharper.
DOCTOR: Alright. No cough, fever, or significant change in shortness of breath. Just the gradual increase in chest pain, aggravated by activity, and a little tickle in your throat. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of – anything you’ve been treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Must be…thirty years now? And… I had some trouble with my blood pressure a while back, but they gave me some pills for that. I used to take them, but… I stopped a few years ago. Doctor said it was okay. I think. Everything gets mixed up. I haven't been to a doctor in a long time, if that makes sense. Honestly, I'm not sure what else…I probably had a cold a few times. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago and some history of high blood pressure that was previously treated with medication, but you stopped taking it a few years ago. And you haven't been to the doctor recently. Do you remember what the medication was for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don't. Little white pills, I think. Maybe pink? Everything's so fuzzy. I just remember taking them every day for a while. My wife always made sure I had them. She was good at keeping track of things. I really don't remember the name. Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. It's just… hard to recall things these days. I'm starting to feel a little tired now, if you don't mind. Can we wrap this up soon?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Ruocco. No problem at all. It's perfectly alright that you don't remember the medication name. We can certainly move along. Now, just to finish up the history, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife used to ask me that every time they gave me something at the doctor, and I always said no. But… you know. It's been a long time. I don't think I have any allergies. But I can't be certain. Honestly, I'm really getting tired now. Can we please finish soon? I just want to go home and rest.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Ruocco. We will finish up shortly. Just a few more questions. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Not since... well, since my wife passed. She always took care of all that. I stopped taking everything. I don't really see the point anymore, to be honest. Just want to get this pain figured out, and then… just be comfortable. Can we please be done soon? I really appreciate you listening to me. It's just… a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Ruocco. We’re almost finished. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I just want to ask quickly about your family history. Are there any serious medical problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My father…he had some trouble with his heart, I think. But he was a smoker, you know. He smoked like a chimney. And… my mother, she had some kind of… arthritis, I think. Bad joints. It was a long time ago. I don't really remember much else. It wasn't something we talked about much. Honestly, Doctor, I’m really feeling quite tired. Is there anything else you need to know? I just want to get this checked out and go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Ruocco, that’s perfectly alright. We’ll keep it brief. Just a few more quick questions, then we can move on to a physical exam, and then discuss what we’ve learned. Do you drink alcohol, smoke or use any recreational drugs?
