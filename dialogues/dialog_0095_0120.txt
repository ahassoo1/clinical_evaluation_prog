DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't really do small talk. I just… I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be easy. My husband… well, he’s gone now, and I don't want any trouble, you know? I’m not getting any younger. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re hoping to conceive, and you’d like to discuss options to make that happen as smoothly as possible. And you're concerned about potential complications given… recent events. Right. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Cycles? Honestly, I… I don’t really track that sort of thing. It happens, doesn't it? Usually around the same time each month, I suppose. It’s never been… regular regular, if that makes sense. More… predictable-ish. Is that good enough? I don’t have time for a detailed report, doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, “predictable-ish” is a start. And I appreciate you being upfront. Have you ever been diagnosed with any issues related to your periods – like PCOS, endometriosis, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctors… always with the names for everything. No, no diagnoses. I've had kids before, you know? Two of them. Perfectly fine pregnancies, aside from the usual morning sickness. This isn't my first rodeo. Why are you asking about things I don’t have? It feels like you're already expecting something to be wrong.
DOCTOR: I’m just trying to get a complete picture, Ms. Villarreal. Previous healthy pregnancies are very good information. But things can change. And it's important to rule things out, or confirm them, to ensure a smooth pregnancy. Do you remember roughly how old you were when you had your children?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? A long time ago. Let me think… The first one, I was… probably around twenty-five? Maybe twenty-six. And the second one was a couple years later. Look, it was a while ago. My memory isn't what it used to be. Is knowing exactly how old I was really going to make a difference? I feel like you're trying to trick me into admitting something.
DOCTOR: Okay, around twenty-five and twenty-six. That's helpful. And no, I’m not trying to trick you, Ms. Villarreal. It helps me understand the timeline. Now, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Just… my blood pressure pills. The doctor gave them to me after… well, after everything. Something about stress, I think. And a multivitamin, but that's hardly a medication, is it? Honestly, I feel like I’m being interrogated. Is this what all doctor's visits are like now? It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication and a multivitamin. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Look, I just… I take a little orange pill every morning. That’s all I know! My pharmacist handles all that. I don’t memorize the names of every little thing they give me. It's… Lisinopril? Is that right? Maybe. I think that's what it said on the bottle last time. Look, I have a lot going on, doctor, and I really don’t have the bandwidth for a pharmaceutical quiz.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. Good. And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, but that’s it. I’m pretty tough. Really, I don’t understand why we’re going through all this. It’s not like I’m some fragile flower. I just want to know if I can have another baby, without a lot of fuss. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Villarreal, that’s not too much to ask. I’m gathering information to help make that happen. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your husband… or your partner's… medical history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Don’t remind me. Honestly, it's still… difficult. He… he had high cholesterol. And… and he smoked, before we met. That's… about all I remember. He saw a doctor regularly, but I never bothered with all the details. It wasn't my department. I just… I handled the cooking and cleaning and raising the kids. Is that relevant? He's gone, doctor. What does his cholesterol have to do with me getting pregnant now?
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand this is difficult. His history can be relevant, Ms. Villarreal, as some conditions can have a genetic component or impact fertility. Now, just to clarify – have you been trying to conceive for a specific amount of time?
PATIENT: Look, it hasn’t been… planned. It's been a few months, maybe? I haven’t been keeping track, alright? It's not like I’m obsessing over ovulation calendars or anything. It just… happened. And honestly, I’m starting to worry it won’t happen at all. Is there something wrong with me? Is that what you’re trying to say? Because if there is, I really don’t want to hear it. Just tell me straight. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I'm not trying to imply anything is wrong. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you're hoping to conceive. And a few months of trying without success isn’t necessarily a cause for concern. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and order some basic blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Get it over with. But don't tell me I have to come back a million times. I have a life, you know? And please, no lectures about lifestyle changes or anything like that. I eat healthy enough. And I definitely don’t need to hear about my late husband’s smoking habits again. Just… do the tests and tell me what’s what. Quickly. .
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just have a seat on the table, we'll start with your blood pressure. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam. It shouldn’t take long.
