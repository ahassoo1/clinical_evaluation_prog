DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well… it’s family. My mother, she… she had some bad things. Heart, mostly. And my brother, he got… something with his head. Not good. I just want to make sure I’m okay, you know? Just peace of mind. I’m getting older now.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. It's very wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history like that. It's good you're thinking about this now. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a bit more about what specifically your mother experienced with her heart?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. She… she got tired very easy. Like, walking to the store was too much. And her legs… they would swell up. Big. And she had… chest pain. Sometimes it was bad. She went to the hospital a few times for it. I don’t know… all the names the doctors used. Just… her heart was weak, I think. She had it for a long time, before… before she passed. I don’t know all the details, sorry. I was young then.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like she dealt with a lot, and it's perfectly normal not to remember all the medical specifics from years ago. Fatigue, leg swelling, and chest pain… those are all important clues. And your brother – do you remember what kind of "something" he experienced with his head?
PATIENT: It was… after a fall. He slipped on the ice, I think. Then he started… forgetting things. Small things at first. Where he put his keys. Then bigger things. He got confused easy. And… angry sometimes. They sent him to a place, a special place, to take care of him. I don’t know what they called it. It’s… sad. It happened quick.
DOCTOR: I see. A fall followed by memory loss and confusion… that’s concerning. It sounds like he may have experienced a traumatic brain injury, or potentially something else neurological. Okay, shifting focus to you for a moment. Have you experienced anything similar – any memory issues, confusion, or falls?
PATIENT: No, no falls. And my memory… I think it’s okay. I forget things sometimes, like everyone does. Where I put my glasses! But nothing… serious. I don't think so. I mostly just worry. My wife… she passed a few years ago. Maybe that’s it. I just… want to be sure I don’t end up like them.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it's natural to feel anxious about your health, especially with your family history and recent bereavement. Grief can certainly affect how we perceive our well-being. Let’s do a quick review of your general health. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the doctor said. A few years back. I take a pill for it. A white one. Every morning. And… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. But that’s it, I think. Otherwise, I’m okay. I try to eat good, mostly. Not too much salt. My wife… she always made sure I ate right.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal in the past. That’s good to know. And it sounds like you're mindful of your diet, which is excellent. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. I eat everything. My wife tried to get me to eat more vegetables, but… I mostly stuck to the meat and potatoes. She was a good woman. But no allergies. I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. No known allergies. And it sounds like you have a good appetite! Now, before we move on, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, besides the white pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the white pill. One every morning. I think it’s… amlodipine? That’s what the bottle says. And sometimes, when my knees bother me, I take… ibuprofen. The blue one. But not every day. Just when I walk a lot, or if it rains. Makes them feel better. That’s it. Promise. I don't like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine daily for blood pressure, and ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. That's helpful to know. Now, Mr. Schwer, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and check things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… try not to poke too much. My knees… they get grumpy.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schwer. I'll be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse, and then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll take a look at your knees last, so we don't aggravate them right away. Alright, just relax for me. Deep breaths. …Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Your pulse is 72, which is normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not concerning at this time, but we'll want to monitor it. Your lungs sound clear. Now, can you take a deep breath in, and then exhale slowly?
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… A murmur, you say? Like… a little noise? Is that bad? My mother… she had a lot of noises, I think. Maybe that’s what you’re hearing. It’s okay, though, right? If it’s just a little one? I don’t want to worry my daughter. She has enough on her plate.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re asking, Mr. Schwer. Murmurs can vary quite a bit. Some are completely harmless, and others require further investigation. Yours is faint, and right now, it doesn’t sound concerning, but it’s something we’ll monitor at each visit. It's good we know about it. It’s understandable you’re concerned, especially with your mother’s history. Let's not jump to conclusions, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Not jumping. Just… a little worried. So… what now? Do you need to… poke around? My knees are already feeling a little stiff. And do I need any tests? Like, blood tests? Or… one of those picture things? My brother had one of those picture things. It made him very upset.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask. Let's check your knees briefly. I'll just gently feel around them to assess the range of motion and any tenderness. We’ll do it gently, I promise. And then we can discuss some potential tests. There's some mild tenderness on the inner side of both knees. And the range of motion is a little limited, but nothing alarming. Regarding tests, I think it would be wise to order a few things. First, a complete blood count, to check your overall health. And a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes. And, given your family history, an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity. It’s a simple, painless test, just some stickers on your chest. We can also discuss an X-ray of your knees, to see what's going on with the joints. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Okay… stickers, I can handle stickers. And blood tests, too. I don’t like needles, but… it’s okay. For peace of mind. X-ray… Hmm. My brother… he didn’t like being in those machines. But… if you think it’s important. Yes, okay. Do the X-ray. Better safe than sorry, right? My daughter always says that. Will it take long? I have… a bingo game this afternoon. It starts at two. I don't want to miss it.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good attitude, Mr. Schwer. You're right, better safe than sorry. And your daughter sounds like a wise woman! The blood tests and EKG will take about 30 minutes total. The X-ray should only take a few minutes. We can get everything done right here in the clinic, and I’ll have the results back within a few days. You should have plenty of time to make your bingo game. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and set you up for the EKG. Then we’ll get the X-ray done. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Thirty minutes… I can handle thirty minutes. Bingo is very important. It keeps my mind sharp. And… I might win some money. Okay, let’s do it. Blood, stickers, and pictures. Just… let me know if it’s going to hurt. And please… be gentle with my knees. They're old. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schwer. I’ll make sure everything is as comfortable as possible. I'll be gentle with your knees, and I’ll explain each step before we do it. The nurse will be right in to start the blood work. And don't worry, we'll make sure you have enough time to get to your bingo game. We’re going to get everything checked out, Mr. Schwer. And hopefully, it’s nothing to worry about. Just taking precautions, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… precautions. That's good. Thank you, Doctor. I feel… a little better now. Knowing you're taking care of it. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. That’s my job. And I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. The nurse will be with you shortly. In the meantime, try to relax and take a few deep breaths. We'll get you sorted out.
