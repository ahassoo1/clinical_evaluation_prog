DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepbro. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having some… pain. Down there. In… that area. It’s been going on for a little while now, but it’s gotten worse recently. I’m not quite sure what’s causing it, and I thought it best to get it checked out. I apologize for being vague; my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright. Many patients find these topics… difficult to discuss. We’ll get to the bottom of it. “Down there,” as you say, is quite broad. Could you be a bit more specific about the location of the pain?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me think… it’s… in my scrotum, I believe that’s the right word? Yes, the scrotum. On… well, it seems to be mostly on the left side, though sometimes it feels like it’s spreading. It’s not constant, it comes and goes. A dull ache, mostly. Occasionally, a sharp pain, but that doesn’t last long. Does that make sense? I’m sorry if I’m not being very clear.
DOCTOR: Alright, left scrotal pain, intermittent, described as a dull ache with occasional sharp pains. And how long precisely has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh dear. “Precisely” is the tricky part. Let me see… it must be… a few weeks, I think? Maybe longer? It started very subtly, just a little discomfort after I’d been… working. I do a lot of woodworking, you see. Standing and moving around quite a bit. It was easy to dismiss at first, I thought it was just muscle strain. But it hasn’t gone away, and like I said, it’s been getting worse. I really can’t say exactly when it started, Doctor. I wish I could.
DOCTOR: Right. A few weeks, associated with physical activity. And has anything specifically made it better or worse, aside from rest?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sitting down seems to help a little. Taking the pressure off, I suppose. And… a warm bath sometimes provides temporary relief. But nothing really makes it go away completely. And… bending over makes it worse. Definitely bending over. It’s a rather uncomfortable sensation. I also noticed… it feels heavier when it’s hurting. Does that make any sense? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Heavier… alright. And have you noticed any swelling, redness, or any discharge associated with the pain?
PATIENT: Swelling… I hadn’t really thought about it. Let me… feel. Yes, I think… yes, there is a little swelling. Not a lot, but it’s definitely noticeable now that you mention it. Redness… no, I don’t think so. I’ve been looking, but it seems normal in color. And… no, no discharge. Definitely not. I would have noticed that. It's just the swelling, and the pain, of course. A bit concerning, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is… noteworthy. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting accompanying this discomfort?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that at all. No fever, no chills, no nausea… I’ve been feeling perfectly fine otherwise. A little tired, perhaps, but that’s just from working long hours in the shop. No other symptoms, just the pain and the swelling. I really appreciate you asking, though. It’s good to know you’re checking all the possibilities. I’m a bit worried, I must admit. Is it something serious, do you think?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Stepbro, based on what you’ve described—left scrotal pain, swelling, intermittent discomfort exacerbated by bending over—there are several possibilities we need to consider. It could be something relatively minor, such as an epididymitis or a hydrocele. However, we must also rule out more serious conditions, such as a testicular torsion or, less likely, a tumor. To do so, I'm going to need to conduct a physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A physical examination sounds… sensible. I understand you need to check things properly. I trust your judgement completely. I was rather hoping it wasn’t anything too serious, but I appreciate you being thorough. Please, go ahead. I’ll… I’ll try to remain still. It’s a little embarrassing, but I want to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I will need to palpate your scrotum and examine your testicles to assess the size, shape, and consistency, and to check for any tenderness or masses. I will also listen to your abdomen. This will take just a few moments. Please let me know immediately if you experience any significant discomfort. …Alright. There is some tenderness on the left side, as you described. I detect a slight fullness, a small mass, approximately one centimeter in diameter. It is firm, and slightly mobile. No crepitus is noted. The right testicle is normal in size and consistency. No palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy. Based on the physical examination, the findings are concerning. It is imperative we obtain an ultrasound to determine the nature of this mass. It will help us differentiate between a cyst, a hydrocele, an epididymitis, or a more serious pathology. I'll have my assistant schedule that for you immediately. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… Oh dear. That sounds… rather serious. A mass… one centimeter… It’s definitely not good, is it? No, I didn't think so. Avoiding strenuous activity… yes, I can do that. It’s probably best. I… I suppose not. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… what are the chances it’s something… bad? I know you probably can’t tell me for sure until after the ultrasound, but… a general idea? It’s just… a bit frightening. I don’t want to lose it. I hope it’s nothing too serious. I apologize for being so anxious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepbro, it is understandable that you are anxious. The presence of a mass warrants investigation, and it is responsible of me to inform you of that. While a mass does not automatically equate to cancer, it could be indicative of a testicular tumor. However, it could equally be a benign cyst or an inflammatory condition. The ultrasound will provide us with the necessary information to determine the exact nature of the mass. I do not wish to cause undue alarm, but early detection is crucial with these conditions. We will proceed with the ultrasound as quickly as possible. Should the results be concerning, we will discuss appropriate treatment options, which may include further imaging or, in some cases, surgical intervention. For now, focus on resting and avoiding strenuous activity. I will also prescribe you a mild pain reliever to manage any discomfort. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. A mild pain reliever… that would be helpful, thank you. Early detection… yes, you’re right. It’s better to know, even if it’s not good news. I… I suppose I just need to wait for the ultrasound, then. And try not to worry too much. Easier said than done, of course. Will the ultrasound tell you definitively what it is? Or will there be other tests afterwards? And… what kind of surgical intervention are we talking about, if it comes to that? I know you probably can't give me specifics yet, but… a general idea would be reassuring. I apologize for all the questions. I’m just trying to prepare myself. I truly appreciate your patience with me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepbro, the ultrasound will provide a detailed image of the testicle and surrounding tissues, allowing us to assess the size, shape, and internal structure of the mass. In most cases, it is sufficient to determine whether the mass is solid or fluid-filled, and to differentiate between benign and potentially malignant lesions. However, in some instances, further investigation may be necessary. This could include a biopsy, where a small sample of the mass is removed for microscopic examination, or blood tests to check for tumor markers. Should surgical intervention be required, the typical procedure involves an inguinal orchiectomy, where the affected testicle is removed through a small incision in the groin. This allows for accurate staging of the tumor and prevents potential spread. In many cases, the remaining testicle is sufficient to maintain normal hormone production and fertility. However, this is something we would discuss in detail should it become necessary. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we will proceed with caution and provide you with all the information you need to make informed decisions. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: An inguinal orchiectomy… removing the testicle… That sounds… quite drastic. But… staging the tumor… preventing spread… I understand it’s necessary, if it’s cancer. I suppose. And the remaining testicle is sufficient… that’s… reassuring, at least. No, I think… I think that’s all the questions I have right now. I’ll probably think of more later, but… for the moment, I just need to process everything you’ve told me. Scheduling the ultrasound… that’s the most important thing, I suppose. And resting. And trying not to panic. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough and patient with me. I truly appreciate it. I’m still a bit frightened, but… at least I know what to expect. Or… what might happen. I suppose I’ll wait for the call to schedule the ultrasound, then. And… hope for the best.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Stepbro. My assistant will contact you shortly to schedule the ultrasound. In the meantime, I will prescribe you a mild pain reliever, as we discussed. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as increased pain, swelling, or fever. I understand your anxiety, and I want to reiterate that we will proceed with caution and provide you with all the necessary support. I wish you all the best, and I will see you after the ultrasound results are available. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s everything. Thank you again for your time and patience. You’ve… eased my mind, somewhat. It’s still frightening, but… I feel more prepared now. No, I don’t think so. I’ll wait for the call about the ultrasound. Thank you. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you, again, for everything.
