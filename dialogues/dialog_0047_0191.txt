DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I requested a test for HIV. It’s… a personal matter, really, but I wanted to get it checked. I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately, and I thought it best to be sure.
DOCTOR: Right. An HIV test. Of course. And what exactly do you mean by “not feeling quite yourself”?
PATIENT: It’s difficult to explain, Doctor. Just… a general tiredness, really. More than usual. And some aches, in my joints. Nothing severe, mind you, but persistent. I also seem to be losing weight, even though my appetite is… normal. It’s just a collection of things, really. I thought it prudent to rule things out.
DOCTOR: “Prudent.” Yes, well. These things do require investigation. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms, Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… perhaps three months now? It started gradually, I suppose. At first I just thought it was the heat, you know? Lagos can be very draining. But it hasn’t gone away, even with the cooler weather. It’s been… steadily worsening, if only slightly. Perhaps two months of feeling noticeably unwell, and a month of just… feeling off.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really, Doctor. No fever, no rash, no swollen glands that I've noticed. My digestion is… regular, thankfully. I haven’t had any night sweats, or anything like that. Just the tiredness, the aches, and the weight loss. It’s quite perplexing, to be honest. I'm usually very robust.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you had any… recent changes in your personal life, Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… that’s a rather personal question, Doctor. My husband and I… we’ve been married for a long time, very happily. But he travels quite a bit for work, and… we haven’t been as close recently. That is the only change I can think of. I assure you, there has been no infidelity. Just… distance, due to his work commitments. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: It's simply standard procedure, Ms. Shaub. One must rule out all possibilities. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite healthy, touch wood. A few minor illnesses, colds and flu, of course, but nothing serious. I had malaria a few times when I was younger, living in the rural areas, but I recovered fully each time. Otherwise… no. I don’t take any regular medication. My eyesight is failing a little, hence the glasses, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My parents passed away some time ago, and I wasn't particularly close to my extended family. I know my mother had high blood pressure, and my father… well, he died quite suddenly of a heart attack. Nothing else springs to mind, I'm afraid. There wasn't much discussion of medical matters in my family, if I’m honest. It wasn't considered proper, really.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. My husband smoked for a while, but he gave it up years ago. We both believe strongly in a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. We eat well, try to exercise when we can, and avoid unnecessary risks. Old habits, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Shaub, I’m going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. It’s standard procedure, of course. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen. It won’t be unpleasant. May I proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. Please do. I understand it’s all part of the process. I’m quite comfortable with it. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… slightly elevated, 140 over 90. Not alarming, but worth noting. Heart sounds… regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Some slight discomfort in the upper right quadrant, but nothing significant. No obvious abnormalities detected during the physical exam. Now, we will need to run some blood tests to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and, of course, an HIV test. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I haven’t needed much medication in my life, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing serious. I should perhaps mention...I did have a tetanus shot a few years ago, after stepping on a nail in the garden. But no other allergies.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Shaub, I've ordered the blood tests. The lab technician will come and draw some samples shortly. Once the results are back—usually within a few days—we can discuss them in detail and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to monitor your symptoms and rest as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your attention to detail. I suppose I’ll just have to wait for the results, then. It’s difficult waiting, of course, but I trust your judgement. Thank you, Doctor Press.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shaub. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if your symptoms worsen before then. One final thing… given your husband’s travel history, it may be prudent for him to be tested as well, once we have your results. Just something to consider. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s a very sensible suggestion. I will certainly discuss that with him. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I won’t keep you any longer. Goodbye, Doctor Press. .
