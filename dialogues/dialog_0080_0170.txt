DOCTOR: Hi Waleed, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just here for a life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, you know? A medical exam for the insurance. I’d like to get it over with quickly if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Waleed. I completely understand wanting to be efficient. We’ll get through everything as quickly as possible while still being thorough. So, it's a pre-insurance physical, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Pre-insurance. Is that going to take long? I got things I need to do today.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t take too long. It's pretty standard – we’ll check your vitals, go over your medical history, do a brief physical exam, and probably order some basic lab work. I'll ask a few questions to start. Let’s begin with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I mean, nothing major. The doctor back home, he said my blood pressure was a little high once, but he just told me to watch my salt. And my knees bother me sometimes, old age I guess. But no… no big diagnoses. I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox and all that, but that was ages ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, managed with dietary changes, and some knee discomfort. That's good to know. And you said no other diagnosed medical conditions?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing else. I don’t really go to the doctor much, to be honest. Only when I have to, like now. It's a pain, all this paperwork and waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Waleed. Many people feel that way. Alright, let's talk about any surgeries you’ve had. Have you ever had any operations or procedures?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had any. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Just a few stitches here and there when I was a kid, falling off my bike and stuff. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Good. No surgeries. How about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mom, she had some problems with her heart when she got older. And my dad, he had diabetes. That’s about it, I think. Most of my family is still back on the islands. It’s hard keeping track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your father. That’s helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. Don’t really care for alcohol either. And definitely no drugs. I try to stay healthy, as much as I can. Mostly just eat and sleep, these days.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Waleed. That's very good to hear. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin sometimes. Old age, you know? I forget to take it half the time, though. Nothing else. No prescriptions or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, to get a better picture of your overall health, I’d like to ask a few quick questions about how you’ve been feeling lately. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve probably put on a few pounds since… well, since everything. And I get tired easier, I guess. Sleeping isn't as good as it used to be. But that's just getting older, right? It's hard to say what’s normal anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s fair. It can be hard to tell. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations – feeling like your heart is racing or skipping beats?
PATIENT: No chest pain. Sometimes I get a little breathless walking up stairs, but that’s just the weight, I think. And no… no heart racing or anything like that. I’d know if I was having heart problems, I think. My mom… well, I know what that looks like.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you been experiencing any headaches, vision changes, dizziness, or any problems with your hearing or balance?
PATIENT: No, not really. My eyesight's getting a little worse, but that's just age, too. I need new glasses, probably. And sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I stand up too fast, but that's nothing serious. Mostly just old age, you know? I keep saying that, don't I?
DOCTOR: You do! And it's good to be aware of those changes. Okay, just a couple more general questions. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or urinary function?
PATIENT: No, nothing out of the ordinary there. Everything's... regular, if you know what I mean. Sorry if that’s a weird question. I just want to get this over with quickly.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It's important to ask. Alright, Waleed, we're almost done with the questions. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. That will include checking your blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and looking at your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Just get it over with, please. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. If you could please sit up on the table, that would be great. I'll start with your blood pressure. 148 over 88… a little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears appear normal. No signs of infection in the nose or throat. I'll palpate your abdomen now. Soft, non-tender, no masses. Now I will check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. No edema noted. Now I'll measure your height and weight. You're 174 centimeters tall and weigh 97 kilograms. Alright, Waleed, physical exam is complete. I'd like to order some blood work to get a more complete picture of your health. That will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a fasting blood glucose test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Whatever you need. Just let me know when I can leave. I really need to get going. Fasting… does that mean I can’t eat anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. For the fasting blood glucose test, you’ll need to refrain from eating or drinking anything for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. We can schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning. You can eat and drink normally after the blood work is completed. I'm also concerned about your slightly elevated blood pressure. It's not drastically high, but it warrants further investigation. We'll monitor it with the blood work, and I may recommend a home blood pressure monitor for you to track it over a week or so. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your salt intake and maintaining a healthy weight. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just tell me what time I need to come in for the blood work tomorrow. And… is there a cost to all this? Insurance… they don’t always cover everything.
DOCTOR: The blood work can be scheduled for 8:00 AM tomorrow morning at the lab across the hall. As for cost, your Medicare insurance should cover the majority of the blood work, but there may be a small copay depending on your plan. The lab will verify your coverage and let you know the exact amount you owe before proceeding. Here’s a summary of everything we discussed and a list of instructions for the fasting blood work. Do you think you'll be able to schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor after the blood work is completed?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can do that. I got a doctor back home, I’ll give him a call. 8:00 AM… that’s early. I think that's it. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you getting this over with quickly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Waleed. I understand wanting to be efficient. If you have any questions or concerns after the blood work, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Here's the clinic's phone number and address, just in case. Have a good day, and try to get some rest. And remember to fast for at least 8-12 hours before your blood draw tomorrow.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. I will. .
