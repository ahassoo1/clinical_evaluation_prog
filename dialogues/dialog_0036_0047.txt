DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, it’s about… insurance. Long-term care, I think? My daughter, she set this up. I don’t really… remember all the details, to be honest. It’s somethin’ about makin’ sure I’m taken care of, if I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like your daughter is proactively looking into long-term care insurance options for you. I can definitely help clarify things and make sure you understand your coverage. Just to be clear, are you experiencing any current health concerns that prompted this appointment, or is this entirely focused on reviewing the insurance policy itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… current health… not really, nothin’ major. My knees ache a bit when it rains, you know? Old age, I guess. And I get tired easier than I used to. But I get by. My daughter, she worries a lot. She said it’s good to get things sorted before somethin’ happens. So, yeah, mostly just the insurance. I ain't really sick or nothin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very thoughtful of your daughter to encourage preventative planning. And it's good you're willing to discuss this. Knee pain and fatigue can be related to a number of things, even just the normal changes with age. To get a better picture of your overall health, and just to make sure there isn't anything else going on, would you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. Ask away. I… might need you to repeat things sometimes, though. My memory ain't what it used to be. Been a long time since I really talked about all that stuff. I used to be pretty healthy, I think. Worked on boats most of my life. Hard work, but good work.
DOCTOR: Of course, no problem at all. I'm happy to repeat anything as many times as you need. And working on boats sounds like it kept you quite active. That's good to know. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure, maybe? The doc back in… Anchorage, I think, told me somethin’ about that years ago. Put me on a little pill for a while. Stopped takin’ it after a bit, though. Felt alright. Arthritis… my hands get stiff sometimes, but I never really got a proper diagnosis for that. Just old age, I figured. Heart… never had any trouble with my heart, not that I know of. I used to be able to climb all over those boats, no problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of possible high blood pressure treated briefly in Anchorage, and some hand stiffness. We'll definitely want to check your current blood pressure today. And we can talk about the hand stiffness. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… uh… yeah, once. A long time ago. When I was younger. I fell off the boat, kinda. Not a big fall, but I broke my arm. Had to stay in the hospital for a few days to get it fixed. That was… oh, goodness, must be forty years ago now? Everything’s a blur. They gave me good pain medicine, though, I remember that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm approximately forty years ago. That makes sense. And I understand memories can fade over time. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm… let me think. No, not that I recall. Maybe somethin’ small when I was a kid, like tonsils, but nothin’ major. Definitely nothin’ like… openin’ me up or anythin’. I remember avoidin’ the hospital whenever I could. Didn’t like bein’ poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major surgeries reported. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history… well, my mom, she died young. Heart trouble, I think. Sudden like. And my dad, he lived a long life, but he had… somethin’ with his lungs. Smoked a lot, you see. Always coughin’. My sister, she’s still alive, but she’s got diabetes, I think. Yeah, diabetes and somethin’ with her kidneys. Not a healthy family, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of early cardiac death in your mother, lung issues in your father likely related to smoking, and diabetes and kidney problems in your sister. That’s helpful information. Now, just a few more questions about your current lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smokin’ for me. Never liked it. Dad smoked enough for the whole family, you see? And I don’t drink much, maybe a beer now and then with dinner, but nothin’ regular. And definitely no… recreational drugs. Never been my style. Just a simple man, Doc. Simple life.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use. That’s good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. Just a little somethin’ for my knees, sometimes. When they really bother me. It’s… ibuprofen, I think? The white pills. And sometimes I take a multivitamin, just to be safe. But that’s about it. Nothing regular, really. I try to get by without too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and a multivitamin occasionally. And you mentioned having some allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, the allergies. Not too bad, though. Just… hay fever, I guess. Gets pretty bad in the spring, when all the flowers bloom. Makes my eyes itchy and my nose run. Nothing life-threatenin’, though. Just a nuisance. Used to take somethin’ for it, but I don't bother much anymore. Just try to stay indoors when it’s real bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, seasonal allergies. Good to know. Alright, Mr. Rover, that gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doc. Just… try to be gentle with my knees, alright? They ain’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Blood pressure is 148/82. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. And your breathing rate is 16 and steady. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There’s some mild tenderness to both knees, with no evidence of swelling or redness. Range of motion is slightly limited. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen and check your reflexes. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are normal. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Everything seems within normal limits overall, but we’ll need to repeat the blood pressure reading again later, just to confirm.
PATIENT: Okay, good. Glad to hear everything seems alright. I figured it was just old age, mostly. Those knees have seen a lot of wear and tear, you know? Worked hard on those boats for many years. Sometimes they just ache a bit.
DOCTOR: I can imagine. Years of physical labor definitely takes a toll. Now, I'm wondering if it would be helpful to run a few basic blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel – just to get a more detailed picture of your overall health and see if there are any underlying issues contributing to your fatigue and knee pain. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… hmm. I don’t really like needles, Doc. But… if it’s gonna help, I guess so. If you think it’s important. My daughter always says I should get more checkups, so maybe this is a good idea. Just… try to be quick, alright? And tell me if it’s gonna hurt.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. I'll do my best to make it as quick and painless as possible. A phlebotomist will draw the blood, and they are very skilled. It's just a small pinch, and it will be over before you know it. The tests will give us a better understanding of your kidney function, blood sugar levels, cholesterol, and any signs of inflammation. It’s a good preventative measure, especially given your family history. While we wait for the results, let’s talk about your insurance. Do you have the policy information with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, hold on a sec… Here it is. Long-term care… somethin’ or other. My daughter helped me set it up, I don’t really remember all the details. It’s with… Pacific Mutual, I think? Here’s the policy number… 1234567890.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, it looks like you have a fairly comprehensive long-term care policy with Pacific Mutual, covering both home healthcare and facility care. It has a daily benefit amount of $200, and a benefit period of three years. Your daughter did a good job setting this up. It’s important to understand the details, though. For example, there’s a 90-day elimination period before benefits kick in. And it’s a non-cancelable policy, which means the premiums will remain level. Do you have any specific questions about the policy that I can help you with?
PATIENT: Ninety-day elimination… what does that mean? So I gotta wait three months before it… kicks in? Even if I need help right away? That don’t sound very good. And level premiums… is that good or bad? I’m not real good with all this insurance stuff. It’s all just a bunch of words to me, honestly.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. The 90-day elimination period means that you need to require long-term care services for at least 90 consecutive days before the policy will start paying benefits. So, if you only need a few weeks of care, the policy won't cover it. However, once you reach the 90-day mark, it will start covering the eligible expenses. And level premiums are good. It means that your monthly premiums will stay the same for the life of the policy. Some policies have premiums that increase over time, which can make it difficult to budget. Do you understand that a little better?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think so. So I gotta be sick or need help for three months straight before it starts payin’? That’s a long time. And the price stays the same, that’s good. My daughter said somethin’ about… a waiting period, I think. Is that the same as the elimination period? Everything sounds so complicated. I just want to know if I’m covered, if I need help someday.
DOCTOR: Yes, the waiting period and the elimination period are the same thing. It means you need to need care for 90 days consecutively before the benefits begin. I understand it's complicated, and it's perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. Let's focus on making sure you understand the basics. The policy is designed to help cover the costs of long-term care if you need assistance with activities like bathing, dressing, eating, or transferring – if you're unable to do those things on your own. We'll have to wait on the lab results to give you a clearer picture of your overall health. But while we wait, let me explain a little more about the benefits and limitations of your policy…
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds good. Just… try to keep it simple, alright? And… tell me what kind of care it covers. Like… if I can’t get around too well, can it help me get a nurse to come to my house? Or… if I need to go to a home, will it pay for that? I just wanna know what it actually does, if I need it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let's keep it simple. Your policy does cover both home healthcare and facility care. If you’re unable to get around well or need assistance with daily activities, it will pay for a nurse or home health aide to come to your house to provide assistance. The daily benefit amount is $200, which means that's the maximum amount it will pay per day for home care services. And if you need to go to a nursing home or assisted living facility, it will also cover the costs, up to the daily benefit amount. There are some limitations, of course. It doesn't cover the costs of room and board, but it will cover the costs of skilled nursing care, therapy, and other covered services. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: So it pays for the care, not the place itself? Just the people comin’ to help? And how long will it pay? Three years, you said? What if I need help for longer than that? I always worry about runnin’ out of money.
DOCTOR: You're exactly right. It covers the care itself – the cost of the nurses, aides, and therapists – but it doesn't cover the cost of room and board at a facility. And yes, the benefit period is three years. That means it will pay for covered services for up to three years. If you need care for longer than three years, the policy will stop paying after that period. That’s a valid concern about running out of money. If you anticipate needing care for longer than three years, you might consider purchasing a longer benefit period, or supplementing your care with other resources, like Medicare or Medicaid. We can discuss those options later, if you'd like. For now, let’s focus on your current health status and see what the lab results show. Do you have any other questions about the insurance policy at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. It’s a lot to take in, honestly. Just… thank you for explainin’ it so clearly. I still don’t understand everything, but I understand a little bit more than I did before. Is there anything else we need to do today? Or do we just wait for the results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. It is a lot to take in, and it's perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. I’m happy to answer any further questions you have as they arise. For now, we’ll just wait for the lab results. They should be back in a few days. I’ll give your daughter a call to let her know when they’re available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doc. You’ve been very patient with an old man like me. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rover. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, don't apologize for your age! I’m happy to help in any way I can. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
