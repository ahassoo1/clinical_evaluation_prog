DOCTOR: Hi San, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I need to get a card so I can keep driving folks around for those ride-share things… and taxis, I suppose. A commercial driver medical card, that’s what they call it, right? I want to make sure I’m still able to do it, and I need to get this all sorted out quickly if that's possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A commercial driver medical card – sometimes called a DOT physical – is what we’re looking at. I can definitely help with that. It is good you're being proactive about this. To get started, let’s go through some questions, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Ask away. I’m a pretty good driver, always have been, but I suppose it’s best to be sure everything is alright, you know? I’ve got a good memory, so I shouldn’t have any trouble remembering things for these questions. Let's just get it done quickly, if we can.
DOCTOR: Perfect! And that’s excellent, a good memory is a huge help. We’ll start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me a few years back, maybe five years ago? I take a little pill for it every day, keeps it under control. Otherwise, nothing major. I had a bit of trouble with arthritis in my knees for a while, but that’s just old age, I suppose. It doesn’t bother me too much these days. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. High blood pressure, managed with medication for about five years, and some arthritis in your knees that’s currently stable. We’ll definitely need to document that. And what medications specifically are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s a little white pill… oh! Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams. I take one every morning with my breakfast. I always make sure I don’t forget, it’s very important. And that's it. Just the Lisinopril.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily – noted. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing that I know of. I've eaten everything people put in front of me, and I haven’t had a bad reaction yet! I've never really been one for allergies, thankfully. I’m pretty lucky that way, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent! No known allergies. Alright, and have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, actually. A hysterectomy, many years ago. Probably… oh, goodness, maybe 30 years ago now? And I had my gallbladder out too, maybe 20 years ago. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. They were both… routine, I guess you could say. No problems afterwards.
DOCTOR: Okay, hysterectomy approximately 30 years ago, and gallbladder removal about 20 years ago – both without complications. Good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke…?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a bit of a tricky one. My mother had… I believe it was a stroke, yes, a long time ago. And my father had some sort of heart trouble when he got older. He wasn’t very good at taking care of himself, always smoking and eating rich foods. As for cancer… my aunt on my husband’s side had breast cancer, but that’s about all I can remember. We weren’t a very close family, you see. Things were… complicated. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. History of stroke in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and breast cancer in your husband's aunt. Okay, and just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My husband smoked for a while, but I always made sure he did it outside. Terrible habit, I always thought. And I certainly don’t drink much either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, that’s it. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No history of smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. Alright, San, I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, just to check your vital signs and do a general assessment. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, vision, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s perfectly alright. Get it over with quickly, if you would. I’ve got things to do, you know? But please, be gentle with my knees. They aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72, and temperature is normal. Your vision is 20/30 in your right eye and 20/25 in your left, with correction. That’s a little diminished, but still within acceptable limits for driving. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses. Your gait is steady, and your balance appears good. However, I do notice a slight stiffness in your knees when you walk. I'll make a note of that. Alright, San, all in all, everything looks pretty good. But I'd like to run a quick urinalysis, just to rule out any underlying issues. It's a standard part of the DOT physical. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, a urinalysis sounds fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. Honestly, I don’t understand why they need to do so much. I’ve been driving for years, and I’ve never had a problem. But if it’s what you need to do, go ahead. Just let me know when I can go.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s just standard procedure, and it's better to be thorough. I’ll give you a few minutes of privacy. The restroom is just down the hall to your right. Please bring the sample back when you’re ready. While we're waiting for the results, do you have any concerns or questions you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, no concerns. Just want to get this done quickly, really. I'm sure everything is fine. Just let me know when you have the results, and we can get this card sorted out. I've got a schedule to keep, you know. People are counting on me.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. I'll let you know as soon as the results are back. Alright, San, the urinalysis came back normal. No protein, glucose, or blood detected. Everything looks good on that front. Based on my examination and the urinalysis results, I can clear you to drive commercially. You’ve met all the requirements. Here’s your Medical Examiner’s Certificate. You’ll need to present this to your licensing agency to renew your commercial driver’s license. It’s valid for 24 months. Do you have any questions about the certificate or the renewal process?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! That’s excellent news. Thank goodness. No, I think I understand. Just present this to the licensing agency… 24 months… Yes, I can remember that. How much do I owe you? Let's get this over with quickly. I have places to be.
DOCTOR: The fee for the DOT physical is $125. Your insurance covers $75 of that, so your out-of-pocket cost is $50. You can pay with cash, credit, or debit card. I appreciate you coming in today, San, and I wish you safe travels! Do you have any remaining questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, that’s quite alright. Thank you, Doctor. You were very efficient, which I appreciate. I suppose that’s all. I really must be going now. People are counting on me, you know? Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. You have a safe day as well. And please, drive carefully! .
