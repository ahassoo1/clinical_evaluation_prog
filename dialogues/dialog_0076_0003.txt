DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Baide, yes. Eighty years old… Look, I'm Dr. Ruocco. Let's get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Tremor. That's what the nice lady on the phone said I was here for. Honestly, it’s not that bad. Just a little shake, you know? Gets worse when I try to… well, when I try to do things. Mostly. Though I can’t rightly remember what things, exactly. It’s probably nothing. Old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: "A little shake," right. And how long has this "little shake" been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Months, I suppose. Maybe longer. Time all blurs together, you know? I used to be able to hold a camera steady… directed some real pictures, I did. Now… not so much. It’s bothersome, that’s for sure. Mostly when I’m trying to… What was I saying?
DOCTOR: Right. Months. And when you say it gets worse when you "try to do things," can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Look, I used to make things happen, alright? Direct actors, set up shots… all that. It's hard to explain. It’s just… harder now. My hands… they wobble. Makes it difficult to… to point, mostly. Or hold things still. A cup, a script… anything. Honestly, it’s probably just nerves. I used to be a strong man. Still am, for all that.
DOCTOR: And has this tremor affected anything else?
PATIENT: Affected? What do you mean, “affected”? I haven't been climbing mountains, if that’s what you’re getting at. It makes me a bit clumsy, I suppose. Dropped a fork the other day. My wife… bless her heart… she used to pick it up for me. Never mind that. It's just… things aren't as easy as they used to be. You’re asking silly questions.
DOCTOR: Right. Clumsiness. Any difficulty with walking, or balance?
PATIENT: Walking? Balance? I get around just fine, thank you very much. I walk to the store, I walk around the house… I haven't fallen or anything, if that’s what you’re fishing for. Look, I’m a producer and director, not some… frail old man. I have things to do, you know. This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any stiffness in your muscles, or any pain associated with this tremor?
PATIENT: Pain? No. A little ache now and then, what do you expect? I’m eighty years old! Everything aches. It's not a pain, it's just… old age. And stiffness… maybe a little. Mostly in the mornings. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to it. I have more important things on my mind. Is this going to be much longer?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, goodness. Let me think. The little white pill for my… what was it now? Blood pressure, I think. And something for my… arthritis. Maybe. I don’t really keep track. My wife used to handle all that. Honestly, I just take what the doctors tell me to take. Medicare pays for it, so I don’t question it. It’s all a blur.
DOCTOR: Fine. Let's do a quick exam. Just to… rule things out. Raise your arms out to the sides.
