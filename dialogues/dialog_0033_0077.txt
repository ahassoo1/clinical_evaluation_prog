DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh? Good morning to you too, Doctor. They tell me I gotta come for check-up. Something about the mine, I think. Not feeling bad, though. Been working there a long time, you know. Long, long time. They just want to make sure… something.
DOCTOR: Right. A check-up. And this “mine”... is that your current employment?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! Still working. Underground. Heavy work. Been loading and moving things down there since… well, since before you were born, I expect. Not easy work, but a man’s gotta eat. They sent a paper, said I been breathing… something bad, maybe? Don't rightly remember all the words.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here… occupational exposure to silica dust. It’s a fairly common concern in mining. And you haven’t noticed any… shortness of breath, cough, or fatigue recently?
PATIENT: Silica… dust? Sounds fancy. No, Doctor, nothing like that. I breathe, I work, I eat, I sleep. Same as always. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just old age, isn't it? I ain’t a spring chicken anymore, you know. Still strong though, for my age!
DOCTOR: Right. And how long have you been working in the mine, specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. A long time. Very long. I came here from Nigeria when I was… oh, maybe twenty years old? And started at the mine soon after that. So… sixty years? More than sixty years, I reckon. It's hard to keep track when you’re busy working. A lifetime, really.
DOCTOR: Sixty years… That is a considerable exposure. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never touched the stuff. Bad for you, you know. My wife, God rest her soul, she always said so. And she was right about most things. A waste of money, too. No, I’ve always been a clean liver. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of lung problems – bronchitis, emphysema, anything like that?
PATIENT: Lung problems… hmmm. My brother, he had some trouble breathing towards the end. But he was a fisherman, always out in the cold sea air. Never worked in a mine. And my mother… she just got old, you know? Things wear out. Not really lung problems, just… age. I don't think anyone in my family worked in a dusty place like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given the length of your exposure, we should perform a quick lung function test, just to get a baseline. And I’d like to listen to your lungs as well. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Lung function test… sounds complicated. Listen to my lungs? Like with a… a stethoscope? Is it gonna hurt? I don't like being poked and prodded. But… alright. If you have to. Just be quick about it. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll just sit here, I’ll start with the stethoscope. It won’t hurt a bit. Just breathe normally. Deep breath in… and out…
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Deep breath… like this? Used to a lot of dust, you know. Always have been. Don’t think a little listening will tell you much.
DOCTOR: Okay. I am hearing some mild wheezing, particularly on exhalation. And your breathing sounds a bit… diminished overall. It’s not alarming, but it does warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Wheezing? Diminished? What does that mean? Sounds bad. I told you, I've been working in that mine for sixty years! Dust is part of the job. A little wheezing is to be expected, isn't it? You can't expect a man to work in dust for sixty years and not have a bit of trouble breathing! Is this going to cost me extra money?
DOCTOR: It means we need to rule out any chronic lung damage. We’ll need a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test to get a clearer picture. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's standard procedure given your occupation and length of exposure. As for cost… that will depend on your insurance coverage. We can have the billing department look into that for you. Now, let's schedule those tests.
PATIENT: Insurance… always the insurance. Fine. X-ray and… pulmonary… whatever. But I'm not sitting around all day waiting. I have things to do, you know. And if it turns out to be nothing, I expect a full refund. And don’t try to charge me extra for breathing in dust for sixty years! It’s ridiculous. Just schedule the tests, quickly.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ve scheduled you for a chest X-ray and pulmonary function test at the imaging center across the street. They’re expecting you in an hour. The results will be sent to my office, and we’ll review them together next week. Here’s the appointment information. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: An hour? Hmmph. Fine. Next week? That’s a long time to wait when you're worried about your lungs. No, I don't think so. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long next week, Doctor. I’ve got a life to live, you know. A long life, hopefully. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I need to go find that imaging center.
