DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's nice to meet you too, Doctor. I... just moved here. For my job. I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor? It’s… something about Medicare? I don't really know how it all works around here.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. Getting settled in a new place can be a bit overwhelming, and Medicare can definitely be confusing. We can absolutely get you set up as a new patient and go over everything. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. Before we dive into the paperwork, is there anything specific that prompted you to schedule this appointment today, or are you just getting established with a primary care physician?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay, good. I'm glad. Um… no, nothing specific. I don't… I don’t really feel sick, if that makes sense? Just… what you do when you move, right? Like, check-up and stuff? I think my husband said something about that. He usually handles all this.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Emileigh. A wellness check-up is an excellent idea when you’re new to an area. It's good preventative care. Okay, well, let’s start with a little bit of background information then. Just to get a good picture of your overall health. I see here you're 21 years old, and your height and weight are noted as 150cm and 82kg, is that correct?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, I think so. Those numbers sound right. I haven't… checked in a while, to be honest. It’s been a bit busy with the move and everything.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable. No worries at all. Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I… don't think so? Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. My husband says I should probably write those things down, but… I forget.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Emileigh. We can work through it together. It’s common to not have a list readily available. Okay, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… just a multivitamin, sometimes. The kind my grandma used to take. And… sometimes ibuprofen, if my head hurts. That's it, I think. I don’t really like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Good to know. Now, thinking about your medical history – have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… no, not that I know of. I went to the doctor when I was little, for shots and stuff, but… nothing serious. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. My husband always says I'm a tough cookie.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Emileigh. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No… no surgeries. And I don't think I've ever been in the hospital. Not even when I was a kid. Just… a few stitches once, when I fell off my bike. But that's it. It wasn't a big deal.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, just a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, grandparents, siblings – has any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… that’s… hard. My mom’s side, I don’t really know. She… she didn’t talk much about her family. My dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. And his mom… she had something with her heart. But I don’t really remember what. It was a long time ago. I’m sorry, I wish I knew more.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s common not to have a complete family medical history. Knowing what you do is helpful. We can also sometimes look into resources to help with that if you're interested down the line. Okay, last few questions for now. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… um… I work a lot, mostly. I’m a mechanical engineering technician. It’s… a desk job, mostly, but sometimes I have to go out and check things. I don’t really have much time for hobbies, to be honest. I like to read, when I can. And… I try to eat healthy, but it’s hard when you’re busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mechanical engineering technician, primarily desk work, some travel, and you try to maintain a healthy diet. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. No smoking. I don't really like the smell. And… I don’t drink much. Maybe a glass of wine on special occasions. Definitely no drugs. My husband doesn’t like those either.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good to know, Emileigh. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… good. Whatever you need to do. Is it going to be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: Not at all uncomfortable, Emileigh. It's pretty standard. I’ll just be listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, looking in your ears and throat, and feeling your abdomen. It shouldn't take long. First, let's check your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Okay. I hope I'm not going to faint. My blood pressure is usually okay, I think… but I get nervous at doctors.
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Emileigh, we'll take it slowly. Just try to relax and breathe normally. It's perfectly normal to feel a little nervous. Okay… your blood pressure is 128 over 76. That’s within the normal range. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Could you take a deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly?
PATIENT: Okay… is everything okay? It sounds… weird when you listen to my chest.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds clear, Emileigh. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. It does sound a little strange when you listen with the stethoscope, that's perfectly normal. It's just the sound of your breathing and your heart beating. Now, I'm going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Could you please open your mouth and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Ah… is something wrong? My ears have been a little itchy lately.
DOCTOR: Your ears look a little dry, Emileigh, which could be causing the itchiness. It's not anything serious. We can talk about some over-the-counter solutions for that later. Your throat looks clear as well. Now, I'm just going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… a little tender. I had a really bad stomach ache last week. It’s better now, but… it still feels a little sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, I notice some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, Emileigh. Just to be sure, can you describe the stomach ache you had last week?
PATIENT: Um… it was… a really sharp pain. In my lower stomach, on the right side. It came and went, but when it was there, it hurt a lot. I just… laid in bed and tried to sleep it off. I didn't want to bother you. It went away after a couple of days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emileigh. That sounds like it could be a number of things. Given the location and the sharp pain, it's important to rule out any potential issues. Just to be cautious, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a urine analysis. These tests will help us get a better understanding of what might have caused the pain. Do you have any known kidney issues or a history of urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: No. No kidney problems. And… I don't think so. I had a bladder infection once, a long time ago, when I was a teenager. But that was years ago. It didn't feel like that this time. It was… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. It sounds like it might not be related. I'll go ahead and order those tests for you. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. In the meantime, do you have any other symptoms – like fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: No. No fever. I haven’t been sick. And… no, nothing like that. Everything’s been pretty normal, besides my stomach. I was really worried I was getting something bad.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Emileigh. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, I don't suspect anything serious, but it's always best to be thorough. We'll get the lab results back within a few days. Once we have those, we can discuss the next steps, if any are needed. For now, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids and eating a healthy diet. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like high fever, severe abdominal pain, or difficulty breathing, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t think so. You explained everything really well. I was… really nervous at first, but you made me feel a lot better. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I'll just… wait for the test results then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. I'm glad I could help ease your worries. Yes, just wait for the test results, and the nurse will contact you when they’re available. In the meantime, if you think of anything else, don't hesitate to call the clinic. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect the urine sample. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Dashevsky. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
