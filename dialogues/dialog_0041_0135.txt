DOCTOR: Good morning, Gerhard. I’m Dr. Polczynski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is good to meet you too. I have… problem with my ear. It is… leaking. A little bit. I notice it yesterday.
DOCTOR: Okay, leaking from your ear, you said you noticed it yesterday. Hmm. Can you tell me a bit more about the leaking?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… clear liquid. Not blood. And not… much. Just a few drops. When I move my head, maybe more come out. It does not hurt, but it feels… strange. Like something is wet inside. I try to clean it with cloth, but… it keep coming.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear liquid, not a lot, more when you move your head, and feels wet inside. No pain, just a strange sensation. That’s helpful. Have you had any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain. No fever. I can hear okay. Maybe a little… muffled, but I think is just because of the… wetness. No dizziness. I eat good. Sleep good. Just this ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms like pain, fever, dizziness, or changes in hearing other than a little muffling. Just the ear leaking. Have you had any ear problems before, Gerhard?
PATIENT: Yes. When I was young, maybe ten years old, I have… infection in ear. Very bad. I remember doctor give me drops. And it get better. But this… this is different. Not sore like before. Just leak. And I have not been to doctor for ear since then. Long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood ear infection, treated with drops. And this feels different – no pain, just the leaking. That's good to know. Do you recall any injury to your head or ear recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No injury. I work at the college, teaching. I sit at desk mostly. I walk to the bus, but… nothing fall on my head. No bump. No hit. I am careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent injury. Let's take a look at your ear, if that's alright with you. I'll use an otoscope to get a better view. Just lean your head forward a bit.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is okay. I lean forward. Please be gentle. I do not like things in my ear. Is… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Okay. I see some fluid behind your ear drum, and the drum itself looks a little… dull. It’s not ruptured, thankfully, but there’s definitely something going on. It's hard to say exactly what without a little more information. Do you have any allergies, Gerhard?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think… No, I do not think so. Not to food. Not to medicine. I have… sensitive skin, sometimes. But not allergies. I never take anything for allergies. I have never had allergies, I think. My wife… she has allergies. But not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you mentioned sensitive skin, but no allergic reactions. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take medicine. I try to stay healthy. Just vitamins, sometimes. Multivitamins. But not every day. Only when I feel… weak. Maybe one week every month. Is small pill. That is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, just occasional multivitamins. And no other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I am healthy man. I walk every day. I eat vegetables. I drink water. I have… little bit high blood pressure, the doctor tell me last year. But I do not take pills for it. He say I can watch my salt. And I do. I try to. Is hard. But I try.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, managed with diet. That’s good that you're being proactive about it. Now, let's talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family with ear problems, hearing loss, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Let me think… My mother, she have trouble hearing when she get very old. Very, very old. But not before. My brother, he have… ringing in ear sometimes. But he work with loud machines. I think is from the machines. No one else. Not that I remember. My father, he have good ears. He could hear everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, your mother had hearing loss in old age, and your brother has ringing related to his work. Good to know. Now, just one or two more questions. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never smoke. And I do not drink alcohol. Not anymore. I used to drink… a little beer, when I was younger. But not now. Is not good for the blood pressure, the doctor say. So I stop. Long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol. That’s excellent. Alright, Gerhard, based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve seen in your ear, it sounds like you may have a middle ear effusion – fluid buildup behind the ear drum. The fact that it's not painful, and you haven’t had any injury, suggests it’s not a ruptured drum. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a tympanometry test. It's a quick, painless test that measures how well your ear drum moves. It will help us determine the cause of the fluid buildup. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is okay. Tympa… what did you call it? Is not painful? You said it is not painful. And quick? I have bus to catch later. I need to go back to college. But if you think is important, I will do the test. Is good to know what is wrong. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, tympanometry. It’s completely painless, and only takes a few minutes. We have a technician who can do it right here in the clinic. It involves placing a small probe in your ear – similar to what I did, but it doesn’t go as deep. While we wait for the results, I'm going to prescribe a nasal decongestant. Sometimes congestion in your sinuses can contribute to fluid buildup in the middle ear. It won’t cure the problem, but it may help with the symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is okay. Nasal… decon… gestant? Is a pill? Or drops? And it is for my nose? Is good to try anything to help. I want to get better. I have students to teach. I do not want to miss class. So yes, please give me the pill. Or drops. Whatever is best. And thank you, Doctor. You are very helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's a nasal spray, actually. It helps to open up your nasal passages. It won’t interact with your blood pressure, but do follow the instructions carefully. I’ll have the nurse print those out for you. Let me see if the technician is ready for the tympanometry test. "Maria, are you available to do a tympanometry for Gerhard Radillo?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. I will wait for the nurse with the instructions. And thank you again, Doctor. You have been very patient with me. Is good to have someone who listen. Is very important.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gerhard. It's my job to listen. And you're a good patient, taking things in stride. Maria, if you could take Gerhard back to room 3 for the tympanometry test, please. I'll be right in to review the results with him once they’re available. Alright, Gerhard, go ahead with Maria, and we'll get this sorted out. We’ll see what the test shows, and go from there. Don’t hesitate to let me or Maria know if you have any questions. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Is good. I will go with Maria now. I will see you soon. Bye bye to you too.
