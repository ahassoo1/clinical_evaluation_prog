DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. Now, Ms. Geho, I understand you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, the nurse told me some blood work showed my cholesterol is a little high. Hyper… something? I don’t really remember all the words, to be honest. It just sounded… not good. I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia, yes. It’s… quite common, frankly. Though “a little high” is a rather imprecise description, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is! I apologize. I tend to gloss over details sometimes. I just remember the nurse looking a bit worried and saying I needed to see someone about it. Do you need the actual numbers? I think they sent those over with the referral. Perhaps you have them there?
DOCTOR: Yes, thankfully, they did. Total cholesterol 245… HDL 42… LDL 160. Triglycerides are… acceptable, at 150. Hmm. Yes, well. The LDL is… elevated. And the HDL is less than ideal. Do you have any family history of heart disease or high cholesterol, Ms. Geho?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Those numbers… they don’t sound good, do they? Let me think… my father, he had some heart problems later in life. He had a blockage, I think. Needed a… a stent? Something like that. And my mother… she was always a bit overweight, and I think the doctor warned her about her cholesterol too, but she didn’t really take it seriously. She passed away a few years ago, so I don’t have all the details. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It’s… relevant. Though family history is only a piece of the puzzle. And your mother's… lack of compliance is… unfortunate. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My father always said they were terrible for you, and I listened! I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe three or four times a week. But I don’t drink heavily, if that makes a difference. I also try to eat fairly well, lots of vegetables… though I do have a sweet tooth, I’ll admit. Chocolate is my weakness!
DOCTOR: Wine… and chocolate. Yes. Those are… factors. And your activity level?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn't say I'm a marathon runner! I'm an aerospace engineer, so I spend most of my day at a desk, to be honest. But I do try to walk at least 30 minutes most days. I live near a park, which is nice. And I enjoy gardening in the summer. That’s a good bit of bending and lifting, if it counts! I used to take a yoga class, but I haven't been since… well, since the pandemic, really. It's just been hard to get back into it. Is walking enough, do you think?
DOCTOR: It’s a start. Though, frankly, Ms. Geho, your lifestyle… could use improvement. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure. Nothing extensive. Please, if you’d be so kind, lie down.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Yes, of course. I understand. I’m not exactly the healthiest person, I suppose. . But I’m willing to try! Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. Is there a gown I should put on?
DOCTOR: No, no gown is necessary. Just your clothing is fine. Heart sounds are… regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90. Not ideal, naturally. It confirms my initial assessment.
PATIENT: Oh. A murmur? That doesn’t sound good, does it? I didn’t know I had a murmur. And 140/90… what is ideal, exactly? Is that very high? I always get a little anxious when I hear numbers like that. I'm probably worrying over nothing. Should we be running more tests, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s a benign murmur, most likely. Though we’ll need to rule out anything more serious. And 140/90 is… elevated. Ideally, it should be below 120/80. Now, before we launch into a cascade of unnecessary tests, let’s consider lifestyle modifications. A low-fat diet, regular exercise – at least 30 minutes most days – and weight management. We can revisit testing if there’s no improvement. I'll write you a referral to a registered dietician, and a prescription for a low-dose statin to get things under control.
PATIENT: A statin? Is that… a medication? I was hoping to avoid medication if possible. Are there any side effects? And a dietician sounds good. I'm just… worried about changing my entire diet. I do enjoy my food! But if it's necessary… I suppose I can try. What kind of exercises do you recommend besides walking? I'm not very coordinated, I'm afraid. And can you explain what a statin does, exactly? In simple terms, please. I don't understand all the medical jargon.
DOCTOR: A statin, Ms. Geho, lowers your cholesterol. It inhibits an enzyme in the liver that produces cholesterol. It’s quite effective, though muscle aches are a common side effect. We’ll monitor you closely. As for exercise… swimming is low-impact. And gardening, which you already do, is beneficial. It’s about consistency, not intensity. Now, the referral and prescription will be sent electronically to your pharmacy. I expect you to follow the dietician’s recommendations and adhere to the medication regimen. A follow-up appointment in three months to assess your progress. Do you have any further questions… before I attend to my other patients?
PATIENT: Three months… alright. That sounds… manageable. Muscle aches… that's a little concerning, but I can talk to the dietician about good sources of protein to help with that, perhaps? And is there anything I should be looking out for specifically when I start the statin? Any warning signs I should be aware of? I suppose I should probably read the information leaflet that comes with it as well. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. I appreciate it. I just… don’t like the thought of being on medication long-term. .
DOCTOR: Read the leaflet. And report any unexplained muscle pain or weakness immediately. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
