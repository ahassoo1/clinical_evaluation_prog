DOCTOR: Hi Jailenne, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Condray, nice to meet you too! Um, well, I’ve just been getting chills, and it’s a little weird. It’s not like a fever chill, you know? Just… cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, "just cold"... I understand. Not a feverish chill, more of a general coldness. How long have you been experiencing these chills, Jailenne?
PATIENT: Hmm, probably about three days now? It started off and on, and now it seems to be… pretty much constant. Not terrible, but definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Three days, and increasing in frequency. Alright. And are you experiencing anything else along with the chills?
PATIENT: Let me think… No fever, like I said. I haven’t really had a cough or a sore throat. Maybe a little tired, but honestly, I’ve been a bit stressed lately with… stuff. So that could be it. I guess no other symptoms really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no cough, no sore throat. Fatigue, which you attribute to stress – that’s good to consider. When you say “tired,” is it just feeling run-down, or is it more of an overwhelming exhaustion?
PATIENT: It's more just… run-down, yeah. I can still do things, you know? I went to work today, and I did my usual. But when I get home, I just… collapse on the couch. It doesn’t take much. Not like I’m completely wiped out all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, so functional fatigue, meaning it doesn't completely disable you, but you're quicker to feel worn out. Have you noticed any muscle aches or joint pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No aches or anything like that. Honestly, that’s why I didn’t rush to the doctor right away. It’s just the chills and the tiredness, which, like I said, could be stress. But then it just… kept happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No muscle aches or joint pain. It's smart to get it checked out even if it could be stress. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, nothing chronic. I had the usual childhood stuff, like chickenpox, but I haven’t really been sick with anything serious. I try to eat healthy and exercise when I can. Just a normal, healthy person, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. No prior chronic medical conditions. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never had surgery or been in the hospital. Knock on wood!
DOCTOR: Excellent. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat whatever, take most medications without issue. My mom always worried I wasn’t allergic to anything because I didn’t react to anything!
DOCTOR: That’s good news. No known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, that’s it. And occasionally, if I get a headache, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that's it. Really basic.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Alright, that’s helpful. Before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Um, okay. My mom's side, they have… high blood pressure, I think? And my dad, he had diabetes, but he was older when he got it. Nothing too serious on either side, really. No major cancers or anything like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure on your mother’s side, diabetes in your father, developing later in life. Good to know. And lastly, before the exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a health education specialist, so I'm on my feet a lot during the day. I live alone, but I try to stay active when I can. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially – maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat healthy, like I said, but sometimes it's hard with work and everything. I guess that's it!
DOCTOR: Okay, a health education specialist, active job, no smoking, social drinking, trying to maintain a healthy diet. That’s all very helpful, Jailenne. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, absolutely. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if anything feels… weird.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your temperature. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit – normal. I’m going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular. Blood pressure is 120/80 – normal. Lastly, I'm going to briefly examine your throat and check your lymph nodes. Throat appears normal, no signs of infection. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Everything appears normal so far, Jailenne. However, the persistent chills warrant further investigation. Based on your symptoms and the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… good to hear it's something normal, but also, a little concerning that you need to consider things. What kind of possibilities are we talking about? I’m a little worried now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It's good that you're asking. While the physical exam didn't reveal anything obvious, persistent chills can be caused by a few things. The most common is a viral infection, even without a fever or other typical symptoms. We also need to consider things like thyroid issues, although you don’t have any other symptoms that point to that right now. Less commonly, it could be a sign of something more serious, though that’s less likely. To rule things out and get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. The CBC will check for signs of infection, and the TSH test will assess your thyroid function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds… sensible. If you think that’s what we should do. A blood test sounds fine. I’d rather know what’s going on than just keep worrying about it. Will I need a special order or something for that?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, I agree, it's best to be thorough. I’ll write you an order for the CBC and TSH tests right now. You can go to the lab here at the clinic, and they’ll draw the blood. They'll need your insurance information, of course. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Here’s the form. Once you have the results, you can either schedule a follow-up appointment with me, or you can call the office, and we can discuss them over the phone, whichever you prefer. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and continuing to monitor your symptoms. If you develop a fever, severe headache, body aches, or shortness of breath, please seek medical attention immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. Rest, fluids, keep an eye out for anything worse. And get the results back to you. Okay, I think I can handle that. Thank you, Dr. Condray. I appreciate you taking the time to figure out what might be going on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I’m glad I could help. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. I’m here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Get some rest, Jailenne. Have a good day!
