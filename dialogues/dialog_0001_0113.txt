DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor… it’s this… going to the bathroom. Too much. That’s what my wife, bless her heart, says I need to talk about. It’s just… frequent, you know? I go, and then not long after, I gotta go again. It’s a nuisance, really. I don't know what's changed.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, frequent. It’s… bothersome. Especially when I’m trying to get things done around the farm. Can’t be running back and forth all day. Though, to be honest, I haven’t really been doing much on the farm lately. My boy, he handles most of it now. Good boy, but… well, never mind. It’s the going, you understand? Not the farm work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so… it’s just the frequency?
PATIENT: Just the frequency, I think. Though… now that you mention it, sometimes it feels like it doesn’t all come out. Like there’s a little bit left. But maybe that’s just my imagination. Old men, you know… things don't work like they used to. I don’t make a fuss about it.
DOCTOR: Right. Any pain or burning when you go?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. A little… discomfort, maybe. More of a… a weak feeling, like it takes effort. And sometimes, just a little… urgency. Like I gotta go right now. It's not pleasant, I’ll tell ya. But I wouldn’t call it pain.
DOCTOR: And how much are you drinking in a day?
PATIENT: Drinking? Oh, not much. A cup of coffee with breakfast, maybe a glass of water with lunch. I don’t go for those fancy sodas, and I rarely touch alcohol. My wife makes me drink tea sometimes. Says it's good for my… insides. But mostly, just not much drinking. Never have been one for it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any fever, chills, or blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Goodness, no! Never seen any blood. And fever… hmm. I haven’t taken my temperature, but I don’t feel feverish. Just… tired, you know? Old age, mostly. Chills… well, it gets cold in the house sometimes, but that's just the draft. I don't think I’ve had a proper chill in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s just have a quick feel of your abdomen. Just gonna press here and here… Does that bother you at all?
PATIENT: Oh, poking around, are we? Well, it’s… a little tender, right there. But I’ve always been a little tender there, honestly. Probably just… old age again. Don't press too hard, doctor. Bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And I’m just listening here… anything else bothering you?
PATIENT: No, no… just this going all the time. It's a right nuisance, I tell ya. It interrupts everything. Can’t even enjoy a peaceful afternoon without having to think about it. And my wife… well, she means well, but she’s always asking about it. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it could be a number of things. Prostate issues are common at your age, and that tenderness could indicate some swelling. It also could be an infection, or even just some changes with age. I’m gonna order a urinalysis, just to rule out an infection. And I’d like to check your prostate with a quick exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A… a what-alysis? And check my… my prostate? Well, I don’t know about all that poking around, doctor. Sounds… invasive. Are you sure that's necessary? Can’t we just… try something else first? Maybe less tea?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Segretto, I’m a doctor. I need to do a proper examination to figure out what’s going on. The urinalysis is simple—just a urine sample. And the prostate exam… it’s quick, and it will give us a lot of information. It’s not ideal, I agree, but it’s important. If you want to know what’s causing this, we need to do these tests. I wouldn’t recommend them if they weren’t necessary. Now, can we please get a urine sample?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose. If you insist. Doctors these days… always poking and prodding. I just want to be able to sit down and watch my stories without having to run to the bathroom every five minutes. Alright, alright. Where do I go for this… sample? And please, try to be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Down the hall, first door on the left. There’s a little cup in there. Just collect a sample and bring it back to me. And honestly, it will be quick. It’s not like I enjoy doing these things. Now, go ahead. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But if this takes all day, I’m blaming you, doctor. Honestly… the things you have to do to get a little peace and quiet.
