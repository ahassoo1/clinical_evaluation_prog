DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… alright. Honestly, I don’t really need anything. My daughter, she insisted I come. Said I needed… what did she call it? A note. From a real doctor. For… encouragement. It’s a bit silly, if you ask me. But here I am.
DOCTOR: I see. A note for encouragement, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. She says I’ve been… down. A little bit sad, she thinks. Though I don’t see it. It’s just… life, you know? Things happen. You get older, things ache, people disappoint you. It doesn’t mean you need a doctor’s permission to feel normal. But she’s very persistent, that one. And she worries too much. A note will just… indulge her, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Micucci. It’s very thoughtful of your daughter to be concerned, and it's perfectly reasonable for her to want to ensure you're feeling your best. Even if it's simply for peace of mind. To be thorough, and to write that note accurately, would you mind if I asked you a few questions about how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Questions. Like I haven’t already explained everything. But… fine. Ask away, I suppose. Just don't expect me to spend all day on this. I have things to do, you know. A garden doesn’t weed itself. And truthfully, I don’t really feel like talking about my feelings to a stranger. But if it gets my daughter off my back… go on.
DOCTOR: Of course. I certainly won’t take up too much of your time, and you don’t need to share anything you’re uncomfortable with. Let's start with this: when you say “things happen,” could you tell me a little more about what those “things” are?
PATIENT: Well… mostly it’s just the usual. My husband, he’s getting older too, naturally. His knees, they bother him terribly. And he used to be such a strong man. It’s… hard to see him slow down. And then there’s the neighbors. Always complaining about something. The garden, the noise, even the way I look at them, apparently. It’s exhausting, honestly. A person can’t have a little bit of peace anymore. And my son, he doesn’t call as often as he used to. Though, what can you expect? He’s busy with his life, I suppose. It’s just… a lot. It adds up.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're carrying a significant emotional weight, Ms. Micucci. Dealing with your husband's health, difficult neighbors, and a son who is occupied with his own life… that is a lot to manage. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite lately?
PATIENT: Oh, changes? Well, I sleep alright, I think. Maybe not as soundly as before. I wake up a couple of times during the night, usually thinking about… things. The garden mostly. What needs to be done. And my appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I’m ravenous, others I can barely eat a thing. It depends. If I’m upset about something, I don’t really feel like eating, naturally. Food just… doesn’t appeal to me. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t see what this has to do with a note for my daughter. I’m a practical woman. I just need a signature. A few kind words, perhaps. Not a life story.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask, Ms. Micucci. It may seem like I’m asking a lot of questions for a simple note, but understanding how these things are affecting you helps me ensure I write something truly supportive for your daughter. It also helps me to rule out anything that might be contributing to how you're feeling. You mentioned waking up during the night, thinking about the garden. Do you find yourself worrying about things often?
PATIENT: Worrying? Of course I worry! Who doesn’t worry? I worry about the garden, if it will rain, if the tomatoes will ripen before the frost. I worry about my husband, if he's comfortable, if he's taking his medicine. I worry about my son, if he's alright. I worry about the neighbors… well, you get the picture. It’s just… life, Doctor. It’s always something. A good woman worries. It means she cares. And frankly, I’m not sure what you’re getting at. Are you suggesting I'm not alright? Because I assure you, I'm perfectly fine. Just… a bit tired, perhaps. And annoyed. Mostly annoyed.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you are a very caring person, Ms. Micucci, and it’s perfectly normal to feel worried when you have so much on your mind. I’m not suggesting you’re not alright, but I am trying to get a complete picture of how you've been feeling so I can write the most helpful note possible. Would you mind if I asked about your energy levels throughout the day?
PATIENT: Energy levels? Honestly, Doctor. Now you’re just fishing. Of course my energy levels are low! I’m sixty years old. And I spend all day tending to a garden, cooking for my husband, and generally keeping things running. What did you expect? I'm not a spring chicken anymore. I get tired. I rest when I need to. It’s common sense. Honestly, I’m starting to think your questions are rather insulting. Are you suggesting I’m incapable of taking care of myself? Because I assure you, I am perfectly capable. I’ve been running a household for forty years, thank you very much. I just want a note, Doctor. A simple note for my daughter. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, please allow me to apologize if my questions feel insulting. That is absolutely not my intention. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, I am not questioning your capability in any way. You’ve clearly been a very strong and capable woman for many years. I’m asking these questions because sometimes, when people are feeling overwhelmed or carrying a lot of weight, their energy levels can change, and it's helpful to understand how that might be affecting them. It doesn't mean you're not strong or capable – it simply means we’re trying to be thorough. To put your mind at ease, and to get closer to simply writing that note for your daughter, let's shift gears. Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight, either gaining or losing?
PATIENT: Oh, so now you want to talk about my weight? Honestly! This is getting ridiculous. It comes and goes, naturally. Some years I’m a bit heavier, some years I’m a bit lighter. It depends on the weather, what I’m cooking, and frankly, whether I’m upset or not. When I’m stressed, I don’t eat as much. When I’m happy, I indulge a little. It’s a natural thing. Really, Doctor, I don't see what this has to do with anything. I just want a note! A few kind words about how I'm a good wife and mother. Is that so much to ask? I think I’m starting to regret coming here. It’s just making me more upset. And frankly, I have things to do. The tomatoes aren’t going to weed themselves, you know. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, you are absolutely right. It seems I’m causing you more distress than comfort, and that is the last thing I want to do. It’s clear you are a strong and capable woman, and I apologize for pressing you with questions that are upsetting you. Let’s do this. I can certainly write a note to your daughter acknowledging the challenges you’re facing and expressing my respect for your strength and resilience. Would that be acceptable?
