DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been bothering me. Specifically when I lie down flat. It feels… difficult. Like there's something heavy on my chest. I wanted to get it checked, if you don’t mind. I do hope this won't take too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Maribeth. We’ll get to the bottom of this. It’s good you came in to have it checked. Difficulty breathing is never something to ignore. And I assure you, we’ll move at a pace that’s comfortable for you. So, you mentioned it’s particularly troublesome when you lie flat. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been developing gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I believe. It wasn’t… overnight, no. Maybe the last few months? It started with just needing an extra pillow, and now… well, now it’s hard to sleep without being propped up quite a bit. It’s… inconvenient, mostly. I do try to get a good eight hours, you see. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It absolutely is important, Maribeth. Eight hours is a good goal. So, over the last few months, progressing from needing an extra pillow to now needing to be quite propped up to sleep comfortably. Aside from the difficulty and needing to be propped up, have you noticed any other symptoms with this?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, sometimes my ankles swell a bit in the evenings. Not terribly, but I do notice it. And… I get tired easily. More easily than I used to, anyway. I used to walk every morning, but now… just getting around the house feels like a lot sometimes. Is that related, do you think? I don’t want to bother you with too many details.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t hesitate to share anything that might be relevant. That’s exactly what I’m here for. Swelling in your ankles and increased fatigue are definitely things we should consider. Okay. And do you experience any coughing or wheezing with this breathing difficulty?
PATIENT: No, not really. No coughing. And no… wheezing, I don’t think. It’s not like a sickness, you see. It’s more… a feeling of pressure. A heaviness, like I said. It’s hard to explain. I haven't been sick, not a cold or anything, for a very long time. Does that make sense? I hope I'm being clear.
DOCTOR: You’re being perfectly clear, Maribeth. It’s helpful to know it’s not associated with any sickness symptoms like a cough or wheeze. A feeling of pressure and heaviness is a good way to describe it. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you been experiencing any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Not at all. Just the pressure, like something is sitting on me. It’s not a sharp pain, or anything like that. More… uncomfortable. It doesn't radiate, if that’s what you mean? I don’t get it in my arm, or my neck. And my heart feels… normal, I suppose. I haven’t noticed anything different with my heart. I did have a checkup last year, and everything was fine then.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the lack of chest pain, and that it doesn’t radiate. And it’s helpful that you had a checkup last year with normal findings. Okay, Maribeth, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions that I should be aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, I was told years ago I had slightly high blood pressure, but it wasn’t anything serious. The doctor said to watch my salt intake, so I do. I haven’t been formally diagnosed with anything else, no. And no diabetes, I don’t think. My husband… well, my former husband, he had diabetes, but I haven’t. I try to eat healthy. Mostly. I used to garden, you see, and that kept me active. Is that important? I haven’t been gardening lately, though.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re mindful of your salt intake and that you haven’t been formally diagnosed with any other conditions. And yes, your past activity level is relevant. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. That was… a long time ago. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist, but that was just an overnight stay. Otherwise, no. I’ve been quite lucky, really. I don't get sick easily, you know. I try to stay healthy. Is this taking too long? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. You’re doing great, Maribeth. It’s good to know about the gallbladder removal and the broken wrist. Now, regarding your family history – are there any heart conditions, lung problems, or other significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She was always tired. And my brother, he had… emphysema, I believe. He smoked, you see. A lot. I’ve never smoked, thank goodness. My father was healthy as a horse, though. Really. He lived to be 90. It’s… a bit of a mixed bag, really. Is that helpful? I hope I’m not rambling.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Maribeth. Knowing about your mother’s weak heart and your brother’s emphysema is important information. It doesn't sound like you've ever smoked, which is excellent. And finally, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a baby aspirin, every day. The doctor told me to start taking it years ago, for my heart. And sometimes, if my arthritis acts up, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s it. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if you don't mind. Is that all you need to know? I really do hope this won't take much longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a baby aspirin daily and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. That's good to know. Thank you for all that information, Maribeth. That gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your ankles to see if there’s any swelling. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I do have that appointment later, you see. But yes, please, go ahead. I’ll just… sit here, I presume? Is there a place to put my purse? It’s getting heavy on my lap.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please, have a seat. And yes, there’s a hook on the back of the chair for your purse. We'll move as efficiently as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally, in and out. Okay. I’m hearing a slightly rapid heartbeat, but otherwise, your heart sounds regular. Your lungs sound a little diminished in some areas, but I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, let me check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 86. That’s not dramatically high, but we'll want to monitor that. Finally, let me feel your ankles. I do feel some mild swelling in both ankles. And it does pit when I press on it. This is consistent with what you told me about noticing swelling in the evenings.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that… bad? The swelling, I mean. And the elevated blood pressure. I do try to watch my salt, you know. My mother… she had high blood pressure, too. Is it something serious? I hope I haven’t brought you any trouble. I just want to get back to my normal routine, if you don’t mind. And I really do need to get to my appointment later.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Maribeth. You haven’t brought me any trouble at all. It’s good you’re proactive about your health and that you're mindful of your salt intake. The mild swelling in your ankles, the slightly elevated blood pressure, and the diminished breath sounds, along with your report of needing to prop yourself up to sleep, are all things that could be related. It’s possible you’re developing some early signs of heart failure. Now, don't panic – that doesn’t mean your heart is suddenly failing. But it does mean we need to investigate further to understand what’s going on. It’s often a gradual process, and catching it early is the best thing we can do. Would you be comfortable with me ordering some blood tests and a chest X-ray to get a better look?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Heart failure? That sounds… frightening. My mother… she had a lot of trouble with her heart. But I feel… fine, mostly. Just tired, and a little short of breath when I lie down. Blood tests and an X-ray… yes, I suppose. If it will help. But… will it take long? And will it involve a lot of… poking and prodding? I do try to avoid medical procedures, if you don’t mind. And I really do need to make my appointment later. What kind of blood tests? Will they draw a lot? I get nervous, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Maribeth. It’s natural to feel anxious when you hear something like “heart failure,” but as I said, catching it early is the key. We are simply investigating to see what is causing your symptoms, and it doesn't necessarily mean you have severe heart failure. The blood tests are fairly routine. We'll check your kidney function, your electrolytes, and a few markers that can help us assess your heart health. It will be a standard arm draw, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. It shouldn't take long - about 10-15 minutes for the draw itself. The chest X-ray is also quick and painless. It doesn’t involve any poking or prodding. You'll just stand in front of the machine while a technician takes a picture of your lungs. The lab is right down the hall, and the radiology department is on the second floor. We can get everything ordered now, and the results should be back within a few days. Would you like me to call for a nurse to assist you with the blood draw?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A nurse would be… helpful. I don’t like needles, you see. And I do worry about fainting. I’ve never actually fainted, but… well, it’s a fear. And the X-ray… is it safe? I read something once about radiation. Is it a lot of radiation? I do try to be careful. And will it take long? I really do need to get to my appointment later. What time do you think I’ll be finished here? I promised my friend I’d help her with something. Is there a waiting room?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Maribeth. I completely understand your concerns. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about needles and radiation. I'll have a nurse come in right away to assist you with the blood draw. She is very experienced and will make you as comfortable as possible. She can also let you lie down during the draw to help prevent any dizziness. Regarding the X-ray, the amount of radiation is very low – it’s similar to what you’re exposed to during a typical cross-country flight. It’s not a significant risk. The procedure itself should only take a few minutes. Let me see… Once the blood work is done, you’ll head up to Radiology. Assuming there isn’t a long wait, you should be finished here within the hour. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in a few days. Nurse Anya, this is Maribeth Vanderwiele. She's a little nervous about getting her blood drawn. Could you please assist her?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you. I do get nervous, you see. And I do worry about fainting. My mother… she used to get faint easily. And I do need to make my appointment later. Will it be a long needle? And will it hurt? I’m a little sensitive, you see. And I have a small vein, I think. The phlebotomist always has trouble finding it. Is there anything I can do to make it easier? I do have a small bottle of hand lotion in my purse… would that help?
DOCTOR: Nurse Anya: Hello Maribeth, it's lovely to meet you. Don't worry at all, we'll take things slow and steady. It's perfectly normal to be nervous, and we're very good at making this as comfortable as possible. We’ll use the smallest needle possible, and I promise to be gentle. Warming your arm with a warm compress can help make the vein more visible, and the lotion is a great idea! Applying it beforehand can soften the skin. We can also have you clench and unclench your fist a few times, that sometimes helps. And if you feel any dizziness at all, please let me know immediately, and we can have you lie down. Let’s see… yes, here’s a good one. It might take a little bit, but we’ll get there. Just breathe deeply and try to relax. Do you prefer to look away during the draw?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you. I do try to relax, but it’s hard. My mother… she always used to get so anxious at the doctor’s. And I do get nervous easily. Looking away… yes, please. I don’t like to see the needle. And will it hurt a lot? I have a very low pain tolerance, you see. And I do get lightheaded sometimes. And will it take long? I really do need to get to my appointment later. Is there anything I can do to make it faster? Perhaps I could hum a tune? Or think of pleasant thoughts? Oh dear. I'm probably being a bother.
DOCTOR: Nurse Anya: You are not a bother at all, Maribeth. It's perfectly okay to be anxious, and we’re here to make you comfortable. Many people feel the same way. The sensation is more of a quick pinch than actual pain, and it only lasts for a moment. I'll be very quick and efficient. Humming a tune or thinking of pleasant thoughts is a wonderful idea! It can definitely help distract you. Just breathe deeply… almost done… All done! See?
PATIENT: Oh! That did pinch! And I do feel a little lightheaded. And my arm feels a bit weak. And I do think I need to sit down. And I do worry about bruising. And I do hope I haven't made too much of a fuss. And I do need to get to my appointment later. Is there a bandage? And will I need to hold pressure on it for long? And I do hope I haven't wasted your time. Oh dear. I’m probably being a terrible patient.
DOCTOR: Nurse Anya: You did wonderfully, Maribeth! You weren't a fuss at all. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little lightheaded, and you handled it beautifully. Just hold pressure on the bandage for a few minutes, and try to avoid lifting anything heavy with that arm for the rest of the day. You might have a little bruising, but it shouldn’t be too bad. Dr. Solero: Maribeth, you did great! Nurse Anya and I are very pleased with how you handled that. I’ll come back in a moment with the paperwork for the lab and radiology, and we can discuss a plan for getting those tests done. I think you’ll be able to make your appointment. We'll get you taken care of as quickly as possible. .
