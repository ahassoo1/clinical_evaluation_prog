DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I'm Dr. Chora. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get on with it. It’s my stool. It’s black. Like… really black. And I take those pain pills, you know, for my arthritis. Been taking them for years. Is that what this is about? Honestly, I’ve had better things to do than sit around a doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard, I understand you're concerned about your black stools and want to be efficient. We'll get right to it. Black, tarry stools can be a sign of bleeding in the upper digestive tract, and given your long-term pain pill use, that's definitely something we need to investigate. Now, those pain pills… are those opioids?
PATIENT: Opioids? I don’t know what you’re talking about. The doctor gave them to me, years ago. Little white pills. I take two, sometimes three, when it really flares up. Honestly, I don’t read the labels. It’s just for the pain, dear. And I’ve been taking them so long, I don’t know why they would suddenly cause this… this mess. Is this going to involve a lot of tests? Because I really don't have the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard. We'll try to keep things as streamlined as possible. Long-term use of NSAIDs – non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are common pain relievers – can cause stomach irritation and bleeding. Even if it's been years, it's something we need to rule out. Now, aside from the color change, has there been any change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What do you want me to say? I go to the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom. It’s… normal, usually. Well, it was normal. I don’t sit around analyzing everything that comes out of me, if that’s what you’re asking. Look, it's black. That’s the point, isn't it? I just want to know if it's serious and if I need to stop taking my pills. Don’t tell me I have to stop taking my pills. I can barely get out of bed without them.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard, I understand your frustration. Let's focus on getting some information. Has there been any change in the consistency of the stool, besides the color?
PATIENT: Consistency? Like… is it hard or soft? It’s… normal. I suppose. Look, it’s not liquid, if that’s what you're asking. It’s… solid-ish. Honestly, I don't pay that much attention. I’m a mechanic, not a… a stool examiner. Are you going to do a test, or are you just going to ask me about this all day? My husband is waiting in the car, and he doesn’t have all afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to do a quick physical exam, and I'm going to order a stool test to check for blood. It’s a pretty standard test. It will tell us if there is bleeding in your digestive tract. Then we can discuss a plan. I’ll also quickly check your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don’t poke around too much. And make it quick. I have appointments. And tell me straight, if it's something bad. I don't have time for beating around the bush. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard. It shouldn’t hurt. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I'll gently press on it to check for any tenderness. Lie back for me, please. Okay. Everything sounds normal so far. Now I'm just going to press gently here... and here... any discomfort?
PATIENT: A little bit there… on the left side. Not pain, exactly. More like… a dull ache. It’s always a little achy, honestly. It’s probably just my age. You’re pressing too hard, though. Honestly, you’re making me nervous. Is it something serious? Just tell me if it’s something I need to worry about. And what about my pills? Can I still take them?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard. I'm noting the mild tenderness on the left side. It could be a number of things. Given your pain pill use and the black stools, we need to rule out bleeding first. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a stool occult blood test – that checks for hidden blood in your stool – and a metabolic panel. We should get the results back within a day or two. In the meantime, I recommend temporarily stopping the pain pills, if possible, just until we get the results back. I know you said it’s difficult, but it will help us determine if they are contributing to the problem. Is that something you can manage?
PATIENT: Stop them completely? Absolutely not. I can barely function as it is. Maybe… maybe I can cut back a little. Just one a day? I need something for the pain. I have things to do. Honestly, this is ridiculous. You're making a big deal out of nothing. It’s probably just something I ate. And I'm not waiting two days for results. Call me tomorrow. Tell me if it’s serious, and if I can go back to my pills. That’s all I ask. Now, can I go? My husband is probably furious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your concerns. I'll order the tests and call you tomorrow with the initial results. Cutting back to one pill a day is a reasonable compromise for now. However, if the black stools continue, or if you experience any weakness, dizziness, or abdominal pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Here are the lab orders. You can take these to the lab downstairs. And I will call you tomorrow. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms before then. Alright. You can go ahead and get dressed. And drive safely.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. I’ll go get these tests done. But if this turns out to be nothing, I’m holding you responsible for wasting my time. Honestly, doctors these days… always making a mountain out of a molehill.
