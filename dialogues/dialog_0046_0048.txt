DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, it’s about these… episodes. My wife, she’s the one who insisted I come. She says I’ve been… not myself lately. Forgetful, she says. Though I don’t see it, naturally. But she worries. It’s just… little things, really. Like misplacing my tools. Or… not remembering what I went to the store for. It’s annoying, more than anything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that your wife is looking out for you, and it's certainly common to experience some forgetfulness as we get older. However, it's always best to investigate these things, just to be sure. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about these “episodes”?
PATIENT: Episodes. Right. Well, it’s not like I completely blank out, you understand. It’s more… a fuzziness. Like looking through dirty glass. I know who I am, and where I am, generally. But things… don’t quite connect. I might be in the middle of laying tile, and suddenly… I can’t remember what I was doing. Or why I picked up a certain tool. It lasts… a few minutes, maybe? Then it clears up. Usually. And it’s not every day, thankfully. Mostly happens when I'm tired, I think. Though I get plenty of rest. I work hard, but I do rest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Mr. Lason. That "fuzziness" is helpful to know. And the fact that it seems to be worse when you're tired is a good observation. To get a better picture of what might be happening, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmm. Let me think. I had a bad back, years ago. From all the bending and lifting, you understand. Tile work isn’t easy on the body. Went to a chiropractor for that. Helped some. And… I had a bit of a cough last winter. Nothing serious, just a cold. My wife made me drink a lot of ginger tea. Other than that… no. I’ve always been a healthy man. Strong as an ox, even now. Never needed much doctoring, if you catch my drift. Not one for complaining, either.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. A history of back problems is relevant, and it’s helpful to hear you generally consider yourself healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, never. Absolutely not. I take care of myself. I eat well – mostly. My wife makes sure of that. And I avoid unnecessary risks. Surgery is… drastic, you understand. Best to avoid it if at all possible. I've seen what it does to people. No, haven't had a single operation in my life. Not interested.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s helpful. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – who has experienced memory problems, dementia, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she got a little forgetful towards the end, yes. But that was old age, you understand. She lived a long life. Just… the usual things. Misplacing things, repeating herself. Nothing serious. My father was always sharp as a tack, right up until the day he died. And my sister… she’s perfectly fine. Always has been. She’s a teacher, always remembering dates and names and such. It’s a gift, really. So, no. No one with serious memory problems. Just… the normal aging process, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Lason. That's helpful information. Now, let’s talk about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements.
PATIENT: Medications? Just… a little something for my back, sometimes. When it flares up. Ibuprofen, mostly. Over the counter. Nothing prescribed. And… my wife makes me take a vitamin D supplement. She says I don’t get enough sunshine. I don’t really pay much attention to it, honestly. And… sometimes a little ginger for my stomach. It helps with the digestion. That's about it. Very simple. I don't like taking a lot of pills. It feels… unnatural.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for your back, vitamin D, and ginger. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. My wife worries sometimes, says I should be more careful. But I’ve always had a strong stomach. Dust bothers me a little, when I'm cutting tile, but that's not an allergy, is it? Just… irritates my nose. Nothing serious. No, I’m pretty lucky in that regard, really. Never had to worry about carrying an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: That's good. No known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work. Tile setting, as you know. It keeps me busy. I'm on my feet all day. My wife and I, we have a garden. She does most of the work, I help out when I can. We like to watch the news. And… we have family dinners sometimes. My daughter lives nearby, thankfully. She brings the grandchildren over. That’s about it, really. Quiet life. A good life, I think. I don't drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And I don’t smoke. Never have.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very full and healthy life, Mr. Lason. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I also want to do a simple neurological exam to assess your reflexes, balance, and coordination, and check your cognitive function. This will involve asking you a few questions and having you perform some simple tasks. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Hmm. I suppose so. Though I’m not one for poking and prodding, you understand. I'm a practical man. I prefer to do things, not have things done to me. But… if you think it’s necessary. Just… try to be quick about it, alright? And don’t expect me to be able to do any fancy balancing acts. My knees aren’t what they used to be. Cognitive function? What does that even mean? Alright, alright. Go ahead. But I warn you, I might be a little impatient.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Lason. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And “cognitive function” just means checking things like your memory and thinking skills. It’s very straightforward. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but we can discuss that later. Pulse is 72 and regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are normal. Now, let's check your reflexes. Can you please extend your arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Alright. Arms extended, palms up. Though I haven’t done much with my arms lately, besides laying tile. They might be a little stiff. Don’t expect miracles, alright? This is all a bit… undignified, you know. I'm a craftsman, not a… a lab rat. But go ahead. Just be gentle. And hurry up. My wife is waiting.
DOCTOR: Good reflexes, Mr. Lason. Perfectly normal. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Following your finger… Yes, I can see it. Though it’s a bit… distracting, you know? I'm trying to concentrate, but it’s hard when someone is waving something in front of my face. Is there a point to this? Is this going to tell you something important? Honestly, I'd rather be laying tile. It's more productive. But alright, I'll follow your finger. Go ahead. Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Very good. Your eye movements are excellent. Now, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date? Hmm. Let me think… It's… August. Yes, August. And… the second? Yes, the second of August. 2025, naturally. Though I don't see why that's important. I know what day it is. I'm not… senile, you understand. I keep track of things. My wife reminds me of appointments, of course, but that's because she worries too much. But yes, August 2nd, 2025. There. Satisfied?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Mr. Lason. That's perfect. Now, I'm going to ask you to remember three words. Please pay attention: apple, table, pencil. I’ll ask you to recall them later. Now, let’s quickly check your balance. Could you stand up and try to stand on one leg for about ten seconds?
PATIENT: Apple, table, pencil. Right. Three words. Not very challenging, you understand. I can remember three words easily. I remember blueprints, tile patterns, measurements… three words are nothing. Alright, standing up now… Whoa! Steady now… This is ridiculous! My knees, you understand. They aren’t what they used to be. I told you. This is a waste of time. I’m perfectly capable. It's just… my balance isn't the greatest. But I can still lay tile. That's what matters. I need a chair! This is undignified!
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. I appreciate you trying. Now, can you recall those three words I asked you to remember?
PATIENT: Three words… Hmm. Let me think… Apple… Yes, apple. And… table. Yes, table. And… the last one… Oh dear. It’s on the tip of my tongue… It started with a… a P, I think. Something you write with… a pen? No… pencil! Yes, pencil! There. I remembered them. See? Perfectly fine. I just needed a moment to… gather my thoughts. Don't worry about me. I'm a bit distracted by all this… poking and prodding. But my memory is perfectly sound.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That’s very good. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, your symptoms of “fuzziness” and forgetfulness, along with the slightly impaired balance, could be due to a number of things. It could be related to normal age-related changes, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Given your age, it's important to consider the possibility of mild cognitive impairment or early stages of dementia, though I'm not making any definitive diagnosis at this point. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a brain scan, such as an MRI, to look for any structural abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Brain scan? MRI? Now hold on a minute. That sounds… serious. And expensive, I imagine. I don't need a brain scan. I'm perfectly fine. I just need a good night’s sleep. And maybe a bit less stress. All this worrying about my memory… it’s making things worse, you understand? Blood tests, maybe. I suppose that's alright. Check my vitamins… fine. But an MRI? No. I don’t like the sound of that at all. I’m a practical man. I need to do things, not have things done to me. What will an MRI even tell you? It won’t fix anything. I trust you’re a good doctor, but… this seems a bit extreme. Perhaps we could try something else first? A bit of rest… a healthy diet… Maybe another opinion? Honestly, I’m starting to feel rather anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Lason. You are right to ask questions and express your anxieties. An MRI isn’t something we do lightly. The purpose of the scan is to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms, such as a small stroke, tumor, or structural abnormalities. It helps us to ensure we are on the right track and provides more information to help with an accurate diagnosis. However, I absolutely respect your decision. We can start with the blood tests, as you suggested, and see what they reveal. We can also monitor your symptoms closely over the next few weeks. If your symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop, then we can revisit the possibility of further imaging. Would that be a more comfortable approach for you?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds much better. Blood tests, fine. Monitor my symptoms… yes. I can do that. My wife will be happy to hear that. She’s the one who insisted I come in the first place. She’s very attentive to these things. I’ll pay attention to… to the fuzziness. And the forgetting. And if it gets worse… then we’ll talk about the brain scan, alright? But let’s not jump to conclusions. I’m a perfectly capable man. I just need a bit of rest. And perhaps a good, long vacation. That would do wonders, I suspect. So, blood tests it is. When can I get those done? And do you have a referral form, or…? I'd like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Blood tests it is. I’ll write you a referral for the lab just down the street. They don’t require an appointment, but it’s best to go in the morning after fasting overnight. I’ll also give you a list of the tests we’re looking for. Once the results are back, the lab will send them directly to me, and I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with you to discuss them. That will be in about a week, give or take. In the meantime, please keep a diary of your symptoms. Note the times they occur, what you were doing when they started, and how long they last. That will be very helpful. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: A diary? Oh dear. I’m not one for keeping diaries. But alright, I’ll try. My wife can probably help me with that. She’s very organized. No, I don’t think so. Just… the blood tests. And the follow-up appointment. And the… diary. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate it. I’m still not convinced I need all this… poking and prodding. But I trust you’ll do your best. I suppose I should be getting home now. My wife is probably wondering where I am. She’ll be relieved to hear I haven’t collapsed or anything.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Lason. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, we’ll proceed at your pace. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen before our follow-up appointment. Get home safely, and please give your wife my regards. .
PATIENT: .
