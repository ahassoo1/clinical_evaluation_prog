DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. I keep coughing... a lot. And I feel tired all the time. Also, my nose... gets blocked up, like, a lot. Happens often. I dunno… it’s just been going on.
DOCTOR: Okay. A cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion. And you said this has been going on for a while – can you tell me a little more about how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… a while… I think… maybe… six months? Or more? It’s hard to say exactly. It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it’s bad, sometimes not so bad. I just… keep getting sick. Like a cold, but it doesn't really go away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Six months or more of intermittent cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion. And you describe it as feeling like a cold that doesn’t fully resolve. Do you have any fever, chills, or body aches with these episodes?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes, I think? Not high, maybe just warm. Chills… not really. Body aches… a little bit, when the cough is really bad. Like, everything hurts a bit when I cough too much. But not always. It’s… hard to remember exactly. It all feels the same after a while, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, occasional low-grade fever, some body aches with the cough, but not consistently. And you said your nose gets blocked up – is there any discharge from your nose?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, stuff comes out. Sometimes clear, sometimes… yellow-ish? Green-ish? I dunno… depends. When it’s bad, it’s more… thick. Sorry. It's messy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so variable nasal discharge – sometimes clear, sometimes yellow or green, and thicker when the congestion is worse. Have you noticed any shortness of breath or wheezing with the cough?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. No. But… sometimes when I cough, my chest feels tight. Like, it hurts to breathe in deep. And… wheezing… maybe? I don’t know what that sounds like. My wife says I make a whistling sound sometimes when I breathe, but I don’t hear it myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Chest tightness with coughing and your wife has noted some whistling sounds when you breathe, possibly wheezing. Have you tried anything to relieve these symptoms – over-the-counter medications, home remedies, anything at all?
PATIENT: I take some… cough syrup. From the pharmacy. The red one. It helps a little, maybe. And I drink a lot of water. My wife makes me ginger tea sometimes. It’s nice, but… doesn't really fix it, you know? It just… makes me feel a bit better for a little while. I haven’t really tried anything else. I dunno what to try.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've tried cough syrup and ginger tea with limited relief. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you had any recent travel, or been around anyone who's been sick recently?
PATIENT: Travel… no, not really. Been here, working. Same place. Around anyone sick… hmm… Old Man Lim at the tire shop had a bad cold last month, I think. But everyone gets colds, right? And… my son had a cough a few weeks ago, but it went away quick. Nothing else I can think of. It's just… normal life, you know? Tires and coughs.
DOCTOR: Alright. No recent travel, possible exposure to a coworker and your son with colds. Now, let’s go through some basic medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don’t think so. Never had a problem with anything. I eat everything. Take the cough syrup, no problem. My wife always asks if I'm sure, but… never had a reaction. I think. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the cough syrup?
PATIENT: No… no other medicines. Just the red cough syrup when I need it. Sometimes my wife gives me vitamin C, but that’s not a medicine, right? Just… orange juice. Nothing else. I try to stay healthy. Tires are hard work, you know? Can't be sick all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the cough syrup and occasional vitamin C. Now, have you had any serious medical problems in the past – like asthma, pneumonia, heart problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no serious problems. Never been to the hospital, except for a broken finger when I was a kid. Playing football. Just the usual… colds, flu… nothing major. I'm usually pretty healthy, honestly. This cough… it’s just… different. It won’t go away. My wife is starting to worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major past medical history. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never needed them. Everything still works, mostly. Except maybe my lungs, lately. This cough… it feels like something’s wrong inside. But I don't know what. I just fix tires, Doctor. Not bodies.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior surgeries. Now, regarding your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like asthma, allergies, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother… she always complained about her knees. Arthritis, maybe? My brother… he's pretty healthy, I think. Nothing major that I know of. It’s been a while since we talked properly, you know? Everyone's busy. Nothing comes to mind, really. We’re not a family that talks about sickness much. More about… tires. And weddings.
DOCTOR: Okay. Family history of high blood pressure and possible arthritis. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, no smoking! Never. My wife wouldn't allow it. And it's bad for your health, right? I need my lungs for fixing tires! I drink a little beer sometimes, with dinner. But not much. Just one or two.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, occasional beer. Okay, Mr. Tati, thank you for all that information. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust you. I just want this cough to go away. It's tiring. Just tell me what's wrong, okay? My wife is getting worried.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just take a deep breath in and out… and repeat that a few times. Okay… and another deep breath… I do hear some wheezing on both sides of your chest, and a slight crackling sound. Your oxygen saturation is a little low, at 92%. This suggests some inflammation in your airways, possibly bronchitis or even early pneumonia. I also noticed you seem a little short of breath, even at rest.
PATIENT: Bronchitis? Pneumonia? What does that… mean? Is it serious? Will I have to go to the hospital? My wife… she'll be so worried. I just want to fix tires, Doctor. Not… be sick in a hospital. What can we do?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tati, let's not jump to conclusions. While the findings do suggest a possible respiratory infection, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs. This will help us determine the exact cause of your symptoms and the best course of treatment. We'll take it one step at a time. It might not be as serious as you think, but we need to get a proper diagnosis first. We'll get that X-ray done, and then discuss the results and options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… okay. If you think it's necessary. But… will it hurt? And how long will it take? I have to get back to the shop, you know? Old Man Lim can't fix tires by himself. And… will I be able to work afterwards? My wife… she depends on the money.
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray won’t hurt at all. You'll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture. It's very quick, usually takes less than five minutes. And yes, you'll be able to go back to work afterwards. It won't affect your ability to work. We have a radiology center just across the street. I'll write you a referral now. The nurse will explain everything to you and schedule the appointment. While we're waiting, I’ll also prescribe you an inhaler to help open up your airways and ease your breathing. It’s a preventative measure, while we wait for the X-ray results. It won't cure anything, but it should help with the wheezing and shortness of breath. Does that sound acceptable, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: An inhaler… okay, that sounds good. Anything to help with the breathing. And the X-ray… if it has to be done. Will it show everything? Will we know what's wrong? My wife… she worries a lot. I just want to fix tires, Doctor. That’s all. Just… fix tires and get back to normal.
DOCTOR: The X-ray should give us a clearer picture of what’s going on in your lungs, Mr. Tati. It will help us determine if it's bronchitis, pneumonia, or something else entirely. We’ll review the results as soon as they're available, and discuss the best course of action. We’re taking things one step at a time, and we’ll figure this out together. The nurse will be in shortly to give you the inhaler prescription and schedule the X-ray. In the meantime, try to rest as much as possible, and drink plenty of fluids. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience any chest pain or high fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. My wife… she’ll be so worried. And the tires… they need fixing. I’ll go and see the nurse now. Thank you, Doctor.
