DOCTOR: Right, okay. So, Evann, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Evann Buoniconti. Though… honestly, I find remembering things quite difficult these days. It’s rather frustrating. I believe I made an appointment to discuss… some paperwork? Something about future care, if I become unable to… well, to make decisions for myself.
DOCTOR: Hmm, yes, I see it here… advance directives. Right, right. That's a good idea to get sorted. It is… best to be prepared. So, you’re wanting to discuss… a living will, perhaps?
PATIENT: A living will… yes, that sounds right. Or perhaps a POLST form? I was told something about that as well, but I confess the details are… hazy. Is there a difference? I apologize for my confusion. It’s simply that everything feels a bit… distant, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Distant… yes, I understand. A lot of people find this stuff… overwhelming. Okay. A living will is more about your overall wishes, what kind of care you want in general, should you become incapacitated. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is… more specific. It’s actually a medical order, based on your current wishes, so EMS and doctors know what to do right now. Do you have any current medical conditions we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Current… conditions? Oh dear. I… I really don’t recall anything significant. I see a specialist for… well, for feeling generally unwell, I suppose. Fatigue mostly. And some… dizziness. But nothing they’ve formally diagnosed, as far as I know. My divorce was rather… draining, so I always assumed that was the cause. But it's persisted, you see. I have private insurance, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Right, fatigue and dizziness. And a recent divorce. Okay. That can certainly contribute. Let’s see… any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. Not to anything common, at least. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything, not that I recall. I used to keep a cat, and I was fine, if that means anything. But truthfully, my memory is… unreliable. It's frustrating, really. I want to be thorough, but it feels like trying to grasp smoke.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll take things slowly. Any medications you're currently taking, even over-the-counter things?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take something for the fatigue. A small, white pill. I believe the doctor said it was… an energy booster? And occasionally, ibuprofen, for headaches. But that’s it, I think. I truly try to avoid taking anything if I can. I don't have a very good reaction to most things, from what I remember. It’s difficult to be sure though, with my… condition.
DOCTOR: Right, small white pill for fatigue, ibuprofen as needed. Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… a good question. My parents… my mother passed away some years ago, quite suddenly. Heart problems, I believe. And my father… he lives in Mongolia, and we haven't been in contact for a very long time. I don’t know much about his health, I'm afraid. I apologize for being so vague; it's terribly embarrassing. I was never very close to either of them, to be honest. Mostly just… distant relatives.
DOCTOR: Right, mother with heart problems, limited information on father. Okay. And do you… drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Absolutely not. I've never been one for any of those things. Never. I find them… quite unsettling, actually. I prefer tea. Green tea, mostly. It's very calming. I suppose… I've led a rather… quiet life. Perhaps too quiet. Though, lately, even that’s been difficult to manage. All this fatigue, you see. It makes everything… blurry.
DOCTOR: Right, tea… no alcohol, smoking, or drugs. Okay. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a baseline. Check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, that sort of thing. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam. Of course. Whatever is necessary. Though, if you don’t mind my asking… is it normal to feel so… forgetful? And fatigued? I'm just worried there's something… seriously wrong. I'd like to understand what's happening, if that's possible. I realize I’m rambling; I apologize. It’s just… unsettling, not knowing.
DOCTOR: No, no rambling at all. It’s good to ask questions. Forgetfulness and fatigue… they can be normal, especially with stress. But it's important to rule out other things. Okay, if you could just lie down here, please. We'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is… 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72, regular. Let's listen to your heart and lungs now.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. This is… reassuring, in a way. Although I confess, I'm always a bit apprehensive about these things. I always feel… a little lost, if that makes sense. Please, do whatever you need to do. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are… regular, no murmurs. Lung sounds are… clear, but slightly diminished in the bases. Let's check your reflexes now. Reflexes are… normal. And finally, I'll just take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears look clear, nose is… slightly congested, throat is… normal. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Everything seems… within normal limits, but the diminished lung sounds and congestion are worth noting. It could just be a mild cold, but we'll need to do some further testing to be sure.
PATIENT: Further testing? What kind of testing? I… I confess, I’m a little nervous. I’ve always been rather… prone to anxiety. Is it something serious, Doctor? Perhaps the fatigue is finally catching up with me? I just want to understand what's happening, and to be able to… feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Don’t worry, it’s likely nothing serious. But to rule things out, I'd like to order a complete blood count - that checks for anemia and infection - and a thyroid panel. We can also do a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. That will help us determine the cause of the diminished sounds. Would you prefer to book with a specialist for the X-ray, or would you like me to arrange it?
PATIENT: A complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a chest X-ray… that sounds… thorough. Yes, that’s good. I suppose. It’s just… a lot to take in. I think… I think you arranging it would be best, Doctor. If that’s not too much trouble. I'm not very good at dealing with these things myself, truthfully. I always feel… overwhelmed. And I'm afraid I'd probably forget something important. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, I've booked you in for blood work tomorrow morning at the lab across the street, and the chest X-ray for Friday. They'll send the results to me. We can discuss them when I have them. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and drinking lots of fluids. And… try not to stress too much. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning and Friday… Yes, that’s… manageable. Thank you, Doctor. Actually… yes, I do have a question. Regarding the advance directive and POLST form… is it possible to complete them even if I'm feeling… uncertain about everything? I feel rather… foggy, as I've mentioned. And I don't want to make any decisions I might regret later. Is it better to wait until I'm feeling more… clear-headed?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Evann. It's perfectly acceptable to take your time with these forms. You should feel completely comfortable and certain about your wishes. We can certainly postpone completing them until you're feeling more clear-headed. We can also discuss them in more detail at your follow-up appointment, once we have the test results. There’s no rush. It’s more important to get it right than to do it quickly. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect. Waiting until I'm feeling more clear-headed… discussing it further… that’s exactly what I needed to hear, Doctor. Thank you. I believe that’s all for now. I appreciate your patience and understanding. Should I schedule a follow-up appointment now, or wait until the test results are available?
DOCTOR: Let's wait until the test results come back. I'll have my assistant call you to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they're available, probably next week. In the meantime, if anything changes, or you start feeling significantly worse, don’t hesitate to call the office. Here's a summary of today's visit, and the lab order. Alright. Have a good day, Evann. And try to get some rest.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. You too. And thank you again for everything. .
