DOCTOR: Alright, Early, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, Doctor… Auelua, is it? Yes. See, my… ex-wife, she’s been… not nice. Says I need to… cheer up. I thought, maybe a little note from you… a “Get Well” card, something official… would show her I’m… taking care of myself. It’s… important, you understand. For appearances.
DOCTOR: I understand, Early. You're hoping a note from me might help with a situation with your ex-wife. It sounds like you're dealing with some emotional stress, and you’d like my assistance in documenting that. Just to clarify, you're not experiencing any physical symptoms that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? No, no. Nothing like that. I'm a… a strong man. Always been strong. Boiler operator, you know? It’s just… the feeling. The way she looks at me. Like I’m… less than. A note from a doctor… it carries weight. It shows I’m… responsible. Taking care of things.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's primarily about having documentation to demonstrate your well-being to your ex-wife. That makes sense. And you feel this documentation would be helpful in… improving the situation?
PATIENT: Improving? Well, maybe not improve. More like… stopping the complaining. She tells everyone I’m… failing. Says I don't take care of myself. A note… it's proof. It’s… official. People listen to doctors, you know? They don't listen to her.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of stress related to your ex-wife’s perception of your health and well-being, and you believe a note from me could help validate your state of health to others. Early, while I’m happy to document your visit today, it's important to remember that a doctor's note is a medical document. It should reflect a legitimate medical concern or assessment. I can certainly document that you came in to discuss stress related to your personal life, and that you report feeling well physically. However, I want to ensure we're approaching this in a way that's ethical and appropriate for medical practice. Would you be open to discussing some strategies for coping with this stress?
PATIENT: Strategies? Coping? I cope. I run the boilers! That’s coping. Look, Doctor, I don't need… feelings talk. I need a note. A simple note. “Early Kammer is in good health and is doing well.” Is that so hard? I’m not here to… to analyze things. I just want the paper.
DOCTOR: Early, I understand you’re frustrated and just want the note. And I appreciate you being direct about that. However, as a physician, I have a responsibility to practice ethically and ensure any documentation I provide is accurate and reflects a legitimate medical encounter. Simply stating you're in “good health” without any assessment or context wouldn't be appropriate. To be clear, you're reporting no physical complaints or symptoms that require medical attention?
PATIENT: No! None. That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you! Boilers! I work with boilers, Doctor. Big, hot, dangerous boilers. I’m… robust. Strong. I don't feel sick. She’s the one with the problems, always complaining. But she’ll use anything against me. A note… it stops the complaining.
DOCTOR: Okay, Early. I understand. You’re here because you’re feeling stressed about your ex-wife’s perception of your well-being and believe a note from me could help alleviate that stress. You’re reporting no physical symptoms and describe yourself as robust and strong, and you work as a boiler operator. Given this information, I can document the visit as a request for documentation related to stress stemming from interpersonal issues. I can state that you report feeling well and have no current medical complaints. However, I will also include a note about the reason for the request to maintain transparency. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Transparency? What does that mean? As long as it says I’m… healthy. And doesn’t mention… anything about her. Just that I’m fine. Boilers, remember? It’s a hard job. People understand that. If you write that, maybe… maybe she’ll stop. Just write that I’m healthy and came to see you because I wanted to make sure everything was… alright. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: Early, "transparency" means I need to be truthful in my documentation. I can absolutely document that you came in for a wellness check and reported feeling well. I can also note that you are employed as a boiler operator, which you indicated is a physically demanding job. However, I can't ethically omit the reason you requested the visit. I can state you wanted documentation to address concerns about your well-being. I can phrase it neutrally – for example, “Patient reports concerns regarding perceptions of his health and requested documentation.” Omitting that would be inaccurate and could be considered unethical. Would you be comfortable with that wording?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. “Concerns about perceptions”. Whatever. As long as it doesn’t sound like… like I’m weak. Just write the note. Get it done. I have things to do. Boilers don't run themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, here you go. This document states you came in today for a wellness check, reported feeling well and having no current medical complaints, and expressed concerns about perceptions of your overall health. It also notes your employment as a boiler operator. Please review it to ensure it accurately reflects our conversation. I’ll also make a note of this visit in your electronic health record. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: “Perceptions”… It sounds… strange. But… alright. It's better than nothing. No. That’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I guess.
