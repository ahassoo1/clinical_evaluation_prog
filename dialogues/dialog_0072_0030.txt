DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in… how I smell, lately. My body odor. It’s different than usual, and I can’t quite put my finger on how different. It’s just… not right.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s certainly not something patients typically bring up without some hesitation, so you’ve done the right thing by mentioning it. “Not right” is helpful, but let’s try to be more specific. Has the odor changed in intensity – is it stronger or weaker than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I think… stronger, maybe? It’s not overpowering, not like a really bad smell, but I definitely notice it more now, even after showering. And it seems to linger, you know? I used to feel pretty fresh after a good wash, but not so much lately. It's been going on for, oh, about a month, I'd say.
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And is this odor localized to a specific area, or is it all over?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. I haven't really… pinpointed it. It seems to be… everywhere, I guess? Under my arms, definitely, but also… just generally? It’s hard to explain. It's not like one specific spot is worse than another. I thought maybe it was my clothes, but I’ve tried different detergents, even new clothes, and it's still there.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other changes alongside this odor?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. No fever, no weight loss. I've been sleeping okay, maybe a little restless sometimes, but nothing major. My appetite's normal, I think. Oh! Actually… now that you mention it, I have been sweating a bit more than usual, even when I’m not doing anything strenuous. It’s not soaking wet or anything, but I feel… clammy sometimes. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is relevant, Ms. Purtee. Increased perspiration, combined with the change in odor, is certainly worth investigating. Now, let’s delve into your medical background. Do you have any current medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that's it. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy. I see the dentist twice a year, and I had a check-up with my primary care doctor about a year and a half ago, and everything was fine then. They did mention my blood pressure was a little high, but they said to just watch my salt intake. I don't take any regular medications, just over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes for my knees.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal ten years ago, occasional pain relievers… and no other medications. And you said your primary care physician noted slightly elevated blood pressure. Do you recall what they recommended specifically, beyond salt restriction?
PATIENT: Just to watch my salt. They didn't prescribe anything or tell me to monitor it at home, just to be mindful of it in my diet. I try, honestly. I cook most of my own meals, so I can control the ingredients, but… I do like a little salt sometimes. Nothing crazy, I don't think. They didn’t seem too worried about it, just said to check it again at my next appointment. It’s been a while, though, like I said, a year and a half.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. And my father had high blood pressure, like me. My grandmother on my mother’s side had something with her kidneys, I think, but I don’t know a lot of the details. She passed away when I was young. Nothing else really stands out, not that I’m aware of. We weren’t a big family for talking about health issues, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, Ms. Purtee. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I stopped a few years ago. It wasn't really doing me any good, and honestly, I just didn’t enjoy it as much anymore. And no, no recreational drugs, ever. I’m a pretty straight-laced person, Doctor. I work hard, I like to keep busy, and I try to stay healthy. That’s why this whole odor thing is so concerning to me.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Ms. Purtee. And that is perfectly understandable. Now, lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I haven’t had any allergic reactions to anything in my life, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to a medication. I’m pretty lucky that way. Is there anything else you need to know? I feel like I’m running out of things to tell you! Hopefully this information is helpful.
DOCTOR: It is, thank you. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and then I’ll examine your skin. This will help me assess the situation further and determine the best course of action. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Absolutely. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Very good. Please sit back and relax. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… Good. Heart sounds are within normal limits. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your thyroid gland. Please try to swallow normally while I do this. Thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but no nodules are palpable. Finally, I will examine your skin. Skin is generally unremarkable, no rashes or lesions noted. I do observe some mild hyperpigmentation in your axillae, which could be related to the odor. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Ms. Purtee, based on this initial examination, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the odor. The mild thyroid enlargement and hyperpigmentation in your axillae are of note. It could be related to a hormonal imbalance, a change in your body’s microbiome, or a combination of factors. We need to run some tests to investigate further. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. I also want to test your urine to rule out any underlying infections. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, and I appreciate it. That all sounds acceptable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get back to normal. When can I expect the results? And where do I go to get these tests done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve already entered the orders into the system. You can have these tests done at the lab just across the hall, room 203. They should be able to take you right away. Once the results are in, they’ll be automatically sent to my office. Typically, it takes about three to five business days, but I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I’d like you to continue practicing good hygiene – showering daily with antibacterial soap, wearing clean clothes, and using an antiperspirant. We also want to rule out any dietary factors, so I suggest keeping a food diary for the next week, noting everything you eat and drink. Once we have the lab results, we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action. If the results are inconclusive, we may need to refer you to an endocrinologist or a dermatologist for further evaluation. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I can definitely do all of that – the lab work, the food diary, everything. I appreciate you being so thorough and explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a lot better knowing we’re taking it seriously. Is there anything else I should be doing, or anything I should be watching out for, while I wait for the results?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. While we wait for the results, I want you to monitor yourself for any additional symptoms, such as unexplained weight loss, excessive thirst, fatigue, changes in bowel habits, or any new lumps or bumps. If you experience any of these, please contact my office immediately. It's also important to note that sometimes, changes in body odor can be a normal occurrence, especially during times of stress or hormonal fluctuation. However, given the persistence of your symptoms and the slight thyroid enlargement, we’re taking a cautious approach. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered all of my questions, and you’ve explained everything so well. I feel much better now, just knowing we have a plan. I really appreciate your time, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Purtee. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns whatsoever. My nurse, Sarah, is an excellent resource and can address many of your questions. I wish you well, and I look forward to discussing the results with you next week.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate everything. I will definitely be in touch. Have a good day!
