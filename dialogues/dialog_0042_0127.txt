DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s been a bit concerning, to be honest. I’ve been noticing some weakness, mostly in my muscles, and my eyelids… they’re starting to droop. It's been getting worse over the last few months, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids… that’s certainly something we should investigate. When you say weakness, can you describe that a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's… it’s not like a sudden inability to do things, more like things take more effort. Especially things like… holding my head up for too long, or keeping my eyes open, like I said. And it seems to be worse at the end of the day, if that makes sense. It’s… tiring, I suppose is the best way to put it. It doesn’t hurt, just… difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s more of a fatigability, a muscle weakness that increases with activity and gets better with rest, and is particularly noticeable at the end of the day. That’s helpful. And you mentioned it's been worsening over months. Approximately how many months would you say?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably around November, maybe October of last year. So, about eight or nine months now, I suppose. At first, I just thought I was tired from work, but it hasn’t really gone away, and it's definitely gotten more noticeable, particularly the eyelids. It’s… a little unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, eight or nine months of progressive weakness and drooping eyelids. We’ll definitely want to get to the bottom of this. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if that's alright. Have you noticed any changes in your vision besides the drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. And… yes, actually. It's a bit difficult to explain. Sometimes things seem… blurry, especially if I look to the side. And double vision, occasionally. It doesn't happen all the time, but it’s been happening more frequently as the weakness has gotten worse. I thought it might just be needing new glasses, but… now I’m not so sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry and double vision accompanying the weakness and eyelid drooping. That's important information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox, measles… nothing major. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy, but that’s about it. No serious illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. I generally consider myself quite healthy, until this started, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a bit tricky. My mother… she had some problems with her nerves, I think, when she was older. It was something with her muscles, but I don’t know the details. She passed away a few years ago, and my father wasn’t really one to talk about medical things. He was more of a stoic type. I have a sister, but I haven’t spoken to her in a long time, so I don’t know anything about her health either. It's not something we ever really discussed, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of some nerve or muscle issues on your mother's side, though details are unclear. That's helpful to know, even if it’s limited. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally – maybe once a week – but I don’t drink heavily. And definitely no drugs. I work a fairly stressful job, managing facilities, so I try to stay healthy to cope with that. I eat a reasonably balanced diet, and I try to get some exercise when I can, though it’s been difficult lately with… well, with this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no drugs, and a stressful job. That gives us a good picture. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any reactions to anything, as far as I know. I’m generally fine with most things. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven't had any issues with medications in the past, though I haven’t really taken much, to be honest. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that thorough information, Mr. Schaust. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if that's alright. I'll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and do a neurological exam. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schaust, let’s start with your eyes. Look straight ahead. Now, follow my finger… up and down, left and right. Good. Now, follow my finger as I move it in a circular motion. Okay, good. Now, I’m going to check your facial muscles. Can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I’m smiling. It feels a little… difficult, actually. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s alright. It’s helpful for me to see what feels difficult for you. Now, can you frown for me, please?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… harder than it looks.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, can you puff out your cheeks, please?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s a bit… uneven, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, I’m going to check your strength. I want you to try and resist me as I try to move your arms and legs. Just push back against me. We'll start with your arms. Push against my hand… like you’re trying to lift something heavy.
PATIENT: I’m… trying. It feels… weak. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, let’s check your legs. Just push against my hand, like you’re trying to keep your leg straight. And finally, I’ll just check your reflexes. Okay… thank you, Mr. Schaust. That’s enough for now. You can sit up when you’re ready. Based on this examination, you're exhibiting weakness in your arms and legs, drooping eyelids, and asymmetry in your facial muscles. Your reflexes appear normal, but the weakness is concerning. I want to order some blood tests and an MRI of your brain and orbit. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Blood tests and an MRI… that sounds… serious. What are you thinking it could be? Is it… something terrible?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mr. Schaust, and it’s good you’re asking questions. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings, we need to rule out a few possibilities. One possibility is Myasthenia Gravis, which is an autoimmune disorder that causes muscle weakness. Another possibility is a neurological condition affecting the nerves or brain. The MRI will help us rule out any structural problems in your brain, and the blood tests will look for antibodies associated with Myasthenia Gravis. It’s important to remember that these are just possibilities, and we won’t know for sure until we get the test results. It doesn’t necessarily mean it is something terrible. We’re just taking all the necessary steps to figure out what’s going on. Do you have any questions about these tests or what we’re looking for?
PATIENT: Myasthenia Gravis… that sounds… complicated. An autoimmune disorder? Is that… treatable? And what happens if the MRI shows something? What if there is something wrong with my brain? I… I don’t know much about any of this. What’s the next step, practically speaking? When will I get the test results?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, Mr. Schaust. Let's take things one step at a time. Yes, Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder, which means your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues – in this case, the connections between your nerves and muscles. Fortunately, it is treatable. There are medications that can help suppress the immune system and improve muscle strength. We can also explore other therapies, depending on the severity of your condition. If the MRI shows something, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a dire situation. It simply means we have more information to work with. Depending on what the MRI reveals, we might need to consult with a neurologist – a specialist in brain and nerve disorders – to discuss further treatment options. As for the next steps, I’ll write you a referral for the blood tests and the MRI. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment for the blood tests, and the MRI center will contact you to schedule the MRI. Typically, it takes about a week to get the results back from both tests. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, please try not to worry too much. It's important to stay positive and focus on taking care of yourself. Are there any specific concerns that are weighing on your mind that I can address right now?
PATIENT: A neurologist… that sounds… serious. I think… I'm mostly worried about what if it’s something that will get worse? What if I lose the ability to… do things? Work, hobbies… just… living my life. And… is there anything I should be doing now? Any precautions I should be taking?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be worried about that, Mr. Schaust. Those are valid concerns, and it’s good you’re voicing them. While it’s important to be prepared for all possibilities, it's also important to remember that many people with Myasthenia Gravis live full and productive lives with proper treatment. We will work together to manage your condition and minimize any potential impact on your quality of life. Regarding precautions, it’s a good idea to avoid activities that significantly worsen your weakness. Pay attention to what triggers your symptoms and try to rest when you feel fatigued. It's also important to be careful when driving or operating machinery, as weakness can impair your ability to react quickly. For now, focus on getting enough rest, eating a healthy diet, and managing your stress levels. Avoid strenuous activities until we have a clearer understanding of what's going on. I also recommend avoiding medications that can worsen Myasthenia Gravis, such as certain antibiotics. I’ll provide you with a list of medications to avoid when I give you the referral paperwork. I want to reassure you that we will be monitoring your condition closely and adjusting your treatment plan as needed. We are here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address right now?
PATIENT: Okay… that's… helpful. A list of medications to avoid… that’s good to know. I think… I'm just scared. This is all very overwhelming, and I don't know what to expect. I think that’s all my questions for now. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay to be scared, Mr. Schaust. It's a big thing to process, and it’s natural to feel overwhelmed. Remember, you’re not alone in this. I’m here to support you, and we’ll face this together. I’ll get the referral paperwork ready for you, and I’ll also include some information about Myasthenia Gravis that you can read over. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns that arise before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, Mr. Schaust, and try to stay positive. We'll get to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Vodzak. I appreciate your time and your reassurance. I’ll… I’ll schedule those tests right away. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
