DOCTOR: Good morning, Josie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Neeraj Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s get right to it. It’s this… stuff. Coming up. Reflux, the nurse said. It’s awful. Especially when I lie down. It just… comes back up. It’s embarrassing, really. A man my age shouldn’t be dealing with this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No worries at all, we'll get to the bottom of it. “Reflux” is a good starting point – it sounds like you're experiencing heartburn, which is often caused by stomach acid coming back up. And it is quite common, even at any age. So, when did this start?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t tell me it’s common. I eat properly, you know? Not like these youngsters with their… everything. Anyway, it started… hmm. Maybe six months ago? It wasn't constant, just now and then. But the last month, it’s been nearly every night. Keeps me up. And my wife complains about the noise. It’s… disruptive. You understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. It sounds like it’s definitely worsening, and disrupting your sleep isn't good. Six months ago, starting intermittently, now almost nightly for the past month… that’s helpful. Can you describe what this “stuff” feels like when it comes up?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… burnin’. That's the main thing. Like fire. And it tastes… sour. Not pleasant, believe me. And sometimes, there’s a bit of… you know, undigested food. Not a lot, but enough to be… noticeable. It’s not just liquid, if that makes sense. It’s… chunky sometimes. Really unpleasant. Honestly, it’s quite undignified for a man in my position.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning and sour taste, sometimes with undigested food… that certainly paints a clearer picture. And you mentioned it happens mostly when you lie down – does it happen at any other time, like after meals, or when you're bending over?
PATIENT: After meals, yeah, sometimes. Not every time, but often. Especially if I've had something… rich. Like a good Polish sausage. Don't get me wrong, I won't stop eating sausage, but it doesn't help. And bending over… no, not really. It’s mostly lying down and after I eat. And it's worse at night, definitely. Seems to just… creep up on me when I'm trying to sleep. It’s very inconvenient. I have important things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s triggered by eating, especially richer foods, and it’s worse at night when lying down. That’s helpful information. Now, have you noticed anything else happening alongside this?
PATIENT: Alongside? What do you mean? Like… other things? Well, I do get a bit of… bloating sometimes. After I eat, naturally. It's not constant, but I feel a bit… full. And maybe a little bit of… burping. Not excessively, but enough to be aware of it. And sometimes, a bit of a cough. But I've always had a bit of a cough, so I don't know if that's related. It's probably just the weather. You know, this rural air isn't always the best.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating, burping, and a cough. It’s good you mention the cough – even if you’ve always had it, it could be related, as stomach acid can sometimes irritate the throat. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, I'm a pretty healthy man. I've always been strong, worked hard my whole life. I had my prostate checked a few years back, everything was fine. Bit of high blood pressure, doctor said to watch my salt. That’s about it. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing serious. I'm not one for complainin', you know? I’ve always been able to handle things myself. But this… this reflux is gettin’ to me. It’s a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, managed with watching your salt intake, and a normal prostate check a few years ago. That’s good to know. And you haven’t been diagnosed with any other medical conditions. Do you take any medications regularly for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. The doctor suggested something for the blood pressure, but I just try to eat healthy and watch the salt. Seems to work fine. I'm a big believer in natural remedies, you know? Fresh air, good food, hard work. That's what keeps a man going. Not a bunch of chemicals. I really don’t take anything regularly. Just the occasional aspirin for a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications except for occasional aspirin. And no allergies to any medications that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, never had any allergies. Not to penicillin, not to anything. I’ve always been able to eat whatever I want. My wife tries to get me to eat more fruit, but honestly, I prefer a good sausage. Allergies are for weak people, if you ask me. I haven’t had any problems in that department, never. No, none at all. What's next? I really don't have all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And finally, let’s briefly talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has had similar problems like heartburn, acid reflux, or any digestive issues?
PATIENT: Digestive issues… hmm. My father… he had a bit of trouble with indigestion, I remember that. Always complainin’ about his stomach. He liked his rich food, too. And my aunt… she had ulcers, I think. Years ago. But that’s about it. No one else that I can recall. My mother was as healthy as a horse, and my brothers are both fine. It just seems to be a bit of a thing with the older generation, maybe. But honestly, I don’t pay much attention to family history. A man has to worry about himself, you know? It doesn’t do to dwell on the past. Now, are we getting anywhere? Because I really do need to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of indigestion in your father and ulcers in your aunt. That’s useful information. Alright, Josie, thank you for answering all my questions. Based on what you’ve told me – the heartburn, especially at night and after meals, the bloating, and the family history – it does sound like you are experiencing gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Now, before we jump to a diagnosis, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, just to listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Examination? Look, I've told you everything. I’m a perfectly healthy man. You've listened to my heart before, haven't you? It’s fine. I don’t see the point in poking around. Honestly, I’m wasting my time here. Can’t you just… give me something for the reflux? Something to stop it? I don’t need an examination, I need a solution. I’m not a child. I know my own body, and it’s telling me I need something to stop this burning. Now, are you going to help me, or not? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Josie. I understand your impatience, and I respect your feelings. However, even though you feel certain about what’s going on, a quick examination is a standard part of a medical assessment. It’s not about doubting you; it’s about ensuring I haven’t missed anything and that I’m prescribing the right treatment for you. It takes just a few minutes. If you absolutely refuse an examination, I can prescribe a trial of a proton pump inhibitor – that’s a medication that reduces stomach acid – but I strongly recommend at least letting me listen to your heart and lungs, just to be safe. It’s a small step that can make a big difference. What do you say?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But make it quick. I really don't have all day. Just listen to your… whatever you need to listen to. But no poking, no prodding, no unnecessary nonsense. Just listen and get on with it. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. But if you insist. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Josie. Thank you for allowing me. This won’t take long at all. Okay, everything sounds good, Josie. Your heart and lungs are clear, and your abdomen is soft, although a bit full. No signs of anything concerning. Now, based on your symptoms and the examination, it is likely you are experiencing GERD. I recommend we start with a trial of a proton pump inhibitor – a medication called omeprazole. It helps reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces. I’ll write you a prescription for 20mg once daily for two weeks. Take it 30 minutes before a meal, preferably breakfast. Also, I'd like to suggest a few lifestyle changes that can help: Avoid trigger foods: Spicy foods, fatty foods, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, and citrus fruits can worsen symptoms. Eat smaller, more frequent meals. Don’t lie down for at least 3 hours after eating. Elevate the head of your bed by 6-8 inches. We can reassess after two weeks and see how you're doing. If your symptoms don't improve, or if they worsen, we may need to consider further testing, such as an endoscopy. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just get me the pills. And make sure they work. Honestly, I don't have time for this. I've got a garden to tend, you know. And a reputation to uphold. Just… the pills. And tell me how much they cost. I don’t want any surprises. And no, I won’t be changing my diet. I eat perfectly fine as it is. Just the pills, please. This has been a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Josie. I've written the prescription for omeprazole 20mg. The cost will vary depending on your insurance coverage, but it’s typically around $20-$40 for a two-week supply. You can fill it at any pharmacy convenient for you. I understand you're reluctant to change your diet, but even small adjustments can make a significant difference in managing your symptoms. However, I respect your decision. Here’s a printed summary of our conversation and instructions for taking the medication. If you experience any side effects – such as nausea, diarrhea, or constipation – please contact the clinic immediately. And if your symptoms don't improve after two weeks, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… good day. And let’s hope these pills work. I don’t have time for this nonsense. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Josie. I wish you a good day as well. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. .
