DOCTOR: Right. Teretha Uzarski, 63. Okay, let’s get this over with. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's my hands, mostly. They've been…tingling. Like when your foot falls asleep, but in my fingers. It's been going on for a little while now, and honestly, I don't have time for this. It makes it hard to sort the mail, you know? I need to get back to my route.
DOCTOR: Tingling, right. And how long is "a little while"?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... maybe a month? A month and a half, something like that. It comes and goes. Some days it's barely noticeable, other days it feels like pins and needles all the time. I thought maybe I just slept on them wrong, but it hasn't really gone away completely. It’s mostly in both hands, but the left one feels a bit worse, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Both hands, worse on the left. Any weakness?
PATIENT: Weakness…hmm. Not really weakness, no. It’s just…harder to grip sometimes. Like, if I'm carrying a heavy bag of mail, my hand feels like it might give out, but I haven’t actually dropped anything yet. It just feels less secure, you know? It's hard to explain. And honestly, I’ve been carrying mail for so long, my hands are always a little tired. Is that what you mean by weakness?
DOCTOR: No, I mean can you squeeze?
PATIENT: Well, yes! Of course I can squeeze. See? I'm not completely useless. But like I said, it’s just…not as strong as it used to be. Everything gets weaker with age, doesn’t it? Is there something wrong with my nerves or something? My neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, she had something with her hands, and she ended up in a wheelchair… I don’t want that!
DOCTOR: Right, right. Look, let’s just get this over with. I'll have a quick look. Extend your arms. Palms up. No visible deformities, reflexes…present, though a little diminished. Could be anything. Do you have diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Diabetes? No, no, I don’t think so. Never been told, anyway. My husband, God rest his soul, he had a bit of trouble with his sugar, but I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I eat okay, I mean, it’s hard to eat perfectly when you’re running around all day, but no, no diabetes that I know of. I don’t go to the doctor much, honestly. Waste of time and money. Is it something serious? You're making me nervous now.
DOCTOR: Look, it could be serious. It could be nothing. Probably nothing. Let’s just say it’s likely some kind of mild nerve compression. Carpal tunnel, maybe. Or just age. I’ll write you something for the inflammation. Take two of these twice a day for a week. If it doesn't improve, then we'll talk. Next patient.
PATIENT: Well…okay. Inflammation, huh? I don’t even know what that means, really. And what if it doesn’t improve? What happens then? Will I need…tests? Or something more serious? And… will this make me sleepy? I need to be alert on my route! Oh dear, this isn’t what I needed today. .
DOCTOR: Look, if it doesn’t improve, then we'll discuss it. Probably a referral. And no, it shouldn’t make you significantly sleepy. Though, don’t operate heavy machinery. Now, is there anything else?
