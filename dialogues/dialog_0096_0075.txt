DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this tiredness, you see. Even with the machine, the one I use at night... I’m just so sleepy during the day. It’s been going on for a while now, and frankly, it’s a bit of a nuisance. I try to take naps, but they don’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Hmm, the machine… you mean a CPAP?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! A CPAP. My wife – well, my ex-wife – she was the one who really pushed for it. Said I snored like a freight train. And she was right, I suppose. It definitely helps when I'm using it, but… this daytime sleepiness just won’t go away. I’ve been using it pretty regularly, I think. As much as I should, anyway. Sometimes I forget to put it on when I travel, if I'm only going for a night or two.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you're saying even with consistent CPAP use, you're still experiencing significant daytime fatigue. And you admit to not always using it when you travel. How often would you say you don't use it when traveling?
PATIENT: Well, let me think... probably about half the time when I travel. If it’s just a one-night trip, or maybe two, I tend to leave it behind. It’s a bit of a hassle to carry, you see. And truthfully, I don't always feel like dealing with it. I used to think a little less sleep wouldn’t matter too much for a night or two, but maybe I was wrong. I go to see my daughter in Florida a couple of times a year, and I usually don’t take it then. It's only a short plane ride, and I figure I can catch up on rest when I get there. But… maybe that’s part of the problem.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Paske, consistency is key with these things. Intermittent use isn’t going to give you the full benefit, and it can actually worsen things in the long run. But we’ll get to that. Besides the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. I hadn't really thought of it that way, you're right. My daughter always tells me I need to listen to the doctors more! Hmm… other symptoms… Let me think. Sometimes I wake up with a dry mouth, even with the humidifier on the machine. And I suppose I feel a little… foggy in the morning, not quite as sharp as I used to be. Not a lot, but noticeable. My memory isn't what it used to be, of course – that comes with age, I guess! But I’d say the biggest thing is just this persistent tiredness, and feeling a little… sluggish during the day. No headaches, no… I don’t think so. Just tired. Really tired.
DOCTOR: Okay. Dry mouth, morning fog… and persistent fatigue. Have you noticed any weight changes recently, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Weight changes… well, yes, actually. I’ve put on a little weight in the last year, maybe ten pounds or so. It’s probably the pandemic, you know? Not getting out as much, eating more at home… it happens. And I don’t get as much exercise as I used to. My knees aren’t what they used to be, so long walks are a bit difficult. I try to stay active, but it’s a struggle, honestly. I used to be quite the swimmer, but that was years ago. Now… well, now I mostly read and watch a bit of television.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. And before we move on, have you ever been formally diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago. My regular doctor put me on medication for it, and it’s been pretty well controlled ever since. I have my checkups every six months, and he seems happy with how things are going. Oh, and I had a bout of diverticulitis a few years back, but that was just a one-time thing. They took care of it with antibiotics, and I haven't had any trouble since. Otherwise… I’m pretty healthy for an eighty-three-year-old, I think! Nothing major, nothing that would explain this tiredness, at least not that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think... Just the blood pressure medication, a small dose every morning. Oh, and sometimes I take an over-the-counter sleep aid, melatonin, if I’m really having trouble falling asleep. But I don’t use it every night, only occasionally. Maybe once or twice a week, if I’m feeling particularly restless. And I take a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. That’s about it, I think. Nothing fancy. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father had heart problems later in life, a bit of congestive heart failure, I think. And my mother had diabetes, but she developed it when she was quite old, in her eighties. And, well, my older brother, he struggled with sleep apnea for years, similar to me. He eventually got a CPAP machine, but he didn’t use it consistently, like me. He… he passed away a few years ago, unfortunately. Not directly from the sleep apnea, but it certainly didn’t help. It's a bit of a sensitive topic, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. Thank you for sharing that. It's helpful to know. And finally, before we move on to a brief exam, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history… well, as I mentioned, I’m divorced. It was a long time ago, amicable, mostly. I live alone now. I have my daughter, she lives in Florida, we talk on the phone a lot, and I visit when I can. I have a few friends, mostly from a book club I’m in, we meet once a month. I used to travel more, but I don’t as much anymore. It's harder to get around these days. Mostly, I keep to myself, read a lot, watch television… a pretty quiet life, really. Nothing too exciting. I don't drink alcohol, haven’t for many years, and I’ve never smoked. That's about it, I think. A simple life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. Thank you for providing all of that information. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your throat and nose. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I understand. I trust your judgment, and I’m happy to do whatever you need to get to the bottom of this tiredness. Let's get it sorted out, shall we? It's been going on long enough.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we'll get started. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your history. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Now, open your mouth wide and say “ah.” Throat looks normal. No redness or swelling. And finally, let me take a look in your nose. Nose is clear as well. No obvious signs of obstruction. Overall, the physical exam doesn't reveal anything immediately concerning, but we'll need to run some blood tests to rule out other potential causes of your fatigue.
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests seem like a good idea. What sort of things will they be looking for? And will I need to fast beforehand, or is it okay to eat normally? I always forget these things, you know!
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s understandable to forget. We’ll be looking for a complete blood count to check for anemia and any signs of infection. We’ll also check your thyroid levels, as an underactive thyroid can cause fatigue. We’ll also do a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and check your blood sugar levels. And yes, you do need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. No food or drinks, other than water. It’s important for accurate results. I’ll have the nurse give you a requisition form and instructions. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available, typically within a few days.
PATIENT: Okay, eight hours, no food, just water. I can manage that, I think. I’ll write it down right away so I don’t forget. And will the nurse schedule the blood work for me, or do I need to do that myself? And roughly how long will the appointment take? I have a book club meeting on Wednesday, so I need to make sure I have enough time.
DOCTOR: The nurse will schedule the blood work for you. She can usually get you in at the lab right across the street, which is convenient. The appointment itself shouldn't take more than fifteen to twenty minutes, once you’re there. They’ll just need a few vials of blood. It's a relatively simple procedure, Mr. Paske. And it's important to get this done so we can figure out what’s causing your fatigue. It’s unlikely to interfere with your book club meeting. Now, while we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend that you try to be more consistent with your CPAP use. Really make an effort to use it every night, even when you travel. And let’s also try to address your weight. Even a small amount of weight loss can make a difference. Do you think you can commit to that?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand, Doctor. Consistency with the CPAP, I’ll really try. And I'll do my best with the weight, though it's harder to get motivated these days. It’s a bit discouraging, you know? I keep telling myself I'll start tomorrow, and then tomorrow turns into next week… But I’ll make a conscious effort. I promise. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. It’s reassuring to know you’re taking this seriously. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It helps to understand what’s going on. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go find the nurse and schedule that blood work. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Paske. The nurse’s station is just around the corner. And do try to be punctual with your appointment. .
