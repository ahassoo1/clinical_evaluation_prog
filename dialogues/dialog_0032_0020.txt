DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Avril. It is nice to meet you too. I… I am here for this… telehealth thing? My daughter, she made the appointment for me. I am not very good with… all of this new stuff. She said I need to talk to a doctor, but I feel okay, mostly.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, your daughter clearly had some concerns. While I appreciate you feeling “mostly” okay, it's important to understand that preventative care—and addressing potential issues before they become serious—is vital. It’s good of her to be proactive. So, let's try to be specific. Can you tell me what prompted your daughter to schedule this appointment?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, good point. She… she worries. I work with cars all day, you know? Automotive work. Very physical. And sometimes my back… it hurts. Not all the time, but after a long day, lifting… things. She said I should have someone check it before it gets… worse. She also mentioned… something about my hands? They sometimes feel a little… numb. But it goes away. I do not understand why this needs a doctor visit. Is it very bad?
DOCTOR: Right. Automotive work. And discomfort in your back and hands. It’s… not necessarily “bad,” Ms. Benites, but it certainly warrants investigation. Back pain is exceedingly common, but persistent or recurring pain can indicate a more significant underlying issue. As for the numbness in your hands, that could be a number of things – nerve compression, circulation problems… things we need to rule out. To get a clearer picture, let's start with your back pain. When did it begin?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it begin… That is a good question. It has been… a little at a time, I think? Not one big injury. Maybe… six months ago? It started very small, just a little ache after a long day. Now, it is more. Not every day, but… when I bend over, or lift something heavy, then it hurts. I take some… pills. For the pain. My daughter buys them for me. I do not remember the name.
DOCTOR: “Some pills” and “six months ago…” Right. It’s important we identify what medication you’re taking, Ms. Benites. Could you perhaps bring the bottle in with you next time?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, good idea. I will ask my daughter. She keeps those things. I do not like to… bother with the medicine too much. I just want to keep working. I like my job. It keeps me busy. Is it… bad that I waited so long to come see someone? Should I have come sooner?
DOCTOR: Ms. Benites, delaying medical attention is rarely optimal. While I understand your desire to remain active, ignoring potential problems often leads to more complex—and costly—issues down the line. It's better to be proactive, as your daughter wisely suggested. Now, let's focus on these symptoms. You mentioned the pain worsens with bending and lifting. Is there any pain when you're not active?
PATIENT: No, not usually. When I am sitting, or lying down, then it is okay. Sometimes… a little ache in the morning, when I first get up. But it goes away quickly. And the numbness in my hands… that is only when I have been working on a car for a long time. Like when I am using… the wrench. It feels… tingly. And sometimes a little weak. But it always goes away if I rest my hands. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: “Tingly and weak…” That description is… not particularly reassuring, Ms. Benites. It could be a sign of carpal tunnel syndrome, or ulnar nerve entrapment – common conditions in trades like yours. But we need to confirm that with a proper examination. To get a better understanding, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I do not think so. I have never been very sick. When I was a little girl, I had the measles, I think. And I had my… shots. But that was a long time ago. My blood pressure… the doctor at the shop checks it sometimes. He says it is okay. But I do not remember the numbers. He just says, "You are fine." I do not think I have… diabetes. My daughter would know, I think. She is a nurse. She worries about everything. Is it… bad to not remember these things?
DOCTOR: Ms. Benites, relying on the shop doctor and your daughter's recollection is… insufficient. It’s vital that you have a complete and accurate medical history. It impacts treatment decisions significantly. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. My mother, she was allergic to… cats, I think. But I like cats! I do not have any cats now. I used to. But… they are a lot of work. I do not remember any allergies for myself. I have always been… strong. Very healthy. I just want to know if I can keep working. That is all.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's proceed with a physical examination. I'd like to assess your range of motion, muscle strength, and reflexes. We'll also check your hands for any signs of nerve compression. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. I will lie down. But… it is a little cold in here, no? And… is this table clean? I do not want to catch anything. I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: The examination table is thoroughly sanitized after each patient, Ms. Benites. And the temperature is within standard medical facility parameters. Now, if you could lie flat on your back, please. I'm going to start by palpating your spine to assess for any tenderness or muscle spasms.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Flat on my back. But… be gentle, please. My back… it is sensitive. And I do not like anyone touching it. It feels… strange. Are you sure you washed your hands? I do not want to catch anything. I have a very important job to do tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Ms. Benites, I assure you, I have followed all proper hygiene protocols. And I will be as gentle as possible. I am simply attempting to identify the source of your discomfort. I’m detecting some muscle spasms in your lower back. It’s not surprising, given the nature of your work. Can you tell me on a scale of one to ten, with one being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what level of pain you're experiencing right now with this pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Maybe… a three? It is not very bad. But it is… uncomfortable. Like someone is pressing on a sore spot. You are pressing very hard. Can you… be a little softer, please? I need to go to work tomorrow. I have a car to fix. It is a very important car. A red one.
DOCTOR: A three. Alright. Now, if you could try to bend forward, reaching towards your toes. I understand you need to be able to work tomorrow, Ms. Benites, and I’m not attempting to cause you any pain. I simply need to assess your range of motion. I’m observing some limitations in your forward flexion. And I can see you’re experiencing discomfort. Now, let's try bending backwards. Slowly, please.
PATIENT: Oh… Ouch! That is… very painful. I cannot do that. It hurts too much. I think something is wrong. Maybe… maybe I should just go home. I do not need any more tests. I just need to rest. And take some pills. My daughter… she has some good pills. But I do not remember the name. Please… can I sit up now? I feel dizzy.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Sit up slowly, Ms. Benites. You're experiencing significant discomfort, and I’m not going to push you further. It appears we’ve identified some limitations in your spinal mobility and some tenderness. Given your symptoms and the discomfort you're experiencing, I recommend we order some imaging studies—an X-ray of your lumbar spine—to rule out any underlying structural issues. And I also want to order some blood work to assess for inflammation. I’m also going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help alleviate some of the pain and spasm. However, please be aware this will cause drowsiness, so do not operate heavy machinery or drive while taking it. And I would advise you take a break from any strenuous activity for at least a few days. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests and pills… I do not like tests. And I need to go to work. I have a car to fix. A red one! My customer is waiting. But… a red one… that is a very important car. So, you mean… I cannot work? For a few days? And I will be… sleepy? I do not want to be sleepy. What if… what if something happens at the shop? I need to be strong. I am the best mechanic they have. Is there… is there anything else I can do? Maybe just some… cream? Or a bandage? I do not want to take pills. And I really, really need to go to work.
DOCTOR: Ms. Benites, I understand your concern about work. However, continuing to strain your back in your current condition could exacerbate the problem and lead to chronic pain. I am recommending these tests and medication to prevent that from happening. While a cream or bandage may provide some temporary relief, it will not address the underlying issue. The muscle relaxant is a short-term solution to help alleviate the spasm and pain while we await the results of the imaging and blood work. I am not trying to prevent you from working. I am trying to ensure you can continue working safely and without causing further damage to your back. And frankly, attempting to push through this pain demonstrates poor judgment, Ms. Benites. I will write you a prescription for the muscle relaxant, and I will have my nurse schedule you for an X-ray and blood work. We can discuss the results at your follow-up appointment in one week. In the meantime, I strongly advise you avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions about this plan?
PATIENT: One week…? That is a long time! What if… what if the red car breaks down? My customer will be very angry. And… what about the shop? They need me. They cannot fix cars without me. And… what if the tests are… bad? What if something is… broken? I do not want to be broken. I need to be strong. I am strong! I… I think I need to sit down. Or… maybe I need to go home. Right now. I do not feel very good. This is too much. Too many tests. Too many pills. I just want to fix cars. That is all I want. Can I just go home? Please? I promise… I will try to rest. But… I need to go home. Now.
DOCTOR: Nurse, could you please come in here immediately?
