DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it's… it's about having a baby. I want to make sure everything works before I even try. You know? I don't have time for problems. My husband… well, he's gone now, and I'd like to do this right, if that makes sense. No messing around.
DOCTOR: I understand. You want to have a pre-conception check-up to assess your fertility and overall health before attempting to get pregnant. It’s responsible of you to think ahead. "No messing around" is a good attitude. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Honestly? I… I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago, and things just… blur. I had the usual childhood stuff, I guess. Chickenpox, measles… nothing major. And after that… not much. I mean, I was healthy. I am healthy. I don’t go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. Is this going to take long? Because I have a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can work with that. It's helpful to know you generally feel healthy. Sometimes even seemingly minor things can be relevant, but we'll proceed. Do you happen to know if you’ve had any complications during any previous pregnancies, even if they were a long time ago?
PATIENT: Oh. That. Well… I had a miscarriage, years and years ago. Before… before my husband got sick. It was… early. Very early. I don't remember much about it, thankfully. They just… gave me some pills and told me to rest. It was… a long time ago. Is that important? I really don't like talking about this.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Villarreal. Even an early miscarriage can give us some information. It’s good you told me. Do you know if any testing was done at that time to determine the cause?
PATIENT: Testing? No. They didn’t… do anything like that back then. Like I said, they just gave me pills. It was a different time, you know? People didn't fuss over every little thing. Honestly, I don't see what digging up the past is going to do. I just want to know if I can have a baby, not relive old sadness. Is this going to involve a lot of poking and prodding? I really hate needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to dwell on the past, Ms. Villarreal, and I apologize if my questions are upsetting. We'll try to be efficient. Some blood work is necessary to assess your hormone levels and check for any underlying conditions that could affect fertility. It’s standard procedure. And yes, it will involve a blood draw. We may also want to do a pelvic exam. It's best to have a complete picture. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood work. Of course. Fine. Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I think I reacted to penicillin once, a long time ago. Made me itchy. But that was… ages ago, like when I was a kid. And honestly, I don’t go to doctors enough to have allergies, you know? Look, can we just get this over with? I have things to do. And please, tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. We will, of course, avoid that. Alright, let’s move forward. Before we proceed with the blood draw, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any fertility issues?
PATIENT: Family history… oh, lord. Where do I even start? My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And her sister… she had some kind of cancer, a long time ago. But that was in Ghana, and things weren't… well, they weren't like here. As for fertility issues… honestly, people didn't talk about that back then. My grandmother had a lot of children, so I guess no. Look, is this really necessary? I'm starting to feel very impatient. I just want to know if I can have a baby. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I understand your frustration, truly. It’s just that certain conditions can increase your risk, and it's important to rule things out. Alright, let's move on to your social history, if you don't mind. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh, are you sure you need to know all of this? Okay, fine. I don't smoke. Haven't touched a cigarette in years. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And absolutely not, no drugs. Never. I'm a respectable woman. Now, can we please get to the part where you tell me if I can have a baby? This is ridiculous. I'm wasting my whole day here.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I assure you I'm asking these questions because I want to provide you with the best possible care. It is important to gather as much information as possible. However, I can see that you are understandably anxious. We can proceed with the blood work and a pelvic exam, and we will discuss the results afterwards. But please understand that it will take some time to get those results. I'll also want to discuss some lifestyle factors, even if you don’t think they are relevant. We will start with the blood work. Do you have any concerns about that?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. No, I don't have any "concerns." I just… don't like needles, okay? And please, tell the nurse to be quick about it. I really don't want to be here all day. And don't fuss over me. I'm a grown woman. Just take the blood and tell me the results. Is there anything else you need to interrogate me about? Because frankly, I'm losing my patience. .
DOCTOR: Alright. It seems we've covered the basics for now. I will have the nurse come in to draw your blood. She will be gentle, I assure you. We'll take it from there. Please change into the gown in the exam room. I'll be back shortly to discuss the next steps once the blood work is sent to the lab. .
