DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a check-up. For the insurance. I need to have this done before it starts, yes? Medicare told me I must.
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds right. Medicare does require a baseline check-up when you first enroll. Perfectly understandable. So, a general check-up… alright. Now, to get started, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to come in today?
PATIENT: Why I decided? Well, the insurance will not pay if I do not come. It is a formality, no? I do not feel sick. I work. I eat. I sleep. Everything is… acceptable. I do not understand why you ask me what I think. The government says I come.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, and I apologize. Sometimes we get caught up in the paperwork. It’s just… even with the insurance requirement, it’s helpful for me to understand what’s going on with you specifically. Are there any concerns you have, even if they’re small?
PATIENT: Small concerns? Like what? I lift heavy boxes at work, sometimes my back… feels it. But this is work. Everyone feels it. It is not a concern. It is… expected. I do not go to doctors for expected things. That is… a waste of time, no?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re very practical. But even expected things can be worth checking out, just to make sure everything is as it should be. You're right, we don't want to waste time, but preventative care can often stop bigger issues down the line. So, this back discomfort… how long has it been happening?
PATIENT: Preventative… care. Hmm. It is happening… for years. Since I started the job, two years ago. It is not… sharp pain. It is… tired. Like the muscles are always working. I rub it with… cream. It helps a little. But it always comes back. It is just the job, Doctor. I do not think it is… important.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Tired” muscles, happens since you started the job two years ago, and the cream provides some relief. That gives me a little more to work with. Now, aside from your back, are there any other things going on with your health?
PATIENT: Other things? No. I eat rice, meat, vegetables. I drink water. I do not… smoke. I do not drink alcohol, not much. Sometimes I feel… warm, after working hard. But that is just the sun, yes? We work outside. It is August. It is supposed to be warm. I do not understand why you ask so many questions.
DOCTOR: I apologize again for the questions, Mr. Barban. It's just my job to try and get a complete picture of your health. It helps me to make sure nothing is being overlooked. You mentioned feeling warm after work, and that’s good to know. Is it just a general warm feeling, or do you feel a feverish temperature at any point?
PATIENT: A feverish… temperature? No. It is just… hot. Like after running. Not sick hot. Just… tired hot. My face is red, maybe. But it goes away when I rest. I do not take my temperature. I do not have a… thermometer. What is the point? I am a worker, not a… patient.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no feverish feeling, just a warm, flushed face after work that resolves with rest. That’s helpful. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? No. Never. I am strong. I lift heavy things. I do not… go to doctors. My father, he worked hard. He never went to doctors. He lived a long life. So, no. No conditions. I do not have… problems.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And it’s wonderful that your father lived a long life. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Hospital? No. I cut my finger once, when I was a boy, but my mother… she cleaned it. She put a bandage on it. That is all. I do not need… hospitals. They are for… sick people. I am not sick. I repeat this. It feels… strange, this conversation. Why do you ask me about things that are not… happening?
DOCTOR: You're right to feel that way, Mr. Barban. I apologize for making you repeat yourself. It's standard procedure for a new patient exam to ask about past medical history, even if everything seems fine now. It just helps me build a complete picture, and ensures we aren’t missing anything. It's for preventative reasons, as we discussed. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? My father, he is… gone. He worked hard. He did not… complain. My mother, she is in Yemen. I send her money. She is… old. She has… aches. But she does not go to doctors either. She says it is… a waste of time. So… my family does not have… history. They work. They live. They do not need… history. It is… frustrating, this conversation. Are we finished?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Barban. It sounds like you come from a family that values hard work and self-reliance, and that's admirable. You've been very clear about your health and your family's history—or lack thereof. Just a few more quick questions, and then we can move on to a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I touch everything. I work with… dust, and dirt, and… things. I do not… react. Never. I am strong. I do not have… weak reactions. This is… enough questions, Doctor. Can we finish now? I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. And you’re right, I’ve asked a lot of questions. I apologize for that. One final question, then we can move on to a quick physical exam – just to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, if you are willing. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No. I take nothing. I rub cream on my back. That is… it. No pills. No… liquids. Nothing. I do not need… medicine. I work. I rest. That is enough. Are we finished now? I do not want to waste your time, or mine.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, just the cream for your back. Thank you for being so honest with me, Mr. Barban. So, to summarize, you’re a healthy 28-year-old male, working outdoors, with no known allergies or medical conditions, and you're only using cream for some occasional back discomfort. If you're willing, I’d like to just do a quick physical exam – check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and quickly examine your back. It will only take a few minutes. If you’re not comfortable with that, we can skip it, but it's standard procedure. What do you say?
PATIENT: Skip it. I do not want you to… touch me. I am fine. I told you this. I work. I rest. It is enough. I need to go now. This is… a waste of time. I have work tomorrow. I do not need… examinations. Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. I understand. If you’re not comfortable with a physical exam, that’s perfectly fine. I’ve documented everything we discussed. Just remember, if you do experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to seek medical attention. And if anything changes, come and see me. Thank you for coming in today. I wish you all the best at work. Goodbye, Mr. Barban. .
