DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. KROK. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. An… issue has presented itself. A most unwelcome issue, I assure you. It’s been… discharging, you see. From… down there. It’s not a pleasant sensation, and my wife, bless her heart, insisted I come get it looked at. Though, frankly, I don’t see what they know about these things.
DOCTOR: Discharging, you say. Alright. It’s good your wife encouraged you to come in; these things are best addressed promptly. And it’s perfectly alright to feel embarrassed, Mr. KROK, it's a sensitive topic. To help me understand, can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. It’s… well, it’s liquid, naturally. Not a solid, thankfully. And… yellowish, I suppose. Though, it could be… whitish, sometimes? It’s difficult to say precisely. It isn’t… copious, but it’s there. And rather… odorous, if I’m being honest. Not a perfume, certainly. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, I couldn’t say how long. A week, perhaps? Maybe longer. Time slips away, you know.
DOCTOR: Yellowish or whitish, liquid discharge, and an odor… occurring for about a week, possibly longer. Alright. And is it accompanied by any other symptoms, Mr. KROK?
PATIENT: Symptoms… well, there’s a slight… burning sensation when I… urinate. Not excruciating, mind you, but noticeable. And… a certain discomfort. A general… ache, if you will. It’s not constant, thankfully. But it’s there. And I've felt… rather fatigued lately, though that could just be my age. It's all rather unsettling, Doctor. A man shouldn't have to deal with such things.
DOCTOR: Burning with urination, general discomfort, and fatigue… Alright. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t believe so. My wife would have mentioned it, she’s quite attentive to my temperature. Chills, no. And pain… not precisely pain, Doctor. More of a… dull ache, as I said. Lower abdomen… perhaps a little tenderness, if I press on it. Back… no, my back always aches, that’s just old age again. I assure you, Doctor, I’m a robust man, despite my years. It’s likely just a minor… irritation. Though, my wife insists otherwise, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any changes in your urinary habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my… urinary habits? What do you mean, precisely? I mean, I urinate when I need to, as one does. Perhaps… I’ve been going a little more frequently, now that you mention it. But that could be the tea, you know. My wife makes a lovely chamomile. And… it feels a bit… strained sometimes. Not a full blockage, mind you, just a little… effort required. It’s all rather delicate, Doctor. I’m not accustomed to discussing such personal matters.
DOCTOR: Alright, so increased frequency and some straining. Now, have you had any sexually transmitted infections in the past, or have you had any new sexual partners recently?
PATIENT: Excuse me? Doctor, I find that question rather… indelicate. I have been a married man for over fifty years! My wife and I have been faithful to each other. The implication is… frankly, offensive. I will not dignify that question with a response. I assure you, I have lived a respectable life. I expected more discretion from a medical professional.
DOCTOR: Mr. KROK, I apologize if my question was inappropriate. It is standard procedure to inquire about such things to ensure a thorough assessment, regardless of marital status. It is simply part of ruling out all possible causes. However, I respect your boundaries and will not press the matter further. Now, let's move on. Have you had any recent surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Very well. I appreciate your apology, Doctor. A man should be afforded some respect, even when discussing… unpleasantness. Surgeries… hmm. I had my appendix removed, oh, decades ago. And I broke my arm when I was a boy, playing football. A rather foolish endeavor, in hindsight. And… a hernia operation, perhaps fifteen years ago? It's all rather hazy, you understand. Time does slip away. But that's all I can recall, offhand. Nothing recent, certainly. I assure you, Doctor, I’m a remarkably healthy man for my age. Perhaps we are overthinking this entire matter.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal, broken arm, and hernia repair… alright. Now, could you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Family medical history… a rather grim topic, if I’m honest. My father… he suffered from heart problems. Passed away quite young, actually. My mother… she had diabetes, I believe. And… my brother, he had some sort of… trouble with his kidneys. But beyond that… I’m not terribly knowledgeable about the intricacies of family ailments. We weren’t a family given to discussing such things, you understand. It was considered… indelicate. A rather unfortunate lot, if I’m honest. I seem to be the last man standing. Perhaps I’ve simply been fortunate.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never experienced any… untoward reactions to anything. I eat a rather simple diet, you see. My wife is quite particular about what she prepares. No shellfish, I believe. Though, that’s more a matter of preference than allergy. And… I occasionally sneeze when the dust is stirred, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I’m a remarkably resilient man, Doctor. I rarely succumb to ailments of any kind. It’s likely just a minor… irritation, as I said before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me see. My doctor prescribed something for my blood pressure, a small pill. I take that… every morning, I believe. And… sometimes, for my arthritis, a pain reliever. But that’s only when it flares up. Beyond that… no, I don't take much of anything. My wife gives me a bit of turmeric in my tea, for its health benefits, but that's hardly a medication, is it? I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible, Doctor. Chemicals are rarely the answer.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. KROK. Now, I’m going to need to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Well, I suppose it’s necessary, if you insist. Though, frankly, I’m not terribly fond of such intrusions. I’m an old man, Doctor. A bit… fragile, you understand. Just… be gentle, if you please. And… I would prefer to keep it as brief as possible. My wife will be quite upset if I’m unduly discomforted.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. KROK. I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. I’ll start with checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. And finally, I’ll need to examine your abdomen and… the source of your discomfort. Please let me know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable at any point. Your blood pressure is 145 over 88. A bit elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I need to examine your lower abdomen. Please point to where you’re experiencing the discomfort.
PATIENT: Right… here. It’s not… sharp pain, Doctor. More of a… tenderness. And… it’s a bit sensitive. Please, be gentle. This is… rather unsettling, you understand. I really must insist, Doctor, no rough handling. My wife will be most displeased.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m feeling some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, as you mentioned. There’s no guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. I'm also noting some slight redness and mild swelling around the opening of your urethra. I see some whitish discharge as well. Does this cause you any pain when I touch it?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, Doctor, that is… decidedly uncomfortable. Not excruciating, but… unpleasant. And… sensitive. Please, be careful. You’re poking around in a rather… delicate area. This is most… distressing. I really wish we could expedite this process. My wife will be quite concerned if I return in such a state. Is there anything… conclusive you can determine from this examination, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. KROK. Based on the physical exam, it appears you have urethritis, which is an inflammation of the urethra. The redness, swelling, and discharge are consistent with that diagnosis. The tenderness and burning sensation during urination also support this finding. However, the cause of the urethritis needs to be determined. It can be caused by a number of things, including a sexually transmitted infection, a urinary tract infection, or irritation from chemicals. To determine the cause, I need to order a urine test to check for bacteria and other signs of infection. I will also recommend a swab test to check for sexually transmitted infections. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… of course. What else could one do? Though, frankly, I find the entire notion… rather distasteful. And the implication of… that… is most unwelcome. But if it’s necessary to determine the cause, I suppose I have no choice. Just… please be as quick and discreet as possible, Doctor. And I trust you’ll maintain complete confidentiality? My reputation is at stake, you understand. And… what exactly does one do if… the results are unfavorable?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. KROK. I understand your concerns, and I assure you everything will be handled with the utmost discretion and confidentiality. I will explain the process thoroughly, and we will proceed as quickly as possible. The urine test is a simple collection in a sterile cup. The swab test will involve a gentle collection of a sample from your urethra. Both tests are relatively painless, though you may experience some mild discomfort. If the tests reveal a sexually transmitted infection, we will discuss treatment options, which typically involve antibiotics. If it's a urinary tract infection, antibiotics will also be prescribed. And if it's due to irritation, we will identify the source of the irritation and avoid it. In all cases, it's important to complete the full course of treatment, even if your symptoms improve. I will write the orders for the tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician will explain the process to you. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable… I suppose it’s the only course of action. Though, frankly, the entire prospect fills me with dread. Tests, antibiotics… it’s all rather… undignified. Very well, Doctor. Proceed with the orders. Just… please be as swift and discreet as possible. And I trust these tests are… accurate? I wouldn’t want to be subjected to unnecessary treatment. And… one final question, if you don’t mind. Will this… affect my ability to… continue my usual activities? My wife and I have plans, you see. A man deserves some comfort, even in his declining years.
DOCTOR: Here are the orders for the urine test and swab test. The lab technician will explain the process to you. As for your question, Mr. KROK, it depends on the results of the tests. If it's a bacterial infection, you may experience some mild discomfort during urination for a few days while taking antibiotics. However, you should be able to continue your usual activities, as long as you stay hydrated and avoid strenuous activity. If it's a sexually transmitted infection, we will discuss specific recommendations based on the type of infection. It may be necessary to abstain from sexual activity for a period of time to allow for treatment and prevent the spread of the infection. I will also provide you with instructions on how to prevent future infections. I understand your concerns, Mr. KROK, and I will do everything I can to ensure your comfort and privacy throughout this process. Do you have any other questions before you go to the lab?
PATIENT: No… I believe that covers it. Though, frankly, I’m not entirely reassured. But I suppose one must face these things, however unpleasant. Very well, Doctor. I shall proceed to the lab. Thank you… for your assistance, I suppose. And… please, maintain complete confidentiality. My reputation is at stake. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. KROK. Your privacy is my utmost priority. I wish you all the best. .
