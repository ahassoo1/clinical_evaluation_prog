DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Bakan. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today because I am looking into a senior living facility. They require a doctor's clearance, you see, to ensure I am fit for residence. A formality, mostly, but a necessary one. I bake, you know. Good bread. But a fellow gets older, and things… become more difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. A doctor’s clearance is quite standard for those facilities, and a sensible precaution. It’s good you're planning ahead, Mr. Tkac. It's wonderful to hear you enjoy baking – that sounds delightful. To begin, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… well, I’ve been fortunate, I believe. I've never been a man to complain much. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, a long time. Perhaps ten years? Maybe more. I stay active, you see. Kneading dough is good exercise. And I eat well, mostly. My bread, naturally! Though I do enjoy a bit of sweet now and then. No major illnesses, no broken bones. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I sleep alright, though not as soundly as I once did. My memory is… quite good, actually. I remember things from a long time ago like they were yesterday. Do you need specifics, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Mr. Tkac. It's excellent that you've remained active and have a good appetite. It's also wonderful to hear you have a strong memory. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… that’s a good question. Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill, once a day. The name escapes me at the moment. My daughter handles refilling it, mostly. And sometimes, if my joints ache particularly badly, I take ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind, you know? Nothing regularly, just when needed. I also take a vitamin D supplement in the winter months. The sun isn’t as strong then, and my bones feel… better with it. That’s all I can recall at the moment. Would a list be helpful? Perhaps my daughter has one.
DOCTOR: Yes, actually, the EHR does have a medication list from a few months back. It confirms you are taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure, as you mentioned, and occasionally ibuprofen as needed. It also lists Vitamin D 2000 IU daily. Is that accurate, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Ah, yes! Lisinopril, that’s the one. You have a good memory, Doctor. And yes, the dosages are correct. My daughter keeps very good records, I’m fortunate. It’s a relief to know you have access to that information. I sometimes forget the little details, you see. Not important things, but… names and numbers can slip away. But I recall faces and stories perfectly. It’s a strange thing, the mind.
DOCTOR: It is a strange and wonderful thing, Mr. Tkac. And it’s perfectly normal for memory to change with age. I’m glad your daughter is so helpful in keeping track of things. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s another good question. Let me think carefully. I don’t believe I have any serious allergies. No hives or difficulty breathing or anything of that nature. I have a slight sensitivity to dust, I suppose. Makes me sneeze a little, but nothing troublesome. And I’m not particularly fond of shellfish, but that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy, you understand. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, to my knowledge. I've never been one to take many pills, you see. Is there anything specific you're looking for, Doctor? Perhaps something common?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Tkac. It's helpful to rule out any significant allergies. Now, could you briefly tell me about any past medical conditions you’ve had – perhaps anything you’ve been treated for in the past, even if it was many years ago?
PATIENT: Past medical conditions… well, when I was a young man, I had pneumonia, quite bad. Spent a good few weeks in bed, I recall. But I recovered fully, thank goodness. And I had my appendix removed when I was in my twenties. That was a bit unpleasant, but it’s been many years now. Other than that… I’ve been remarkably healthy, all things considered. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and mumps and chickenpox, but nothing serious. I’ve never been hospitalized for anything else, to my knowledge. I've always tried to take good care of myself, you see. Simple living, good food, and plenty of exercise. It seems to have served me well.
DOCTOR: That's a good history, Mr. Tkac. It's wonderful to hear you've remained so healthy. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a bit of a complicated question, Doctor. My family… well, we’re Lakota Sioux. We have a long history, you see, and a history of… hardship. Many of my ancestors succumbed to illness, unfortunately. There's a family history of heart trouble on my mother’s side, I believe. And diabetes, though not directly in my immediate family. My father was a strong man, lived to a good old age, but he suffered from arthritis in his later years. My mother passed away when I was young, from a lung ailment. I don't have much detailed information about their medical histories, you see. Records weren't kept as carefully in those days. It’s a sad story, mostly, but a resilient one as well. We are still here.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Tkac. That is valuable information, and I appreciate your willingness to discuss it. It's understandable that detailed records might be limited. Knowing about the family history of heart trouble is helpful. Now, to get a complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: My current lifestyle… well, it’s fairly quiet, I suppose. I live alone, you see. I bake, mostly. I make bread for the local shops and sometimes for friends and neighbors. It keeps me busy, and I enjoy it. I walk every day, if the weather permits. About a mile, usually. I read a great deal. History, mostly. And Lakota stories. I don’t drink or smoke. Never have. I spend a good deal of time thinking, you see. About the past, about the future. I don’t have much family nearby, unfortunately. A daughter who lives a few states away. We talk on the phone regularly, thankfully. It’s a simple life, but it’s a good one. Not much excitement, but it suits me. Do you need specifics, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very fulfilling life, Mr. Tkac. It's wonderful that you remain active and engaged, and that you have a good connection with your daughter. Knowing that you don’t smoke or drink is also helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know about your health or well-being?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I suppose… sometimes I feel a little lonely, to be honest. Living alone can be isolating, especially as you get older. But I have my memories, and my baking, and my stories. That keeps me going. And I worry a little about falling, you see. My balance isn’t what it used to be. I’ve never had a serious fall, thankfully, but it’s always in the back of my mind. And… well, I sometimes forget things. Small things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, or the name of a song. It doesn’t happen often, but it’s there. Other than that… I feel quite well, all things considered. I'm a lucky man, Doctor. I think that's all.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Tkac. It’s good you're aware of these things, and it's perfectly normal to experience some of those changes with age. We can certainly address those concerns. Now, if you're agreeable, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be perfectly alright, Doctor. A physical exam sounds sensible. I haven't had one in… well, a very long time. I trust your judgment. Do tell me what you'll be doing, if you don't mind. I prefer to know what to expect. A fellow gets a little anxious as he gets older, you see. A little reassurance is always welcome.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tkac. I completely understand. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. I'll check your reflexes and strength. And I'll gently palpate your abdomen to feel for any abnormalities. It's a fairly standard exam, and shouldn’t be uncomfortable. I’ll explain everything as I go, and please feel free to stop me at any time if you have any questions or concerns. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Extend my arm… here you are, Doctor. A bit wrinkled, I’m afraid. Years of kneading dough, you see. Do try not to pinch too hard, if you don't mind. I have sensitive veins. And… what are you expecting to see, roughly? Is there a good number and a bad number? A fellow likes to know these things.
DOCTOR: I’m being very careful, Mr. Tkac. It’s just a routine measurement. A healthy blood pressure is generally considered to be around 120/80, but it can vary depending on age and individual factors. We’re looking for anything significantly outside of that range. It helps us assess your cardiovascular health. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/92. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll monitor it and discuss potential lifestyle adjustments if needed. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Take a deep breath… yes, here you are. My heart… it's been a good one, all things considered. Beating strong for eighty-one years. Do you hear anything… unusual? A little flutter? A little skip? I sometimes feel a palpitation, very occasionally. Just a brief one. Nothing alarming, but… well, a fellow worries. And what does ‘elevated’ mean, precisely? Is it something serious? I do enjoy my baking, you see. It would be a shame to have to give that up.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s a common finding in individuals your age, and often harmless. However, we should investigate further just to be sure. I’ll likely order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to get a more detailed reading of your heart’s electrical activity. Your lungs sound clear, with good breath sounds bilaterally. Now, as for your blood pressure, "elevated" simply means it’s a little higher than the ideal range. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it’s something we need to address to prevent potential complications down the road. Lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise can often help lower blood pressure. We can discuss those options in more detail. And rest assured, I don't anticipate you needing to give up your baking.
PATIENT: An EKG… yes, that sounds sensible. A thorough examination is always best. And you think lifestyle changes might help with the blood pressure? That’s a relief. I do enjoy my walks, as I mentioned. Perhaps I need to walk a little further. And maybe cut back on the sweet treats… though that will be difficult! I do enjoy a good pastry with my tea. What about my heart murmur? Is that something to be concerned about? A fellow worries, you see. About leaving things unfinished. About not being able to bake another loaf of bread. Is it a dangerous condition? Will it prevent me from moving into the senior living facility? They do require a clean bill of health, you understand. It’s all rather stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Tkac. It's perfectly natural to be anxious about these things. The heart murmur is something we want to investigate further with the EKG, as I mentioned. It could be a benign “innocent” murmur, which is very common with age and doesn’t require treatment. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying structural heart problems. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don't feel any masses or abnormalities. Regarding the senior living facility, it’s unlikely the murmur will prevent you from moving in, provided the EKG results are reassuring. They will likely want to review the results with their medical director. We will work together to ensure they have all the information they need. For now, let’s focus on getting the EKG scheduled. It’s a quick and painless procedure. We will also discuss some healthy lifestyle adjustments that can help manage your blood pressure. I don't want you to worry unnecessarily. We are taking all the necessary steps to ensure your health and well-being.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. An EKG and a discussion of lifestyle changes. I can live with that. And you think it’s unlikely the murmur will be a problem? That’s a relief. The senior living facility… it would be a good place for me, I think. A little companionship. A little help with the chores. I’m getting older, you see. It’s becoming more difficult to manage on my own. So, the EKG first. When can we schedule that? And what about the lifestyle changes? What do you recommend? Perhaps less tea? More walks? Less pastry? A fellow likes his comforts, you see. But I am willing to make adjustments, if necessary. For the sake of my health. And for the sake of my bread. I must continue to bake, you understand. It’s what I do. It’s who I am.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Tkac. Your passion for baking is admirable, and I certainly wouldn’t want to take that away from you. Let’s get the EKG scheduled for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. It will only take about 15 minutes. And then we can discuss the lifestyle changes. Regarding the lifestyle changes, it’s not about deprivation, but about balance. I recommend gradually increasing your walking distance, if you’re able. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. And we can discuss ways to reduce your intake of sugar and processed foods. Perhaps swap the pastry for a piece of fruit. And yes, it might be helpful to reduce your tea intake slightly. But it's about small, sustainable changes, not drastic restrictions. And most importantly, it's about listening to your body and finding what works best for you. We can also discuss some dietary resources and support groups if you’re interested. It’s a team effort, Mr. Tkac, and I’m here to help you every step of the way. Do tomorrow morning for the EKG work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, tomorrow morning would be perfectly alright. A team effort… that sounds… comforting, Doctor. I appreciate your understanding. And yes, perhaps a piece of fruit instead of pastry… a small change, as you say. A sustainable change. I can live with that. A team effort, and an EKG tomorrow morning. It sounds… manageable. I suppose… that’s all for today then? Unless there’s something else I’ve forgotten? A fellow gets a little forgetful, you see. But I do appreciate your time, Doctor. And your reassurance. It’s good to know someone is listening. And someone is helping. Perhaps… you could recommend a good brand of fruit? A fellow likes a good apple. A crisp, juicy apple. A sustainable change, you see. And a good team effort.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tkac, that’s all for today. I’ll have my nurse schedule the EKG for tomorrow morning, and she can also provide you with some information on dietary resources. And as for a good apple… Honeycrisp are always a good choice! They’re crisp, juicy, and wonderfully sweet. Gala apples are also a good option. And Fuji apples are another favorite. It really comes down to personal preference, but I think you'll enjoy any of those. It was a pleasure meeting you today, Mr. Tkac. Remember, we are a team, and I’m here to help you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We'll see you tomorrow morning for the EKG. And in the meantime, enjoy your baking!
