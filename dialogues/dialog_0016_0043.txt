DOCTOR: Hi Percell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Dr. Maskal, nice to meet you too. It’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right in the back of my head, feels like a tight band. It’s been…oh, let me think…about a week now, maybe a little longer. Not awful, but persistent, you know? It just is there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight band headache for about a week, you said. Persistent, but not severe. That's good to know. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, persistent is a good word. It doesn’t throb, doesn't make me nauseous or anything. Just…pressure. It’s worse when I’m reading, I think. I like to read a lot, old history books mostly. And, hmm…when I’m stressed. My daughter, she's having some trouble with her business, and that’s been weighing on me. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, though. I still go to my tai chi class every morning, and I still try to get out and walk. Just…annoying. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Percell. So, it’s a pressure-like headache, mostly in the back of your head, worsened by reading and stress, but not stopping you from your usual activities. No nausea or any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Nope, no nausea. No dizziness, no blurry vision, nothing like that. Just the pressure. Sometimes it feels like it goes all the way around my head, but mostly it’s focused right at the back, where your skull curves. And it's not a new thing, I’ve gotten headaches on and off for years, but usually they go away pretty quick with some rest. This one just…won’t.
DOCTOR: Okay. Headaches on and off for years, but this one is different because of the duration. Let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me think... High blood pressure, the doctor mentioned it a few years back, said it was borderline, but he didn’t put me on any medicine. Just told me to watch my salt. I try to. And my knees, they bother me sometimes, a bit of arthritis, I suppose. Nothing too bad, I get by. I don't have diabetes, I don't think. I've never been told I did. I eat pretty healthy, mostly rice and vegetables. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was…oh, 1988, I think. A long time ago now.
DOCTOR: Alright, so borderline high blood pressure, some arthritis in your knees, gallbladder removed in 1988, otherwise generally healthy. And you watch your salt intake. Good to know. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else besides your gallbladder?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing else. Just the gallbladder. Broke my wrist when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but that healed up fine. No other surgeries, no other hospital stays. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, all things considered. I always told my wife, and now I tell my daughter, good health is a gift. You gotta take care of it.
DOCTOR: That's a wonderful attitude, Percell. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there a history of headaches or any neurological conditions – like stroke or migraines – in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm…my mother, she used to get headaches, but I don't know if they were like mine. More of a tension headache, I think, from worrying. My father, he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life. As far as stroke or migraines…not that I know of. Nobody ever talked about it. We didn’t really talk about health much in my family. It was just…you pushed through. My daughter, she gets occasional migraines, but they’re not too bad. She takes some medicine and it helps. Is that the kind of thing you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had tension headaches, your daughter experiences occasional migraines, but no significant history of stroke or other neurological conditions that you're aware of. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Yes, that sums it up pretty well. As for lifestyle…well, I'm retired now, used to be a financial advisor. Still help my daughter with her books sometimes, but mostly I take it easy. I do tai chi every morning, like I said. About an hour. I walk, usually in the park, for maybe another hour. I eat pretty healthy, mostly rice, vegetables, and fish. I don't smoke, never have. I used to drink a little beer with dinner, but I cut back a few years ago. Maybe one or two glasses a week now. I try to stay active, keep my mind sharp. I read a lot. I also enjoy spending time with my grandchildren. They keep me young!
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell, that’s very helpful. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think... No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to any medicine. I don't take much, thankfully. Penicillin, maybe? I think I remember a doctor asking about that years ago, but I don't recall ever actually being allergic to it. No food allergies, no allergies to plants or animals, nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky that way, too. I used to garden, and I never had any trouble with pollen or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Dr. Maskal. Go right ahead. I'm used to doctors poking and prodding, though I haven't been to one much lately. Just let me know if anything feels strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Your reflexes are normal, strength is good in all your extremities, and coordination is intact. I’m going to check your range of motion in your neck and upper back now. Some slight stiffness in your upper back, but nothing concerning. Do you experience any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit. Just a dull ache, right in the muscles. Not sharp, not terrible, just…there. It’s been like that for a while, I suppose. I just figured it was from getting old. I used to do a lot of yard work, maybe that’s it. It doesn’t bother me much, though. Mostly just when you push on it like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, some dull ache in your upper back with palpation, likely musculoskeletal. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by some muscle stiffness in your upper back. Given your history of occasional headaches, normal neurological exam, and the lack of any red flag symptoms, I don’t believe this requires any immediate imaging or specialized testing. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I would like to monitor that closely. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Never really thought I needed one. I usually just go to the doctor's office when I need it checked. I suppose I should get one, though, if you think it’s important. I’m always willing to listen to a good doctor’s advice. What would you recommend? A digital one, I guess? I’m not very good with complicated things.
DOCTOR: Yes, a digital one would be easiest. There are many affordable options available at most pharmacies. I can give you a handout with some recommendations. As for the headache, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed. Also, try to practice relaxation techniques to reduce stress – deep breathing exercises, meditation, or gentle stretching can be helpful. And be mindful of your posture, especially when reading. I’d like to see you back in one month to check your blood pressure and see how the headache is responding to these measures. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. One month is good. I’ll get one of those blood pressure cuffs and try to remember to check it regularly. And I'll try to do some stretching, too. Maybe I’ll even try that meditation thing my daughter keeps talking about. Thank you, Dr. Maskal. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. I’m glad I could help. Here’s a card with my contact information, and the handout with the blood pressure cuff recommendations. If you experience any worsening of your headache – such as fever, stiff neck, vision changes, or weakness – please don't hesitate to call the office right away. Otherwise, I'll see you in one month. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: .
