DOCTOR: Good morning, Lucia. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... I keep... belching. It's a little embarrassing, but it's happening a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, belching… I understand. It can be disruptive. And you said it’s been happening a lot recently?
PATIENT: Yes, for maybe… two weeks now? Not all day, but many times a day. More after I eat, I think. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. Just… loud.
DOCTOR: Okay, two weeks, more after eating, and not painful… just noticeable. Can you describe what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Yesterday… for breakfast, I had a little bit of toast with some guava paste. Lunch was a sandwich, ham and cheese. And dinner… I had some rice and beans, and a little bit of chicken. I drink a lot of water. Sometimes I have a little bit of coffee in the morning, but not much.
DOCTOR: Okay, toast, guava paste, a ham and cheese sandwich, rice and beans with chicken, and water… and a little coffee. Do you notice if it happens more with certain foods than others?
PATIENT: That's a good question… I think maybe the rice and beans? Or… anything with a lot of… sauce, maybe? It’s hard to say for sure. I don’t keep very good track.
DOCTOR: Okay, potentially rice and beans, or foods with sauce. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the belching?
PATIENT: No… not really. Sometimes my stomach feels a little… full, after I eat. But not painful, like I said. No heartburn or anything. Just… full. And the belching, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness after eating, and the belching. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I think I’m the same. I haven’t been weighing myself much, to be honest. I feel… okay, weight-wise.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I don't take any medicine, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and no current medications. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your stomach and check for any tenderness. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could lie down for me, please. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Okay… I'm hearing normal bowel sounds. Slightly hyperactive, perhaps, but nothing concerning at this moment. Now I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Let me know if anything feels painful. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: No… that doesn’t hurt. Just feels… normal. A little pressure, but not pain.
DOCTOR: Okay… and what about here?
PATIENT: No... still nothing. It doesn't hurt, just... feels a little sensitive there, maybe? Like, I notice it, but it’s not painful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Sensitivity on the left side. Alright. Everything else seems normal. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some mild indigestion or possibly some gas buildup. The hyperactive bowel sounds and the sensitivity you mentioned could be contributing to this. It’s not usually anything serious.
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That’s good to hear. What can I do about it? Is there something I should eat less of?
DOCTOR: Yes, there are a few things you can try. Since you mentioned it might be worse after rice and beans, or with sauces, I’d suggest trying to limit those foods for a few days to see if it helps. Also, eating smaller, more frequent meals, and avoiding carbonated beverages can sometimes help reduce gas buildup. Staying hydrated is good, so continue to drink plenty of water. Over-the-counter simethicone, which is a gas relief medication, might also provide some temporary relief. If it doesn’t improve after a week or two with these changes, or if you start experiencing other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or weight loss, please come back and see me. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Limit rice and beans, smaller meals, no fizzy drinks… and that medicine. Simethicone? I'll try that. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'll write down those recommendations for you, just so you have them. And if things do get worse, or don't improve, please don’t hesitate to come back. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help, Doctor Beinborn. I feel much better knowing what it might be.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lucia. I'm glad I could help. Have a good day, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything else.
PATIENT: Okay. You too, Doctor. Goodbye! .
