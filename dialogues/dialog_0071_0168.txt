DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit delicate, truthfully. I’m dating someone, and I thought it prudent to have a check-up before things become… too serious. One simply doesn’t want to bring complications into a new relationship, does one?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A very sensible approach, Ms. Pandolfi. Precaution is always wise. So, is there anything specific you’re concerned about?
PATIENT: Well, I'm… not exactly young anymore, Doctor. And I’ve always been rather… robust, shall we say. I wouldn't want any… surprises cropping up that might…discomfort my companion. It’s important to maintain a certain standard, wouldn’t you agree? I trust you understand.
DOCTOR: Perfectly. Maintaining health and…well, a comfortable relationship is very important. Let's start with a general overview. Have you had any recent illnesses, or been hospitalized for anything in the past few years?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Oh, goodness, no. I don't do hospitals. A few colds, naturally, the usual seasonal things. But nothing serious enough for… that sort of place. I keep quite active, you see. Bridge club three times a week, and I volunteer at the library. Keeps the mind sharp, and the body… adequately stimulated. Though, I did have a rather persistent bout of indigestion last spring. It was quite…unpleasant. But it cleared up on its own, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Right, indigestion last spring, resolved on its own. Good. And before that, anything significant medically?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh, years ago, back in… oh, 2015, I believe, I had my gallbladder removed. It was quite a nuisance, really. The doctor at the time said it was “sluggish.” Whatever that means. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains that come with… maturity. Nothing requiring a visit, certainly. I prefer to avoid doctors unless absolutely necessary, you understand. They tend to…overcomplicate things.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removed in 2015. Noted. And no other surgeries, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No, none that I recall. Absolutely not. I've always been rather…particular about my body. I take good care of myself, Doctor. It’s simply…prudent. Although, I did have a rather unfortunate incident with a chipped tooth last year. But that was the dentist, not a surgeon. Quite a lot of drilling, I must say. Dreadful noise. But that's hardly relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: No, a chipped tooth isn’t what we’re focused on today. Now, Ms. Pandolfi, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family. That’s a… complicated question. My mother… well, she had “the sugar,” as she called it. Diabetes, I believe the doctors said. And my uncle Reginald… he had heart trouble. A very sad case, really. Always eating rich foods, you see. No sense whatsoever. On my father’s side… there was some talk of high blood pressure. Though, honestly, I don’t put much stock in inherited ailments. A sensible lifestyle is far more important, wouldn’t you agree? It’s all about moderation.
DOCTOR: I certainly agree that lifestyle plays a large role, but family history can give us some clues. So, diabetes, heart trouble, and high blood pressure… noted. Now, Ms. Pandolfi, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens, no. I've never been prone to such things. Although, I do find certain perfumes… rather overpowering. Does that count? No, seriously, I don’t have any true allergies. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to shellfish, but I simply avoid it. Much simpler that way. I prefer to be cautious, you understand. One doesn’t want any…unforeseen reactions disrupting a perfectly pleasant evening.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, slight sensitivity to shellfish, avoids it. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of something for my joints, Doctor. They aren't what they used to be, naturally. A little something the pharmacist recommended. Glucosamine, I believe it’s called. And occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take an aspirin. But that's quite infrequent. I prefer to let things run their course whenever possible. I don’t believe in relying on pills unless absolutely necessary. They always have such…side effects. Disruptive, really.
DOCTOR: Glucosamine for joints, occasional aspirin. Good. Ms. Pandolfi, would you mind if I did a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh. Well… I suppose so. Though, I must warn you, Doctor, I’m rather…sensitive. I dislike being prodded and poked, if you understand. And I do have a rather low tolerance for cold instruments. But if you feel it’s absolutely necessary, proceed. But gently, please. Very gently.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. We'll take it slowly and gently. First, let’s just check your blood pressure and pulse. 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 76, regular. Now, if you wouldn't mind, just a quick listen to your heart and lungs... Breathing sounds are clear, heart rhythm is regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's quite faint, but worth noting. Now, just a quick look in your ears and throat... Ears look clear, throat is a little… red, but no obvious signs of infection. Let's just check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. Alright. One last thing, if you don’t mind, I'd like to listen to your abdomen. Just lie back on the table, please. Sounds are normal, no tenderness to palpation. Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?
PATIENT: Well… it was tolerable, I suppose. Though I do feel a little…exposed. All that poking and prodding… It’s rather undignified, really. A slight murmur, you say? Is that…serious? I do hope it's nothing to worry about. My companion wouldn’t appreciate it if I were to suddenly become…incapacitated. And I certainly don't want to be a burden. What does it mean, Doctor? Do you require any further…investigations? Perhaps a blood test? I suppose I can tolerate a little needle prick if it’s absolutely necessary. But not too much, mind you. And a quick result, if possible. I have a bridge game on Thursday, you see.
DOCTOR: The murmur is faint, Ms. Pandolfi, and we don't want to jump to conclusions. It could be nothing, simply a normal variation. However, given your blood pressure reading and the family history of heart trouble, I think it’s prudent to order a few tests. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG – that’ll give us a clearer picture of your overall health and heart function. And yes, a lipid panel too, to check your cholesterol. These tests will involve a blood draw, as you anticipated. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning. The results typically take 24-48 hours. I also recommend a follow-up appointment next week to discuss the results and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… Yes, that will have to do. I suppose. Though I do hope it won't disrupt my routine too much. And 48 hours is rather a long time to be in suspense, isn’t it? One likes to know these things promptly. A lipid panel… you mean to check for…fat? Honestly, Doctor, I maintain a very sensible diet. But very well, if you insist. And a follow-up appointment…next week? I suppose so. Though I must warn you, my schedule is rather full. Please ensure it's not during my bridge game. So, to recap: blood draw tomorrow, results in 48 hours, follow-up appointment next week, not during my bridge game. Is that correct? And will this…blood draw interfere with my medication? I take that little glucosamine pill, you see. I wouldn't want to disrupt its effectiveness.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all correct. Blood draw tomorrow, results in 48 hours, follow-up appointment next week – and I’ll make absolutely certain it doesn't clash with your bridge game. As for the glucosamine, no, it shouldn’t interfere with the tests at all. You can continue taking it as usual. It's a supplement, not a medication that will affect the results. We'll get all the information we need, Ms. Pandolfi. And please, don't worry unnecessarily. We’re just being thorough. A nurse will call you this afternoon to schedule the blood draw. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. You've been… quite thorough, Doctor. Though a little prodding, I must admit. But if it's for the best… very well. Just… ensure the nurse is gentle. And prompt. I dislike waiting. And one final question, Doctor: will this… investigation be covered by my Medicare? One doesn't want any unexpected financial burdens, you understand. Especially not during…well, during a new relationship. It’s simply…imprudent.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. Your Medicare should cover the tests we've ordered, though there may be a small co-pay depending on your plan. The nurse will verify your coverage when she calls to schedule the appointment and can answer any specific questions about costs. Alright then. I believe that covers everything for today. I’ll see you next week, and please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. And enjoy your bridge game on Thursday!
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for your… thoroughness. And yes, I do intend to enjoy my bridge game. It’s… important. .
