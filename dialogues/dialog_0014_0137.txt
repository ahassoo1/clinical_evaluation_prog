DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My… how you say… the place for old people? The senior living? They want me to… check with a doctor first. To make sure I can go. My husband, he find it. Is very nice, but… they need this paper.
DOCTOR: Right, a medical clearance for the senior living facility. Understandable. They need to be sure you're healthy enough to benefit from the move. Okay. So, generally, that involves just a check-up... making sure everything is working as it should. Let’s start with why you want to go. Is this something you’ve been thinking about for a while?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Is… hard to keep up the house. Big house. Too much. My husband, he is good, but… he is older too. We want… easy. More people to talk to. And… not worry so much about the yard. The grass… always growing. I do not like the grass so much anymore.
DOCTOR: Right, manageable living. That makes sense. Less responsibility is a good thing. Okay. So, let’s talk about your overall health. Have you been seeing another doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Yes. Doctor… Ramirez. In the town. He… he checks my blood. For the sugar. And… the heart. He says I am… okay. Old, but okay. I take a little… pill for the blood pressure. And sometimes, for the pain in my… knee. Is bad when it rains.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. Ramirez. I’ll have to look up his notes. Good. It’s helpful you have a regular doctor. And you mentioned a blood pressure pill and something for knee pain. Do you remember the names of those medications?
PATIENT: No, I do not remember the names. My husband, he give them to me. He keeps the… the little bottles. He is very good with that. I just… take them. Is white pill and… a yellow one for the knee. When it hurts very bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we can certainly figure that out. It’s important to know exactly what you're taking. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never. I eat everything. My husband, he always say I eat too much! But… no problems with allergies. No. I like the flowers, too. He say I smell them too much, but… they smell good.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good to know. Now, aside from the knee pain, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes I forget things. Not all the time, but… sometimes. Like… what I was saying. Or where I put my glasses. But… is old age, no? My husband forget things too. We laugh about it. Is not so bad. But… I do get tired very quickly. Even walking to the store.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and some memory issues… alright. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, I eat the same. Maybe too much. My husband, he says so! And… I think I am the same weight. Maybe a little more, but… not much. I like to cook, you know? Is good. But sometimes… I do not feel like cooking. Is just tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to do a brief physical exam to get a better picture of things. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes… routine stuff. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. I can stand. Little slow, but… I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. Just take your time. Heart sounds are regular, a little bit of… a murmur, but nothing concerning for her age. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is also common with age. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Now, let's check your knee… where exactly does it hurt?
PATIENT: Here. When I walk too much. Or when the rain come. Is… a sharp pain. And sometimes… it feels stiff. Like I cannot bend it. I used to dance, you know? Long time ago. But not anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. There is some tenderness here, and a little bit of swelling. It feels like osteoarthritis, which is very common in the knee joint. Your range of motion is limited, and you have some pain with bending. Alright. We'll need to do some blood work to get a better picture of your overall health and check your blood sugar levels. I’m also going to order an X-ray of your knee to see the extent of the arthritis.
PATIENT: X-ray? Is that… safe? I heard… things about the machines. My neighbor, she say…
DOCTOR: It's perfectly safe, Ms. Abdollahi. The amount of radiation is very low, and it gives us important information about what's going on in your knee. It's a routine procedure, and the benefits far outweigh the risks. We need to rule out anything serious. Now, I'll write you a requisition for the blood work and the X-ray. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray facility is across the street. Do you have any trouble getting around to those places?
PATIENT: No, no trouble. My husband, he will drive me. He always drive me. Is good. But… how long will it take? For the results? I want to go to the place… soon.
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take a couple of days. The X-ray results may take a little longer, maybe three to five days. Once I have those, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine if you’re healthy enough for the senior living facility. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your usual medications. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. Just… thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. I hope… I hope I can go to the place. Is important to my husband and me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll do our best. We need to make sure it's the right decision for both of you. Here's the requisition for the tests. The receptionist will schedule your follow-up appointment when you check out. Have a good day, Ms. Abdollahi.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day to you too.
