DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Kammer, let’s get down to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes, the doctor. Well, it's… a little thing. I just thought, you know, a nice card. A “Get Well” card. Or… encouragement. Something like that. My daughter, she says I should come. She worries too much, that one. But a card from the doctor… that would mean something, you see? It’s just… low spirits, that’s all. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: A card?
PATIENT: Yes. A card. You know, with… pretty pictures. And words. Like, “Get better soon.” Or, “Thinking of you.” It's… a kindness. My ex-wife, she always sent cards. Even when… well, never mind that. It just… lifts the spirits, you understand? A little bit of cheer. I don't need medicine or anything. Just… a card. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I’m a physician. I diagnose and treat medical conditions. I don’t… prescribe cards. Are you experiencing any actual symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… I feel… tired. More tired than usual. And… things just don't seem as bright, you know? Like looking through a dirty window. But I'm an old man! Old men get tired. I just thought a card... from a professional... might make me feel… well, more motivated. To not be tired. Is that… is that so unreasonable? I worked hard my whole life. Boiler operator. It’s a tough job. Maybe a little recognition? With a nice picture?
DOCTOR: Right. So, fatigue. And you describe a diminished sense of… enjoyment?
PATIENT: Diminished? Is that what you call it? Yes, yes, that’s a good word. Everything is… flat. Like a soda that lost all its bubbles. And I don't sleep as well. I toss and turn. My daughter keeps telling me I should talk to someone, but… I don't need talking. I need a card. A simple card. You have pretty cards, don’t you? Or can get them? I'm on Medicare, so I don’t know what’s covered. Does Medicare pay for… inspirational cards?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, let’s try to focus. You're describing symptoms that could indicate a number of things. Fatigue, difficulty sleeping… these aren't things to dismiss. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Well… not really. I eat. My daughter makes me eat. She worries I'm getting too thin. I like my pasteles. And arroz con gandules. But… sometimes, it doesn’t taste the same. Like something’s missing. Like… color. Everything is just… muted. Not like it used to be. But I am eating. She makes sure of it. So, it’s not like I’m starving or anything. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you asking. But truly, a card would lift my spirits more than all this questioning. A small kindness, you see? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, diminished appetite with a change in taste. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t stepped on the scale in… well, a while. My daughter has one. She’s always checking my weight. She’d tell me if I was losing weight, wouldn't she? She's very… observant. She notices everything. Always has. But no, she hasn't said anything about weight loss. Just that I need to eat more pasteles. It's frustrating, you know? I just want a card. A “Thinking of you” card. From you. That’s all. Is there a problem getting one? A simple card? It's a small thing that would mean so much. Are you sure Medicare won’t cover it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand you would like a card. However, I am concerned about these symptoms you're describing. Fatigue, changes in taste, difficulty sleeping… these are not things to ignore, regardless of whether you’ve lost weight. We need to rule out some potential medical causes before we consider… motivational cards. I’m going to order some blood work. Just a routine check, to see what’s going on.
PATIENT: Blood work? Now see, that’s what I was trying to avoid! I don’t like needles. And I'm a perfectly healthy man, mostly. Just… low spirits. A card would do wonders for my spirits. Blood work sounds… intrusive. And unpleasant. And it won't give me a card. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel a little… dismissed. You're not listening to me. I just want a small kindness, a gesture of support. A simple “Get Well” card from a professional. Is that too much to ask? I think I'll just… go home now. And maybe my daughter will bring me a nice card herself. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, please wait. Look, I am listening to you. But these symptoms warrant investigation. I am concerned about your well-being, and I'm obligated to ensure we aren’t overlooking something serious. The blood work is a standard precaution. It's not about dismissing you; it's about providing appropriate medical care. I can write a referral to a therapist, as well, if you’d like. But I strongly advise against simply ignoring these concerns. Please reconsider. Let's at least get some baseline tests done.
