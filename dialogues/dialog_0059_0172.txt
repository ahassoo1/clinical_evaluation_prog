DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Really, I don't have much time for chatting. It's simply… a formality, I suppose. My husband insisted. New to the area, you see, and one must establish a general practitioner. I haven't a specific ailment, if that's what you're asking. Just… getting things settled. Medicare requires it, I believe.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Candice. Establishing care with a primary physician is an excellent idea, even in the absence of a specific concern. And yes, Medicare does often require an initial 'Welcome to Medicare' visit. It's a good opportunity for us to get a baseline of your health and discuss preventative care. While it sounds like you're feeling well overall, let’s still go through a bit of a check-up just to be thorough. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sighs dramatically. As long as it doesn't take all day. Honestly, Doctor, I have a rather important appointment this afternoon. And I do dislike being poked and prodded. Is there a questionnaire I can simply fill out? That would be far more efficient.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candice. We can absolutely start with a questionnaire. It will help me get a better understanding of your medical history and current health status. It shouldn’t take too long. We’ll keep the physical exam as brief and comfortable as possible. Here you are. Take your time with it, and please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. We’ll go over it together once you’re finished. This will cover things like past illnesses, surgeries, medications, allergies, and family history.
PATIENT: Allergies… Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea. I eat what my husband prepares, and I suppose I’ve never had a severe reaction. Family history… well, my mother lived to be quite old, I believe. A very stubborn woman, she was. As for the rest… It all seems so very long ago. Where was I? Oh, yes, the form. It’s terribly small print, isn't it? Do you have a magnifying glass?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, let me get you this. The print is rather small, and we want to ensure you can read everything comfortably. And that's perfectly alright about the allergies and family history – we can note "unknown" if you aren't certain. It’s more important to be accurate than to guess. Take your time, and let me know if you need anything at all. I'll be right here if you have questions. Perhaps we can focus on what you remember, and we can leave the rest blank for now.
PATIENT: Well, that's... marginally better. Married, of course. To Harold. Been married… oh, goodness. Decades, certainly. More than fifty years, I think. Dispatcher... yes, that’s what I do. Or did. I retired, you see. Though Harold still insists I help out occasionally. A very organized man, my husband. He handles all these sorts of things, usually. This section about past surgeries... I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I believe. And... I think I broke my arm once, falling from a tree. A very long time ago. Is that all? Honestly, it’s all such a blur.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Candice. Don't worry about recalling exact details – we're just trying to get a general picture. “More than fifty years” is excellent information, and knowing about your tonsillectomy and the broken arm is perfect. "Retired dispatcher" is good to know as well. Just to clarify, when you say Harold helps you out occasionally, what sort of work do you assist with now?
PATIENT: Oh, really, it’s not work precisely. He runs a small dispatching service for… well, for various local businesses. Delivery drivers, that sort of thing. And sometimes he needs me to answer the phone, take a message. Simple things. Mostly, he just likes having me around, I suspect. Keeps him company. It's hardly a demanding occupation. Certainly not like when I was actively employed. Everything is so different now, with these… computers. It's all so very confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're still very active and involved, even if you're not officially working. And it's lovely that you and Harold enjoy spending time together. Now, regarding your medications, do you currently take any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements on a regular basis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. Harold handles all of that, you see. I simply take what he gives me. A small white pill in the morning, I believe. And sometimes a larger blue one at night. For… well, I haven’t the faintest idea what for. He says it’s good for me. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t concern myself with those sorts of details. It’s much easier to leave it to the experts. Do you have a questionnaire for husbands? Perhaps he would be more helpful.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s quite alright. Knowing you take a small white pill in the morning and a larger blue one at night is a good starting point. It would be helpful to get more specifics, if possible, but we can certainly work with this for now. It is important to know what medications you are taking, even if it's just to ensure there are no interactions with anything else we might consider. Perhaps we can ask Harold to bring a list of your medications with him when you come in for a follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: That… might be a possibility. Harold is very organized, as I mentioned. He keeps everything meticulously labeled, I believe. Though I daresay he’d rather I didn’t bother him with it. He’s a busy man, you see. Is there anything else? I really must be going. As I said, I have a rather important appointment this afternoon. It’s terribly inconsiderate of me to keep you from other patients.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Candice. I appreciate you taking the time to come in today and share what you've told me. We've covered a good amount of ground, and it's helpful to get a baseline of your health. Before you go, would you mind if I perform a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Must we? It’s truly not necessary. I feel perfectly fine. But… if you insist. Just… please be quick about it. And try not to poke me too much. I really don’t enjoy being prodded. I have rather sensitive skin, you see. And… please, no needles. Absolutely no needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candice. We'll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible, and I assure you, no needles today. We’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. If you'll just have a seat here, we can get started.
PATIENT: Honestly, these chairs are terribly uncomfortable. And the lighting is rather harsh, don't you think? Just get it over with, Doctor. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. Just a few quick checks. Your heart rate is regular and a bit on the slower side, which is not uncommon for your age. Your lungs sound clear, with no wheezing or crackling sounds. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142/88. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Your ears look clear, and your throat is a little dry, but otherwise appears normal. Everything sounds and looks reasonably good, Candice, but the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor.
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Honestly, I haven’t a clue what that means. Harold always says my blood pressure is perfectly fine. He checks it regularly, you see. Perhaps you should consult him. He’s far more knowledgeable about these things. Is that all? Can I go now? I really must be going. I have a terribly important appointment, you know. And I’m starting to feel rather faint. All this prodding and poking… it’s simply too much for me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Candice. It’s good that Harold monitors your blood pressure, and we can certainly discuss it with him. A single reading isn’t always definitive, and it’s helpful to get a series of measurements over time. For now, let’s focus on a few simple things. I recommend staying well-hydrated and continuing to eat a healthy diet. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to recheck your blood pressure and review your medication list with Harold. Yes, you can certainly go now. Please take your time getting up. And don’t hesitate to call if you experience any concerning symptoms. Here's a card with the clinic's contact information. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you leave?
PATIENT: No, that will be all, thank you. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate your… efforts. Though I still maintain that Harold would have been far more helpful. Very well. Goodbye. .
