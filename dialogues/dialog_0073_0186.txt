DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need a check-up for… well, a sports team tryout. Gotta make sure I'm okay to go for it, you know? Don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: A sports team tryout?
PATIENT: Yeah. It's… archery. I'm getting back into it after a long time. Old man trying to prove he's still got it, I guess. Is that alright? Do you… do sports physicals for archery?
DOCTOR: It’s… unusual, but alright. We can certainly do a check-up. It’s… good to be proactive. Though, frankly, at your age, “proving” things isn’t always the healthiest motivation. Still. We’ll see what we find. Let’s start with the basics. Any current symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Not really. A little ache in my shoulder sometimes, but I think that’s just from… well, using it again after not for so long. Nothing serious. No pain when I’m not shooting, though. Just a bit stiff. Everything else feels okay.
DOCTOR: “A little ache.” Right. And how long has this “little ache” been present?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a week, week and a half? Since I started practicing more seriously. Before that, nothing. It comes and goes, mostly after a longer session. Not enough to stop me, just… noticeable. Honestly, I was hoping it was just muscle soreness and would go away on its own. But figured it’s best to get it checked before I pull something.
DOCTOR: “Muscle soreness.” Of course. And what about your past medical history, Mr. Kingan?
PATIENT: Past medical… not much to tell, really. Had the usual childhood stuff – measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. Broke my arm once when I was a kid, climbing a tree. Nothing major since. No ongoing health problems, no surgeries. I… I don’t think so. Do I need to list every cold I’ve ever had?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kingan, listing every cold is not necessary. Just any significant medical issues. Have you been diagnosed with anything – high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis… anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Doctor’s always told me I was healthy as a horse. Or, well, as healthy as an old horse can be. Seriously, though, no diagnoses. I… I haven't really been to the doctor much in the last… twenty years? I guess. If that tells you anything. I usually just tough things out. I know, probably not the smartest thing.
DOCTOR: Right. And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a bit harder. My parents are… were both pretty healthy, I think. Dad passed a few years back, heart problems. But he smoked for, well, most of his life. Mom’s side… I don’t know much, to be honest. She wasn’t one for talking about it. A lot of relatives I haven’t even met. So… not much help there, I’m afraid. Mostly just… old people dying of old age, if that makes sense? Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Don’t take anything regularly. Maybe some ibuprofen now and then for a headache, but that’s it. Not even vitamins or anything. Just… nothing. You think I should be taking something? I’ve never really bothered with all that stuff.
DOCTOR: We're establishing a baseline, Mr. Kingan, not making recommendations yet. Allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, breathe anything… well, mostly. Dust gets to me a little, but that's just… normal, right? I haven't ever had a reaction to anything, if that makes sense. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. Please step over to the examination table. I'll need you to remove your shirt and we’ll take a look at your shoulders and listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay. Shirt off, huh? Well, alright then. Just… let me know if you need anything. It's been a while since I… well, you know. Hope I don't have any weird old man spots you need to look at.
DOCTOR: Just lie down, Mr. Kingan. And try to relax. Take a deep breath... and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are… regular, slightly muffled, but not alarming for your age. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let's have a look at those shoulders. Can you raise both arms above your head?
PATIENT: Okay, here goes. There. Feels… okay. A bit stiff, as I said. And… yeah, that shoulder on this side feels a little tighter than the other one. It’s not… painful, exactly. More like… restricted. Is that what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: There is some tenderness to palpation here, on the anterior deltoid. And some crepitus with range of motion. Limited range of motion bilaterally, more pronounced on the right. Some audible crepitus. Now, can you rotate your arms outwards?
PATIENT: Like this? Yeah, that’s… a bit uncomfortable. The right one definitely doesn't go as far. Feels like something’s catching. It's not a sharp pain, but… it’s there. Does that sound bad? Is it something serious? I really don't want to mess up my archery.
DOCTOR: It suggests some mild impingement, possibly early rotator cuff tendinitis. Not unexpected, given your age and return to activity. Mild anterior impingement, possible rotator cuff tendinitis. Range of motion limited with external rotation. We’ll need to get some imaging to confirm. An X-ray, to rule out any bony abnormalities. And perhaps an MRI, if it doesn’t improve with conservative treatment.
PATIENT: Imaging, huh? MRI… that sounds expensive. And… long. So, I’m not going to be able to just… keep practicing? I was really hoping to avoid all that fuss. Is there anything… anything at all I can do right now? Some stretches, maybe? I really don’t want to have to put it off for weeks getting tests done.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your… eagerness. But simply “keeping practicing” could exacerbate the issue. While we await imaging, you should immediately cease any strenuous activity involving the shoulder. That means no archery. As for stretches, some gentle pendulum exercises may be permissible, but only as tolerated, and without pain. I'm going to prescribe a short course of NSAIDs to manage any discomfort and reduce inflammation. Take these as directed. And schedule an X-ray as soon as possible. We’ll review the results and determine the next course of action. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No archery… right. Pendulum exercises… okay. I can probably manage that. What sort of timeframe are we looking at, roughly? Before I can maybe get back to practicing? A week? A month? And… how much do you think the X-ray and MRI will cost? I'm… not the wealthiest man, you know?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I cannot provide a definitive timeline without imaging. It depends entirely on the severity of the injury. As for the cost… frankly, I have no idea. Billing is handled separately. I suggest you contact the radiology department and inquire about their rates. I’ll send the X-ray order electronically. And I will refer you to an orthopedist for consultation if the X-ray reveals anything significant. In the meantime, rest, ice, and NSAIDs. And refrain from activities that aggravate the pain. Do you understand?
