DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, I ain’t got all day. It’s… well, it’s this. <gestures vaguely at his stomach with a thin hand> It just… ain’t what it used to be, you understand? Used to be solid, strong. Now it’s… floppy. And I don’t like it.
DOCTOR: Floppy… alright. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What kinda question is that? I told ya! It’s… loose. Like a bag of flour. Used to be muscle, now it jiggles. I work hard, you know. Pile driver ain’t easy work. Should be strong, not… this. <taps his stomach again, harder this time> You a doctor or you need me to draw ya a picture?
DOCTOR: Right, right. I understand. “Loose,” you say. And you’re a pile driver… for how long have you noticed this change?
PATIENT: Change? Hmm… well, let me see. My wife, God rest her soul, she started sayin’ somethin’ ‘bout it… oh, musta been five, six years ago now. Before she… well, never mind. But it’s gotten worse since. I ain’t been feelin’ myself lately. Not strong like I used to be. Pile drivin’ is… harder.
DOCTOR: Five or six years… and it’s progressively worsened. And you’ve noticed this impacting your work?
PATIENT: Impactin’ my work? You think?! I used to be the fastest on the crew. Now… now I gotta take more breaks. And I ain’t sleepin’ as good. Worryin’ ‘bout it, I guess. Used to be able to work all day and sleep like a baby. Now… it’s somethin’ always botherin’ me. And it’s embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or other symptoms alongside this… looseness?
PATIENT: Pain? Nah, not really pain. More like… a draggin’ feeling. Like somethin’ heavy pullin’ down. And sometimes, after I eat, it feels… full. Too full. Bloated, maybe. But no sharp pain, no nothin’ like that. Just… uncomfortable. And I don’t like lookin’ at it in the mirror, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: No sharp pain, a dragging sensation, and bloating after eating… Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… what now? Look, I ain’t here to talk about… that. I told ya what's botherin’ me! It’s this. <points emphatically at his stomach again> Not worried ‘bout goin’ to the bathroom, I’m worried ‘bout what's hangin’ over it! Are you even listenin’ to me, Doc? This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I am listening. And I apologize if my questions seem… roundabout. I need to understand the full picture to help you. Changes in bowel habits can sometimes be related to stomach issues, but we can skip that for now. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Look, I don't got time for games. I told you. It’s floppy. It’s hangin’. It used to be firm. That's all you need to know. Is there a way to… tighten it back up? Like a belt or somethin’? I ain't askin' for a whole makeover, just… fix it. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Alright. We can certainly discuss options. It sounds like you’re concerned about muscle tone and abdominal firmness. Before we get to that, just to be thorough, have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm… now that you mention it… maybe a little. Not much, but my trousers feel a bit looser than they used to. I ain’t been eatin’ as much, truth be told. Not much appetite when you’re feelin’… self-conscious, you know? But I ain’t starvin’ or nothin’. Just… less hungry.
DOCTOR: Less appetite and some weight loss… Alright. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Lie down? Now hold on a minute… you want me to take my clothes off? I ain’t comfortable doin’ that right away. I just want to know if you can fix it. I ain't here for a whole examination. What kinda fixin' are we talkin' about anyway? Pills? Exercises?
DOCTOR: No, no, you don’t need to take your clothes off. Just lie down so I can listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. It's a simple exam. It will help me understand what's going on. As for fixing it… that depends on what I find. It could be anything from exercises to… other interventions. But we need to start with the exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. But don’t go pokin’ and proddin’ too much, you hear? And make it quick. I got things to do. <carefully lies down on the examination table, looking distinctly unhappy> Just… get on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m feeling some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. No large masses, but the abdominal muscles are… less firm than expected. I also note some mild distension. Your bowel sounds are present, but a bit sluggish. It's not immediately alarming, but it does suggest some muscle weakness and potential digestive issues.
PATIENT: Weakness? Digestive issues? I told you! See? I ain't crazy. It's goin' soft! What does that mean, Doc? What kinda exercises you talkin' about? I ain't got time for fancy gym stuff. I need somethin’ quick. And can you fix the… flabbiness?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. It could be a few things. Muscle loss can happen with age, inactivity, or changes in diet. The sluggish bowel sounds could be related to that, or to something else. We need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work to check your overall health, and a stool test to check for any digestive problems. This will give us a better idea of what's going on. In the meantime, I recommend… gentle exercise. Walking is good. Nothing strenuous. And try to eat smaller, more frequent meals. Do you have any allergies or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Walking? I work! Pile drivin’ is exercise enough! And smaller meals? I eat what I can when I can. Look, Doc, I ain’t one for fancy tests and whatnot. I just want to get this… sorted. Blood tests? That mean needles, right? I hate needles. And what about fixin’ it? Can you do somethin’ now? Like… a shot or somethin’ to tighten it up?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration. I wish I could simply give you a shot to "tighten things up," but unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way. We need to find the cause of the muscle loss and digestive issues before we can create a plan. The blood work will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. As for the needle, it’s a small prick. It’s necessary to get a clear picture of your health. I can draw the blood myself, quickly. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a consultation with a physical therapist. They can design a safe and effective exercise program for you. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A physical therapist? More people pokin’ and proddin’? This is ridiculous! Look, Doc, I ain't got time for all this runaround. I need a quick fix, not a whole new schedule of appointments. You’re a doctor, aren’t you? Do something! Can’t you give me somethin’ for the… bloating? That’s botherin’ me the most right now. Some kinda pill to make it stop? Just something to relieve the pressure.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I can prescribe you a medication to help with the bloating. It's an anti-gas medication. It won’t fix the underlying problem, but it may provide some temporary relief. However, I still strongly recommend the blood work and consultation with a physical therapist. Ignoring the problem will only make it worse. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I just take whatever the nurse gives me when I got a cold. But listen, Doc… if this pill don't work, I ain't comin' back. You hear? I got better things to do than run around to doctors and therapists. Just give me the pill, and let's be done with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s a prescription for Simethicone. Take it as directed on the label. I’m also going to have my nurse give you a referral form for a physical therapist, and a lab slip for the blood work. I understand you’re not thrilled about these, but I truly believe they’re important. And Mr. Trendler… please schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks so we can discuss the results and see how you’re feeling. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Two weeks? Fine. But don't expect miracles. And tell your nurse to be quick with that referral. <stands up slowly, adjusting his belt> I got things to do. Let’s just hope this pill works. Thank you. <turns to leave>
