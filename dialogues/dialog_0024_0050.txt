DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. Or is it Pavlovic?
PATIENT: Pavlovec. It's... Pavlovec. It's been a long time since anyone asked about that. Good morning to you too, Doctor... Mutnick, is it? The chart… well, things get fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mutnick. And quite. Now, Mr. Pavlovec, let’s not dwell on the vagaries of memory. You are here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, right. The cough. It’s been… a while now. Just a dry cough. Doesn’t bring anything up, you know? Just… irritating. Gets worse when the weather changes, I think. Or maybe it's when I lay down. Hard to say these days.
DOCTOR: A dry cough… and how long, precisely, has this “while” been?
PATIENT: Precisely… that's a hard one. Months, I reckon. Maybe six? Or was it last winter? My daughter, she keeps telling me to come in… she says it's been too long. I lose track. Everything blurs together after a while, you see.
DOCTOR: Six months of a persistent cough… and you haven't sought medical attention until now?
PATIENT: Didn’t seem… urgent. Old man things, you know? Always something creaking or aching. Figured it would just… go away. And I haven’t got insurance, Doctor. It’s… expensive to go to the doctor. My wife, she used to handle all that. It’s just me now.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief examination. Please, if you would, remove your shirt. I need to listen to your lungs and check your general condition. And do try to remember details, Mr. Pavlovec. It makes my job considerably easier.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Take my shirt off… in here? Well, alright. It’s… a little chilly, though. Always been a skinny fella. Not much to see, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Breathing is slightly labored… diminished air entry bilaterally. Some mild wheezing. Heart sounds… regular, but a bit distant. Dullness to percussion. Height 155 centimeters, weight 107 pounds… quite underweight. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or shortness of breath, Mr. Pavlovec?
PATIENT: No fever that I recall. Maybe a little… tired sometimes. Shortness of breath… not really. Just… gets harder to do things. Like… bending over. Or walking up the stairs. Always figured that was just getting old. I used to be strong, you know? Worked on cars all my life. Body repair. That’s what I did.
DOCTOR: “Getting old” is a convenient explanation for many ailments, Mr. Pavlovec. But it rarely constitutes a diagnosis. Do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Asthma… no, I don't think so. Not that I remember. My wife… she had something with her chest when she was a girl, maybe bronchitis? It was a long time ago. I mostly remember her fussing over me when I was sick. Pneumonia… maybe once, when I was a young man. But it was… a very long time ago. Everything just… runs together after a while. Do you need me to remember specific dates, Doctor? Because I can't.
DOCTOR: We’ll disregard specific dates. I have access to your limited EHR data, though it’s… sparse. No documented history of asthma. One entry for pneumonia in 1958. Given your age, weight, and symptoms, the most likely explanation is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, possibly exacerbated by a recent respiratory infection. But we need further testing to confirm. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test.
PATIENT: Chest… X-ray? Pulmonary… what did you call it? That sounds… serious. Is it bad, Doctor? Will it hurt? I don’t like hospitals. Or… tests. My wife always handled this sort of thing. Is it expensive? I really don’t want to cause trouble. I just wanted something for the cough.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pavlovec, I assure you, I am a medical professional. A cough that has persisted for six months, accompanied by diminished air entry and potential wheezing, warrants investigation. I understand your concerns about expense, but delaying diagnosis could lead to more significant complications. The X-ray is painless. The pulmonary function test involves breathing into a device – it’s slightly uncomfortable, but not dangerous. As for the cost… I will have the billing department contact you regarding payment options. Now, let’s schedule these tests immediately. Do you have transportation?
PATIENT: Transportation… my daughter, Lily, usually takes me places. But she’s busy. Works two jobs, she does. I don’t… I don’t really want to bother her. Maybe I could take the bus? But it’s… it’s a long ride. And I get… winded easily. I don't want to be a bother to anyone. Maybe a stronger cough syrup would help? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Mr. Pavlovec, cough syrup will not address the underlying cause of your symptoms. It is a temporary palliative, at best. We need concrete data, not speculation. I’m going to write you a referral to a specialist – a pulmonologist – who can perform these tests efficiently. They have a dedicated transportation service for patients with limited mobility. I will also have my staff assist with scheduling. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… a specialist? Pulmo… what did you call it? Another doctor? That seems like a lot. And a transportation service… that’s… kind of you, I guess. But it all feels… complicated. My wife… she would have known what to do. I just want the cough to stop. I miss her. Is it okay if I just… think about it? I don't want to make any decisions right now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pavlovec, I understand your distress. However, I am obligated to ensure you receive appropriate medical care. I will have my staff schedule a follow-up appointment for you next week. At that time, you can discuss your concerns further. In the meantime, I will prescribe a bronchodilator to help alleviate your symptoms. But this is not a long-term solution. We must address the underlying cause. Now, if there is nothing further, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Alright. A follow-up appointment… and the… broncho… dilator. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate your help. I just wish she were here.
