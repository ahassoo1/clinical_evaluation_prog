DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I just… I feel kinda puffed up, alright? Like a balloon. Been happening for a bit now. Don’t really have time for a long chat about it, to be honest. Just want to know what’s going on so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're feeling “puffed up” and are short on time. I will do my best to be efficient. Can you tell me a little more about this “puffed up” feeling?
PATIENT: More… what do you want to know? It’s just my stomach, mostly. Feels tight, and… bigger than usual. I guess. It’s uncomfortable. Like after a big meal, but I haven't had a big meal. It’s just… there. Does that make sense? I don’t sit around analyzing my insides, doc. I drive a pile driver for a living.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Kristofik. Thank you for explaining. It sounds like you’re experiencing abdominal distension and discomfort. When did this start?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really remember. A few weeks, maybe? Time kinda… blurs, you know? It’s been hot, work’s been busy… things just kinda run together. I just noticed it getting worse recently, so figured I should get it checked out. Before it… I don't know… explodes or something. Don't look at me like that, I’m serious. It feels weird.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I'm not dismissing it at all. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. It's helpful to try to narrow down the timeline, even approximately. Has anything specific seemed to worsen it over these few weeks – certain foods, activities, stress, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Ugh, foods? Probably. I eat whatever keeps me going, to be frank. Fast food mostly, when I can. Sometimes leftovers, my wife used to cook. Not much of that anymore. Stress? Yeah, work's stressful. Always is. Tight deadlines, grumpy bosses… the usual. Look, is this going somewhere or are we just going to list my entire life? I really need to get back to the site. It’s costing me money just sitting here.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I will try to be as efficient as possible. Knowing a little about your diet and stress levels helps me understand the possible causes. Let’s try to focus on the symptoms themselves. Besides the distension and discomfort, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Like what kind of changes? Look, I’m not a doctor. I just know my stomach feels like a bloated fish. Honestly, I haven’t been paying that close attention. Maybe… some gas? Yeah, definitely more gas than usual. And… I guess I've been a bit tired lately, but that’s just from working long hours. Is that relevant? Because if it is, yes. It's relevant. Everything is relevant when you’re exhausted.
DOCTOR: Okay, gas and fatigue. That is helpful information. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – diarrhea, constipation, or anything unusual with the color or consistency of your stool?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Now we’re talking about… that? Look, I'm a grown man. I don’t discuss my… bathroom habits with strangers. It's been… normal-ish? Maybe a little looser than usual, but I've been drinking more water in the heat. It's hot, okay? People get the runs when it’s hot. Is that it? Can we just wrap this up and give me something for the bloating?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize if I'm asking personal questions. It’s important to get a complete picture of your symptoms. It's good to know you've noticed looser stools, and that you’ve been drinking more water. Okay, let’s shift gears. Do you have any pain anywhere, besides the general discomfort in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Look, my whole body aches, okay? I drive a pile driver all day. My back, my shoulders, my hands… it all hurts. But specifically… in my stomach? No. It's not pain pain. It’s just… full. Uncomfortable. Like I swallowed a beach ball. I don't know what you want me to say. Is it something serious? Because if it’s going to require a lot of tests and appointments, I’m going to need to reschedule. I have a job, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about work, Mr. Kristofik. It doesn't sound like sharp pain, which is good. Just a persistent fullness and discomfort. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope and gently press on it to check for any tenderness or masses. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just… get it over with. Don’t poke too hard, alright? And try not to take too long. I’m already losing money by being here. Just… do whatever you need to do. But quickly. Seriously. I have deadlines. And a very understanding, but increasingly annoyed, foreman.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening now… and gently pressing… Do you feel any pain or tenderness in any particular spot as I do this?
PATIENT: Oof. Yeah, that’s… not great. A little tender there. Not like a stabbing pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. You’re pushing on something. Stop pushing so hard, will ya? It’s not helping. Just… leave it alone now. You've established it hurts. Can we move on? This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll stop there. Thank you for letting me know. I’m noting the tenderness in your lower right quadrant. Given your symptoms – the bloating, discomfort, looser stools, and now the tenderness in your lower right quadrant – several things could be going on. It could be something relatively minor like gas or a mild viral gastroenteritis, but the tenderness raises some concern for a few other possibilities, including appendicitis or a diverticular issue. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work to check for signs of infection and inflammation. I also think a CT scan of your abdomen would be helpful to visualize what’s going on inside. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Blood work? Seriously? This is… this is getting complicated. And expensive, I bet. Look, I appreciate you trying to figure it out, but I’m a pile driver operator, not a medical professional. I don’t do… scans. And I’m not great with needles. Is there… anything else? Any pills you can just give me to make it stop? Something simple? I have a job to do. And I don’t have time for… all this. This is going to cost me a fortune. I… I need to think about this. Can I just… get a referral to someone else? Someone who doesn't immediately jump to CT scans and blood work?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and inconvenience, Mr. Kristofik. It’s true those tests aren’t inexpensive, and they do take time. I wouldn't recommend them if I didn't feel it was important to rule out some potentially serious conditions. However, if you’d prefer, I can certainly write a referral to a gastroenterologist, who can further evaluate your symptoms and determine the best course of action. They may or may not order the same tests, but they’ll be able to provide a more specialized assessment. Before we proceed with the referral, let me give you some initial recommendations to help manage your symptoms while you wait for an appointment. I recommend a bland diet – things like toast, rice, bananas, and applesauce – to avoid irritating your digestive system. Stay well-hydrated, and try to rest as much as possible. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as a high fever, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or bloody stools – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. A referral. That sounds… better. Less invasive. Less expensive. And I can try the bland diet. Toast and bananas. I can handle that. Just… make sure the referral is to someone good. And… thank you. I guess. This whole thing is… unsettling. I really need to get back to work. So, just the referral, then? Can we just… get that done? And can I get a copy of that summary you just gave me? The toast and bananas thing? Just in case.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kristofik. I will write a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-rated gastroenterologist in the area. She’s very thorough and takes a patient-centered approach. I'm also printing out a summary of our discussion, including the recommendations for a bland diet and the warning signs to watch out for. Here you go. I've also made a note on the referral that you're concerned about the cost of tests, so she'll be aware of that. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
