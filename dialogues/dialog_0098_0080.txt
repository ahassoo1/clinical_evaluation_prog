DOCTOR: Good morning, Thyra. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Bombara. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s not really seeing you for anything, if that makes sense. Just need to get some forms filled out, that's all. Medicare sent me over.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, the new patient paperwork. Medicare can be… thorough. And you’re right, it's not always about an illness. I understand. Though, while we’re at it, is there anything at all you’ve been experiencing, even something small, that we should discuss?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. I feel pretty good, all things considered. Work keeps me busy, which is good. I install and repair valves, mostly for irrigation systems out on the reservation. It's physical work, but I like being outdoors. I don't really have any complaints.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Thyra. Physical work is excellent, keeps you moving. Just to be thorough, and since this is a new patient visit, I'll ask a few standard questions, if you don't mind. It helps me get a baseline understanding of your health. It’s just a formality, really. First, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No major surgeries, thankfully. I had pneumonia when I was a kid, pretty bad, but I recovered fully. And the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, all that. Nothing since, though. I did break my wrist a few years back, falling off a ladder at a job site, but it healed up okay. Just a cast for a few months.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia as a child, measles, chickenpox, and a wrist fracture. That's helpful. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mom passed away a few years back, she had some heart trouble. My dad’s still around, he’s 80 and doing pretty good for his age, just the usual aches and pains. My brother lives in Billings, he’s got high blood pressure, I think, but he doesn’t really talk about it much. That’s about all I know, honestly. We’re not a family that shares a lot of medical details.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Thyra. It’s common. Just good to have a general idea. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, not a single one. I try to stay away from pills if I can. I drink a lot of water, and try to eat healthy when I can, but other than that, nothing. I don’t even take vitamins, really. I figure, if my body needs something, it’ll let me know.
DOCTOR: That’s admirable, Thyra. A lot of people prefer that approach. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, like bee stings or latex?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything, as far as I know. I’ve been stung by bees a few times working outside, but just a little pain, that’s all. No swelling or trouble breathing or anything like that. I don’t have any sensitivities that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s all very good information, Thyra. Just a few more questions, then we can move on to the physical exam. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never have. My mom smoked for a while, but she quit years before she passed. I saw what it did to her lungs, so I stayed far away from it. I don’t care for the smell of it, either.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Thyra. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe on the weekends. Nothing heavy, and not every week. It’s more of a social thing, if my husband and I are out with friends. I don’t really need to drink it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Thyra. And finally, do you work with any hazardous materials, or have any exposure to chemicals or fumes at your job?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Sometimes, yeah. We work with different kinds of pipes and fittings, some of which have a strong smell. We use solvents to clean things sometimes, and wear masks when we do. It's not constant exposure, but it happens. We try to be careful, and follow all the safety guidelines. Mostly just dust and dirt, though, to be honest. Being outside, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, just to get a general idea of your current health status, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick look at your throat, ears, and eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I haven't been to a doctor in a while, so I figured I was due for a check-up anyway. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just have a seat here, I’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 122/78, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. All within normal limits. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your ears and throat… Open wide, please. Ears appear clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Everything looks good so far.
PATIENT: That was fast! Everything does sound good, huh? I told you, I feel pretty good. Honestly. It’s nice to hear someone say it, though.
DOCTOR: It is good to hear, Thyra. And yes, everything does sound good. Your vital signs are excellent, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Your ears and throat also appear healthy. Based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, it seems you are in good overall health. Now, are there any concerns you have that you haven’t mentioned, or anything at all you’d like to discuss further?
PATIENT: Nope, I think that covers it. Really. I just needed to get these forms filled out for Medicare, and you gave me a good check-up while you were at it. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Thyra. It was my pleasure. I'll go ahead and complete the necessary paperwork for Medicare. I recommend coming in for a routine check-up once a year to maintain your overall health. We can also discuss preventative screenings based on your age and family history during those visits. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good. You explained everything really well. I’ll remember to schedule something next year. Thank you again, Dr. Bombara. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Thyra. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here’s my card. Have a wonderful day, and stay healthy!
