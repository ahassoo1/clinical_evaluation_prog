DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I am Dr. Blim. I understand you’re here today. Let’s not waste time. Could you tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Right, well… it’s this itching. Everywhere, really. Started a couple weeks ago, maybe three. It’s not… painful, exactly. Just constant. Drives me a bit mad, to be honest. I’ve tried some lotions, you know, the over-the-counter stuff, but nothing seems to help much.
DOCTOR: “Everywhere,” you say. A rather… imprecise description, Mr. Ferneding. Is it localized to certain areas, or truly…全身?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry, Doctor. Yes, 全身 is… a good way to put it. It’s all over. Back, chest, arms, legs… even my scalp feels a bit itchy. It’s not worse anywhere, just… everywhere. It's been pretty consistent, too. Doesn't seem to flare up or get better at any particular time of day. Just… always there.
DOCTOR: Consistent,全身 itching for three weeks, unresponsive to over-the-counter remedies. Very well. Have you noticed any rash accompanying this pruritus?
PATIENT: Pruritus? Is that… the fancy word for itching? Yes, I think so. And no, Doctor, no rash. That's the strange thing. It's just…itchy skin. Red sometimes, after I scratch, naturally, but no bumps or blisters or anything like that. Just red, irritated skin from all the… well, you know.
DOCTOR: So, no visible dermatological abnormalities. Interesting. And have you experienced any other symptoms concurrent with this… inconvenience?
PATIENT: Inconvenience? That’s… one way to put it. But no, Doctor, not really. I sleep alright, eat normal, no fever, no weight loss, nothing like that. I've been feeling a bit… tired lately, but honestly, who isn't? I'm 53, and a widower, if that matters. It’s been… a bit of a year. But I wouldn't say the tiredness is new, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A widower. Right. Fatigue is… ubiquitous. Let's proceed systematically. Any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing major. I still cook for myself, pretty much the same things I always have. Lots of potatoes, some fish when I can get it, you know, the usual. I haven't started eating anything new or stopped eating anything I usually do. I do drink a fair amount of tea, though. Black tea, mostly. Always have.
DOCTOR: Black tea. Very well. And any new soaps, detergents, lotions other than those you’ve already mentioned being ineffective?
PATIENT: Oh, good question, Doctor. Let me think… actually, yes. My daughter, bless her heart, she bought me a new laundry detergent a few weeks back. Said it was “hypoallergenic” and “gentle on sensitive skin.” It smells… very floral. I usually just use the basic stuff, you know, the unscented kind. Could that be it? It started around the time she gave me that detergent, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Hypoallergenic. A marketing term, Mr. Ferneding, nothing more. We shall examine the possibility. And your past medical history?
PATIENT: Right, you're probably right about the detergent. Marketing, definitely. As for my medical history… not much to speak of, honestly. I had chickenpox as a kid, a broken arm when I was a teenager, but nothing serious. My wife, she had the high blood pressure, but I never did. No allergies that I know of, never been hospitalized, never had any surgeries. Just the usual colds and flu, I suppose. Oh, and my wife had… eczema, when she was a girl. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: A family history of eczema is… noted. And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, Doctor. Nothing else. Not even aspirin or ibuprofen, unless I get a really bad headache. I try to stay away from medications as much as possible. My wife… she was always taking something.
DOCTOR: Very well. I observe no significant dermatological findings. Your skin appears… unremarkable. We shall proceed with a basic lab work-up to rule out common causes. Complete Blood Count, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, and Liver Function Tests. We will also test for thyroid stimulating hormone, to rule out thyroid dysfunction. Do you have any objections to these tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no objections at all. Sounds… thorough. As long as it helps figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. I’m just… tired of itching. So, if these tests can give us some answers, that would be great. Where do I go to get them done?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, room 102. They will take a sample of your blood. Fasting is not required for these tests, but do try to remain hydrated. Once the results are back, we will review them and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions before I dismiss you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Room 102, got it. No fasting, good to know. Thank you for… listening, and for running the tests. I appreciate it. I’ll go get that done now. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. You may go. And try to avoid scratching, Mr. Ferneding. It will only exacerbate the condition. Honestly, some patients….
