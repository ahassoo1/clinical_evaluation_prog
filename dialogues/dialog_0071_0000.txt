DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Or… is it Sharifa?
PATIENT: Sharifa is fine. Honestly, most people can’t be bothered with the full name. And good morning to you too, Doctor… Galena, is it? I read your bio online – Dutch, right? Interesting. Now, about my legs… they just feel… gone, almost. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a nasty cold. Not a fever, just the sniffles and a cough, but now this. It's really quite inconvenient, you know. I have tours scheduled.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod, making a note on the chart. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. Dutch, yes, that’s right. Though I’ve been here long enough, I suppose. And tours, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, tours! I'm a guide. People pay me to walk them around and show them things. Difficult to do when you can barely stand, wouldn't you agree? It’s not just a hobby, Doctor. I have a reputation to uphold. I specialize in the historical district, you know. People expect… a certain level of… competence. This weakness is rather embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I understand. A reputation is important. So, this weakness… is it in both legs?
PATIENT: Yes, both. It's not like one is completely fine and the other isn't. It’s… evenly distributed, I suppose. Though, if I had to pick, the left one feels a little worse, maybe? It’s hard to explain. It's not painful, exactly. Just… heavy. Like trying to lift weights I don’t have the strength for. And it gets worse as the day goes on, naturally. Walking any distance is becoming… problematic.
DOCTOR: Alright, heavy… worse with activity, even distribution… and you mentioned this started after a cold. Any other symptoms with the cold besides sniffles and cough?
PATIENT: No, that was pretty much it. A little tired, but everyone gets tired when they’re sick. No aches, no sore throat, no headache… honestly, it was a very mild cold. That’s what’s so baffling about this leg thing. A perfectly good, healthy cold shouldn't lead to this. It's rather… illogical, wouldn’t you say? I take very good care of myself, Doctor. Vitamins, proper diet, plenty of water… it’s just not making sense.
DOCTOR: Illogical, yes. We'll try to figure it out. Have you noticed any tingling or numbness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no tingling or numbness. Just… weakness. It feels like the muscles just… won’t respond properly. Like they’ve forgotten how to work. Honestly, it’s quite alarming. I’ve never experienced anything like this before. And frankly, I don’t have time for mysterious ailments. I have a tour scheduled for Friday. A very important one with a group of… discerning clients. They expect a certain level of… performance. I need to be able to walk, Doctor. It's really quite simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, no tingling, just weakness. And Friday’s tour is important. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better idea of what we're dealing with. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must warn you, it's not a pretty sight. And please be careful. I don’t want to fall and ruin everything. This chair is rather… low to the ground, isn’t it? It feels like I’m climbing out of a well. Honestly, Doctor, I hope you know what you're doing.
DOCTOR: Just a few steps forward and back, if you could. That’s alright… yes, I see. Your gait is… slightly unsteady. And there's some weakness in both legs, particularly on dorsiflexion – lifting the tops of your feet. Do you feel any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not pain. Just… effort. It’s like trying to push through thick mud. And yes, lifting my feet is… difficult. They feel like lead weights. Honestly, it's quite undignified. A tour guide shouldn't have to struggle to lift their feet, Doctor. It's simply… unprofessional. Are you going to take any tests? Or are you just going to watch me wobble around like a newborn foal? I have a schedule to keep, you know.
DOCTOR: No pain, just effort. We will need to do some tests, yes. I'd like to order a blood test - a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel - to rule out any underlying imbalances. And perhaps an MRI of your legs, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on with the nerves and muscles. We also need to check your Vitamin B12 levels. It's not always a definitive answer, but it's worth looking into given your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds rather… extreme. I have a very busy schedule, you know. And I'm rather claustrophobic, if you must know. Blood test, fine. Vitamin B12, fine. But an MRI? Is it absolutely necessary? And how long will these tests take? I have a tour on Friday, remember? Discerning clients. Important people. Honestly, I'm starting to think I should have just stayed home and rested. This is all very… disruptive. Do you at least have a preliminary idea of what might be causing this? Or are we just going on a wild goose chase?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the MRI, Ms. Firestone. It’s not my first choice, but given the weakness and the timing after the cold, we need to rule out some possibilities. It's a precaution, really. It helps us see if there's any nerve compression or inflammation. As for a preliminary idea... it could be a number of things. Sometimes, post-viral weakness can occur, though it's unusual. Another possibility could be a nerve issue, or even a muscular problem. We need the tests to narrow it down. The blood test results should be back within a day or two. The MRI will take longer to schedule, but we can try to get you in as soon as possible. Perhaps we can discuss options for managing your symptoms in the meantime – gentle stretching, rest, and avoiding strenuous activity?
PATIENT: Fine. Tests, fine. But if I have to lie in one of those claustrophobic tubes, you're personally responsible for explaining my absence to my clients. And as for gentle stretching… honestly, Doctor, I’m a tour guide, not a yoga instructor. My job requires strenuous activity. It’s rather ironic, isn’t it? But… alright. Blood tests first, then we’ll see about this MRI. Just promise me you’ll try to get it done as quickly as possible. And… perhaps a referral for some temporary help? Someone to cover my tours while I’m… incapacitated? It’s really quite a lot to deal with. Honestly, I think I need a cup of tea. A very strong cup of tea. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Firestone. I’ll write you a referral for temporary coverage, and we’ll get those tests scheduled as quickly as we can. And yes, a strong cup of tea sounds like a good idea. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood. And don’t worry. We’ll figure this out.
