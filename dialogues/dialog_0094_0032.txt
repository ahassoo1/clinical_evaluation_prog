DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Though, frankly, I don’t recall making an appointment. My wife, you see, she’s the one who usually handles these things. Something… rather unpleasant has arisen, and she insisted I come. It's... a bit embarrassing to discuss, truthfully. A discharge, she called it. Said it needed… attending to.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. It's not uncommon for things to be a little unclear, and these types of concerns can certainly be sensitive. Don’t feel embarrassed at all – we're here to help, and I assure you I’ve discussed similar issues with many patients. So, a discharge… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… it’s been happening for… oh, goodness, I couldn’t say precisely. A week? Perhaps longer. My wife noticed it first, naturally. She has a keen eye for such things. It's… a fluid. Not a large amount, thankfully, but enough to be… concerning. It’s clear, I believe, though I haven't… scrutinized it closely. It’s simply… there. And a bit… uncomfortable, if I am honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear fluid, noticed for about a week or so. And you’re experiencing some discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, discomfort. Not pain, precisely. More… a sort of… burning sensation. Especially after… well, after relieving myself. And sometimes… a slight itch. It’s not debilitating, mind you. I’ve endured worse in my life, working with farm equipment all these years. But it's… bothersome. And my wife, she was quite insistent I get it checked. Women, you know? They worry so.
DOCTOR: They certainly do, and it’s often a good thing that they do. A burning sensation and some itching after urination… that gives us some helpful information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. No fever, that I’m aware of. No swelling, no redness… no visible sores, thankfully. I haven't noticed any pain in my lower back. Oh! My wife mentioned something about a slight… odour. I haven’t personally detected anything, but she has a rather sensitive nose. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a simple man. I deal with tractors and combines, not… delicate matters like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no swelling, no redness, no back pain, and your wife has noted a slight odour. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical conditions… Goodness. I've lived a long life, Doctor. I had the measles as a boy, of course. And a rather nasty bout of influenza in ‘68. Oh, and a broken arm when I was a teenager – fell off a horse, foolishly trying to impress a girl. As for anything serious… I had my prostate checked a few years back, routine, nothing alarming. Otherwise, I’ve been remarkably healthy, if I do say so myself. Mostly aches and pains from years of hard work.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Krok. So, a routine prostate check with no concerns noted. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Yes, I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, barely a boy. And… oh, yes! A rather large mole removed from my back a few years ago. Skin cancer, they said, but thankfully caught early. Other than that… I don't believe so. I've always been lucky, you see. Managed to avoid serious illnesses and injuries for the most part.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and mole removal. And no family history of any significant medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Family history? Not that I recall. My father was a farmer, strong as an ox, lived to be eighty-five. My mother… she passed away when I was young, from… well, I don’t recall precisely. It was a long time ago. We weren’t a family prone to illness, you see. Mostly hard workers, plain and simple. We took care of ourselves, relied on common sense and good living. No fancy doctors or hospitals, for the most part.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a small dose of aspirin every other day for my joints, you know, to keep the stiffness at bay. And occasionally, a bit of ibuprofen when they really flare up. Otherwise, no. I prefer to avoid pills whenever possible. My wife, she insists on a multivitamin, something about keeping my “energy levels up”, but I can’t say I notice much difference. I prefer a good night’s sleep and a hearty meal.
DOCTOR: Alright, aspirin and ibuprofen as needed for joint pain, and a multivitamin. And you have no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’ve never been allergic to anything in my life. I’ve handled all sorts of things on the farm – pesticides, fertilizers, animal dander… I’ve built up a strong constitution, you see. My wife, she’s the one with the allergies – pollen, dust mites, cats… a whole host of things. But me? No. I’m as hardy as an old oak tree.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, Mr. Krok, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. It’ll just involve listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief examination of your abdomen and, with your permission, a genitourinary exam to take a closer look at the area you’re concerned about. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a genitourinary exam? Well, that sounds… rather intrusive, Doctor. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, I’ve already told you the symptoms. Couldn’t you just… prescribe something? I’d rather not have you… poking around, if you don’t mind. I’m an old man, you see. A bit… sensitive, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Mr. Krok. It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. You are right, we could proceed with a preliminary treatment based on your description of the symptoms. However, to ensure an accurate diagnosis and the most effective course of treatment, a brief examination would be very helpful. It will allow me to rule out other potential causes and determine the specific issue. We will proceed with the utmost respect and discretion, and I will explain every step as we go. I can also have a chaperone present if you would feel more comfortable. If you remain uncomfortable, we can certainly discuss alternative approaches, but it may limit my ability to provide the best possible care. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Well… you make a compelling argument, Doctor. I suppose… I suppose it’s better to know for certain. I don’t like the idea of it, mind you. But I also don’t want this lingering on. Very well. But please… be gentle. And explain everything as you go. And… yes, a chaperone would be… appreciated. My wife isn’t here, unfortunately. Perhaps one of the nurses?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. We will proceed with the utmost care and respect. I will explain everything as we go, and I'll have Nurse Anya assist us. She’s very experienced and will ensure your comfort. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Goodness, this isn't as easy as it used to be. All these years of farm work, you see. It takes its toll on the joints. Very well… here I am. Please, be quick about it. And don't be alarmed if I make a noise or two. My back isn't what it used to be either.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Now, just take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Blood pressure is 140/85, which is a little elevated, but not overly concerning for your age. Pulse is 72. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Soft, no tenderness here. Everything feels normal. Now, to proceed with the examination of the genitourinary area, I'll need you to lower your trousers and undergarments. Nurse Anya will be right in to assist us. Again, we’ll proceed slowly and with respect, and I'll explain every step as we go. Please, don’t hesitate to voice any concerns or discomfort.
PATIENT: Very well… but do hurry, Doctor. This is… rather undignified. And please, be gentle. I repeat, gentle. I’ve lived a long life, but I’m still a sensitive man. And… perhaps a distraction? Some conversation, anything to take my mind off things? Tell me about your practice, perhaps? Or the weather? Anything will do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. Nurse Anya is excellent at providing a calming presence. And I’m happy to chat while we proceed. Alright, Mr. Krok, I’m just going to take a look at the external genitalia. I’m looking for any signs of redness, swelling, or lesions. I’ll also gently palpate the prostate through the rectum. This will allow me to assess its size and texture. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. Please, let me know immediately if you experience any pain. I do notice some mild redness and slight swelling of the glans. The prostate feels slightly enlarged but smooth. No nodules or tenderness. I also note a small amount of clear discharge. Alright, Mr. Krok, that’s all for now. You can go ahead and get dressed. Nurse Anya will help you if needed. We'll discuss our findings and next steps in a moment.
PATIENT: Goodness, that was… unpleasant. I’m glad it’s over. What did you find, Doctor? Is it serious? And what does all this mean? I trust you have a diagnosis? I’m a simple man, Doctor. I just want this sorted out, quickly and efficiently.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Based on my examination, it appears you have a case of non-gonococcal urethritis, likely caused by a bacterial infection. The redness and swelling I observed, along with the discharge, are consistent with this diagnosis. It's not a sexually transmitted infection, though it can be contracted through other means, such as bacterial imbalances. It’s a common condition, treatable with antibiotics. The good news is it’s not serious, and with a short course of medication, we should be able to resolve the symptoms. However, it's important to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed to prevent recurrence. I’ll also recommend some supportive measures, such as drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding irritants. Do you have any questions so far, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Non-gonococcal… what did you call it? And… antibiotics? I’ve always avoided taking pills whenever possible. Are there no other options? And what about… recurrence? You said it might come back? Goodness, this is all rather alarming. Is it… contagious? Will I have to inform my wife? She’s a worrier, you see. This is going to cause quite the commotion, I fear.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Krok. It’s perfectly natural to be worried. Let me address your concerns one by one. Non-gonococcal urethritis simply means an inflammation of the urethra caused by bacteria other than gonorrhea. It’s not a sexually transmitted infection, although it can be spread through close contact. Regarding antibiotics, I understand your preference to avoid pills. However, antibiotics are the most effective way to treat this infection and prevent complications. We can discuss the lowest effective dose and minimize any potential side effects. As for recurrence, it’s possible, but less likely if you complete the full course of antibiotics and follow some preventative measures, like staying well-hydrated and practicing good hygiene. Regarding your wife, it’s not contagious in the typical sense, but it’s possible she could have been exposed through close contact. I recommend she also see a physician for evaluation, just to be safe. It’s better to be cautious. I’ll write you a prescription for a 7-day course of doxycycline. It’s a common antibiotic and generally well-tolerated. I’ll also give you some instructions on hygiene and preventative measures. And I’ll provide a referral for your wife to see a physician. Does that address your concerns, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Seven days… well, it’s better than a lifetime, I suppose. And a referral for my wife… she’s going to be furious. But I suppose it’s best to be safe, as you say. Doxycycline… is it safe for an old man like me? Will it interact with my aspirin? And what about… side effects? Will I be sick? Will it make me tired? I have chores to do, you see. I can’t afford to be bedridden.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krok. It’s perfectly reasonable to be worried about side effects, especially given your age and existing medication. Doxycycline is generally safe for older adults, but it can interact with certain medications. Aspirin is typically fine to continue taking with doxycycline, but it's always best to be cautious. We will note the interaction in your record, and I'll advise you to monitor for any increased bleeding. Common side effects of doxycycline can include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some people may experience photosensitivity, meaning they are more sensitive to sunlight, so I recommend wearing sunscreen and avoiding prolonged sun exposure. Fatigue is also a possibility, but it's not common. I’ll write a prescription for a lower dose of doxycycline to minimize the risk of side effects. If you experience any significant side effects, such as severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, please contact me immediately. And I'll provide you with a list of potential side effects and what to do if they occur. I'll also give you a list of supportive measures, such as drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding irritants. And I'll provide you with a referral for your wife to see a physician. Does that address your concerns, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that does address my concerns, Doctor. A lower dose… that’s reassuring. And the list of side effects… I suppose it’s better to be prepared. Very well. Write your prescription, and I’ll be on my way. My wife is expecting me, and I suspect she’ll want an explanation. This has been… quite the ordeal. Thank you, Doctor, for your patience and kindness. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krok. I’m glad I could help. Here is your prescription for doxycycline, along with the list of potential side effects and supportive measures. And here is the referral for your wife to see a physician. Please, don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. And remember to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed, even if you start feeling better. I wish you and your wife all the best. Take care, and have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been most helpful. I suspect my wife will have many questions for you as well. Very well. I’ll be on my way. And… Doctor? Perhaps it’s best to avoid discussing this with my neighbors. They’re a rather gossipy bunch, you see. Good day to you.
