DOCTOR: Hi Jinnie, good morning. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Well, it's…rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that's why one comes to a doctor, isn’t it? It’s a…a problem. A delicate problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No need to be embarrassed at all, Jinnie. We deal with all sorts of things here, and everything you tell me will be completely confidential. Just take your time and tell me what’s been going on. Can you tell me a little more about this problem?
PATIENT: It’s…discharge. From…down there. And it’s not…normal. Not at all. It’s been going on for…oh, I don't know, a week or so, maybe a little longer. Honestly, keeping track of these things is…difficult. It's certainly not something a lady wants to discuss.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s not easy to talk about, Jinnie, and I appreciate you being open with me. “Not normal” is a good way to describe it – can you tell me a bit more about what is normal for you, and what's different now?
PATIENT: Well, normally…there's nothing. Absolutely nothing. A proper lady keeps herself…clean and tidy. This is…a fluid. A milky fluid, and…and it smells. Not a pleasant smell, Doctor, let me assure you. It's…fishy. Though, I haven't been fishing lately, so I don’t know if that’s the correct descriptor. It's…unacceptable. It’s quite distressing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a milky fluid with a fishy odor. That's helpful. And you said it's been going on for about a week or longer. Has it gotten worse over that time, or stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s definitely worse. At first, I thought it was just…a bit of dampness, you understand? But now…now I have to change my…undergarments several times a day. It's most inconvenient, and rather unsanitary, if you ask me. A proper lady doesn’t have these sorts of troubles. I haven't noticed any…burning or itching, thankfully. Just the smell, and the…discharge. It’s very upsetting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased amount of discharge, milky in color, fishy odor, and no burning or itching. That helps me narrow things down. Have you had any fever, lower abdominal pain, or unusual fatigue recently?
PATIENT: Fever? Goodness, no. I haven’t been ill. And pain? A proper lady doesn't complain of pain. Though, I have been a little…tired lately, now that you mention it. But that’s probably just the heat. August is terribly hot, you know. And worrying about this hasn't helped my disposition, I assure you. It’s simply…unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no abdominal pain, just some fatigue, likely related to the heat and worry. Have you had any changes in your sexual activity recently?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really. Is that necessary to ask? I am a single woman of…a certain age. Let’s just say my days of…that are well behind me. It’s rather rude to inquire, if you ask me. I came here for a medical problem, not…personal questions.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Jinnie. I understand your discomfort, and I didn't mean to be intrusive. I ask because changes in sexual activity can sometimes contribute to these types of symptoms, but it's certainly not necessary to discuss if you’re not comfortable. Let's move on. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections in the past?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! The very idea! I have lived a…respectable life. I would never have…such things. I find your line of questioning quite…offensive, Doctor. I expect a higher level of decorum from a medical professional. This is all rather upsetting. I may need to seek a second opinion.
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize, Jinnie. I understand your distress and I truly didn't intend to offend you. My questions are simply part of a thorough evaluation, and I apologize for not explaining that better. Let’s back up a bit. Have you experienced any similar issues in the past, even before this current problem?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… years ago, when I was… younger, I had something…similar. But it was quickly resolved with a…a cream, I think. A pink cream. I don't remember the name, of course. That was decades ago. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It wasn’t nearly as…unpleasant as this, though. It cleared up quickly. And it was a very different time then. Things were…simpler.
DOCTOR: Okay, a similar issue in the past that was treated with a cream, and resolved quickly. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I believe I had a reaction to some sort of antibiotic years ago… gave me a terrible rash. But I can’t recall the name of it. It was a red pill, I believe. And I'm terribly sensitive to…perfume. Makes my head ache. Other than that, no. I am generally quite robust, despite this…affliction. It’s just… deeply inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, allergy to a red antibiotic pill and sensitivity to perfume. Good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve me listening to your abdomen, and a gentle pelvic exam to take a look and potentially collect a sample to send to the lab. This sample will help us identify the cause of the discharge and get you the appropriate treatment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A…pelvic exam? Doctor, are you certain that is necessary? It sounds…rather invasive. I came to you with a simple problem, and now you want to…examine me? I'm not certain I'm comfortable with that. It sounds…undignified. Perhaps we could just try a different cream? The pink one, perhaps? That seemed to work before.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Jinnie, and I want to assure you that I will do everything to make you as comfortable as possible. The exam is the best way to accurately determine the cause of the discharge. Trying a cream without knowing the cause could mask the symptoms and potentially delay proper treatment if it's something more serious. It's very important to rule out other possibilities. The exam is very quick and discreet. If we identify the cause, we can get you on the right track to feeling better quickly. Would you be willing to let me explain the exam procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Explain it, I suppose. But I still maintain that it seems…excessive. And please, be quick about it. I have appointments, you know. And I really don't care for the idea of…being examined. It's…humiliating. Proceed, but be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jinnie. I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. First, I'll have you lie on your back on the exam table with your knees bent and feet flat on the table. I’ll drape you with a sheet to maintain your privacy. Then, I’ll use a speculum – a gently curved instrument – to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visualize the cervix. It may feel a little pressure, but shouldn't be painful. I’ll take a small sample of the discharge for testing. The whole process takes just a few minutes. We can stop at any time if you're uncomfortable. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: A…speculum? It sounds…unpleasant. And what sort of testing? Will it hurt? And what if…what if you find something…bad? I'm not certain I'm prepared for bad news. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather…distressing. Perhaps I should just go home and take a bath. A very hot bath with lots of…scented bubbles. Yes, that sounds much better. No, thank you. I've changed my mind. I think I’ll just…leave.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jinnie. It’s perfectly alright to change your mind. It’s important that you feel comfortable and safe. I apologize if I’ve made you feel uncomfortable. However, I do strongly recommend getting this checked out, as untreated infections can lead to complications. Perhaps we could start with a urine test, which is non-invasive and can sometimes give us some preliminary information?
PATIENT: A urine test… well, that sounds… less intrusive. Very well, Doctor. A urine test. But that is all. No…speculums. Absolutely no speculums. And if it doesn't reveal anything conclusive, I’m leaving. I have a very busy schedule, you know. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jinnie. Just a urine test. No speculum. We can do that right away. I'll have you follow me to the restroom. I'll provide a sterile cup, and you can collect a sample. I'll label it, and we'll send it to the lab for analysis. It usually takes a few days to get the results. Let’s go ahead and get that done, and then we can discuss next steps.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Lead the way. But please, be quick. And ensure it's…discreet. A proper lady doesn't want to draw attention to herself. Honestly, this is all very…undignified. .
