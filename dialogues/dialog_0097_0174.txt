DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I haven’t been feeling myself lately. Just… down. I suppose that’s the best way to put it. I’d like to get this sorted, if possible. I don’t have a great deal of time, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, “down” is a good place to start. It's helpful you're able to describe it that way. And I understand you're concerned about time, we’ll do our best to be efficient. When you say you haven't been feeling yourself, can you tell me a little more about how that manifests?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I used to be very active. Ski patrol in the winter, lifeguarding in the warmer months… kept me busy, kept me going. Now… I find little joy in it. Everything feels like a… a tremendous effort. Even getting out of bed. I sleep a lot, but I’m still tired. And I don’t… I don't really want to see my friends anymore. I used to enjoy their company greatly. It’s just… not the same. It’s been going on for a few months now, I’d say. Three, maybe four? It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Nani. Losing interest in things you used to enjoy, feeling tired despite sleeping, and withdrawing from friends… those are important things to mention. And three to four months is a significant period. To help me get a clearer picture, would you mind if I ask you a few questions – it’s just a short checklist, really – about how you’ve been feeling emotionally and physically?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I’m… I’m not one for lengthy examinations, if you understand. Just the important bits, please. Let's get this done, shall we?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nani. We’ll focus on the essentials. This is the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. It asks about how often you’ve been bothered by different problems over the last two weeks. There are no right or wrong answers, just be honest about what you’ve been experiencing. Take your time, and let me know if you have any questions. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: There. I think that covers it. It wasn’t…pleasant, but I answered truthfully. Though, frankly, some of those questions felt a bit…personal. Do you need me to elaborate on anything? I'm hoping this is enough to give you an idea of what's going on.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nani. Okay. This gives me a clearer picture. It looks like you're experiencing symptoms consistent with moderate depression. Now, I want to be very clear: depression is a common medical condition – it's not a sign of weakness, and it’s very treatable. Before we discuss possible next steps, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your background, just to rule out any other potential contributing factors. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. As long as it's relevant, Doctor. I suppose I have little choice. My background… well, it's been a long life. Divorced some years ago, no children. I've always been…independent. Used to traveling for work, keeping busy. No family nearby, really. Just a few distant cousins I rarely see. Is that what you need to know? And please, let's not dwell on the past too much. It won’t change anything.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Nani. Knowing about your support system and life circumstances is important. Now, let's talk about your physical health. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: My appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I eat very little, others I find myself…comfort eating, I suppose. Mostly sweets. And yes, I believe I’ve put on a little weight. Nothing drastic, but enough to notice. My clothes feel…tighter. It’s probably just age, though. And the lack of activity, now that I think about it. Still, it’s…troubling. Everything feels off, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, changes in appetite and weight are common with depression, so that's not unexpected. Now, I'd like to ask about your sleep. You mentioned you sleep a lot, but is it restful sleep?
PATIENT: No. Not restful, no. I go to bed early, I wake up several times during the night. I lie there…thinking. Worrying. It takes me a long time to get back to sleep. And even when I do, I wake up feeling…exhausted. As if I hadn't slept at all. It's… frustrating. I used to sleep like a log, you see. Now... it's a constant battle. I've tried warm milk, chamomile tea… nothing seems to help.
DOCTOR: Okay. Difficulty sleeping, waking up feeling unrested… those are significant symptoms as well. Now, I’m going to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to how you're feeling. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and do a basic neurological exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you must. Though I can assure you, Doctor, I’m as healthy as an old woman can be. I’ve always been quite careful with my health. But…go ahead. Just…be quick, if you would? I do have an appointment later this afternoon. A bridge club meeting, you see. Though, truthfully, I don’t think I have the energy for it anymore.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise, everything sounds normal. Your thyroid feels within normal limits, and your reflexes are good. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, the most likely explanation for how you’re feeling is depression. However, to be absolutely sure, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will help rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, alright. If that's what you think is best, Doctor. Though I can assure you, my bloodwork has always been impeccable. Still, do what you must. The sooner we get this sorted, the sooner I can get back to… well, whatever it is I do these days. Just…please tell me when and where I can get these tests done. I don’t want to spend all day running around.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. We’ll make it as easy as possible. Here’s a requisition for some routine bloodwork. You can get these tests done at the clinic lab just down the hall. They’re open until 5:00 PM today. It should only take about 30 minutes. While we're waiting for the results, I’d like to discuss some treatment options with you. The good news is that depression is very treatable. We can explore things like lifestyle changes – regular exercise, a healthy diet, getting enough sleep – and, if those aren’t enough, medication. Are you open to discussing medication?
PATIENT: Medication… hmm. I’ve always been wary of pills, Doctor. I prefer to rely on my own strength, if you understand. But… if it's absolutely necessary, I suppose I’m willing to consider it. Though I’d like to hear about the side effects first. And I want something… mild. I don’t want to be drowsy or… foggy. I still need to be able to function, you see. This bridge club meeting, for example. Though, truthfully, I’m starting to question whether I even have the energy for that anymore. Tell me… what are my options?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Nani. It’s wise to be cautious, and it’s good that you're thinking about potential side effects. There are many different antidepressants available, and they all have different profiles. For someone new to antidepressants, and given your preference for something mild, we might consider a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI, like sertraline or escitalopram. These medications generally have fewer side effects than older antidepressants. Common side effects can include nausea, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction, but these are often mild and temporary. Another option is bupropion, which can be particularly helpful if you’re feeling fatigued. It's a bit different from SSRIs, and the side effects are also a little different. We’d start with a low dose and gradually increase it until we find the optimal dose for you. And, of course, we’d monitor you closely for any side effects. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Sertraline… escitalopram… bupropion… It all sounds rather… complicated, Doctor. And frankly, a little frightening. Nausea, insomnia, sexual dysfunction… good heavens. Honestly, the side effects sound almost as bad as feeling depressed. Is there… is there anything else? Perhaps something more… natural? I’ve heard good things about St. John’s Wort, or… or even just talking to someone? Before we resort to pills, I’d like to explore other options, if possible. Perhaps a few sessions with a therapist? I suppose it wouldn't hurt to try that first.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Nani. Exploring non-medication options first is absolutely reasonable, and often a good starting point. St. John's Wort can interact with other medications, so it's best to avoid it without discussing it with me first. But therapy is an excellent option. There are several qualified therapists in the area, and I’m happy to provide you with a referral. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, is often very effective for depression. It helps you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. I also want to emphasize that even with therapy, medication can be a helpful adjunct, particularly if your symptoms are severe. But we can certainly start with therapy and see how you respond. Here’s a list of therapists. I’d recommend scheduling a consultation with a few different ones to see who you feel most comfortable with. And I’m happy to discuss your progress and adjust our treatment plan as needed. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds…reasonable. Talking to someone… it’s not something I’ve ever done before, frankly. But… perhaps it's worth a try. I'll take a look at this list and see who sounds… tolerable. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you not pushing the pills on me immediately. Honestly, I was rather apprehensive about that. Now… I suppose I should get these blood tests done. And then… then I'll try to find a therapist. This is all rather… exhausting. But thank you. Really.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nani. It's my job to listen to your concerns and help you find the best treatment plan for you. Take your time with everything, and don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And yes, go get those blood tests done when you have a chance. I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Have a good day, Nani. And remember, you’re not alone in this.
