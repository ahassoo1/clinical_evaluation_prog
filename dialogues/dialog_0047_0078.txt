DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, a jumpstart, if you will. I haven't been feeling quite myself lately, and I’m hoping you can help me figure out what that means.
DOCTOR: "Stuck," alright. And how long have you been feeling this way, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s been…gradual, I suppose. Maybe the last six months or so? It didn’t happen overnight. It's just…less energy, less motivation. Things that used to be easy feel harder. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, yes. Gradual onset is quite common. And can you tell me a little more about this lack of energy and motivation?
PATIENT: Well, my work… I’m a molder, shaping things, mostly ceramics. I enjoy it, usually. But lately, even starting a new piece feels…daunting. I find myself putting it off, or just…not caring as much about the details. And it's not just work, honestly. Even things around the house… I used to keep a lovely garden, but it’s gotten a bit overgrown. It's just…hard to get going. I feel…flat, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: "Flat." Right. And has anything specific happened in the last six months that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: That’s a thoughtful question. Let me think… Well, my eldest daughter, Sofia, she moved to California for a job. I was very proud of her, of course! But…she’s always been very close, and I miss her terribly. It's been…a big adjustment, not having her nearby. Also, my husband, Ricardo, he’s been working longer hours at the bakery. So, things have been a little busier around the house, generally. But I wouldn’t say anything majorly stressful, just…different.
DOCTOR: So, a daughter moving away and a husband working more hours. Alright. And aside from feeling “flat,” are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. I’ve been sleeping… alright, I suppose. Not terribly well, not terribly badly. Maybe a little more tired when I wake up than I used to be. And… my appetite hasn't been great, but I also haven’t been actively losing weight, if that makes sense. I just… don’t feel as hungry. Oh! And sometimes, I feel a little… anxious. Just a general sort of worry, but nothing specific. Does that help? I'm not sure if any of this is useful.
DOCTOR: It’s all useful, Ms. Pitzel. Everything helps build a picture. You mentioned anxiety – can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like panic attacks or anything dramatic, Doctor. It's more… a persistent sort of unease. Just a feeling that something isn't quite right. I worry about Sofia, naturally, being so far away. And I worry about Ricardo working too hard. And… honestly, I worry about myself, and why I’m feeling this way. It's just… a low-level hum of worry, most of the time. It doesn't stop me from doing things, but it's… always there. It's tiring, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your mood, besides this “flatness”?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I wouldn’t say I’m sad, exactly. More…detached, perhaps? I don’t get the same joy from things I used to enjoy. My garden, for instance. It used to be such a source of pleasure, but now… it just feels like another task. I wouldn't say I'm crying or anything, or feeling hopeless, but… the color feels a bit faded, if that makes sense. Like everything is just… muted. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: "Muted." Yes, I understand. Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, a very long time ago. And I broke my wrist a few years back, gardening, ironically enough. But other than that… not much, really. I've always been quite healthy, generally. I do have slightly high blood pressure, my doctor has mentioned it, but it’s usually well-controlled with medication. I take a small dose every day. Other than that, no major health concerns.
DOCTOR: And what medication is that, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It’s… let me see if I can remember the name… It’s lisinopril, I believe. A small white pill. I’ve been taking it for about five years now. My family doctor prescribed it, and it seems to be doing its job. I get it refilled regularly, no problems.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I don’t. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything, as far as I know. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven't had any problems with medications in the past. It’s one of the things I’m grateful for, actually. No pesky allergies to worry about!
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, well. My mother had diabetes, type 2. She managed it with diet and medication for many years. And my father… he had heart problems later in life. Nothing too specific, just… general heart trouble. My brother is healthy, as far as I know, but we don’t see each other very often. So, that’s about it, really. Nothing too alarming, but those are the main things. I try to eat healthily, to be proactive, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… well, I’m married, as I mentioned. Ricardo and I have been married for twenty-five years. We have two daughters, Sofia, who’s in California, and Isabella, who’s still at home, studying at the university. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I enjoy gardening, as we’ve discussed, and I used to be very active in the church community, but… I haven’t been going as much lately. It’s all a bit… muted, as I said.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Given your symptoms, and your medical history, I think we need to do a quick physical examination. Then, I'd like to order some blood work, just to rule out any underlying medical causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. A physical examination and some blood work… yes, let’s do that. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get back to feeling like myself again. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just step over here and lie down, we’ll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then, I'll listen to your lungs and abdomen, and do a quick neurological exam. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Very good. Let’s get this done then, shall we? I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 135 over 88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Heart rate is 72, regular rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, motor strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. However, the blood work is important to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, I suppose, that it’s not anything obvious. I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. So, the blood work will tell us more? What exactly are we looking for? I don't want to be a bother, but I like to understand things.
DOCTOR: We're looking for a number of things, Ms. Pitzel. Primarily, we’ll check your complete blood count to rule out anemia or infection. We'll also check your thyroid function, as hypothyroidism can cause similar symptoms. We’ll assess your vitamin D levels, as deficiency is common and can contribute to fatigue and mood changes. And, of course, we’ll check your blood glucose levels to rule out diabetes. It’s standard procedure, given your symptoms and your family history. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, it’s simply to be comprehensive.
PATIENT: That makes a lot of sense, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. Thyroid, vitamin D, blood glucose… I can remember that. So, after the blood work, we’ll discuss the results and go from there? I’m quite willing to follow your recommendations, whatever they may be. It’s just… I want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pitzel. We'll review the results when they come back, typically within a few days. We'll discuss your options then. In the meantime, I recommend trying to maintain a regular sleep schedule, and ensuring you're getting adequate nutrition. And, if you're feeling overwhelmed, consider speaking with a therapist. Sometimes, simply talking things through can be helpful. I'm sending the lab order now. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. A therapist… I’ll consider that. I suppose there’s no harm in talking to someone. And I will definitely try to get more sleep. I appreciate your help, and your thoroughness. I’m ready when the phlebotomist arrives.
DOCTOR: Very well. They should be with you shortly. I’ll be back to review the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. Chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache… go to the emergency room. I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you again for your time and attention. I’m feeling a little less anxious now, knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. I’ll just sit here and wait for the phlebotomist, then.
DOCTOR: Very well.
PATIENT: .
