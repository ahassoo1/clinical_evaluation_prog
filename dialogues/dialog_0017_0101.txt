DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been havin’. Right at the back of me head, you know? Been botherin’ me for a bit now. Not constant, comes and goes, but when it does come… ooh, it's a proper one.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A headache, you say. And it’s located at the back of the head. For how long precisely have you been experiencing these headaches, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Let me think now… properly started, oh, maybe three weeks ago? But I had a little twinge before that, maybe a month and a half ago, but nothin’ to write home about. Just thought it was from bendin’ over the nail polish all day, you know? But then it got…more regular. Three weeks, I’d say, definite three weeks.
DOCTOR: Three weeks. And you attribute it initially to…bending over?
PATIENT: That's right, Doctor. I'm a manicurist, see? Lots of close work, lookin’ down at hands and feet all day. Thought it was just me neck, gettin’ stiff. I do try to stretch, but… well, you know how it is. Time flies when you're makin' ladies pretty! But it's not gone away with the stretchin', so I figured maybe it’s somethin’ more.
DOCTOR: A manicurist. And you've been stretching. Very well. Is there anything else accompanying these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Not really, no. No blurry vision, no nausea, nothin’ like that. Sometimes, when it's really bad, I feel a little… dizzy, maybe? But that don't last long. And my wife says I’ve been a bit more quiet than usual, but she always says that when I’m focused on the dominoes. She says I get grumpy when I lose, you know! But that's just her teasin'. So, no, not really anythin' else besides the dizziness, and that don't happen every time.
DOCTOR: No nausea, no visual disturbances. Intermittent dizziness. And your wife notes… a change in temperament. I see. Do you have any history of head trauma, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Head trauma? No, sir. Not that I recall. I was a lively boy, climbed a few trees in me day, but never fell and knocked me head. Played a bit of cricket too, but always wore a cap. Nothing serious, never been knocked unconscious or anything like that. My wife woulda remembered that! She remembers everything. She'll tell you so herself! I might have bumped it on a cupboard door a time or two, but that's all.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Never been much of a pill-taker, if I can help it. Just a bit of liniment for me knees sometimes, when they act up, but that's all. And a cup of chamomile tea before bed, helps me sleep. But nothin' prescribed, nothin' regular, just the liniment and the tea.
DOCTOR: No medications. And no allergies that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, no sir. I eat everything! Jamaican food, you know? Lots of spices, lots of different things. Never had a reaction to anythin'. My wife tries to get me to eat more greens, but… well, I try. She's always lookin' out for me. But no, definitely no allergies. I'd know, she'd have a list longer than me arm if I did!
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Popova, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… hmm. Let me think. Well, the doctor told me a few years back me blood pressure was a little high, but he said it was nothin' serious, just to watch me salt intake. I try to, but I do love a good jerk chicken! And me knees, they get a bit arthritic sometimes, especially in the cold. But that’s just age, I reckon. No serious illnesses, nothin' like diabetes or heart trouble or anythin’ like that. Just the blood pressure and the knees. Mostly just old age, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, managed with diet. Arthralgia. And any surgical history, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Surgical history… oh, let me see. When I was a boy, I had me tonsils out. That was a long time ago, back in Jamaica. And I had a hernia operation when I was workin’ on the docks, maybe… twenty years ago? That was a bit rough, but I recovered fine. Apart from that, no. Never been much of a surgery man. I prefer to stay out of the hospital if I can help it!
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy. Inguinal hernia repair. And finally, Mr. Popova, is there any family history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she had diabetes, but she lived to be eighty-five, so it wasn’t too bad. My father, he had heart trouble, but that was later in life. And my sister, she had some kind of arthritis, like me knees, but I don’t know the details. Nothing major, really. Just the usual things, I reckon. Old age and bad luck mostly. Not much in the way of serious inherited diseases, if that’s what you’re askin'. We were a strong family, mostly. Lots of good genes, I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Popova, I'm going to conduct a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your neurological function. And please, try to remain still.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Neurological function, you say? Sounds fancy! I’ll try me best to stay still. Old bones don't move as quickly as they used to, you know. Lead the way!
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Pupillary response is equal, round, and reactive to light. Range of motion is… slightly restricted. Do you experience any pain with this movement, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little bit, Doctor. Not sharp, more like a dull ache. It's that same ache I get in me shoulders sometimes. It's not too bad, but I can feel it. It's worse when I try to look to the left. Like somethin' is stuck in there. It’s just a bit tight, I reckon. From all them years lookin’ at nail polish bottles, probably.
DOCTOR: Palpation reveals tenderness in the upper trapezius muscles bilaterally. There is no evidence of nuchal rigidity. Blood pressure is 140/90. Heart sounds are regular. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I will need you to sit up now, Mr. Popova. I suspect you are experiencing tension headaches, likely exacerbated by your occupation. The tenderness in your neck and shoulders supports this.
PATIENT: Tension headaches, you say? That sounds about right, Doctor. It is a stressful job, makin' sure every lady leaves lookin' her best! So, what do you recommend? Will I need pills? I really don't like takin' medicine if I can avoid it. Is there somethin' I can do to help it? Perhaps some stretchin' exercises? Or maybe a different chair?
DOCTOR: While I understand your reluctance to take medication, I recommend a trial of over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen as needed for pain relief. Additionally, I strongly advise regular stretching exercises, focusing on the neck and shoulders. I can provide you with a handout detailing appropriate exercises. Ergonomic adjustments to your workstation – a chair with proper lumbar support and a monitor positioned at eye level – are also crucial. However, given your age and blood pressure, I also want to rule out other possibilities. I am going to order a CBC and CMP to assess your overall health. If the headaches persist or worsen despite these measures, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as fever, vision changes, or weakness – you must return immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen or naproxen… alright, I can try that. And the stretchin' exercises, yes, that makes sense. And a better chair… me wife has been tellin' me that for years! She's always right, bless her heart. CBC and CMP, you say? That sounds… complicated. Is that to check for somethin’ serious? But if me headaches don't get better, I'll come straight back. I promise. I don't want to ignore anythin’. I just want to get back to makin’ ladies pretty, you know?
DOCTOR: The blood tests are a precaution, Mr. Popova. Simply to establish a baseline and rule out any underlying medical conditions. It is unlikely anything serious, but it is best to be thorough. Here are the instructions for the blood tests and the stretching exercises. Please schedule these at your earliest convenience. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your follow-up appointment, do not hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: Alright, a baseline. I understand. I’ll schedule those tests as soon as I can. Me wife can help me with that, she’s good at all that sort of thing. No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen, and for not just givin' me pills right away. Thank you for your help. I think I’ll go home and put some heat on me neck now. And maybe book those tests.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please contact the office to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the lab results. Have a good day, Mr. Popova. .
