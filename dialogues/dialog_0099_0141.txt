DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Overgaard. It’s this itching, really. Just… all over. It started maybe a week ago, and it's driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not painful, exactly, just… relentlessly itchy.
DOCTOR: Relentlessly itchy, you say. A week ago… alright. And is it… everywhere, or are there specific areas that are worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's pretty widespread, but my back is the worst, I think. And my arms. My legs are okay-ish, just a little bit. It's hard to describe... it's not like a rash, really. Just… the skin feels like it needs scratching all the time. I keep thinking it’s something in the laundry, but I’ve switched detergents twice now.
DOCTOR: Right. No visible rash, just the sensation of itching… and you’ve already tried changing detergents. That’s… sensible. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well, nothing really makes it better, sadly. Hot showers seem to help for a few minutes, but then it comes right back. Worse… hmm. Stress, maybe? I've been a bit on edge lately, with… well, it's a long story, but my wife passed away last year. It’s still hard, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s… a significant stressor, certainly. And it’s not uncommon for stress to manifest physically. So, you've had this itching for a week, coinciding with, or perhaps worsening with, ongoing grief. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no tiredness… nothing like that. Just the itch. And… well, maybe a little bit of trouble sleeping, because of the itching, naturally. I keep waking up scratching. It’s… irritating, to say the least. Sorry, bad joke.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Ferneding. A little levity is… acceptable. No fever, no fatigue, just the itching and some disrupted sleep. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. My wife always did the remembering for things like that, to be honest. But I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I eat pretty much everything. And I'm on Medicare, so they usually ask about those things, don't they?
DOCTOR: Medicare does tend to be thorough. Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure. Been on that for… oh, maybe ten years now? It’s very low dosage, the doctor said it was just preventative. And… that's it. Nothing else. I take it every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, ten years, low dosage. Good. Now, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And I broke my arm once, skiing. Nothing major, really. Oh, and I had pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Nothing chronic, like. No diabetes, no heart problems… just the usual old-man stuff, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendix, broken arm, pneumonia. No chronic conditions. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had… arthritis, I think. Badly, towards the end. And my father… he had high blood pressure, like me. And… his brother had something with his skin, a long time ago. A rash, maybe? But I don’t really remember the details. They lived in Russia, you see, and we didn’t talk about medical things much. It wasn’t really… encouraged. Not very helpful, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Not entirely unhelpful. Arthritis, hypertension, and a possible skin condition in a relative. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better look at your skin, and check a few things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just loosen your shirt a bit, that would be helpful. I'm going to start by examining your skin all over. Please tell me if anything feels particularly sensitive. Hmm. I’m not seeing any obvious rash, hives, or lesions. The skin appears generally normal in color, though slightly dry. There is some minimal excoriation on your upper back – that's consistent with scratching, of course. Let’s look at your arms now… No visible abnormalities here either. Skin is dry, but no rash, bumps, or wheals. I'm not detecting any areas of significant tenderness. And just to be thorough, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Nothing to suggest any underlying systemic issue there either. Heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72.
PATIENT: That all sounds… good, I suppose? I mean, I'm glad you're not finding anything obviously wrong. It's just so frustrating, this itch. It feels like it’s coming from inside, you know? Not just on the surface. Do you have any ideas what it could be? I’ve been reading things online, but… well, you know what the internet is like. It just scares me more.
DOCTOR: The internet is rarely helpful in these situations. And you’re right to be cautious. Given your history, the physical exam, and the lack of any obvious rash or systemic symptoms, a number of things could be at play. It could be a form of eczema – even without a visible rash, it can present as intense itching. Dry skin, especially during seasonal changes, can certainly contribute. But given your recent loss, we must also consider psychogenic itch – that is, itching triggered or exacerbated by stress and emotional factors. It's surprisingly common. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. That will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the itching. Also, I’m going to recommend a course of a topical corticosteroid cream for your skin. It should provide some relief from the itching, regardless of the underlying cause. We'll also discuss some strategies for managing stress. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. A blood test and a cream… and talking about stress. I can definitely do that. It's… hard, but I’m willing to try anything to get some relief. Where do we go from here? Do I need to go somewhere else for the blood test? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so you won’t need to go anywhere else. I’ll write you a requisition form. Just take that to the lab technician, and they’ll draw the blood. The results should be back within 48 hours, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, apply the corticosteroid cream to the itchy areas twice daily, after showering. Use a thin layer, and avoid using it on your face unless specifically instructed. Also, and this is perhaps the most important part, I'd like you to consider speaking with a grief counselor. I can provide you with some referrals if you're interested. Dealing with loss is incredibly difficult, and sometimes having a professional to talk to can make all the difference. It’s not a sign of weakness, Mr. Ferneding; it's a sign of strength. Does that sound like something you’d be open to?
PATIENT: Yes, I think… yes, that sounds good. A grief counselor. I haven't really thought about it, but… maybe it’s time. I appreciate you suggesting that, Doctor. And thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel a little bit better just knowing there’s a plan. I'll go to the lab now, and I'll think about the counselor. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. Remember, we're here to help. Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
