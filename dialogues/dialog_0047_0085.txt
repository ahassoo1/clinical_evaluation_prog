DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s this…patch. On my skin. It’s just…not right, you know? It’s been bothering me, and frankly, it’s quite unsightly.
DOCTOR: “Unsightly,” right. Well, we’ll get to the bottom of it. Can you tell me a bit more about this patch?
PATIENT: Well, it started… oh, I’d say about six weeks ago, maybe a little longer. It’s on my left forearm, just…there. It wasn’t painful at first, just a bit…different in texture. Now, it’s…discolored. A sort of…muddy brown. Not a very pleasant shade, I assure you. And it feels different than the rest of my skin. Rougher. I moisturize religiously, you understand. But it doesn’t seem to help.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, on the left forearm…discolored, rough texture. And you said it wasn't painful initially. Is it painful now?
PATIENT: No, not exactly painful. More…sensitive. Like if I brush against it, I notice it. And sometimes, especially when it’s warm, it itches. Not terribly, but enough to be…irritating. It’s just…distracting, really. I’m a very particular person, you see, and I don’t like things being…off.
DOCTOR: Sensitive and itchy, especially with warmth. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in its size or shape since it first appeared?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. It has gotten…larger. It was quite small, barely noticeable, to begin with. Now, it’s…oh, about the size of a quarter, perhaps a bit bigger. And the shape…it’s not perfectly round, it’s a bit…irregular. Sort of…blobby, if I’m being honest. Not a very appealing shape, I must say.
DOCTOR: Irregular shape, growing…right. And have you noticed any other symptoms associated with it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think…No, not really. Just the itchiness, and the sensitivity. And, well, the fact that it’s there. It’s quite…noticeable, you know? I haven't felt sick or anything like that. No fever, no swelling, nothing like that. I'm very careful about my health, I assure you. I eat well, I exercise regularly... I just don't understand why this is happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. Absolutely not. I've always had…rather good skin, actually. A bit fair, but clear. My mother always said I had a lovely complexion. This is…completely out of character. It’s really quite unsettling. I’ve never had a spot or anything like this before in my life. I suppose anyone can get something, but…it just doesn't seem right for me.
DOCTOR: No history of similar issues... Alright, Ms. Bartock. Let's have a look at it. If you'll just roll up your sleeve, please.
PATIENT: There you are. It's not terribly…photogenic, I’m afraid. As you can see. It's rather…distracting, wouldn't you agree? I really do hope it's nothing serious. I have a very important charity gala next month, and I simply must look presentable.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. Irregular borders, varying pigmentation…it’s raised slightly. Feels a bit rough to the touch. Does that cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a little. It's not painful, exactly, but…noticeable. Like a dull ache, almost. It’s…unpleasant. Honestly, Doctor, it just looks so…wrong. I’m not usually one to fuss, but it really is quite alarming. Is it something contagious, do you think? I’ve been gardening quite a bit lately, and I wouldn't want to…transmit anything to anyone. I volunteer at the botanical gardens, you see.
DOCTOR: Contagious is unlikely, but we can’t rule things out entirely without further investigation. It doesn’t present classically as an infectious lesion. I’m going to palpate your lymph nodes to check for any swelling. Just relax your arm.
PATIENT: Lymph nodes? Oh dear. Is that…serious? I didn't realize this was going to be so involved. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know if it's something I need to worry about. I have a rather busy schedule, you see. I really don't have time for…extensive procedures. Is it likely to be something simple? Like a fungal infection, perhaps? I do try to take precautions when gardening, but one can never be too careful.
DOCTOR: Relax. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Bartock. There is a slight tenderness here, but no significant swelling. Given the size, irregular borders and slight tenderness, I’m going to recommend a biopsy to determine the exact nature of this lesion. It’s the only way to be certain.
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh, honestly. That sounds…rather drastic. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn’t we just…try some cream, perhaps? Or a stronger lotion? I really don't like the sound of that at all. I've heard those things can be quite painful, and leave scars. And I’m very particular about my skin, as I’ve mentioned. Is there really no other way? I’m not sure I’m comfortable with…cutting into it.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, I understand your concerns, but a biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis. We can’t simply guess what this is. Cream or lotion will not provide a definitive answer and could potentially delay appropriate treatment if it is something serious. It’s a small procedure, performed under local anaesthetic. It will likely leave a small scar, but it’s a necessary precaution. Would you prefer I refer you to a dermatologist for a second opinion?
PATIENT: A second opinion…well, that's not a bad idea, I suppose. I do like to be thorough. Though honestly, I was hoping this would be a simple fix. A dermatologist…who do you recommend? Someone…discreet, and who understands the importance of aesthetics? I don't want to end up with a horrible scar, or…worse. And will my insurance cover it? I have Medicare, you know. I wouldn't want any unpleasant surprises with billing. Honestly, this is all rather stressful.
DOCTOR: I can recommend Dr. Anya Petrova. She’s a board-certified dermatologist with excellent reviews and a reputation for…aesthetic sensitivity. As for Medicare coverage, a biopsy is generally covered for lesions of this nature, but it's always best to verify with them directly. I can have my receptionist provide you with their contact information and a referral form. Do you have any other questions at this time, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds…reassuring. Dr. Petrova, you say? Yes, please, do give me the contact information. And the referral form, of course. Honestly, I just want to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. It’s just…so unsettling, having something…wrong with my skin. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Avoid the sun, perhaps? Or…apply a special cream? I really do try to take care of myself, you know. I just want to be proactive. And…will this delay anything? I have that gala coming up, and I need to look my best.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely avoid direct sun exposure and wear protective clothing. A broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher is also advisable. As for a cream, I wouldn't recommend applying anything until after Dr. Petrova has examined it, as it could interfere with the diagnosis. Here is the referral form and Dr. Petrova’s contact details. Her office will schedule an appointment at your convenience. As for the gala, I can’t predict the timeline, but the sooner you see Dr. Petrova, the better. Do you have any other concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. Thank you…I suppose. I still think it’s a bit drastic, but I appreciate the referral. And the information. I’ll call Dr. Petrova first thing in the morning. Honestly, this has been rather…disconcerting. I hope she can tell me what it is, and how to get rid of it. Quickly. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let me know if you have any questions. Have a good day. .
