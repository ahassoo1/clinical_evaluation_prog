DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Todoro– Todoro– forgive me, I’m terrible with names. It’s this… unsteadiness. I’ve been feeling rather off-balance, you see. It’s… unsettling. I don’t quite recall when it started, precisely. Just… gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Gradually… okay. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. "Unsteadiness" can mean a lot of things. Can you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a constant wobble, if that makes sense. Sometimes I feel perfectly fine, and then… a wave will come over me. Like the ground isn’t quite solid. It’s hard to explain. And sometimes… I stumble, just a little. Not a fall, thankfully. It’s just… disconcerting. I do try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Waves of instability, and occasional stumbling… alright. And how long would you say these "waves" typically last?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… difficult to say. Some are very brief, just a moment. Others… perhaps a few minutes? It truly varies. I haven’t kept strict track, I’m afraid. My husband… he usually noticed these things before. It’s been a bit of a blur since… well, since he passed. I apologize for being vague.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss complicates things, certainly. It’s perfectly alright to be vague. We’ll try to piece it together. So, a few minutes at most for these episodes. Do these episodes happen with any particular activity?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I don’t believe so, not that I’ve noticed. They seem to occur… randomly. I work, of course… out on the rigs. It hasn’t affected my work yet, but I worry it might. Lots of movement, climbing… it does make me anxious to think about it. It’s difficult to say if the anxiety causes it, or if it’s the other way around. I suppose.
DOCTOR: The rigs… okay. That definitely adds a layer of complexity. And you haven't noticed any specific triggers – no sudden movements, changes in position, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing specific comes to mind. I… I don’t recall any particular incident that started it, either. It just… became apparent. Though, I was quite stressed around the time my husband… became ill. Perhaps it started then? It's all rather hazy. I’m terribly sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll work with what we have. Let’s talk a little more broadly. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I’ve been rather fatigued lately, though working my job is tiring in itself. And sometimes… a slight ringing in my ears? It comes and goes. Nothing persistent, just… occasionally. And I suppose my vision isn’t as sharp as it once was, but I attributed that to… well, to age, mostly. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Fatigue, tinnitus—ringing in the ears—and some vision changes. Okay. Have you noticed any dizziness, or nausea accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Dizziness… sometimes, yes. A sort of… wooziness. Not a spinning sensation, exactly. More like… lightheadedness. And no, I haven’t experienced any nausea. Thankfully. The lightheadedness isn’t frequent, but it does occur alongside the unsteadiness sometimes. It makes me hesitant to… move quickly, naturally. I don't want to risk a fall.
DOCTOR: Alright, lightheadedness alongside the unsteadiness. Now, let's go through some basic history. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I’m aware. I’m usually quite careful with what I consume. My husband always said I was a bit of a hypochondriac, which I found rather rude, but… I suppose I am cautious. I don’t take any regular medications currently, either. Just… occasional pain relievers for aches and pains, if needed.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, no regular medications. Let's talk about past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. My doctor… before, she mentioned my cholesterol was slightly elevated, but it wasn’t anything alarming. She suggested lifestyle changes, which I attempted. Beyond that… no, I don’t believe so. I’ve always been reasonably healthy, to be honest. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing serious. I had a rather difficult pregnancy with my son, but I recovered fully. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Elevated cholesterol, and a difficult pregnancy… yes, that is relevant. We'll need to delve into that a bit later. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, a rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And… during the birth of my son, I required an emergency C-section. I was hospitalized for several days afterward, of course, for recovery. Beyond those two instances, no. I haven’t required any other surgeries or hospital stays. I do try to avoid them, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy and emergency C-section. Now, let’s talk about family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. My mother… she suffered from high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he passed away from a stroke several years ago. It was quite sudden. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had some form of dementia, I think? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to her. Beyond that, I’m not entirely sure. My family isn’t very forthcoming with medical information, I’m afraid. It’s… a cultural thing.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in your mother, stroke in your father, and dementia in your grandmother… alright. And finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I've never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I myself do not drink alcohol. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I work very hard, and I prefer a quiet evening at home. It’s… a simple life, really. Though, admittedly, it’s been rather lonely since my husband passed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for that information. Now, I'm going to perform a physical exam. It'll involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and assessing your neurological function, including balance and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand it’s necessary. Please, proceed. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I do get a bit anxious during medical examinations, but I’ll try to remain calm.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths. Heart and lungs sound normal. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function, including your balance and coordination. Please stand up slowly. Now, please close your eyes and extend your arms. Now, please heel-to-toe walk for me. Alright, that’s enough for now.
PATIENT: Oh… that felt a bit strange. I do feel slightly dizzy now, if I’m honest. I suppose that’s to be expected? I’ve never been particularly good at balance, even when I was younger. It’s… reassuring to know that my heart and lungs are alright, though. What did you find? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Your vital signs are generally within normal limits, though your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Your heart and lungs sound normal. However, I did observe some unsteadiness and a slight tremor in your arms, along with some difficulty with coordination during the balance tests. These findings are concerning, but not necessarily indicative of a serious condition. It could be a number of things. Given your symptoms and the findings of the physical exam, I suspect we’re dealing with either a vestibular issue—something affecting the inner ear—or possibly some early signs of neurological dysfunction. The dizziness and unsteadiness are consistent with a vestibular problem, but the tremor and coordination issues suggest we need to investigate further. I'm going to order some lab work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. I’ll also order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: Oh dear… an MRI? That sounds… rather daunting. Is it absolutely necessary? I’ve never had one before. And… what if something is wrong? I understand you need to be thorough, Doctor, but I must admit, I'm feeling quite anxious now. Could it not be… just stress? Or fatigue? I’ve been working very long hours, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. An MRI is non-invasive, though I appreciate it can be unsettling. It gives us the most detailed look at your brain, allowing us to rule out anything serious, such as a tumor or stroke. While stress and fatigue can certainly contribute to these symptoms, the neurological findings—the tremor and coordination issues—are concerning enough to warrant further investigation. It's better to be safe than sorry. We're not assuming anything is seriously wrong. The MRI is a precautionary measure. If it comes back normal, we can explore other possibilities, such as vestibular rehabilitation or stress management techniques. But first, we need to rule out any structural abnormalities. As for stress, yes, it can exacerbate symptoms. However, it doesn’t explain all of your findings. We need to have a clear picture before we can determine the best course of action. It's better to have more information than less. Would you like me to explain the MRI procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very reassuring. I must admit, I’m quite nervous about being enclosed in such a machine. What does it feel like? And how long does it take? Will it… hurt? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor, but I’m easily flustered. I just… I don't like feeling helpless.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask questions, Lilyanna. It's understandable to be anxious. The MRI machine is a large, cylindrical magnet. You’ll lie on a table that slides into the machine. It’s a relatively narrow space, though we can provide you with a blanket and headphones to make you more comfortable. The machine makes a loud knocking and humming noise during the scan—that’s why we provide headphones. It doesn’t hurt at all. You won’t feel anything. It's similar to being inside a large, metallic tube. You'll need to remain completely still during the scan, as any movement can blur the images. The scan typically takes about 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the specific images we need. You'll be able to communicate with the technician throughout the procedure. They'll give you a call button to alert them if you feel uncomfortable or claustrophobic. We’ll also review your medical history to ensure there are no contraindications—such as any metal implants—that would prevent you from having the scan. Do you have any metal implants, such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, or surgical clips?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. No implants of any kind. I’ve never had any surgery requiring metal… aside from the tonsils, and I believe those clips dissolve, don't they? I’ve always been fortunate enough to avoid serious medical interventions. Aside from the C-section, of course, but I don’t recall any metal being used then. The doctor assured me everything was removed afterward. So, no, no metal implants. I do wear glasses, of course, but I can remove those for the scan. The noise… that’s what worries me the most, I think. Being enclosed and… hearing all that banging. It sounds rather terrifying.
DOCTOR: Alright, no metal implants. That’s good. And the glasses can be removed. The noise is loud, I won’t lie. But we’ll provide you with headphones and earplugs, and you can listen to music during the scan. Many patients find that helps to distract them. We can also administer a mild sedative if you’re particularly anxious, but that’s something we can discuss further. We'll schedule the MRI for as soon as possible. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activities that may exacerbate your symptoms. And if you experience any worsening of your symptoms—such as increased dizziness, difficulty walking, or blurred vision—please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. Perhaps… just one. What if the MRI does show something concerning? What are we talking about, realistically? I understand you can’t give me a diagnosis without the results, but… I like to be prepared, if possible.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re asking, Lilyanna. Realistically, if the MRI shows something concerning, it could be a number of things. It could be a tumor, though that’s relatively rare. More commonly, it could be evidence of a stroke or other vascular event. It could also be a sign of multiple sclerosis, though that’s less likely given your age and symptoms. It's important to remember that these are just possibilities. The MRI is just a tool—it doesn’t provide a diagnosis. We’ll need to interpret the results in conjunction with your symptoms and the findings of the physical exam. If something is found, we'll refer you to a specialist—either a neurologist or a neurosurgeon—for further evaluation and treatment. The treatment options will depend on the specific diagnosis and the severity of the condition. However, I want to reiterate that we're not assuming anything is wrong. Many MRIs come back normal. And even if something is found, it's often treatable. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let's focus on getting the MRI done and interpreting the results. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Todoro– Todoro– forgive me, I still struggle with names. Thank you for being so patient and… thorough. I appreciate your honesty, even though it was… unsettling. I suppose I'll just have to… wait. And try not to worry too much. I’ll schedule the MRI as soon as possible, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Lilyanna. Try to stay calm, and don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns before your appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
