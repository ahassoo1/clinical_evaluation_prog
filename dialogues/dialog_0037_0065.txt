DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. AX. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and I haven't changed anything about my diet or exercise. It’s rather unsettling, to be frank. I was hoping you could perhaps shed some light on it.
DOCTOR: I understand. That is unsettling, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. We can definitely look into that. To start, could you tell me a little more about how long you've been noticing this weight gain?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It began, I’d say, roughly six months ago. At first, it was very gradual – just clothes feeling a bit tighter. But in the last three months, it’s been… more noticeable. Perhaps five or six pounds a month, if I had to estimate. It's quite alarming, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months with a recent increase of about five to six pounds a month. That gives us a good starting point. Have you noticed any other changes along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not particularly, no. I sleep reasonably well, although I do wake up once or twice a night. My energy levels are… normal, I suppose. Not any lower than usual. I haven’t been feeling ill, no fever or anything like that. Oh! And my appetite hasn’t changed either. Which is… perplexing, isn't it? I eat the same things, the same amount of things, and yet… the weight continues to increase.
DOCTOR: That is perplexing. No fever, normal sleep, consistent appetite… alright. Let’s try to get a fuller picture. Can you tell me a little bit about your typical daily diet?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, my husband, Darius, and I, we generally eat… a fairly traditional Lithuanian diet. For breakfast, I usually have oatmeal with some berries and a cup of tea. Lunch is often a simple soup, maybe potato or beetroot, with a slice of dark rye bread. And for dinner… usually meat – pork or chicken – with potatoes and some kind of vegetable, like cabbage or carrots. We don't eat a great deal of sweets, though Darius does enjoy a small piece of chocolate after dinner sometimes. I make sure to use a lot of dill in everything, naturally. It’s very important in our cooking! Does that… sound like anything unusual?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't sound unusual at all. It sounds like a very wholesome diet. And the dill is excellent. Let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like thyroid problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve been quite healthy my entire life, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothing serious. I've never been diagnosed with anything chronic. I do get a bit anxious sometimes, but nothing that requires medication or anything. Darius always says I worry too much. He’s probably right. And my mother had… arthritis, I believe. But that was later in life. I haven’t experienced anything like that myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic conditions, childhood illnesses only, some anxiety, and a family history of arthritis. Good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been very fortunate in that regard as well. No surgeries, no hospital stays – apart from the birth of my son, of course. But that was many years ago, and everything went smoothly. I truly haven't had many dealings with doctors over the years, which is why this weight gain is so concerning. It feels… out of character.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely. It is unusual, and it's good you're getting it checked out now. Let’s talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, no prescription medications, no. But I do take a multivitamin every morning, just a standard one. And sometimes, when my joints feel a bit stiff – especially in the colder months – I’ll take some glucosamine and chondroitin. Just the over-the-counter kind, you know. Nothing else. Darius occasionally suggests I take something for my anxiety, but I prefer to manage it with… fresh air and a good book. Perhaps I should reconsider that, though, if this continues.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and glucosamine/chondroitin as needed. That’s helpful to know. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not to food, no. I’ve never had any reactions to anything I’ve eaten. I do have a bit of a sensitivity to pollen in the spring, but it’s just mild sneezing and a runny nose – nothing serious. I take some over-the-counter antihistamines when it’s particularly bad. And… I’m slightly allergic to cats, but we don’t have any pets. Darius is allergic to dust mites, but he manages that with regular cleaning. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's good information to have, thank you. It doesn't sound like any of those allergies are directly contributing to the weight gain, but it's good to have a complete picture. Now, let's talk a bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. Darius and I, we’ve never smoked, and we rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And recreational drugs… well, that's simply not something we would ever consider. We lead a very quiet life, you see. We enjoy gardening, reading, and spending time with our son and grandchildren. I assure you, Doctor, there's nothing of that nature to worry about.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to get a few basic measurements. Would you mind stepping on the scale and letting me measure your height and blood pressure?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. That’s perfectly acceptable. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I'm quite eager to find out what might be causing this, you understand. It’s just… unsettling, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. Your weight is 83 kilograms, and your height is 155 centimeters. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 135 over 85. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and gently examine your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your expertise implicitly. Just… try to be gentle, if you wouldn't mind. I do get a bit… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. Your heart sounds are normal. I did notice your breath sounds are a little diminished in the lower parts of your lungs, and your abdomen is a bit tender when I press here, just below your breastbone. It's not anything alarming, but it's good to note. Given your weight gain, slightly elevated blood pressure, diminished breath sounds, and abdominal tenderness, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests. We'll check your thyroid function, a complete metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. Blood tests, you say? Very well. I trust your judgement. If that’s what you recommend, then please proceed. I just… I do hope it’s nothing serious. What exactly are we looking for with these tests? And… will they require a lot of blood?
DOCTOR: We're looking for a few things, Ms. Selbitschka. The thyroid test will help us rule out any problems with your thyroid gland, as that can sometimes cause weight gain. The metabolic panel will give us a snapshot of your overall health and check things like your kidney and liver function. And the lipid panel will check your cholesterol levels. As for the amount of blood, it's a standard amount – a few vials, nothing excessive. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and you likely won't even feel it. While we wait for the results, and to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d also like to discuss some lifestyle modifications. We can talk about diet and exercise. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications… yes, of course. I suppose that’s to be expected. Darius has been gently suggesting I take more walks, but… I confess, I do enjoy my quiet time with a good book. But I understand. I am willing to try, Doctor. I just… I hope it’s not something I’ve done wrong. Is this… is this my fault?
DOCTOR: It's not about fault, Ms. Selbitschka. Weight gain is often complex, and there are many factors that can contribute to it. It’s rarely one single thing. We’re going to investigate everything methodically, and then tailor a plan to your needs. Let’s start with diet. Could you keep a food diary for a week, just to give me a more detailed picture of what you're eating?
PATIENT: A food diary… yes, I can certainly do that. It seems… manageable. I shall write down everything, meticulously. Even the small pieces of chocolate Darius enjoys. And what about the exercise? Do you have any specific recommendations, Doctor? I confess, I haven’t been very active lately. Perhaps a gentle walk each day? Or… is something more strenuous required?
DOCTOR: A gentle walk each day is an excellent start. Aim for about 30 minutes, if you can, but don't push yourself too hard, especially at first. Start slowly and gradually increase the duration and intensity as you feel more comfortable. We can also discuss some simple exercises you can do at home, if you'd like. Something to strengthen your core and improve your flexibility. But for now, let's focus on the food diary and the daily walks. I'll order the blood tests now, and we should have the results back in about a week. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant swelling – please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel… somewhat reassured. I shall keep the food diary and attempt the daily walks. And I will call if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor AX. I appreciate your time and your attention. It’s… a relief to finally be taking steps to address this. I believe that is all. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we're in this together, and we'll figure it out. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again next week to discuss the results.
