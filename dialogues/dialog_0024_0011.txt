DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's just say I need a… a permission slip. For somethin’ the young folks are doin’ now. A cosmetic… fix, I believe they call it. My niece, she says I need to get cleared before I do it. It involves… well, it's on my face.
DOCTOR: A “permission slip,” you say?
PATIENT: That's what she called it! Honestly, all this newfangled stuff. It’s… somethin’ to do with makin’ my face look… tighter. She says it's safe, but… well, you know. Better safe than sorry. I just need you to tell me if I'm… strong enough for it, I suppose. Don't ask me to explain the details, 'cause I wouldn't rightly know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with the basics, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine by me. Just… hurry it up, will ya? I got things to do. And don't ask me about no childhood illnesses, I barely remember yesterday as it is.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, a thorough medical history is essential for determining your suitability for any procedure, even one as… superficial as this appears to be. Now, I need to ask you a few questions. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I’m a strong man. Always been strong. Worked on them towers, you know? Climbin’ and fixin’ things. But… wait. There was somethin’ the doctor told me… years ago. Somethin’ about my… blood. It wasn't high, exactly. Just… different. I don't recall the name of it. Old age, you see. It slips my mind. Does that matter? Is that why you're askin'?
DOCTOR: "Different" blood, you say?
PATIENT: That’s what he said! A little… off. It wasn’t nothin’ serious, mind you. He gave me some pills for a bit, but I stopped takin’ ‘em. Felt fine without ‘em. Look, I ain't a complicated man, Doctor. I just want to know if I can get this… face thing done. Is that too much to ask? I got a social engagement, you know. Don’t want to look… old.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, discontinuing prescribed medication without consulting a physician is… unwise. And your vague description of a blood “difference” is concerning. Do you recall when you were diagnosed with this condition?
PATIENT: Goodness gracious, now you're askin’ for the impossible! Years ago, I tell ya. Maybe… twenty years? More? It was at that clinic downtown… the one that closed down. Dr. something-or-other. He was a nice man. Look, I’m tellin’ you, I felt fine. Still do! I work hard, I eat… well, I eat. And I’m still climbin’ towers, though not as much these days. This is gettin’ ridiculous. Are you gonna clear me or not? I really don't have time for a medical history lesson.
DOCTOR: Considering your inability to provide any concrete details regarding your medical history, and your stated discontinuation of medication, I am hesitant to offer any medical clearance for a cosmetic procedure at this time. We need to establish a baseline of your current health status. I will order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG. Perhaps then, we can discuss your… request.
PATIENT: An EKG? Blood tests? Good heavens! This is more trouble than it's worth! I just wanted a little… touch-up! Fine. Do your tests, whatever. But I’m tellin' ya, it's a waste of time. A complete waste. I'll be back when I have the time. And don't expect me to be happy about it. Honestly, the things they make you go through these days… .
