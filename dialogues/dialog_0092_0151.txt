DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Teretha. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s… annoying, to be honest. I just want to know what’s causing it, if you can help.
DOCTOR: Okay, Teretha. Annoying tingling in your hands and feet... I understand. To get a better idea of what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not constant, you know? It comes and goes. Sometimes it feels like pins and needles, other times just… numb. It’s worse in the evenings, I think. And it’s in both hands and feet, not just one. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Intermittent tingling, pins and needles or numbness, worse in the evenings, and affecting both hands and feet. That helps narrow things down. About how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four months ago? It was very mild at first, I barely noticed it. I thought it was just me sitting too long, you know? But it’s gotten a bit more noticeable lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three to four months, starting mild and gradually becoming more noticeable. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it, or make it worse besides evenings?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… well, if I'm on my feet all day, like when I have a really heavy mail route, it seems worse afterwards. But honestly, sometimes it just happens for no reason. I can’t really pinpoint anything specific. And it doesn’t seem to get better with resting, not really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's exacerbated by prolonged standing, but also happens without a clear trigger, and rest doesn't fully relieve it. Now, Teretha, I'd like to ask a few more general questions. Have you experienced any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… not really. I mean, I’m getting older, so things aren’t as easy as they used to be, but I haven’t dropped anything or had trouble holding things. I still manage my mail route, even though it’s tiring. But no, not noticeable weakness, no.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And have you noticed any changes in your skin, like color changes, rashes, or sores, particularly on your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My skin’s always been a little dry, especially in the winter, but no rashes or anything unusual. I check my hands pretty regularly, you know, from handling the mail, and haven’t seen anything worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had a little cold back in the spring, but that was months ago now. Nothing serious, just a sniffle and a cough for a few days. I’ve been pretty healthy otherwise.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’m going to ask about some other symptoms, just to get a complete picture. Have you experienced any dizziness, vision changes, or difficulty with balance?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness or anything like that. My eyesight’s not what it used to be, I need glasses, but that’s been the same for years. And my balance is okay, I haven’t fallen or anything. I just try to be careful walking on icy sidewalks in the winter.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you noticed any pain anywhere else – back, neck, shoulders?
PATIENT: My back… sometimes aches a little, especially after a long day of carrying mail. But it's just normal aches and pains, you know? I don't think it's related to this tingling. I don't have any pain anywhere else, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, to be honest. I usually just try to tough things out. I used to go regularly when my husband was alive, but… well, it's been a few years since then. He always handled the doctor appointments. I don’t think I have any of those conditions, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. And have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, a long, long time ago. And I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my wrist a few years back. But other than that, nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had arthritis, in her hands mostly. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. But I don’t know much about their medical history, to be honest. They both passed away a long time ago. I don’t know if that helps.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, thank you. And finally, what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t take any regular medications. Just some over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, for my back. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Teretha. No regular medications, just occasional over-the-counter pain relievers. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this figured out. Let’s get it over with, if you don’t mind. I have a lot to do today.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won’t take long. Please lie back on the examination table. First, let’s check your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed. I tap lightly on Teretha's knees and ankles with a reflex hammer, observing the response. Your reflexes are… a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, I'd like you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. I assess her grip strength in both hands. And now, push your feet against my hands, resisting my pressure. I assess her foot strength. Your strength seems within normal limits, though a little less robust. Finally, I’m going to check your sensation. Close your eyes for me. I gently touch various points on her hands and feet with a cotton swab. Can you tell me when you feel the touch?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I feel that. And that… hmm. That one feels a little… fainter. And this one… oh, yes, there it is. But that one… not so much. This foot feels a bit… numb. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I make notes on her chart. I noticed some decreased sensation in your feet, and slightly diminished sensation in your hands, as you described. Based on your history and the physical exam, the tingling in your hands and feet could be a sign of peripheral neuropathy, which is damage to the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. It can have many causes, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, certain medications, and even just age. However, to get a better idea of what's causing it, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your blood sugar, vitamin levels, thyroid function, and kidney function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t particularly like needles, but I want to know what’s going on. So yes, go ahead. Just… try to be quick, please?
DOCTOR: I understand. I'll make sure the phlebotomist is aware you're not a fan of needles, and they'll do their best to be as quick and gentle as possible. I begin typing on the computer. I'll order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin B12 level. These should give us a good starting point. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend that you try to avoid prolonged standing or repetitive movements that worsen your symptoms. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers for any discomfort, but don't take them regularly without talking to me first. I'll give you a requisition form for the lab. Once you have the tests done, please call the clinic to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A follow-up appointment… yes. I’ll try to get those tests done as soon as I can. I just… really don’t want to be stuck with this tingling forever. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teretha. I understand your concern, and we'll do everything we can to figure out what's going on and get you some relief. I hand her the requisition form. Here’s the form for the lab tests. The results usually take a few days to come back. Please call us to schedule a follow-up appointment once you’ve had them done. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – for example, if you experience severe pain, weakness, or difficulty walking – please don't hesitate to go to the emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Giganti. I appreciate your help. I just want to get back to my mail route, you know? It’s… important to me. .
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We'll do our best to get you back to doing what you enjoy. Take care of yourself, Teretha. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
