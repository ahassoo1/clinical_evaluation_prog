DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Jaxston. Uh… well, I’ve been getting these headaches. Really bad ones. And… I dunno, sweaty, shaky feelings with them, I guess. It’s been happening on and off for a while now. It's hard to put my finger on it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaxston. Headaches and those accompanying symptoms – the sweating and shakiness – those are certainly things we want to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about these headaches?
PATIENT: Right, yeah. Okay… um… they come on pretty sudden, usually. Not like a slow build-up. Just… bam. And they’re… intense. Like a really tight band around my head, mostly. Sometimes it feels like it’s behind my eyes too. I’ve never had headaches like this before, not really. I get the normal ones, you know, from stress and stuff, but this is… different. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Jaxston. Sudden onset, intense, band-like pain, sometimes behind the eyes… that is helpful information. And you’re saying these are different from headaches you’ve experienced before. When you say “sudden onset,” can you give me a rough timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm… rough timeframe… let me think. It’s… hard to say exactly. They don’t happen every day, thankfully. But when they do, it’s like… within minutes, they’re full-blown. Not like hours building up, definitely not. Maybe… ten, fifteen minutes tops? It's just… fast. And then the sweating starts pretty quick after that. It's hard to remember details, sorry.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all, Jaxston. It’s perfectly normal to have difficulty recalling precise details when you’re not feeling well. Ten to fifteen minutes to full intensity is quite rapid. Do you notice anything that triggers these headaches?
PATIENT: Triggers… that's a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. I mean, I work… production, mostly. It can be a bit stressful sometimes, but nothing crazy. I've been trying to think about it, and I honestly can’t point to anything. Sometimes they happen when I'm just relaxing at home, other times it’s… well, I don't know. No pattern I've seen, sorry. It feels pretty random.
DOCTOR: Okay, random onset with no clear triggers. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, aside from the headache and the sweating, do you experience any other symptoms with these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yeah, actually. My heart kinda races when they happen. That's the palpitations I mentioned, I think. And… sometimes I feel a bit dizzy, like I might fall over. Not every time, but sometimes. And… I get kinda sensitive to light, I think? Like, bright lights bother me more when I’ve got a headache. That’s about it, I think. Oh! And really tired afterwards. Like completely wiped out.
DOCTOR: Okay, palpitations, dizziness, light sensitivity, and significant fatigue afterward. That’s a lot of helpful information, Jaxston. To get a more complete picture, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… uh… not really. I mean, I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox and stuff, but nothing major. No serious illnesses or anything. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. Divorced a few years back, if that counts, but no health issues related to that, thankfully. I don’t really… go to the doctor much. I usually just try to ride things out. I guess that's not the best idea. Sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Jaxston. It’s good to be thorough. Tonsillectomy as a child, otherwise generally healthy. Have you had any surgeries besides your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing else. Just the tonsils. I've broken a bone or two as a kid, playing around, but that's it. Nothing that needed surgery. I… I don't think so, anyway. I'm terrible with remembering dates and stuff, you know? Sorry. Does it matter? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Jaxston. No need to apologize. It's helpful to have that information, and it’s good to know you haven’t had any significant surgeries. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm… that’s a tough one. My dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mom… she had some sort of arthritis, I think? It was always kinda bad. And my grandma, on my dad's side… she had… something with her memory, when she got older. Not sure what it was, exactly. That’s about all I can really think of, honestly. Nobody really talked about health stuff much. It wasn’t really a thing. Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jaxston. High blood pressure in your father, arthritis in your mother, and a memory issue in your grandmother – that’s helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much anything. I've tried a few different medications over the years for colds and stuff, but never had any problems. I don’t really take anything regularly. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, but that's it. Sorry, I'm really not much help with the details, am I? I always forget things.
DOCTOR: You are doing just fine, Jaxston. It’s perfectly normal to not remember every detail. No known allergies, no regular medications. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… uh… Well, I work a pretty standard shift. Long hours on my feet. I don't really get much exercise, to be honest. I try to eat okay, but it's hard when you're working long hours. I don't smoke. And I drink… occasionally, a few beers on the weekend. Nothing crazy. I live alone, pretty quiet life. Not much to say, really. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, long hours on your feet, limited exercise, moderate diet, no smoking, occasional alcohol use. Alright, Jaxston, I think we have a good starting point. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. That's fine. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it's gonna be… uncomfortable or anything. I'm not great with… medical stuff, you know? Sorry.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jaxston. I will explain everything as we go and make sure you are comfortable. We’ll start with checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, no problem. I’m not usually one for doctors, sorry. Just… a bit nervous, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jaxston. Many people feel a bit nervous. I’ll take my time. Your blood pressure is 140/90. Your pulse is 88 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Could you please take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, deep breaths. In… out… in… out… Is that okay? I feel a bit silly, breathing like this. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Jaxston. You’re doing great. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily cause for concern, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam. I’ll just check your reflexes and coordination. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. I'm trying to keep my head still… is that right? I get dizzy easily sometimes, sorry. Hopefully, this won't make it worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re doing very well, Jaxston. Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. Please relax your arm.
PATIENT: Uh… that tickled. Is that normal? I don’t usually get a lot of… stuff done with doctors, sorry. I just… get a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly normal, Jaxston. It often feels like a tickle. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is within the normal range. Okay, Jaxston, that concludes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me and the results of the exam, I have a few initial thoughts. Your symptoms – headaches, sweating, palpitations, dizziness, and light sensitivity – coupled with the slightly elevated blood pressure and murmur, could indicate a few different possibilities. One possibility is a tension headache, but the accompanying symptoms and the murmur make that less likely. Another possibility is a more serious cardiovascular issue or a neurological condition. I want to order some further testing to help us determine the cause. I recommend a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an electrocardiogram to assess your heart’s electrical activity, and a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Wow. That’s… a lot. CT scan… ECG… I don’t even know what half of those are, sorry. I just… I was hoping it was something simple, you know? Is it… serious? You said “serious cardiovascular issue”… that sounds scary. I guess if you think it's necessary, then I'll do whatever you recommend, but… could you explain what each of those tests does, in… simple terms? And what you're hoping to find out? I’m just… a bit worried, if you don’t mind. Sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Jaxston, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel anxious. Let’s break down each test. The complete blood count is a simple blood test that checks for things like anemia, infection, and other blood disorders. It gives us a general overview of your health. The comprehensive metabolic panel also involves a blood test, and it checks your kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. It helps us see how well your organs are working. An electrocardiogram, or ECG, is a non-invasive test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It can detect irregular heartbeats, heart damage, or other heart problems. It's quick and painless. Finally, the CT scan of your head is an imaging test that uses X-rays to create detailed pictures of your brain. It helps us rule out any structural abnormalities, such as tumors, bleeding, or stroke. I’m ordering these tests to be thorough and to get a clear understanding of what’s causing your symptoms. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but it's important to rule out any serious possibilities. The murmur I detected, coupled with your symptoms, warrants further investigation. We're not necessarily looking for something serious, but we need to be certain. Does that explanation help?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, that makes a bit more sense. So, blood tests to check my organs, an ECG to check my heart, and a scan of my brain just to be safe. And the scan is just… a precaution? Because of the murmur? That’s… good, I guess. Knowing it’s not just automatically assuming something awful is helpful. How long will it take to get the results? And… what happens if something is found? Sorry, I’m just… trying to prepare myself. I don’t handle medical stuff very well.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Jaxston. The CT scan is primarily a precaution due to the murmur and your symptoms. It’s always best to be thorough. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back, depending on the lab. Once I have the results, I’ll call you immediately to discuss them and explain what they mean. If something is found, we’ll discuss all your options. Depending on the results, this could range from medication to further testing or, in rare cases, a referral to a specialist. I will explain everything clearly and work with you to develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. We’ll take things one step at a time, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. That sounds… manageable. And you'll explain everything, even if it's… bad news? Where do I go to get these tests done? And do I need to… prepare in any way? Like, fasting or anything? I always forget these things. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jaxston. I’ll explain everything, and I’ll be here to answer any questions you have. Here’s the order for the tests. You can get them done at the lab at St. Jude’s Hospital – it’s just down the street at 123 Main Street. You do need to fast for eight hours before the blood tests, so ideally, schedule them for first thing in the morning. You can drink water, but no food or other beverages. The ECG and CT scan don’t require any preparation. I’ve also included the lab’s phone number on the order, so you can schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions about the order or the instructions?
PATIENT: St. Jude's… eight-hour fast… got it. No food, just water. And the other tests are fine, no prep. Um… will this be expensive? I don’t… I don't have insurance, so I'm a bit worried about the cost. Sorry. I didn't even think to ask before. I just… get flustered around doctors.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly valid concern, Jaxston. It’s important to be aware of the costs. Let me check the pricing for you. Okay, the blood tests will be approximately $150, the ECG is around $80, and the CT scan will be about $400. That brings the total to roughly $630. I understand that’s a significant expense without insurance. St. Jude’s Hospital does have a financial assistance program for patients who are unable to afford medical care. I can provide you with information about the program and help you with the application process if you’re interested. There are also some local charities that may be able to provide assistance. We can also discuss which tests are absolutely essential and potentially prioritize them if cost is a major concern, though I would strongly recommend getting all of them for a complete picture. Do you want me to give you information about the financial assistance program?
PATIENT: $630… wow. That’s… a lot. I really appreciate you checking. Yeah, please. Information about the financial assistance program would be great. And if there are any charities… that would be amazing. I just… I didn’t expect it to be so expensive. Sorry. I’m probably just being a bother.
DOCTOR: You are not a bother at all, Jaxston. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about the cost, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. Here’s the brochure for St. Jude’s financial assistance program. You can find the application form and more information on their website. I’ve also included a list of local charities that may be able to provide assistance. I also want to assure you that we can discuss prioritizing the tests if necessary. We can start with the blood tests and ECG, which will give us a good initial overview, and then consider the CT scan if needed. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, thank you. This is… really helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything and checking the costs. No, I think that's everything for now. I just… need to process everything. And schedule those tests. I'm gonna go home and try not to panic. Thank you, Doctor Giganti. I really appreciate it. And… sorry for being a bit flustered. You've been very patient.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaxston. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. And there’s absolutely no need to apologize – it’s perfectly normal to be anxious in these situations. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you after you've had the tests done.
