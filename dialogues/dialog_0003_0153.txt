DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I am Dr. Yackey. Let’s try to be brief, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Brief is good. My…work requires a lot of standing, you see. And frankly, I don’t remember much these days, so the quicker we get this done… the better. Though, standing isn’t new to me. I’ve been…around a bit.
DOCTOR: Very well. To that end, let’s focus. You say standing isn't new… but what brings you here today, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: Oh, right. The…clearance. For…performing. They want to make sure I’m…fit enough. Something about a physical. It’s for the theater, I think. I usher mostly, and take tickets… sometimes lobby stuff. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. They just said I needed a check-up.
DOCTOR: A physical… for ushering. Right. And are you experiencing any specific complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints…? Hmm. Not really. My feet get tired, naturally. And my back…aches a bit after a long shift. But that’s… old age, I suppose. Nothing serious. I wouldn't say I'm complaining, exactly. Just…worn. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Worn,” yes. I see. And when did you first notice this… wearing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When…? That’s…a hard question. Years, surely. Decades, probably. It wasn’t a sudden thing. Just…gradual. Like a slow leak. I’ve always been on my feet. First with…well, I don’t quite recall what before the theaters. Just…always moving. It’s always been a bit achy, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your feet or hands?
PATIENT: Numbness…? No, not really. A bit of cold sometimes, especially in the winter, but…that’s the weather, isn’t it? Not…tingling. No, I don’t think so. My hands are okay, I think. I still manage the tickets alright. Though, I do sometimes drop them…but that’s probably just my age, too.
DOCTOR: And any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Pain…? Hmm. Sometimes, yes. A bit of a shooting pain, down my…left leg, I think. Not all the time, though. It comes and goes. It’s worse if I’ve been standing for a really long time, or if I bend over too quickly. But it’s manageable. I just…sit down for a bit. It usually goes away. Is that…bad? I really don’t know much about these things.
DOCTOR: We’ll need to do a brief examination to assess this. Please step onto the examination table. I will need you to lie down.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. An examination. Yes, okay. This is a bit high, isn’t it? But…alright. Just tell me what to do. I’ll try my best. I hope it won't take too long.
DOCTOR: Now, Mr. Krahn, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please try to breathe normally. Deep breaths in…and out. Normal rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let’s check your reflexes. 2+ bilaterally. And can you please squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Squeezing… Is that…okay? I don’t want to…break anything. My grip isn't what it used to be, I’m afraid. It’s getting harder to do even simple things these days. I really hope this is enough.
DOCTOR: Grip strength is diminished. Now, I need you to lie on your back, and gently lift each leg, one at a time. I will assess your range of motion. Limited range of motion in both hips. Slight discomfort with flexion of the left hip. No acute distress noted.
PATIENT: Oh…that’s a bit uncomfortable, yes. Especially on this side. It's not painful, exactly, just…tight. I haven’t been doing much stretching lately. Mostly just standing, you see. And walking. Is this…bad? I'm starting to worry a bit now. This feels more serious than I thought.
DOCTOR: It appears you have some age-related changes in your hips, likely contributing to the discomfort. No evidence of anything acutely concerning. I recommend over-the-counter pain relief as needed and gentle stretching exercises. Perhaps consider a walking aid if prolonged standing becomes too difficult.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Pain relief…and stretching. That’s…not too bad, I suppose. A walking aid… Well, I suppose that’s what happens when you get old. Is that…it? Is there anything else I should be doing? Or…seeing? I just want to be sure I can keep doing my job. That's all. It's not much, but it keeps me…moving.
DOCTOR: We can discuss referral to a physical therapist if the pain persists. However, given your age and the nature of your occupation, I don't anticipate significant improvement. Consider modifying your duties if possible. I've documented my findings. Do you have any further questions?
