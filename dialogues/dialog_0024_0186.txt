DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I am Dr. Mutnick. Let’s not waste time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, good morning. Look, I'm trying out for a team – a sports team – and they need me to get checked out first. That's it, really. A physical. Just the basic stuff, I hope. I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: A sports team, you say. Well, that does explain the… urgency. Very well. While I appreciate brevity, a thorough examination is still necessary, regardless of your schedule. We must ensure you are fit for participation. First, let's get some background. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never been seriously sick, if that’s what you mean. Maybe a cold now and then, like everyone gets. Nothing a little rest didn’t fix. I'm pretty healthy, honestly. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: “Not seriously sick” is not a medical history, Mr. Kingan. Have you ever been hospitalized?
PATIENT: No. Never been in the hospital. Not once. Look, I told you, I'm a healthy guy. I eat okay, I get some exercise... I'm just here because they made me come. Is there a form I can just… sign?
DOCTOR: A signed form does not constitute a medical evaluation, Mr. Kingan. It would be irresponsible of me to clear you without proper assessment. Let’s proceed systematically. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Nothing like that. I think...I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but it healed on its own. My mom wrapped it up and that was that. No doctors, no hospital. Does that count? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: A self-managed fracture… fascinating. Alright. Family history then. Are your parents or siblings living?
PATIENT: My mom's still around, she’s... 85, I think? Living back in Mongolia. My dad passed away a few years back. Heart trouble, I believe. And I don’t really have any siblings. Just me. Is this important? Are you looking for something specific? I really need to get this over with.
DOCTOR: “Heart trouble” is also not a diagnosis, Mr. Kingan. However, it is… relevant. I’ll note that. Now, regarding your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never smoked a day in my life. Not my thing. Always been pretty careful about what I put in my body. I mean, I like a beer now and then, but that’s about it. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: One beer is unlikely to be a critical factor, Mr. Kingan. Though, it's good to be thorough. Do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Look, I’m an athlete, trying to be. I need to be in good shape. I don't need any of that stuff slowing me down. Seriously, are we almost done here? I have training later.
DOCTOR: Very well. Allergies?
PATIENT: No known allergies. I can eat anything. No trouble with pollen, no trouble with food, nothing. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I’m starting to think this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Then, perhaps you should have considered that before being required to undergo a medical evaluation. Finally. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Not a single pill. Never have, never will, if I can help it. Look, I'm a perfectly healthy 62-year-old man, just trying to get cleared for a sports team. Can we please just move on to the actual physical now? This questioning is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Fine. Let’s get this over with. Please lie down on the table. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then we'll proceed with a basic neurological exam and check your reflexes. Don't waste my time.
PATIENT: Finally. Let’s get it over with. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Breathe deeply, Mr. Kingan. Deeply. … Hmm. Your heart rate is slightly elevated, but that could be due to… anticipation. Lungs are clear… for now. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. And the other side… Good. Reflexes appear normal. Now, stand up and follow my finger with your eyes. Don’t move your head.
PATIENT: Is everything alright? This feels… unnecessary. I told you I'm healthy. Are you seeing something wrong?
DOCTOR: Your pupils are slightly unequal in size, Mr. Kingan. And there’s a slight nystagmus present. Not alarming, but it requires further investigation. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is slightly elevated: 145/90. Pulse is 88 and regular. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. We’ll also need an EKG to assess your heart rhythm and rule out any underlying cardiac issues.
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on. What’s wrong? What does all that mean? Unequal pupils? Cardiac issues? I just want to play sports! This is getting serious now, isn't it? I didn't think… I just thought it was a routine check-up. What do you think is wrong?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I've explained that these findings require further investigation. I am not prepared to clear you for strenuous activity based on a cursory examination. It would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. The unequal pupils could indicate a neurological issue, though it may be benign. The elevated blood pressure is also concerning, especially given your family history. An EKG will assess whether your heart is functioning properly. I'm scheduling you for these tests immediately. You'll receive a call with the appointment details. Until we have the results, you are advised to refrain from any strenuous physical activity. Here are the orders for the lab work and EKG. Do not lose these. And please, try to remain calm. We need to determine the cause of these findings before we can proceed.
PATIENT: This… this is bad, isn’t it? I just wanted to play. I didn’t want any trouble. What if… what if it is something serious? I don't even have insurance... I'm an old man, Doc. I just wanted to have some fun. Fine. I'll... I'll go get the tests done. But I don’t understand any of this.
DOCTOR: That is a matter for the specialists, Mr. Kingan. My role is to identify potential concerns and refer you for appropriate evaluation. The lab will send the results directly to my office. Once I review them, we'll discuss the next steps. Do not contact me with questions; it will only waste my time. Good day. .
