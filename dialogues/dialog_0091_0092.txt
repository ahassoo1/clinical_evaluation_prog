DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Guilds. Oreste Guilds. Pleasure’s…somewhere, I guess. Look, I been…short of breath. Feels like I’m always tryin’ to suck air through a straw. And my mouth…like sandpaper. Eyes too, I reckon. Real dry. It’s been…a while now. Can't rightly say how long.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Guilds. I understand you’ve been experiencing shortness of breath and a feeling of dryness in your mouth and eyes for some time now. When you say “a while now,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough…hmmm. Listen, doc, I used to work the lights, you know? Traffic. Been retired…oh, must be ten years, maybe more? It started…around then, I think. Maybe a little after. Hard to keep track when you get old. It ain't been sudden, that's for sure. More…creepin’ up on me. Like a slow leak. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Guilds. A slow, gradual onset. And has this shortness of breath been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I…well, when I do somethin’. Walkin’ up the stairs, carryin’ groceries. Even just talkin’ too much. Then it gets bad. Restin’…it’s better. Not good, mind you, just…less bad. I mostly just sit around these days anyway. Don't have much reason to go anywhere.
DOCTOR: I see. So it's exacerbated by exertion, and improves with rest. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Swelling…? You mean like…big? No, not really. My shoes feel a little snug sometimes, but I always figured that was just…old age. Feet spreadin’ out, you know? Never paid it much mind. I wear loafers mostly, so it's hard to tell. Don't wear nothin' tight. And honestly, doc, I don’t stare at my feet. Got better things to worry about, or had better things, anyway. Now it's mostly just…bein’ tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant swelling noted, or at least, none that you've observed. And you mentioned feeling tired. Is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go like the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, same as everything else. But the tired…that sticks around longer. Even when I’m restin’, I feel…spent. Like a battery that won’t hold a charge. It’s…unpleasant. I used to be able to work all day, fixin’ lights, climbin’ poles. Now? I get winded just walkin’ to the mailbox. It’s…humiliating, frankly. Makes a man feel useless. You understand?
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Guilds. It sounds quite frustrating to experience such a decline in your energy levels. Now, let's move on to some other questions. Have you had any chest pain associated with this shortness of breath or fatigue?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Nah. Not really. Sometimes a little…tightness, maybe. But it’s not like a sharp pain, or nothin' like that. More like…a squeeze. Happens when I get really out of breath. But it goes away when I sit down. I ain't one for complainin', doc. I had a tough life, you know? A little squeeze ain't gonna bother me. Besides, my brother…he always complained. Drove everyone crazy. I vowed I wouldn’t be like him. So I mostly just suffer in silence. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Guilds. And I appreciate your stoicism, but it's important for me to have a complete picture of what you're experiencing. So, this tightness is associated with the shortness of breath and resolves with rest. Has this been happening for as long as the shortness of breath and fatigue, or did it start more recently?
PATIENT: Recently, I reckon. The breathin’ and tired, that's been a while. This tightness…maybe six months? Hard to say. Like I told you, time ain’t my friend anymore. It all blurs together. I remember…I was helpin’ my neighbor with his yard work, tryin’ to be a good guy. And I got winded, and that's when I noticed the squeeze. Didn’t think much of it at the time. Thought it was just old age catchin’ up with me. Now I'm not so sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. A gradual onset of tightness in the chest over the past six months, associated with exertion and relieved with rest. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure... the doc gave me somethin' for that years ago. Little white pills. Stopped takin' 'em after a while. Didn't feel like they were doin' much. Diabetes? No. Never been told that. Heart problems… I had a scare once, a long time ago. Palpitations, they called it. Doc said my heart was fine, just anxiety. That was… oh, must be 30 years ago. Haven't bothered with it since. I ain’t one for doctors, you know? They always wanna poke and prod. Makes a man feel like a guinea pig.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Guilds. We will try to be as efficient as possible. You were prescribed medication for high blood pressure in the past, but discontinued it. You experienced palpitations approximately 30 years ago, but were told it was anxiety. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Hmmm. Let me think. Had my appendix out when I was a kid, I think. That was a long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, fallin' off a ladder. They set it in a cast. That's about it. Never been in the hospital for anything serious. Just the usual bumps and bruises. I always prided myself on being tough. Didn't like to show weakness. My father…he was a strong man. He never complained, even when he was sick. I tried to be like him. That's just the way we were raised.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendectomy in childhood and a broken arm. No other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… hmmm. My mother… she died young, heart problems, I think. But they didn’t have good doctors back then. Everything was… vague. My father… he lived a long life, but he had… troubles breathin' towards the end. They said it was old age. My brother… he had everything. Diabetes, cancer, you name it. Poor guy. Wasn't a healthy man. I always figured I got lucky, avoided all that. But now… now I’m not so sure. It's funny, ain't it? You think you’re tough, you think you’re lucky, and then somethin' like this happens. Makes you wonder.
DOCTOR: It is often humbling, Mr. Guilds. A family history of heart problems, breathing difficulties, and diabetes. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Right now…? Just a little somethin' for my knees. They ache somethin' awful in the mornin'. Over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, I think. And sometimes I take a little somethin’ for sleep. Melatonin, I think it’s called. Can’t sleep much these days. Worryin’ too much, I reckon. That's about it. I don't trust those fancy pills doctors prescribe. Too many side effects. I prefer to suffer in silence, like I said before. It's just the way I am. Old habits, I guess.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Mr. Guilds. Ibuprofen for knee pain and melatonin for sleep. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
