DOCTOR: Hi Candis, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Decosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, honestly? It’s about feeling just… worn out. And this habit I’ve got. It’s embarrassing, really. I don’t usually complain, but it’s getting worse and I figured… maybe you can fix it. I don’t have time for this, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It takes courage to come in and talk about things, so thank you for sharing. “Worn out” can mean a lot of different things, and I appreciate you being upfront about something being embarrassing – we all have things we're a little shy about! Let’s start with the feeling worn out. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Honestly? Everything just takes…effort. Used to be I could garden all day, clean the whole house, visit friends, all in one go. Now? I take a nap after hanging up a picture. And it's not a normal tired, it's…deeper. Like my bones are tired. And it's been going on for months, slowly getting worse. I just thought I was getting old, to be honest. What’s the point of even asking about it?
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking about it, Candis. It’s never just “getting old,” and it’s important to figure out what’s going on, especially when things are slowly changing. Feeling tired even after rest, and that “deeper” tiredness you describe... that’s definitely worth looking into. Let’s get a bit more specific. When you say “months,” roughly how many months would you estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I started noticing it properly around… November, maybe? Yes, November of last year. It was after my cousin Beatrice’s birthday. And it’s been a steady decline since then. I hate to bother you with all this, but it's just... frustrating. I have things to do. I don't have time to be useless.
DOCTOR: You’re not bothering me at all, Candis. It’s my job to listen and help you figure things out. And you're definitely not useless! It sounds like this has been impacting your life for quite some time. So, November of last year. And you said it’s been a steady decline since then. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes – things like any aches or pains, changes in your appetite, difficulty sleeping, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: Well… my stomach’s been a bit off. Not sick, exactly. Just… unsettled. And I’ve been craving… dirt. Honestly. I know it sounds awful. I find myself… picking at the garden soil. A little bit. It started small, just a tiny taste when I was weeding. Now… well, I try to stop myself, but it's hard. I feel… better when I do it. Which is ridiculous. Don’t tell anyone, please. They'll think I've lost my mind.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Candis. It takes a lot of courage to talk about things that feel embarrassing or strange. I assure you, you haven't lost your mind, and I won't judge. The craving for dirt – that’s something we need to explore further. It's called pica, and it can sometimes be a sign of a nutritional deficiency. And the unsettled stomach - is that more like nausea, indigestion, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, a name for it. Fancy that. Pica. Well, it’s not really nausea, not throwing up or anything. It's just… a gnawing feeling. Like something’s missing. And sometimes I get a bit of heartburn, especially after… you know. The dirt. I try to eat something afterwards, to settle it, but it doesn’t always work. Look, can we just get this over with? Are you going to give me a pill or something? I really don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and wanting a quick solution, Candis. I want to assure you I'm doing my best to understand what's going on and find the best course of action. Jumping straight to a “pill” without figuring out the cause wouldn’t be the best approach, and could even be harmful. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Then I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to check a few things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Questions. Just… get on with it. And make it quick. I have a tomato plant that needs pruning. Honestly, this whole thing is a waste of a perfectly good afternoon. What kind of questions are we talking? I hope you don't ask me about my childhood. I haven’t got time for all that.
DOCTOR: No childhood stories today, I promise. We’ll stick to things that are relevant to what’s going on now. First, let's talk about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I eat… reasonably well. I used to cook a lot more, but now it's mostly simple things. Toast and tea for breakfast. A sandwich for lunch, maybe some fruit. Dinner is usually… something out of a can, or a frozen meal. I don't eat a lot of red meat anymore. Too heavy. And I try to have a biscuit with my tea in the afternoon. I don’t really snack much except… well, you know. And I don't drink a lot of water, honestly. Tea is enough. It's a good, strong brew. What does any of this have to do with craving dirt? It sounds ridiculous, even I know that.
DOCTOR: It's not ridiculous at all, Candis. Your diet gives me some helpful clues. The lack of variety, and not drinking much water… that can contribute to deficiencies, which can sometimes cause unusual cravings. Now, let’s talk about any medications you’re taking, or have taken recently. Any vitamins, supplements, or over-the-counter remedies?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in all that. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but I managed to get it under control with… sensible living. Tea, mostly. And I don’t take any vitamins or anything like that. Waste of money, if you ask me. I get everything I need from my food. Although, admittedly, I haven't been eating a lot of greens lately. Look, can we just skip the rest? I'm starting to feel… faint. Probably just needs a biscuit and a lie-down.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just a few more quick questions, then we’ll do a brief exam and see what’s going on. You mentioned feeling faint… have you noticed any dizziness, shortness of breath, or headaches lately?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, my head has been a bit fuzzy. And I do get a bit breathless sometimes, just walking up the garden path. And yes, I suppose I have been a bit dizzy occasionally. Mostly in the afternoons. But I just put it down to… getting older. It’s probably nothing. Honestly, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. Can we please just get this over with? I need to prune that tomato plant before it gets too overgrown. It’s a 'Brandywine', you know, very delicate. And I haven't got all day!
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. Given what you’ve told me, and the symptoms you're describing, it's good we're looking into this. I'm going to ask you to lie down on the examination table so I can listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then I’ll take a quick look at your eyes and feel your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Just… be quick about it. And try not to poke me too much. Honestly, I’ve got more important things to do. And don’t be surprised if I ask you to hurry. I have a schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I’m hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds, especially on your lower lobes. Your breathing sounds a little…wheezy. I’m going to check your blood pressure now. Your blood pressure is a bit low. Now I’m going to take a look at your eyes. Just look straight ahead. I’m seeing some mild pallor in your conjunctiva, which could indicate anemia. Finally, I'm just going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Okay. That’s all for the physical exam. I'm going to need to order some blood tests to check your iron levels, vitamin deficiencies, and rule out any other underlying conditions. We'll also need to do a stool sample to check for parasites. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… stool samples? Honestly! This is ridiculous. What does any of this have to do with craving dirt? It's a perfectly normal habit, I'm sure. And what about my tomato plant? It needs pruning! Look, I don’t have time for all this. Just give me something for the tiredness and let me get on with my life. I haven't got time to be poked and prodded and have my… stool analyzed! This is a complete waste of a perfectly good afternoon!
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis, please, just sit still for a moment. I understand your frustration, but we need to rule out anything serious. The tiredness, the craving for dirt, the dizziness, the low blood pressure… these things are all connected, and we need to find out why. I'm concerned about your current state and I don't think it’s safe for you to go home until we've at least started some basic testing. Your low blood pressure and dizziness are worrying, and I'm worried you might fall. I'm going to order an immediate blood draw and get the lab to prioritize the results. I'm also going to call an ambulance to take you to the hospital for further evaluation and monitoring. It's better to be safe than sorry, and I want to make sure you're okay. .
