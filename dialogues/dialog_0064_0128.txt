DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Smetak, was it? It's…my joints, mostly. They get stiff in the mornings. Real stiff. It’s been happening for…a little while now, I guess. I don’t really keep track of things like that anymore. It just…is.
DOCTOR: Alright, “a little while now” is fine. We’ll get to the bottom of it. So, the stiffness is mainly in the mornings… can you tell me where specifically you’re feeling this stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… everywhere, kinda. My hands, mostly. And my knees… yeah, my knees bother me getting up. And my back… sometimes. It’s hard to say, really. It's not like one spot. It just…aches all over when I first wake up. Does that make sense? I don't know if I'm explaining it right.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Lilliana. “All over” is a very helpful description. So, it sounds like widespread joint and muscle aches, particularly worse in the mornings. And does anything relieve the stiffness throughout the day?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Moving around, mostly. Once I get going, it gets better. It takes a while… but after I’ve been up and doing things for a bit, it’s not so bad. Standing, walking… even just puttering around the house helps. Sitting still is the worst. That’s when it really locks up on me. I do a lot of… well, I used to do a lot of gardening. Not so much anymore, though. My back… you know.
DOCTOR: Right, so movement seems to be your friend, and stillness, not so much. Gardening… that's good to know. We’ll come back to that. Now, can you describe the type of pain?
PATIENT: The type…? Oh dear. What do you mean? Is it…sharp? Dull? It's…achey, mostly. A real deep ache. Not like a sudden pain, you know? It's more like… a heavy feeling. And it's…stiff. That's the best way to put it, I think. A heavy, stiff ache. It doesn't really hurt hurt, if that makes sense. It just…is uncomfortable. Does that help? I’m not very good at describing things, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: You’re describing it perfectly, Lilliana. A heavy, stiff ache, not sharp, not sudden. That’s very helpful. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the aches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think. Hmm… I get tired, easily. More tired than I used to, anyway. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little…fuzzy headed. Not dizzy, exactly. Just…not as sharp as I used to be. You know? Like my brain is a little slow. And… oh, I’ve been sleeping a bit more, too. Not a lot, but…more naps than usual. Does that count? I don't know if that's related, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, those all count, Lilliana. Fatigue, feeling a bit "fuzzy headed," and increased sleep are all important things to know. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. It was so long ago… My husband, bless him, he always handled the doctor things. I remember… something with my blood pressure, maybe? The doctor said I needed to watch it. And I think I had…arthritis, a long time ago, in my hands? But it wasn’t…bad. It didn’t bother me much. Honestly, I’m not very good at remembering these things. It was all so long ago, and so many doctors…
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lilliana. Don’t worry about it. We’ll do our best to figure things out. I'm going to take a quick look at your records on the computer here – sometimes that helps jog the memory. Just give me a moment. Okay, it looks like there's a note here about slightly elevated blood pressure a few years back, managed with diet and exercise, and a mention of possible osteoarthritis in the hands, but no specific diagnosis or treatment plan documented. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries… Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, I think. And…oh! When I broke my wrist, years ago. I was gardening, of course. I fell off a little step ladder. They put a cast on it. I don’t remember much else. Everything’s so… blurry. And I think I had… something with my gallbladder, maybe? But it was a long time ago, and I don’t really remember the details. Was that a surgery? Honestly, I’m just trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsils out as a child, a broken wrist, and possibly a gallbladder surgery. We're getting there. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there a history of arthritis or other joint problems in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother had… something with her hands, I think. She couldn't knit anymore towards the end. It was awful. Always complaining about the pain. I think it was arthritis, yes. My father… he was healthy as a horse, always working in the garden. Never a sick day. And my sister… she had something with her hips, maybe? She needed a cane towards the end. It’s all so vague. I remember them being sick, but not…what they had. Does that make sense? I wish I could remember more. It feels like I’m letting them down, not remembering.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Lilliana. You’re not letting anyone down. Memories fade, especially over time. The fact that your mother and sister experienced joint problems is helpful information. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he used to smoke, years ago. But he quit when I got pregnant. He said it wasn’t fair to the baby. Good man, he was. No, no smoking for me. And I don't drink much, either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear… allergies. Let me think. I don't think so. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. My husband always said I had a strong stomach. I remember one time, the doctor gave me a shot, and my arm was a little sore afterward, but that’s about it. I don’t recall any serious allergies. But honestly, I'm not very good at remembering these things. It’s possible I forgot something. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly okay, Lilliana. We can always proceed cautiously with any new medications. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. It will just involve checking your joints, listening to your heart and lungs, and maybe checking your reflexes. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I'm just glad I came. It’s been bothering me for a while, and I just want to feel better. Yes, please. Go ahead. Whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your hands. Can you make a fist for me?
PATIENT: There… like that? It feels a little stiff, you know? Not painful, just…tight. And my knuckles… they feel a bit bumpy. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m noticing a little swelling around the knuckles and a bit of stiffness. And you’re right, the range of motion is slightly limited. It's not severe, but it's something we need to take into account. Now, let's move on to your wrists. Can you bend your wrists up and down for me?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a little uncomfortable, yes. It feels… tight. And there’s a little clicking sound, I think. Do you hear that? It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it’s… unsettling. And my wrists feel weak, maybe? I don’t know. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m noticing a little tenderness here and I do hear a bit of clicking as you move your wrists. That could be due to a number of things. Now, let's check your knees. Can you bend your knees for me, as much as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… uncomfortable, yes. It feels tight and a little creaky. It’s worse in the mornings, you know? It takes a while to loosen up. And sometimes I feel a little pop when I bend them. Is that bad? Oh! Sorry. That’s about as far as I can go.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm noticing some crepitus and slight tenderness here. It sounds like there's some wear and tear in the knee joint. It doesn't seem to be severely inflamed at the moment, but we’ll need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally for me.
PATIENT: Okay… like that? I hope I'm not doing it wrong. I'm not very good at this sort of thing. Is everything alright? I always worry when they listen to my heart. My husband… he had a bad heart, you know. I just want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds good, Lilliana. Your heart rhythm is regular, and your lungs are clear. No worries there. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax your legs for me.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Is that going to hurt? I’m always so afraid of needles and things. My husband… he hated needles too. Oh! That tickled. Did you see it? Did I do it right?
DOCTOR: Alright, your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which can be normal, especially as we age. It's something we’ll keep in mind. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on the exam, you're experiencing some joint stiffness, particularly in your hands and knees, with some limited range of motion and diminished reflexes. It sounds like we need to rule out a few possibilities, including osteoarthritis, and possibly some early signs of… well, we’ll need some blood work and maybe some imaging to get a clearer picture. Would you be comfortable getting some blood tests done?
PATIENT: Oh dear… blood tests? I don’t like needles, you know. But… if it will help me feel better, then yes, I suppose so. I just… I get so nervous. What are you looking for, exactly? Will it hurt much? And how long will it take? I just want to know what’s going on, you know? And I want to feel better soon.
DOCTOR: It's okay to be nervous, Lilliana. I understand. The blood tests will help us rule out some inflammatory conditions and check your vitamin levels, which can sometimes contribute to joint pain. It's a standard procedure, and the discomfort is usually minimal – just a quick pinch. It will only take a few minutes to draw the blood, and the results usually come back within a few days. We’ll also order some X-rays of your hands and knees to get a better look at the joints themselves. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays… Oh dear. Is that safe? I always worry about those things. But… if it will help, then yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s wrong, you know? And I want to feel better. So, yes, blood tests and X-rays, if you think it’s necessary. When can we do them? And will they tell me the results right away? I just want to know what I'm dealing with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilliana. That's good. We can get the blood work and X-rays done today. I’ll write you a requisition form for both. You can go to the lab just down the hall for the blood work, and the X-ray technician is just around the corner. It should only take about an hour or so for everything. The lab results will be sent to me electronically, and I’ll review them as soon as I receive them. The X-ray technician will take the images and a radiologist will interpret them, and those results will also be sent to me. I should have everything back within a few days, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A few days… I can manage a few days. So, I go to the lab, then the X-rays, and then I wait for you to call? Is that right? And you’ll explain everything to me when I come back? It's just… a lot to take in. But I trust you, Doctor. I just want to feel better. Thank you for your help.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Lilliana. You go to the lab first, then the X-rays. Then you just wait for me to call. I’ll explain everything to you in detail when you come back, and we’ll create a plan to help you feel better. Here's the requisition form. The lab and X-ray technician are both very friendly, so don’t hesitate to ask them any questions you have. And yes, please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns in the meantime. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. It's just… nice to be listened to, you know? I just hope the results aren’t too bad. But I trust you to take care of me. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. I’m glad I could help. Don’t worry, we’ll take things one step at a time. And remember, I'm here for you. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in a few days.
