DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s about my bruising. It's just… getting worse, even though I’m on that medicine to help my blood not clot so easy. I don’t really know what to tell you, it just seems off.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that’s getting worse despite being on a blood thinner… that definitely warrants a closer look. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? Small bruises, you know, like from bumping into things. Normal stuff. But then they started appearing out of nowhere, and getting bigger, even when I haven’t bumped into anything. And they’re taking longer to go away. A lot longer. I usually don't remember how I got them, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a month ago, starting with typical bruising, then progressing to bruises appearing spontaneously, larger size, and prolonged healing time, with a lack of recollection of injury… I see. And you said you’re on medication to prevent your blood from clotting too easily?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The doctor put me on it about six months ago. Something about my blood being too thick, I think? He said it would help with… circulation, maybe? I just take the pills every day like he told me. I can tell you the name if that helps? It's… Warfarin, I think.
DOCTOR: Warfarin, okay. Yes, that definitely helps. And six months on Warfarin… we’ll want to look into that, as well. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, I guess. Just… run down. And my gums bleed a little when I brush my teeth, more than they used to. Nothing major, but enough that I noticed. Oh, and… sometimes I get little red spots on my skin, like tiny pinpricks. Mostly on my legs. I thought they were bug bites at first.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue, bleeding gums, and those small red spots – petechiae, we call them – on your legs… those are all important things to note. Have you experienced any unusually heavy periods, nosebleeds, or blood in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, none of that. My periods are… normal, for me. No nosebleeds recently, and everything seems okay, you know… down there. I haven't checked, but I haven't seen anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um, let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been controlled with medication for years now. And I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, but that was ages ago, no problems since. Oh, and the doctor said something about my cholesterol being a little high, but we haven't really done anything about it. It’s not bad high, he said. Just… a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled hypertension, gallbladder removal, and slightly elevated cholesterol… I appreciate you sharing that. And what about any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. Nothing else. I've broken a bone or two as a kid, but that was a long time ago, and nothing recent. And I haven’t had any… serious illnesses, like pneumonia or anything. Just the usual colds and flu, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, and her mother had heart trouble. And my brother has… something with his blood, but I can’t really remember what. It’s not the same as what I have, he has to get shots all the time. Something about… clotting? It’s complicated, I don’t really understand it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes, heart trouble, and a brother with a clotting disorder… that's helpful. And to get a complete picture, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean?
DOCTOR: That's a good question. It just means things like if you smoke, drink alcohol, or what your typical daily activity level is like. And if you have any significant stress in your life. It helps me understand things that might be impacting your health.
PATIENT: Oh! Okay. Well, I don’t smoke, never have. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe a couple of times a week. And… I mostly just work, to be honest. I’m an Information Security Analyst, so I sit at a desk a lot. Not much exercise. And yeah, work is pretty stressful. Lots of deadlines, lots of… problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional alcohol, a sedentary job with a high stress level… I understand. Now, just a few more quick questions. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was low on it. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Maybe once or twice a month? That's it, I think. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D and occasional ibuprofen. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I’m pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Thank you for sharing all of that information, Courtnye. It gives me a much better understanding of what’s going on. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam to check things out more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, I'll examine your skin, looking for any signs of bruising or those small red spots. Finally, I'll gently palpate your abdomen. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 78 and regular. I do see some bruising on your arms and legs, some of it looks relatively recent, some older. And I also see those small red spots – petechiae – particularly on your lower legs. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to the touch, no masses felt. Overall, these findings are consistent with what you've described, but we need to do some further testing to determine the underlying cause.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… thorough. So, what kind of testing do you need to do? Is it going to be painful? I don't really like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles. We'll try to keep it as quick and painless as possible. We'll need a complete blood count, or CBC, to check your red and white blood cell counts and platelet levels. We'll also need a coagulation panel, which will evaluate how well your blood is clotting – including your INR, which measures the effect of the Warfarin. And lastly, I'd like to order a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. These tests will help us determine if the Warfarin is at the correct dose, if there's an underlying bleeding disorder, and if there are any other factors contributing to the bruising. These tests will involve a blood draw, unfortunately. But I can ask the phlebotomist to use a smaller needle and to be as gentle as possible. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds like a lot of tests, but I guess it’s necessary. If it’s going to help figure things out, I’m willing to do it. Yes, please ask for a smaller needle. And… maybe someone who’s really good at drawing blood? I always get a little faint.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll make a note to request our most experienced phlebotomist, and we'll definitely use a smaller needle. We can have you lie down during the blood draw to prevent you from feeling faint, and I'll be right here with you. Okay, let me write up the orders for these tests. It should take about an hour to get the results back. After that, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity or activities that could lead to injury. And if you notice any significant bleeding, like nosebleeds that won't stop, blood in your urine or stool, or heavy bleeding from any wound, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… please let me know what the results are as soon as you can. I hate feeling like this, not knowing what’s wrong. And… thanks for being patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Courtnye. I understand your anxiety, and I'll do my best to get the results to you as quickly as possible. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll be in the next room reviewing your chart, and I'll come back as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, try to relax. We'll figure this out.
