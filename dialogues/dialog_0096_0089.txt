DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor… Burlingham, is it? Yes, please, do call me Alese. Well, it’s… it’s this pain. Down low, in my belly. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it’s… quite something. I’ve been having these episodes for… oh dear, I can’t quite put my finger on how long. It feels like it’s been a little while, though. A few weeks, perhaps? It’s hard to keep track, you see.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. Hmm. And when you say “down low,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… yes. Well, it’s… lower abdomen, of course. But… it’s hard to pinpoint. It feels… everywhere down there, really. More on the right side sometimes, I think? But then other times it’s more in the middle. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… a deep ache. And cramping, yes, definitely cramping. It’s… uncomfortable, to say the least. Do you need me to be more specific? I apologize, I'm not very good at describing things, I find.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. “Lower abdomen, more on the right side sometimes, a deep ache and cramping.” That’s helpful enough for now. And is this pain constant, or does it come and go in episodes, as you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, it absolutely comes and goes. It’s not… thankfully, it’s not always there. It flares up, and then it… subsides. It’s unpredictable, really. Sometimes it’s just a dull ache that I can ignore, and other times… well, other times it’s quite debilitating. I find myself just needing to lie down. It's been… worrying me a bit, you see. I don't recall it ever being this frequent before.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And when these episodes flare up, are they related to anything in particular?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. I wish I knew! I've been trying to figure that out myself. I don’t think so… not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It doesn’t seem to be connected to what I eat, or… or any particular activity. Sometimes it happens after I’ve been… moving around a lot, perhaps? But other times it happens when I’m just sitting quietly. It’s very… erratic, I'm afraid. I wish I could be more helpful. Is it important to know why it happens?
DOCTOR: Well, of course it's important to know why things happen, Ms. Glymph. That's what I'm here for. But sometimes the body just… does things. Now, let’s move on. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. You're quite right. My apologies for being… unhelpful. Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I’ve been rather tired lately, more so than usual. And… my joints ache a bit, but that’s… nothing new, really. I have… a condition, you see. Something the doctors have been treating for a while now. Lupus, I believe? Or something like that. It causes… a lot of aches and pains. Is that what you mean by “symptoms”? I tend to forget the details, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Lupus, right. And the fatigue and joint pain… is that new, or has that been ongoing with the Lupus?
PATIENT: Oh, the fatigue and joint pain… that’s… a tricky question. The joint pain has been ongoing, certainly. It comes and goes with the Lupus, as you know. But the fatigue… I think it’s worse lately. More debilitating, perhaps. I find myself needing to rest much more than usual, even after a good night’s sleep. It’s… interfering with my daily routine, you see. I used to be much more active, but… well. It's been a gradual change, I suppose. I can’t pinpoint exactly when it started to worsen.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fatigue worsening, ongoing joint pain related to Lupus… Anything else at all?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. I have been… a little more irritable, perhaps? Not that anyone has mentioned it, but I feel… a bit on edge lately. And… oh dear, this is embarrassing. My appetite hasn’t been very good. I haven’t been eating as much as usual. It’s not… a deliberate thing, you see. I just don’t feel very hungry. And… I believe I’ve had a slight… fever a few times? But nothing major. Just a little warm to the touch. It goes away quickly. Is that important? I always worry about mentioning things that might not be relevant.
DOCTOR: Irritability, decreased appetite, occasional low-grade fever… Ms. Glymph, are you currently taking any medications for your Lupus, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Yes, I am. Let me think… I take… Plaquenil, I believe? And… a small dose of Prednisone, sometimes. When the flares are particularly bad. And… oh, I take something for my blood pressure, too. Losartan, I think it’s called. I also take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were low. I’m… terribly sorry, I should have remembered that right away! My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Plaquenil, Prednisone as needed, Losartan, Vitamin D. Any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! No allergies, thankfully. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I know. I’m… fairly certain of that, at least. I've always been quite careful about checking with the pharmacist before starting anything new. It's good to be cautious, you see. My mother always said so.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I'm going to need to examine your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything specific. And… is it going to be… uncomfortable? I do hope not.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be painful, Ms. Glymph. Just relax, and I’ll let you know if I need you to do anything.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Just tell me if there’s anything I should be aware of. I do hope this doesn’t take too long. I have… a small appointment later this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath in… and out. Now, tell me if you feel any tenderness anywhere. Ouch. There. Is that where the pain is usually located?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, Doctor, that’s… that’s definitely it. Right there. Not constantly, you understand, but… when it flares up, it’s right there. It’s a… a dull ache, usually. But when you press… it’s sharper. Yes, that’s it. That's where the trouble is. Is it… serious? I do hope it’s not anything too worrying.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There’s some guarding here, Ms. Glymph. And a bit of rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished. Given your symptoms and this examination, I’m concerned about a possible flare-up of something more than just Lupus. We need to rule out other causes of abdominal pain. I'm ordering some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a CRP to check for inflammation. We'll also need a urine analysis. And… I'm going to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, just to be safe.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan? And all that blood work… Is it… is it something serious, Doctor? Is it possible it’s just a bad flare-up? I’m rather anxious, you see. And… a CT scan sounds… quite invasive. Is it absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, I understand your anxiety, but it's necessary to rule out other possibilities. While it could be a Lupus flare, we need to exclude things like appendicitis, diverticulitis, or other infections. A CT scan is the best way to do that. It’s not invasive – you just lie on a table and it takes pictures. We need to have a clear picture of what’s going on before we can determine the best course of action. I will order the tests now, and the lab will contact you to schedule the CT scan. Don't panic, alright?
PATIENT: Oh… very well, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary… I just… I don't like being poked and prodded, you see. And the thought of… pictures inside my body… it's rather unsettling. But… if it will help to determine what’s wrong, then I suppose I must do it. When will I know the results? And… what happens if they find something… serious?
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back within 24-48 hours. The CT scan results will take a bit longer, perhaps a day or two after that. If anything serious is found, we will discuss it thoroughly and determine the best treatment plan, which may involve medication, or a referral to a specialist. Now, I'm going to write up these orders. I will also give you instructions on how to prepare for the CT scan. Please follow them carefully. Try to relax, Ms. Glymph, and try not to worry until we have the results.
PATIENT: Oh… very well. Thank you, Doctor. I will… try to relax. And I will follow the instructions carefully. Thank you for… explaining everything. Is there… anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Should I be avoiding certain foods? Or… is there anything to look out for?
DOCTOR: For now, continue taking your medications as prescribed. Maintain a normal diet – no specific restrictions are necessary at this point. However, if you experience a high fever, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. I will contact you as soon as the results are available. Do you have any other questions at this time, Ms. Glymph?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for… seeing me. And thank you for… explaining everything so thoroughly. I do appreciate it. I… I hope it’s nothing too serious. I will… try to relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just follow up with the lab to schedule your tests. And don't hesitate to call if anything changes.
PATIENT: Oh… very well. Thank you again, Doctor. .
