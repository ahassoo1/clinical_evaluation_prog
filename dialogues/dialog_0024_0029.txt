DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's get straight to the point. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Norval is fine, please. Well, it's… I get full awful quick these days. Like, I haven't even finished a proper plate of food and I feel stuffed. It's been happening for a few months now, I'd say. It's just… bothersome, you know?
DOCTOR: "Just bothersome." Right. Well, “bothersome” can be indicative of a multitude of things, Mr. Obarr. A few months, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, a good few months. Maybe six, seven? Hard to say exactly. It’s not painful, not at all. Just… uncomfortable. And it makes it hard to enjoy my meals, which is a shame. My wife makes a beautiful salmon chowder, but I can only have a little bit now before I feel like I’m gonna burst. Not a good thing for an old man, missing out on good food.
DOCTOR: Salmon chowder, you say. And you are experiencing this fullness during the meal, or shortly thereafter?
PATIENT: Right during, Doctor. It’s not like I eat and then feel sick later, no. It's while I'm eating. A few bites in, and that's it. Feels like I've already had too much, even though I haven't. It’s strange. And it doesn’t matter what I’m eating, really. Salmon chowder, roast chicken, even just a little bit of toast… same thing. It's just... full.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this… premature satiety?
PATIENT: Premature… what now? Oh, early fullness. Right. Let me think. Well, no… not really. I mean, I'm an old man, Doctor, so things creak and groan a bit, you know? But nothing different alongside the full feeling. No nausea, no stomach pain, no heartburn... I'm just... not hungry for very long. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that's just getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: "Just getting old." A convenient explanation, isn't it?
PATIENT: Well, it usually is, Doctor! But I suppose you're right. It's good to check things out. My wife, Elsie, she insisted I come. Said I was losing weight, and she worries. She’s a good woman, Elsie. Always looking after me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: Not much, really. Just the usual old man stuff. High blood pressure, a bit of arthritis in my knees, you know. Nothing serious. Had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was ages ago. And… oh! I had a bit of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered just fine. Elsie keeps all the records, though. She's the organized one, definitely. I couldn't tell you dates or anything. Just the basics, really. Nothing that would explain this, I wouldn't think.
DOCTOR: And medications, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for the blood pressure. Amlodipine, I think it's called. One a day, every morning. And sometimes, when my knees are acting up, Elsie gives me some ibuprofen. But not often, she doesn't like me taking too much of that stuff. It doesn’t really help much, honestly. Just makes me feel a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I'm aware of. Elsie always checks when she gets new prescriptions, though. She's very careful. I've never had a reaction to anything, not as far as I can remember. I eat pretty much everything, really. Except for oysters. Never liked oysters. Slimy things. Elsie tried to get me to eat them once... that didn’t end well. But no allergies, no. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we proceed with a… cursory physical examination, let's discuss your family history. Were there any instances of… digestive issues, or unexplained weight loss, amongst your relatives?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tough one, Doctor. My family… well, most of them are gone now. My mother, she had a bit of trouble with her stomach sometimes, but just the usual indigestion, I think. My father… he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life. My sister… she passed away young, from something else entirely. And my brother… lived a long life, but didn’t talk much about his health. Now that you mention it, my uncle, on my mother’s side… he lost a lot of weight before he died. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t remember what it was. Something with his insides, Elsie said. But I don’t know for sure. It’s all a bit fuzzy. We weren't a family that talked a lot about… that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Let's move on. I’d like to perform a brief examination. Please lie back on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you say so. Old bones aren't as nimble as they used to be. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. And please, don't poke too hard!
DOCTOR: Normal bowel sounds, though slightly diminished. No bruits auscultated. Palpation… abdomen is soft, non-distended. Tenderness to light palpation in the epigastric region. No hepatosplenomegaly detected. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Epigastric… is that the top part? Right around here? Elsie always says I eat too fast, maybe that’s it. Just a little tender, like a bruise, almost. And reflexes… what do I need to do for that? Just lie still?
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes also 2+ bilaterally. No clonus detected. Now, let's take a look at your throat. Open wide, please.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just let me know if I'm drooling too much, eh? I always thought I had a big mouth, but Elsie says it's just because I talk too much. Everything alright in there, Doctor? You see anything strange? My tonsils aren't bothering me, I don't think...
DOCTOR: Pharynx normal in appearance. No obvious erythema or exudate. Tonsils are not enlarged. Alright. Based on this limited examination, and considering your history, it's possible this is early satiety due to… functional dyspepsia. However, to rule out other possibilities, I recommend a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a stool analysis to assess for any underlying inflammation or infection.
PATIENT: Functional… what now? Sounds complicated. And those tests… are they painful? The stool analysis… That doesn’t sound very pleasant. And will they tell me what’s wrong? Is it something serious? Elsie will be worried sick if it's something serious. I just want to be able to enjoy my salmon chowder again, you know? Is it something I can fix?
DOCTOR: "Functional dyspepsia" simply means indigestion without a clear, identifiable cause. The tests are not painful, Mr. Obarr. The stool analysis requires a small sample, and there are kits available to make it… less unpleasant. And, at this stage, there is no indication that this is anything serious. However, it is prudent to rule out other causes, such as anemia, electrolyte imbalances, or infection. I will write you a requisition for these tests. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals, avoiding fatty foods, and staying hydrated. And perhaps, try to eat a little slower. We'll see what the tests reveal. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Smaller meals… I suppose I can try that. Elsie always tells me I eat like a horse. And I’ll definitely try to slow down. She’ll be pleased to hear that. No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Just… thank you. For looking into it. And for not saying it was all in my head. Elsie gets a bit… frustrated when she thinks it’s just me being an old worrywart. So, the requisition… where will I take that? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: You can take this to the lab at City General Hospital. The results should be back within five to seven business days. They will likely contact you directly when they are available. I believe that is all for today, Mr. Obarr. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or unexplained weight loss – please contact my office immediately. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. City General… I know where that is. No, I think that’s everything. You've been very helpful. And thank you for listening. Elsie will be relieved to know we have a plan. I’ll go get those tests done right away. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. You too, Mr. Obarr. .
