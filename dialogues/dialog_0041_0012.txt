DOCTOR: Hi Velda, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Polczynski. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here today regarding a cruise I am planning. They require some medical information before I can confirm my booking, and my own doctor… well, he's retired now, sadly. I was hoping you could perhaps assist me with that.
DOCTOR: Right, a pre-cruise medical form. Perfectly understandable. I can definitely help with that. Let’s see… usually these forms ask about your overall health, any existing medical conditions, medications you're taking, allergies… things like that. To start, could you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m generally quite well, thank you. I keep active, I do a fair bit of gardening, and I try to eat a balanced diet, though I do enjoy a good biscuit with my tea now and then! I haven’t been seriously ill in… oh, goodness, I couldn’t rightly say when. Just the usual colds, nothing that’s kept me from my routine. I’m 45 years of age, if that’s of any consequence.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear! Staying active is wonderful. And a biscuit with tea is perfectly acceptable, in my opinion. 45 is certainly relevant, thank you. Now, thinking a bit more specifically... have you been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve had the usual check-ups over the years, with my previous doctor, of course, and he never mentioned anything of the sort. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing like that. I had my tonsils removed as a child, if that counts, but that was decades ago. Really, I can't recall ever having been told I have anything long-term.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known chronic conditions. That's helpful. Tonsils out as a child doesn’t usually factor in at this point, but good to know. Have you had any surgeries other than your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had a rather nasty fall about fifteen years ago, broke my wrist. Required a cast and a bit of physiotherapy afterward, but it healed up grand. Aside from that… I believe that’s it. Nothing else requiring a surgeon's attention, thankfully. A few stitches here and there over the years, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, broken wrist fifteen years ago, and a few minor stitches. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… is there any history of significant medical conditions in your parents, siblings, or grandparents?
PATIENT: Oh, now that is a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure toward the end of her life. And my father, he struggled with arthritis in his knees. That slowed him down considerably when he got older. I have one sister, and she's perfectly healthy as far as I know. No heart trouble or cancers that I'm aware of on either side of the family, thankfully. It's funny, you don't really think about these things until you're asked!
DOCTOR: It is funny how that works, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Quite right! It's easy to forget the details of family history unless someone specifically asks.
DOCTOR: Exactly. High blood pressure in your mother and arthritis in your father – noted. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, not even as a child. I can eat anything, take most medicines, and I’ve never been stung by a bee or come across anything I’m sensitive to. I don’t have any skin allergies either. I used to help my grandmother with her roses, and I was always handling the plants, never any bother.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. No known allergies – that simplifies things nicely. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I don't take anything regularly. Occasionally, if I have a headache, I might take a paracetamol, but that’s it. I don’t bother with vitamins or herbal supplements. I try to get everything I need from my food.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional paracetamol for headaches, but no regular medications, vitamins, or supplements. Okay, that gives me a good picture of your health history. Just to complete the form, would you mind if I quickly listen to your heart and lungs and take your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Not at all. That sounds perfectly sensible.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just relax and take some deep breaths… Heart sounds normal, lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but within an acceptable range. Do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fatigue?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I've never experienced any chest pain, and I can walk as far as I need to without getting breathless. I don't feel dizzy, and I certainly haven't been overly fatigued. I might feel a little tired at the end of a long day in the garden, but that’s to be expected, I suppose! Everything feels quite normal, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That's reassuring to hear. So, to summarise, you're generally healthy, no known chronic conditions, no allergies, occasional paracetamol for headaches, and normal heart and lung sounds with a slightly elevated blood pressure. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick examination, I believe you are fit to travel. I will complete the pre-cruise medical form with these details. Do you have any specific concerns or questions about travelling with your current health status?
PATIENT: That’s very good to hear, Doctor! No, I don’t have any specific concerns, no. I’ve always been quite a healthy traveller. I suppose it’s good to have it confirmed by a professional, though. I’m just eager to get the form completed and finally book this cruise! I’ve been looking forward to it for months.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here you are. This should satisfy the cruise line's requirements. I’ve noted the slightly elevated blood pressure, and I would recommend continuing to maintain a healthy lifestyle – diet and exercise – and getting your blood pressure checked regularly with your primary care physician. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: That's wonderful, thank you so much, Doctor Polczynski! This is perfect, exactly what I needed. No, I think that's everything. I truly appreciate your time and thoroughness. You've put my mind at ease. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Velda. I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your cruise! And don't forget the sunscreen. If you need anything in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. .
PATIENT: Have a good day yourself, Doctor. And thank you once more.
