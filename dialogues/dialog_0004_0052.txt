DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s this nausea, see. Happens most mornings now. It's a bit unsettling, to be honest. Especially with… well, with my heart not being what it used to be. I get a bit queasy, just before breakfast usually. It’s not awful, but enough to put me off my food, and that can't be good, can it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Nausea, primarily in the mornings, you said. And you’re concerned given your heart history. Can you tell me a little more about your heart condition?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Well, the cardiologist told me a few years back it's… weakened, is the best way to put it. Something about it not pumping as strong as it should. I’ve been on some pills for it, water pills mostly, to get rid of any extra fluid. I can't quite remember the name of it now, sorry. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I go for check-ups every six months or so, and they said it was stable, but… this nausea is new.
DOCTOR: Right. A weakened heart, managed with diuretics, stable for some time. And now this new onset of nausea. Do you experience any other symptoms with the nausea?
PATIENT: Aye, sometimes. Not every time, mind you. But a wee bit of… lightheadedness, I suppose. Not enough to make me fall, just a bit unsteady on my feet. And… now that you mention it, I've been feeling a bit more tired lately than usual. Just a general worn-out feeling, like I haven’t had a good night’s sleep even when I have. It's hard to say if that's just getting old though, at my age.
DOCTOR: Lightheadedness and increased fatigue along with the nausea. Are you noticing any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Hmm… Now that you ask… aye, actually. A bit looser than usual, if you don’t mind me saying. Nothing terribly dramatic, just… not as firm as they used to be. And maybe a bit more frequent, but nothing to write home about, you understand. It started around the same time as the nausea, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay. Looser and more frequent stools concurrent with the other symptoms. Are you taking any other medications besides the water pill?
PATIENT: Just the one, as far as I know. The doctor gave me something for my blood pressure a while back, a small white pill. I take that every evening. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take one of those over-the-counter sleeping tablets, the ones with diphenhydramine in them, but not regularly. Maybe once or twice a week, if that. I try to avoid them if I can. They leave me feeling a bit groggy in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Alright. Diuretic for the heart, a blood pressure medication, and occasional diphenhydramine for sleep. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I don’t recall ever having any trouble with anything myself. I eat pretty much everything, and I’ve never had any skin rashes or trouble breathing after taking a new medication. I’ve always been a pretty hardy soul, until recently, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. None of that for me, thank you very much. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Used to have a wee dram of whisky now and then, especially on a cold evening, but I gave that up years ago. The doctor said it wouldn't do my heart any good, and he was right, I suppose. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a bit of a bookworm, if you must know. That's my vice.
DOCTOR: Right. Non-smoker, no alcohol, no drugs, and a fondness for reading. Good to know. Now, tell me about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Aye, well, my father had a weak heart, same as me, and he ended up needing a pacemaker. My mother was fine, mostly, but she did have diabetes towards the end of her life. And my sister, she had breast cancer a few years back, but thankfully she’s doing alright now. She's been given the all clear. My grandparents… I don't really know much about their medical history, to be honest. They both died when I was quite young. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. Family history of heart disease, diabetes, and breast cancer. Now, finally, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than your heart condition, or had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, that was about it. Oh, and I broke my arm once falling off a bicycle, but that was a long time ago. Nothing else, I don’t think. No major illnesses, no other surgeries. Just the heart, as far as I know. It's been a pretty uneventful medical life, until recently. Hopefully, it'll stay that way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. Thank you for that comprehensive history. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll start with your heart and lungs, then check your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, and I do detect a slightly irregular rhythm. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, but I note some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Blood pressure is 140/90. Your weight is 142 lbs. Is this consistent with your usual weight?
PATIENT: Aye, 142 sounds about right. I tend to hover around that weight, give or take a pound or two. It’s been steady for years now. That's… aye, that's where it feels a wee bit tender. Not terrible, just uncomfortable. And the irregular rhythm... that doesn't sound good, does it? I haven't noticed anything myself, but I suppose that’s the worry with these things. It comes on suddenly, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean it's dire, but it warrants investigation. Given your symptoms and the findings of the exam, I'm concerned about several possibilities. It could be related to your heart condition, perhaps some worsening of the heart failure. It could also be a gastrointestinal issue, like gastritis or a mild infection. The tenderness in your abdomen and the irregular rhythm, combined with the nausea, fatigue, and changes in bowel habits, are concerning. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count to check for infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess kidney and liver function, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level to rule out thyroid problems. I also want to order an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to get a more detailed look at your heart rhythm. Finally, I'd like to order a stool sample to rule out any bacterial or parasitic infections. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Aye, that's a lot of tests. But I suppose it's best to be thorough. So, blood tests, an ECG, and… a stool sample? Right. No, I don't think I have any questions about what you’re wanting to do. Just… how long will it take to get the results back? And will I need to come back again, or…? I don’t drive anymore, you see, so getting back and forth to the clinic is a bit of a bother.
DOCTOR: The lab work should be back within 24 to 48 hours. The ECG results are usually available immediately. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and call you with the findings. We'll discuss the next steps at that time. You may need to come back for a follow-up appointment depending on what the results show. If the blood tests are significantly abnormal, or if the ECG shows a serious arrhythmia, I may refer you to a cardiologist for further evaluation. Depending on what’s going on, that may require an echocardiogram or other more advanced testing. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or severe abdominal pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I understand. Chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or bad stomach pain – go to the emergency room. Got it. So, these tests… will they involve a lot of poking and prodding? I’m not a fan of needles, you see. And the… stool sample? Is there much to it? I just need to know what to expect. It's just that… well, I like to be prepared, you understand.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will require a small blood sample from your arm, it's a standard procedure. There will be a brief pinch, but it's usually over quickly. The stool sample involves collecting a small amount of your stool in a container, which the nurse will provide to you with detailed instructions. It’s not pleasant, but it’s a simple process. It’s best to follow the instructions carefully to ensure accurate results. The nurse will walk you through everything step-by-step, and you can ask her any questions you have. She’s very good at explaining things. Do you have any other concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. As long as the nurse explains everything clearly, I should be alright. And if I get any bad news, you'll call me, right? Not just send a letter? I prefer talking to someone, if you don’t mind. It's easier to understand things that way.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I will personally call you to discuss the results, not just send a letter. I understand your preference for talking things through, and I'll make sure to take the time to answer any questions you have. I’ll have the nurse come in and provide you with the lab requisitions and instructions for the stool sample. She'll also schedule a follow-up call with me. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and rest as much as possible. If anything changes, or if you feel worse, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a wee bit, knowing you're taking this seriously. It's good to know someone is looking after me.
