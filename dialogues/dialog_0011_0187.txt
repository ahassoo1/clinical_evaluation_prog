DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning. Sobkowicz. Just… chest. Hurts sometimes. And… heart goes bump-bump-bump. Doctor, you fix, yes? I no have time for this. Wife make me come.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Sobkowicz. “Chest hurts sometimes” and a fast heartbeat – we can certainly take a look at that. It's good your wife encouraged you to come in. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this chest pain?
PATIENT: More? What more you need? It hurts. Like… pressure. Here. <points vaguely to chest> Not always, you understand. When I… when I get upset. Or after I eat too much. Wife says I eat too much. She always says that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it feels like pressure in your chest, and it seems to come on when you're feeling stressed or after meals. Does the pain radiate anywhere – does it travel to your arm, neck, jaw, or back, perhaps?
PATIENT: Radiate? You mean… go somewhere else? Sometimes. Left arm… feels funny. Like… pins and needles. Not always though. And… jaw. But maybe that’s just my teeth. Old man problems. <shakes head>
DOCTOR: Alright. Pain in your left arm, feeling like pins and needles, and sometimes in your jaw. That’s helpful information, Mr. Sobkowicz. Now, when you say “sometimes,” could you give me a sense of how often this chest pain happens?
PATIENT: How often? Hmph. Not every day. Maybe… two, three times a month? Hard to say. I busy man! Run things. Emergency… important things. No time to sit and count heart bumps.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Sobkowicz. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate. Even with a busy schedule, it's important to address these symptoms. To get a better understanding, could you describe what you're typically doing when the pain starts?
PATIENT: What I doing? Everything! Work, fix things, yell at people… sometimes eat. Like I said. Usually when… when someone give me trouble. Or… when I try to sleep. Then I worry about tomorrow. All the things.
DOCTOR: So, it sounds like stress and worry are significant factors. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: High… what? Doctor, you talk too much fancy. Blood pressure, yes. Wife always nagging about that. Says it’s too high. Give me pills. I take them. Sometimes. <shrugs> Cholesterol… no idea. Never ask me about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, and you take medication for it sometimes. And we’ll check your cholesterol today. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Long time ago. When I was young man. Appendicitis. That’s all. No surgeries. I strong man. Don’t need surgery. <flexes bicep weakly>
DOCTOR: Good to know, Mr. Sobkowicz. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Family? Hmph. Father… died old. Mother… same. No heart problems that I know of. Everyone just… died of old age. No use worrying about that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Sometimes I take… little white pill for sleep. When I really can’t sleep. Wife gives it to me. <shrugs> Don't know what it is. Something for nerves, she says.
DOCTOR: Okay. A little white pill for sleep when you're having trouble. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Korean food, American food… everything. Never have problem. Never.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’m just taking a look at your records here... I see your last blood pressure check was a few months ago and was a little elevated. It also looks like you’ve had some routine blood work done in the past. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your pulse and blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I have things to do. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. If you could please sit back and relax, it will only take a moment. <I proceed to listen to his heart and lungs, noting any abnormalities. After a moment, I sit back and document my findings.> Your heart sounds… regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's not necessarily cause for concern, but we’ll want to investigate it further. Your lungs are clear. Now, let's check your pulse and blood pressure. <I measure his pulse and blood pressure and record the results.> Your blood pressure is elevated today – 160/90. Your pulse is also a bit rapid at 88 beats per minute. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing angina—chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart. However, we need to do some more testing to confirm that diagnosis. I’d like to order an EKG and some blood work to check your cholesterol levels and other markers of heart health. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Angina? What is… angina? More tests? Doctor, you keep saying tests. I told you, I busy! But… wife will yell if I say no. Fine. Do your tests. Just… tell me quick when I can go.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Sobkowicz. Angina is chest pain that happens when your heart muscle isn't getting enough oxygen-rich blood. The tests will help us determine the cause of your chest pain and the best way to treat it. We'll start with an EKG, which is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. Then, we'll take a blood sample to check your cholesterol and other important levels. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn't take long. Once the results are back, we'll discuss them and create a plan to manage your symptoms. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and stress, and if you experience chest pain, stop what you’re doing and rest. <I pause briefly.> Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… get it done. And tell me when I can leave. My wife… she make me soup. She good cook.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. The lab technician is ready for you now. Once you’ve completed the tests, please return to me, and we’ll discuss the next steps. I anticipate having the results back within a few hours. I will call you with the results as soon as they are available, but if you do not hear back from me, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. <I offer a polite smile.> Thank you for your patience, and please let me know if you have any questions or concerns before you leave.
PATIENT: Fine. Let's go. <starts to shuffle towards the door> Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowicz. The lab is just through that door, and the technician will take excellent care of you. Please let them know if you have any questions or concerns. <I offer a final, reassuring smile.> Thank you, and have a good afternoon.
PATIENT: .
