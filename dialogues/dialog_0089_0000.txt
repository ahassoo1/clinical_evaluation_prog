DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's...it's my legs. They just feel weak. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a really nasty cold. Not a fever, thankfully, just a lot of congestion. But then, boom. Like jelly. It's quite inconvenient, honestly. I lead tours, you see, and you can't really lead a tour when you can barely stand.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness in your legs that started a few days after a cold. I understand that's impacting your work, which is frustrating. Just to clarify, when you say “like jelly,” can you describe that sensation a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t I know it. Frustrating is an understatement. And yes, “like jelly”...it's hard to explain to someone who hasn’t experienced it. It's not painful, exactly. It’s just...they don’t feel solid. Like there’s no strength in them. When I try to stand up, it’s like I'm pushing through water. And they feel…heavy? I don’t know. It’s not normal. I've never felt anything like it. It's just… unnerving.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just a feeling of weakness, heaviness, and instability, like pushing through water when you stand. It’s good you’re recognizing that this isn’t normal. Do you notice it's worse at certain times of the day, or with specific activities other than standing?
PATIENT: Well, it seems a bit worse in the mornings, definitely. I have to really concentrate just to get out of bed. And walking any distance is…a challenge. Not that I’ve been doing much walking, naturally. I wouldn't subject my clients to that. But even just getting to the kitchen is tiring. And honestly, just the thought of it makes me anxious, which probably doesn’t help. It’s all very…deflating.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse in the mornings, and with any walking. Anxiety makes sense with this. Let’s talk a little bit more about your medical history. Have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never. And I’ve traveled extensively, Doctor. You’d think I’d have picked something up along the way, but no. I've always been quite healthy, to be frank. Good genes, I suppose. And I'm very particular about what I eat and drink. I don't understand where this is coming from. It feels…undignified. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no previous episodes like this, generally healthy. Good to know. Any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think...nothing major, no. I had my tonsils out as a child, that's about it. A very routine procedure. And I broke my wrist once, skiing, years ago. But that was a long time ago and healed perfectly. Nothing that would possibly be relevant now, I assure you. I’ve never even been hospitalized for anything serious. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, a healed broken wrist. No hospitalizations. What about your family?
PATIENT: My family? My mother lived to be 95, quite a feat, really. She was very robust. My father had some heart trouble later in life, but nothing dramatic. And my sister...well, she’s perfectly healthy, thank goodness. A bit of a worrier, but physically, she’s fine. No history of anything neurological, if that's what you're asking. We’re a sturdy bunch, generally. This…this feels like a fluke.
DOCTOR: Alright, good health history in your family as well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don’t believe in all that pharmaceutical nonsense, frankly. I prefer to let my body heal itself. A little rest, a bit of good food, that's all one needs. I take a multivitamin, occasionally, just to be on the safe side, but that's it. Absolutely nothing for any kind of condition. And I certainly don’t go around popping pills for every little ache and pain. It's simply unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional multivitamins. And you mentioned you recently had a cold. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. I thought I was allergic to cats when I was a child, but I haven't had a reaction in years. And I get a little sniffly during pollen season, but it's nothing a tissue can't handle. Nothing serious, I assure you. Definitely not the type to require medication or anything like that. I prefer to avoid those things if possible, as you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild possible cat allergy as a child, and seasonal sniffles. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I want to check your strength, reflexes, and sensation. Can you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Though, I must say, I'm not terribly fond of examinations. It feels rather…invasive, doesn't it? But, alright. Here I am. Try to be quick, Doctor. I have a tour scheduled for tomorrow, you know. I can’t afford to be laid up.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Ms. Firestone, and I'll be as efficient as possible. First, let’s just check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Good. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always had rather strong hands. I’ve had to be, you see, navigating all those tours and dealing with…certain types of tourists. There. Is that sufficient? It feels a bit…patronizing, checking my strength. It’s perfectly adequate, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good strength. Now, can you push your feet against my hands like you're pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor. Must we? It feels rather undignified. There. Is that…acceptable? It's a little difficult, you know, feeling so…unstable. And frankly, I'm not terribly coordinated when I'm being prodded and poked.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. Now I’m going to check your reflexes with this little hammer. Reflexes are a bit diminished on both sides. And finally, can you tell me if you feel this when I touch here, and here?
PATIENT: Oh, really. Yes, I feel that. And yes, I feel that too. It’s…unpleasant. It doesn't mean anything, does it? Honestly, I've always had rather sensitive skin. It’s probably just…normal sensitivity. Are we finished now? I must say, this is all rather alarming. I’m starting to feel quite faint. Is there a chair I could sit in? This table is most uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. Let’s stop there. I understand your discomfort. I'm seeing some decreased strength and diminished reflexes in your legs. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some post-viral weakness. Sometimes, after a cold or other infection, the nerves can be temporarily affected. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and inflammation. Also, an MRI of your spinal cord would be helpful to look for any underlying nerve compression or other issues. Would you be able to schedule those tests?
PATIENT: MRI? Blood work? Honestly, Doctor, this sounds…excessive. And expensive, I presume? I told you, it's just a bit of post-viral weakness. A few days of rest and a healthy diet should do the trick. I really don’t see the need for all these…invasive procedures. Are you certain this is necessary? I have clients, you know. I can't just disappear for days undergoing tests. Perhaps a prescription for some muscle relaxants would suffice? Or… a strong vitamin supplement? I really think you're overreacting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone, and I wouldn't recommend these tests if I didn't think they were important. While it could be simple post-viral weakness, the diminished reflexes and the degree of weakness you're experiencing warrants further investigation to rule out more serious causes, such as nerve damage, spinal cord compression, or other neurological conditions. Ignoring those possibilities could lead to a delay in treatment and potentially more significant complications. I want to ensure we’re being thorough and safe. I can write a referral to a neurologist for a consultation. They can review your case and determine the best course of action, including whether or not further imaging and blood work are necessary. In the meantime, I can prescribe a multivitamin with B12, as that can support nerve health. However, it's crucial to get a professional evaluation to determine the underlying cause of your weakness. Would you be open to seeing a neurologist?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, you’re making me quite anxious now. A neurologist? That sounds…serious. Are you suggesting I have something… dreadful? I really don't appreciate this. I came in here for a simple weakness in my legs, and now you’re talking about…scans and specialists. It's quite upsetting, actually. Very well. A consultation. Just a consultation. I'm not promising anything beyond that. I still maintain it's just a bit of post-viral fatigue, but… alright. Write your referral. But I expect a clear explanation of everything, and I want a second opinion if this neurologist suggests anything drastic. And I want it to be someone…reputable. I don't want to be subjected to unnecessary procedures just to line someone’s pockets.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. I understand your anxiety, and I’m happy to write a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly respected neurologist at Suburban General Hospital. She’s known for her thorough evaluations and conservative approach. I’ll also include a note detailing your concerns and preference for a second opinion. I'll also give you a prescription for a high-dose multivitamin with B12, as we discussed. It won't fix the underlying problem, but it can support your overall nerve health. Now, while you wait for your neurology appointment, please monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any new symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, difficulty with bowel or bladder control, or worsening weakness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here are your prescription and referral information. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Hmm. Dr. Evelyn Reed, you say? I’ll have to look her up. And I suppose monitoring my symptoms is sensible enough. But honestly, I’m still convinced this is all a bit of an overreaction. No, I don't believe I have any further questions at this time. I suppose I'll schedule an appointment with this Dr. Reed, though I’m not optimistic. And I sincerely hope this doesn’t interfere with my tours. Thank you for your time, Doctor. Though, I must say, this hasn't been a particularly reassuring experience.
