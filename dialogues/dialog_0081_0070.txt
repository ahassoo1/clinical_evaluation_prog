DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. Good morning to you too, Doctor…Paulino, yes? I… just moved here. New place. Need to… see a doctor, I guess. Medicare said I should. Old lady at the office. Very…efficient. Not much for explaining, though. Just a number. That's all.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Medicare is quite thorough in their recommendations. So, aside from establishing care – and I appreciate you coming in for that – is there anything specific you’ve been experiencing that prompted them to suggest a visit, or anything bothering you currently?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Life bothers me. Always. But… physically? Not so much. I work with… faces. Makeup. Theatrical things. Lots of people. Sometimes long hours. That’s… tiring. But aches and pains? Everyone has aches and pains at my age, no? I don’t… complain. Not my style. What do you want to know, exactly? You ask too many questions.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. It's good you're generally healthy. However, establishing care requires a comprehensive understanding of your health, even if things feel "normal" to you. It helps me establish a baseline and recognize changes should they occur. Let's start with the basics then. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Conditions? Oh… well, there was… something with my stomach, years ago. Back in Russia. But it was… nothing. Doctors poked and prodded. Gave me some pills. It went away. I don't even remember what it was called. Something…itis? No, that's not right. My ex-wife, she always knew these things. But… she’s ex for a reason. Don't ask about her. It was a long time ago. Probably doesn't matter now, does it? Just old man problems.
DOCTOR: "Something-itis" isn’t particularly helpful, unfortunately. Do you recall approximately when this stomach issue occurred?
PATIENT: Hmm… A long time. Very long time. Before… the divorce. Yes, definitely before the divorce. Maybe… twenty years ago? More? Time… it all blends together, you know? I was younger then, thinner. And… angrier. She… she was very demanding. Always complaining about something. Oh, and I had a different beard. A very bushy beard. It was… a phase. What does my beard have to do with my stomach? Are you a beard expert now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Szmyd, I am not a beard expert. I simply attempt to establish a timeline of events. Twenty years ago… alright. And did this stomach issue require any surgery or hospitalization?
PATIENT: Hospital? No. Definitely no hospital. I hate hospitals. Smell of…everything. And the people. Always sick people. No. Just pills. Lots of little pills. Pink ones, I think. Maybe white. Or blue. It was a long time ago, like I said. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. Everything is a blur. Honestly, Doctor, I don't think it was very serious. If it was serious, I would remember, wouldn’t I? Are we getting anywhere with this? It feels like you're fishing.
DOCTOR: We are attempting to establish a complete medical history, Mr. Szmyd. It’s standard procedure. To clarify, you were treated with oral medication for a stomach problem approximately twenty years ago, with no surgery or hospitalization. Is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Oral medication. Yes. Pink pills, probably. Or maybe blue. Whatever. It went away. I’m perfectly fine now. Always have been. Always will be. Look, I’m a busy man. I have faces to paint. Shows to prepare for. Are you going to do something, or just ask me about old pills forever? I thought doctors fixed things, not just talked about them.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to surgical history then. Have you ever undergone any surgical procedures, regardless of how minor?
PATIENT: Surgical… Hmmm. Let me think. There was… a wisdom tooth. A very long time ago. When I was… young. And… they removed a mole. On my back. I think. My ex-wife insisted. Said it looked suspicious. She was always suspicious of everything. It was small. Very small. Local anesthetic, I think. Didn’t even feel it. Just a little…snip. That’s it. No big surgeries. Definitely not. I’m not the surgical type. I prefer… art. Much less invasive, you know?
DOCTOR: Wisdom tooth removal and a mole excision. Approximately when did these procedures occur?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake, Doctor. You really want dates? This is ridiculous! The tooth… maybe thirty years ago? Before the ex-wife, even. Different beard then, too. A very pointy beard. And the mole… probably fifteen years ago. When she… started getting really worried about everything. She read a lot of magazines, that woman. Always convinced I was dying of something. Honestly, I think she enjoyed the drama. It was exhausting. Why do you need to know all this? It’s not like it’s important now, is it? I’m perfectly healthy, I tell you!
DOCTOR: While you feel healthy, establishing a timeline is crucial. It allows me to assess any potential risks or complications. We are simply gathering information, Mr. Szmyd. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are you aware of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… Family history is… complicated. My mother… she complained a lot. Everything hurt. But I never knew what it was. Old age, probably. She lived a long life, though. Very long. And my father… he drank a lot. Vodka, mostly. Didn’t seem to bother him much. He was a… strong man. Very stubborn. As for heart disease or cancer… I don’t remember anyone having those things. Maybe. It was a long time ago. I didn’t pay much attention to their health. I was too busy… with my own life. Honestly, Doctor, my family wasn’t very forthcoming about these things. Secrets, you know? Russians are good at secrets. It’s probably not very helpful information, is it?
DOCTOR: It is what it is, Mr. Szmyd. We will proceed as best we can. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no allergies. Never had them. I eat everything. Drink everything. I'm Russian, you know. We're a hardy people. Maybe a little… sensitive to disappointment. But not allergies. Absolutely not. I’ve tried all sorts of things. Exotic fruits, strange fish… nothing bothers me. Honestly, Doctor, I think you’re starting to insult me. Are you implying I'm… weak? I’ve survived a lot worse than a little food allergy. Now, are we done yet? I have a very important appointment. Faces to paint, remember?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Szmyd, I am not implying anything of the sort. It's simply a standard question. One final question for now. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Medications… hmmm. Let me think. Old lady at Medicare gave me… something. For my… blood pressure, I think she said. Little white pill. Take it every morning. That’s it. Nothing else. Absolutely nothing else. Vitamins? Supplements? No. I eat well. Drink well. I don't need fancy pills. Just that one little white thing. Honestly, Doctor, I think that’s it. Can we please be done now? I'm starting to feel… agitated. Faces won’t paint themselves, you know. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Szmyd. I have a reasonably complete, if somewhat…fragmentary, history now. You mentioned a medication for blood pressure. Do you happen to know the name of it?
