DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Scobie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. I want… uh… test for my people, long time ago. For knowing where I come from. DNA, they call it? My daughter, she say I should do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your daughter suggested you come in for a DNA test, to learn more about your ancestry?
PATIENT: Yes, that right. Ancestry. She say it can tell you who you are, where your family come from, before… before everything. I never know much about them, long, long ago. Just Marshall Islands, that’s all. But she say test can show more.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very interesting. While we don't routinely offer DNA ancestry testing here at the clinic, I can definitely see why your daughter suggested it. It can be a really valuable way to learn about your family history. Just to be clear, are you experiencing any health concerns at all that brought you in, or is this solely for ancestry purposes?
PATIENT: No, no health problem. I feel okay for old man. Just want to know my story. No sickness, no pain. Just… curious, you know? My daughter, she always like knowing things. I try to be like her. So, test for my story, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know you’re feeling well. So, this is primarily about exploring your ancestry then. I can certainly point you in the right direction for getting that done. Unfortunately, we don't have the facilities here to perform those tests ourselves. There are several reputable companies that offer at-home DNA ancestry kits. Have you heard of any, like 23andMe or AncestryDNA?
PATIENT: Uh… names sound familiar, but I don’t remember. My daughter, she use computer all the time. She tell me names, but my brain… it forget easy now. I don’t know which one good, which one safe. That’s why I come here, you know? You doctor. You know these things.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s smart to ask your doctor before using those services, as you want to make sure you’re using a reputable company and understand what the results mean. Both 23andMe and AncestryDNA are generally considered safe and reliable, but they do have different focuses. 23andMe also offers some health-related genetic information alongside ancestry results, while AncestryDNA is more focused on building a family tree. I can print you out some information about both companies, including their privacy policies and what kind of data they collect. We can also discuss any concerns you have about genetic testing in general. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be good, Doctor. Very helpful. I don't understand privacy policy. My daughter say they take your spit, then know everything about you. Is that true? I don’t want them knowing everything. Just want to know where my family come from, not… everything else.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Scobie. It is true that they collect a DNA sample from your spit, and with that DNA, they can learn quite a bit. However, both companies have privacy policies in place to protect your information. They generally won't share your raw genetic data without your explicit consent. The biggest thing to be aware of is that the results are stored in their database. It’s generally de-identified, meaning your name isn't directly linked to the data, but it could potentially be used for research purposes. I can show you the specific details of their privacy policies – they’re a bit lengthy, but we can go through the main points together. It's also important to know you can choose not to participate in research studies. Here’s some information about both companies. We’ll start with 23andMe…
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Thank you, Doctor. Long time ago, people no worry about these things. Just family, island, that's all. Now so many… rules, information, everything. This writing… very small. My eyes not so good anymore. Maybe you can tell me, what 23andMe do with my spit, simple like?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. Let’s break it down simply. When you send your spit sample to 23andMe, they analyze your DNA to tell you about your ancestry – where your ancestors likely came from. They look for patterns in your DNA that are common in certain regions of the world. They also provide information about certain genetic health predispositions – meaning your chance of developing certain conditions, but it's important to remember this isn't a diagnosis. It just indicates a slightly higher or lower risk. They store your DNA information in a secure database. You have control over whether they share that information with research partners, but they do use it to improve their services. Essentially, they're using your DNA to learn more about ancestry and health, and they promise to protect your privacy, but it's good to be aware of what they're doing with the data. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… So they look at my spit, then know where my people came from… and maybe… if I get sick? My daughter, she always say knowing is good. But knowing too much… maybe scary. What about AncestryDNA? Is that same like 23andMe? Or different? I want to know which one just tell me about my family, not tell me about sickness. Maybe just family tree like she say?
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair concern, Mr. Scobie. You're right to be cautious about what information you're comfortable sharing. AncestryDNA is a bit different from 23andMe. While they also provide ancestry information, their main focus is on building your family tree. They help you connect with relatives who have also used their service and find historical records about your ancestors. They do offer some genetic health reports as an add-on, but it's optional. You don't have to purchase those reports if you're not interested. So, if you're primarily interested in learning about your family history and not about your health risks, AncestryDNA might be a better fit. They also have strong privacy policies in place and give you control over your data. Here's some information about AncestryDNA. You can see here that they really emphasize connecting with relatives and researching your family's past.
PATIENT: Okay… so AncestryDNA is more for finding family, not for telling me if I get sick. That good. My daughter always talk about great-grandparents, cousins… things like that. What about… cost? How much money these tests cost? My pension not so big. I don’t want to spend too much money, just to know where my family come from.
DOCTOR: That’s a very practical question, Mr. Scobie. The costs vary a bit depending on whether there are sales or promotions, but generally, both 23andMe and AncestryDNA cost around $99 to $199 for the basic ancestry tests. 23andMe’s health reports are an additional cost, usually around $49 to $99 extra. AncestryDNA also has options for adding historical records and more detailed reports, which will increase the price. Right now, AncestryDNA is having a sale for $99, which includes the basic ancestry test and access to historical records. 23andMe is currently priced at $129 for the basic ancestry test. I can show you their websites if you’d like, so you can see the exact pricing and what’s included in each package. Here are their websites. You can see the details of each package and compare the costs yourself.
PATIENT: Okay, let me see… $99… that not so bad. My daughter can help me look at family tree if I get this. But… she say need to send my spit in the mail? Is that safe? What if they lose my spit? Or someone steal it? I hear stories about these things. My daughter, she always say internet is dangerous.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Scobie. You're right to be cautious about sending your DNA sample through the mail. Both 23andMe and AncestryDNA use secure packaging and shipping methods to protect your sample. They’re very careful about maintaining your privacy and preventing unauthorized access. The sample is barcoded and tracked, so they know where it is at all times. However, it is true that there's always a small risk of loss or theft when sending anything through the mail. Both companies have procedures in place to address these situations, such as sending you a new kit if your sample gets lost or damaged. They also use encryption to protect your data online, and they don't share your personal information with third parties without your consent. It's still important to be careful about protecting your privacy online, such as using a strong password and being aware of phishing scams. Here’s their security information. You can see here that they take your privacy very seriously and have measures in place to protect your data. They also have a customer support team that can answer any questions you have about security.
PATIENT: Hmm… Okay. They say safe, they say secure… Maybe… maybe I ask my daughter. She know more about these things. She can read all the small writing, and she can make sure they not steal my spit. Thank you, Doctor. You help me a lot. I think I have enough information now. Maybe I just try AncestryDNA, if my daughter say okay.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was my pleasure to help. That sounds like a good plan – consulting your daughter is an excellent idea. If you have any further questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a wonderful day, and I hope you enjoy learning more about your family history. .
