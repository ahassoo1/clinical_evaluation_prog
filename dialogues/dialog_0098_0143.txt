DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s a bit… complicated, I think. My… someone I care about, she… wants to have a baby. And I thought it was a good idea to… check things first. Make sure everything is okay, you know? It’s been a long time since… well, since I thought about these things. I’m not sure what I need to do.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s very responsible of you to think ahead and get things checked out. It has been a while for many people. So, to clarify, you're wanting to ensure you are healthy enough for potential fatherhood?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Me. I… I want to be sure I’m okay. Not… not her. Though, of course, she is important too. But I’m the… older one, you see? I worry about… things. Like, if I can even… you know. Is that… does that make sense? I don’t really know what they check for these days.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Verrall. It's very common to have those concerns, especially with time passing. We'll certainly look into everything. We'll want to go over your medical history – past illnesses, surgeries, any medications you're taking, allergies – and then do a physical exam. We might also need to do some blood work. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, alright. I… I don’t love needles, but if it’s important, I can do it. I think… I had the chickenpox when I was a boy. And I broke my arm once, falling from a tree. A long time ago. As for medicine… not really. Nothing regular. Just… maybe something for a headache now and then. I’m not sure if that’s important. I don’t remember much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No regular medications, and just a history of chickenpox and a broken arm. We’ll definitely note those. And don’t worry about the blood work – we’ll get through it. Before we move on to the exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s… difficult. My father… he had… problems with his heart, I think. He was a smoker. And my mother… she lived a long life, but she had… aches and pains, you know? Old age things. I don’t really know about… grandparents and further back. We didn’t talk about it much. I’m sorry. It’s… a bit hazy. Is it important to know everything?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s very common for families not to have detailed medical histories. Knowing about your father’s heart problems is helpful, and that’s a good starting point. It's not essential to know everything, but it can sometimes give us clues. Do you know if anyone in your family had diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. High blood pressure… maybe? My father was always a bit… grumpy. But I don’t know if that’s related. He liked salt, a lot of salt. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had something with her… nerves, I think. She shook a lot. But that was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to her. I'm really not sure. I wish I could remember more, but it's… just gone. It feels like a different lifetime.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. You’ve given me some good information to work with. We can proceed even with some gaps in the history. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked. Don’t drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And definitely no drugs. I… I don’t like those things. Never have. I work hard, I like to eat good food, and I sleep well. That’s about it. A simple life. Is that… good enough? I worry about being too old for all this. I want to be a good… you know. A good father.
DOCTOR: That is good enough, Mr. Verrall. A healthy lifestyle is excellent, and it’s wonderful that you’re thinking about this so responsibly. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I… I get a bit itchy sometimes with certain fabrics, wool mostly. And… bees. I think I’m allergic to bee stings. I got stung when I was a boy, and it swelled up quite badly. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major. I can eat anything, thankfully. My someone… she's a very good cook. And I like to try everything!
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. So, no known drug allergies, sensitivity to wool, and a bee sting allergy. Now, let’s move on to the physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a general examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Sounds… fine. My heart… I hope it’s alright. I haven’t had it checked in a long time. Go ahead, Doctor. Do what you need to do. I’m a bit nervous, but I trust you.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur – it’s often harmless, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any abnormalities. I'm also going to check your reflexes and test your strength. Just relax your arms and legs as I ask.
PATIENT: Reflexes… alright. I’m not very good at relaxing, I warn you. I always worry about things. Go ahead, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please? My muscles aren’t what they used to be. I used to be very strong, working in… well, never mind. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon with age, but still within a normal range. Your strength is also a little reduced, but adequate. Everything seems generally okay, Mr. Verrall, but given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur, I'd like to order some blood work and an electrocardiogram to get a more detailed look at your heart function. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work… again? And… what was that other thing? Electro… something. It sounds… complicated. Is it expensive? I don't have… insurance, you see. I’m a bit worried about the cost. But if it’s important… if it’s to make sure I can… you know… then I’ll do it. Just tell me how much it will be.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Verrall. The blood work will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and other important markers. The ECG is a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart – it helps us to identify any irregularities. Let me check the approximate costs for you. The blood work will be around $150, and the ECG is approximately $80. We also have a social worker available who may be able to help you explore options for financial assistance. Would you like me to connect you with them?
PATIENT: $150… and $80… That’s… a lot. But if it’s to be sure… alright. I’ll do it. Yes, please. Connect me with the social worker. I don’t like to ask for help, but I… I need to be responsible. And I want to be a good… you know. A good father. So, what happens next? Do I need to fast before the blood work? And when can I have the ECG?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Verrall. I'll have the social worker reach out to you shortly. For the blood work, yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. And the ECG can be done right here in the clinic after your blood work. It only takes a few minutes. Does that timing work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that’s fine. 8:00 AM. No food… I can do that. I’m a bit of a breakfast person, but I can skip it for one day. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I still worry, but I feel a little better knowing what needs to be done. Is there anything else I need to do before tomorrow? Or any questions you have for me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I’m glad I could help ease some of your worries. No, there's nothing else you need to do before tomorrow. Just remember to fast. And no, I don’t have any further questions at this time. We’ll review the results together once they're available, and we can discuss the next steps then. Here’s a slip with the instructions for the blood work and the appointment time. Do you have any other concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Bombara. You’ve been very kind and patient with an old, worried man. I suppose… I just hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. It was my pleasure. Try not to worry too much – we’ll get all the information we need. And remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Have a good evening, and I’ll see you tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM.
