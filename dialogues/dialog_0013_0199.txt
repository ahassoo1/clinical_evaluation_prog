DOCTOR: Hi Marquie, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It's… my breathing. It’s been kinda short lately. Like, I get winded really easily. Honestly, it’s hard to explain exactly when it started, just… recently, I guess. It’s been worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. "Recently" can mean a lot of different things, so let’s try to narrow that down. Has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think? Yeah, gradual. It didn't just happen one day. It’s just… gotten worse little by little, over… weeks, maybe? I'm terrible with dates, sorry. It’s just been harder to do things, you know? Like climbing stairs.
DOCTOR: No worries at all about the dates—we'll figure it out. Okay, so gradually worsening over several weeks. And you mentioned climbing stairs – are there any other activities that you've noticed are becoming more difficult with your breathing?
PATIENT: Um… yeah. Walking any distance, really. Even just… carrying groceries from the car. Things I used to do without even thinking. And… sometimes, even talking. Like, if I get excited or try to say a lot quickly, I have to pause to catch my breath. It’s… frustrating. My wife keeps telling me to slow down, but… I dunno. It's just there.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, exertion definitely makes it worse – walking, carrying things, even talking. Any chest pain or tightness that comes with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain… not really pain, exactly. More like… a feeling of pressure? Sometimes. Not always. It’s hard to describe. It's not a sharp pain, it’s… uncomfortable. It comes and goes. Like, if I’m really trying to breathe, I feel it. But most of the time, it’s just the shortness of breath. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. And have you noticed any coughing, wheezing, or any fever or chills with this?
PATIENT: Coughing… a little bit. Not a bad cough. Just… sometimes in the mornings. No wheezing that I’ve noticed. And no fever, no chills. Definitely not sick, I don't think. Just… breathless. It’s just… worrying me, you know? I haven't felt right for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a more complete picture, have you had any recent illnesses – even a cold or the flu – in the past few months?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Uh… maybe a cold, back in… April? Or March? It wasn’t bad, just a little sniffly, lasted a few days. Nothing major. I don’t really remember being sick sick recently. Honestly, my memory’s not the best. My wife usually handles all that stuff when I get a cold, so I forget the details.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, pollen, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never been really allergic to anything. No rashes, no swelling, nothing like that. I eat pretty much anything. My wife always jokes I have an iron stomach. I haven’t taken any new medications recently, either. Just… the usual over-the-counter stuff for headaches sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And finally, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she used to, but she quit years ago. We both try to stay pretty healthy, honestly. That's why this breathing thing is so weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, no smoking history, no known allergies, no recent major illnesses or new medications. Alright, Marquie, I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, and then I’d like to check your oxygen saturation. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just take a few deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. I'm going to listen to both your front and your back. Okay. Deep breath… and again… Your heart sounds normal, but I do hear some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, mostly on the left side. It's not severe, but it's definitely there. Let’s check your oxygen saturation now. Okay, your oxygen is 95%, which is within normal limits. But the wheezing is concerning. I’m going to ask you a few more questions, then we’ll talk about some possible causes and next steps. Have you been exposed to any dust, mold, or chemicals recently, perhaps at home or work?
PATIENT: Dust… mold… chemicals? Um… at work, sometimes. I work at the water treatment plant, so… yeah, there’s always stuff around. Cleaning products, things like that. Not usually a problem. I wear a mask when I need to. At home… not really. We keep things pretty clean. My wife's a bit of a neat freak. But… now that you mention it, we did some painting in the spare room a couple of weeks ago. Maybe that?
DOCTOR: Okay, painting could definitely be a factor. And the work environment too. Given the wheezing, your recent painting, and your work at the water treatment plant, it sounds like this could be related to some level of airway irritation. Do you have any family history of asthma or other lung conditions?
PATIENT: Asthma… hmm. My… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, I think. He had some trouble breathing when he got older. But I don't know if it was asthma, exactly. Just… old age, I guess. No one else that I know of. My mother was healthy as a horse, and my father… he always worked outdoors, never had any lung problems. So, not really, I guess. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, possible mild family history, but nothing definitive. Given your symptoms, the wheezing I heard, and your exposure to potential irritants, it’s possible you’re experiencing some degree of occupational asthma or reactive airway disease. It's also possible it’s just a temporary irritation from the paint. I’d like to start with a trial of a bronchodilator inhaler to see if that helps open up your airways. We can also do a peak flow test today to see how well you can exhale. If your symptoms don’t improve, or if they get worse, we may need to consider some further testing, like a pulmonary function test or an allergy test. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… that sounds good. An inhaler sounds… I dunno, helpful, I guess. A test… whatever you think is best. I just… I want to feel normal again. I wanna be able to walk up the stairs without getting winded. So, yeah. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. Let’s do it. I just… how long does this stuff take? I have to pick up my wife from work later…
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Let's get you started. The peak flow test is quick—it just takes a few breaths. And I’ll show you how to use the inhaler properly. It shouldn't take more than 20-30 minutes total. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment in a week or two to see how you’re doing. If things don’t improve, then we can discuss the possibility of further testing. We'll take it one step at a time. How about we start with the peak flow test?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Let's do the test. The sooner I can figure this out, the better. I’m ready when you are. Just… tell me what to do. I’m not really good with medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, Marquie, no worries at all. It’s very simple. I just need you to take a deep breath in, as big as you can… and then blow into this mouthpiece with one strong, fast puff. Don't worry about how loud it is, just blow as hard as you can. We'll do it three times and take the best reading. I’ll stand here and guide you. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, here goes nothing. Is that right? Did I do it okay? It felt… weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a good start! Your reading was 350. Let’s do two more, just to get a consistent result. Remember, deep breath in, and one strong puff. Okay, so your best reading is 370. That’s a little lower than expected for your age and height, but it’s not drastically low. It could be due to the mild wheezing I heard. Now, let's talk about the inhaler. This is a bronchodilator, which means it will help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. I’ll show you how to use it properly, and we’ll practice a few times. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good. So, 370 is… bad? Is that why I'm so breathless? And… okay, show me the inhaler. I want to make sure I do it right. I'm terrible with these things. My wife always handles the medicine.
DOCTOR: 370 isn't bad, Marquie, it's just a little lower than the average for someone your age and height. It could definitely be contributing to your breathlessness, especially when combined with the wheezing. It’s also important to remember that these numbers can fluctuate. Alright, so here's how you use it. First, shake the inhaler well. Then, breathe out completely, as if you’re fogging up a mirror. Put the mouthpiece in your mouth and seal your lips around it. As you start to breathe in, press down on the inhaler once. Keep breathing in slowly and deeply. Then, hold your breath for about 10 seconds. Now, you try it. I’ll watch and make sure you’re doing it right. Remember, shake well, breathe out, press down and breathe in slowly.
PATIENT: Okay. Okay… Shake… Breathe out… Press down… Ugh! That didn't feel right. I think I breathed in too fast. And I coughed. I'm really messing this up. It's harder than it looks.
DOCTOR: It is tricky at first, don't worry! And coughing is very common. You were right, you breathed in a bit too fast. The key is to start pressing down on the inhaler just as you start to breathe in slowly and deeply. Let’s try it again. Okay, shake the inhaler well… good. Breathe out completely… excellent. Now, put the mouthpiece in your mouth… seal your lips around it… and as you start to breathe in slowly and deeply, press down on the inhaler. Slowly… slowly… and hold your breath for ten seconds. That's much better! A little slower on the inhale, and remember to hold your breath. You're getting it! Let's practice a couple more times, and then we can talk about a plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… shake… breathe out… press down and breathe in… hold… That feels a little bit better. Not perfect, but better. I think I'm getting the hang of it. Okay, what’s the plan? Do I just… use this whenever I feel short of breath? And… what about work? Should I wear a mask all the time? I don't want to get fired. It's already hard enough to make a living these days.
DOCTOR: That’s great, you’re doing very well! You picked it up quickly. Okay, so the plan is this: You’ll use two puffs of the albuterol inhaler as needed whenever you feel short of breath or wheezing. You can take it up to four times a day, but try not to use it constantly. If you find yourself needing to use it more than twice a day regularly, that’s a sign we need to revisit the plan. Regarding work, yes, I recommend wearing a mask—an N95 mask—as much as possible, especially when you’re around potential irritants like cleaning products or dust. It’s a good idea to talk to your supervisor about your breathing and the need to wear a mask. You don’t need to go into detail if you don’t want to, just explain that you have some breathing sensitivity and need to take precautions. I’ll also give you a written instruction sheet with everything we discussed. I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in one to two weeks so we can check your progress and see if the inhaler is helping. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Mask… okay, I can do that. I'll talk to my supervisor. Hopefully, they'll understand. And the follow-up… yeah, let's schedule that. I think… I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You really helped me a lot. I was really worried about this, and you made me feel a lot better. I appreciate it. I'll go get the prescription filled and schedule that follow-up. Have a good day. And… thanks again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marquie. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and I hope you feel better soon. .
