DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. IUzzolino, but you can call me Wendall. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you. I suppose. It's about my… well, let's just say it wasn't a pleasant sight this morning. Blood. In my stool. Not a little, mind you. Enough to be concerning. And frankly, at my age, concerning is the last thing I need.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is concerning, Arbie. I understand your worry, especially at your age. Blood in the stool is always something we need to investigate. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Investigate? Honestly. What is there to investigate? I’m an old man, Wendall. Things wear out, don’t they? It's probably just… something old breaking down. Though, I’ve always been regular, you understand. Never had trouble. This is new. And unsettling. It wasn’t like a little streak, it was… mixed in. Do you understand? Mixed.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Arbie. And you're right to want answers. Even if it is something simple, it's best to rule things out. When you say “mixed in,” can you describe the color of the blood?
PATIENT: Color? Really, doctor? You need to know the color? Well, it wasn't bright red, if that's what you’re after. More… darker. Like… old coffee grounds, I suppose. Though I haven't had coffee in years. It wasn't… shiny. Dull, mostly. And there was… a smell. Not good. Though everything smells bad these days, if you ask me. Everything's gone downhill.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker color, resembling coffee grounds… and an unpleasant odor. That does give me some more information. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits besides the blood?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, I told you I've always been regular! But… now that you mention it… it was a bit… looser this morning. Not diarrhea, mind you. Just… not as solid as usual. And it took me a bit longer in the… facilities. If you catch my drift. I usually don't have to… strain, you know? It just… comes. Now it was… a bit of an effort. Though I'm not complaining, I’ve always been a strong man. Still am, for that matter.
DOCTOR: Alright, looser stool, a bit more effort to pass… Thank you for sharing that with me, Arbie. And you are a strong man, it sounds like. Now, have you experienced any abdominal pain or cramping along with this?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, no. More of a… discomfort. A dull ache, if you will. Lower down, mostly. Around the… well, you know. Down there. It comes and goes, really. Not enough to stop me, mind you. I’ve got a high tolerance. But it’s… noticeable. And it’s new. Everything is new lately. Annoyingly new.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache in the lower abdomen, coming and going… Thank you. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or nausea recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I don’t get fevers. Always been able to fight things off. Chills, no. And nausea… well, my stomach’s been a bit unsettled, like I said. But I wouldn’t call it full-blown nausea. More of a… queasiness. Like something isn’t quite right. Though, to be frank, everything isn’t quite right these days. It’s the world, you know? Gone to pot. But that’s beside the point. I haven’t been sick sick. Just… off.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, chills, or significant nausea, just a general feeling of being "off." Now, do you have any history of diverticulitis or inflammatory bowel disease?
PATIENT: Diverticul-what-now? Inflamma-what? Doctor, are you trying to confuse an old man? I've had the usual aches and pains, a bit of arthritis, but no fancy diseases. Never had anything removed, never been hospitalized for anything serious. I’ve always prided myself on my health. Good genes, you see. Haida blood is strong. I just want to know what’s going on with my… situation. Is it serious? That’s what I want to know. Don't give me medical jargon, just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Arbie. I didn't mean to confuse you. Those were just things I needed to ask to rule out possibilities. What you're describing – the blood in your stool, the change in bowel habits, the discomfort – is concerning, and it does require investigation. It could be a number of things, and I don't want to jump to conclusions. Given your age and the fact that you haven't had this happen before, I'd like to do a physical exam and then order a few tests. These tests will help us determine the cause of the bleeding and rule out anything serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… of course. What else are you going to do, just guess? Fine. Do your tests. But I expect a clear explanation of the results, understand? None of that medical mumbo-jumbo. And make it quick, if you can. I haven’t got all day. Physical exam, you say? What does that involve, exactly? I've got a bad back, you know. Don’t go poking around too much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Arbie. Clear explanations, absolutely. And I’ll be as gentle as possible. The physical exam will involve listening to your abdomen with a stethoscope, and gently pressing on it to check for any tenderness. I’ll also do a quick digital rectal exam – that’s where I’ll briefly examine the rectum with a gloved, lubricated finger – to check for any abnormalities. It's standard procedure, and it shouldn't be too uncomfortable, but please let me know if you feel any pain at any point. I will also check your vitals: blood pressure, pulse, temperature. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Digital… what now? A finger? Really? Must you? I suppose… I suppose it’s unavoidable. But be quick about it, doctor. And gentle, you said. Very gentle. I’ve never liked anyone poking around down there. It’s… undignified. Just get it over with, and then let’s get these tests done. What kind of tests are we talking about, anyway? Blood work? Something worse? I’d like to know what I’m in for. And can you promise me you won’t find anything too dreadful? I haven’t got time for anything dreadful.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Arbie. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. It won't take long, I promise. The tests I’d like to order are a complete blood count – that's a standard blood test to check for anemia and infection – and a stool test to check for blood and any signs of infection. We may also need to consider a colonoscopy to get a better look at your colon, but let’s start with these initial tests and see what they show. A colonoscopy requires preparation, so we'll discuss that if necessary. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: More tests… always more tests. A colono-whatsit? Preparation? What does that even mean? Never mind. Fine. Do your tests. Just… don’t tell me I have to drink anything nasty. I've had enough unpleasantness for one day. And please, for the love of all that is holy, don’t find anything serious. I’ve lived a long life. I’d like to keep it that way. Just get it over with, doctor. And be quick. And gentle. Really, really gentle. I'm trusting you here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arbie. I understand your concerns, and I will do everything I can to make this as comfortable as possible. The preparation for a colonoscopy involves drinking a special liquid to clean out your colon, but we can discuss that thoroughly if it becomes necessary. Right now, let’s focus on getting these initial tests done. I’m just listening to your abdomen now. Take a few deep breaths for me… Any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: It's cold. And a bit… ticklish. No, no pain yet. Just… unsettling. Honestly, doctor, you're making me nervous. I can feel your eyes staring at my… everything. It’s rather embarrassing, you know. I haven’t been examined like this in… well, a very long time. Just get on with it, please. And try not to be so… thorough. It’s rather undignified.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm making you uncomfortable, Arbie. I’m just trying to get a clear picture of what's going on. I’ll be as quick and respectful as possible. I'm just pressing gently on your abdomen now. Does this cause any pain or tenderness?
PATIENT: Ouch! There… on the left side. Just a little. Not sharp, but… definitely something. A bit of a dull ache. Like a… bruised feeling. And stop poking! You're making it worse! Honestly, doctor, I'm starting to feel quite faint. This is rather unpleasant, you know. I thought doctors were supposed to help people, not… torture them.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Arbie. I didn't mean to cause you any pain. I’ll be more careful. Okay, tenderness on the left side. That’s helpful to know. It does seem like there's some sensitivity there. I’m going to wash my hands now, and then we’ll discuss the next steps. We'll get the lab orders in for the blood work and stool test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Wash your hands. And get those orders in. The sooner I’m out of here, the better. I’m not sure I can take much more of this… poking and prodding. And please, just give me the results straight. No medical jargon, no beating around the bush. I’m an old man, doctor. I deserve a straight answer. And a little respect, if you don't mind. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: Of course, Arbie. You deserve nothing less than a straight answer and full respect. I promise I’ll explain everything in plain language, and we'll take things one step at a time. The lab orders are in, and the nurse will be in shortly to take some blood. The stool test kit will be given to you with instructions on how to collect the sample. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any severe pain, bleeding, or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I understand this has been unpleasant, and I appreciate your patience. Is there anything else I can do for you at this moment? .
