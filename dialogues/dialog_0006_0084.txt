DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kobler, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It is… a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor Gorga. I… well, I have been finding it difficult to breathe, and my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It has been happening… gradually, I think. It’s hard to say exactly when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Gradual onset…difficult breathing and dry mouth and eyes. Right. Let’s try and pinpoint this a little better. When you say “difficult breathing,” can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Describe… yes. It isn't a sudden shortness of breath, Doctor. It’s more… like I need to take a deeper breath than usual, even when I am resting. It doesn't happen all the time, but it's becoming more frequent. And… sometimes my chest feels a little tight. I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, needing to take deeper breaths, more frequent… chest tightness. That does make sense. And the dry mouth and eyes… is that constant, or does it come and go with the breathing issues?
PATIENT: I believe… it’s more consistent, the dryness. Even when I am not particularly noticing the breathing difficulty, my mouth feels… like sand, almost. And my eyes… they just don’t feel as comfortable as they used to. I carry drops with me, but they only help for a little while. It isn't a sharp pain, if that matters. Just… very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed… yes. Well, my divorce was finalized about six months ago. And… I relocated to the city after that. Before that, I was living in a much smaller town, near the coast. Aside from that… no, not that I recall. I've been trying to keep a regular routine, writing as much as possible, but… it has been an adjustment, certainly. I don’t know if any of that is relevant, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Relocation, divorce…stressful life events, definitely. And a change in environment could be a factor, yes. Okay. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… I do not believe so. I’ve never been formally tested, if that makes a difference. I… haven't had any reactions to anything, as far as I know. Though… now that you mention it, sometimes my eyes feel a little itchy when I’m working outside. But I always assumed that was just dust, or pollen. It doesn't happen often.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I generally avoid medications if possible. I’ve always tried to take care of myself… natural remedies, things like that. I do use those eye drops I mentioned, but they are just for the dryness. Nothing prescribed, if that is what you mean. I haven't needed anything for… well, for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that is a difficult question. My mother passed away when I was very young. And… my father wasn’t really around. I didn’t know much about his side of the family. I believe he had some… heart trouble, but I don’t have specifics. It was… not something that was discussed, to be honest. I don't recall any other significant illnesses in my family, but my knowledge is rather limited. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Kobler. It's not always easy to have that information. Let's move on. Okay. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listening to your lungs, checking your throat, things like that. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly acceptable. Please, proceed. I… trust your judgement. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your lungs, both front and back. Take a nice, deep breath… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Okay. Your breathing sounds… slightly diminished, especially on the lower lobes. Not significantly, but it’s something I want to note. Say “ah”… good. Your throat looks clear. No obvious inflammation. Alright. I'm going to check your heart rate and blood pressure now.
PATIENT: "Ah…" Very well, Doctor. It feels… a little strange, having everything listened to. But I am doing my best to cooperate. I hope it is helpful.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little on the lower side, but nothing alarming. Heart rate is normal. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, and this quick exam, it could be a few things. The dryness, breathing difficulty… it could be related to stress, certainly, with the divorce and relocation. But the diminished breath sounds… that needs further investigation. It could be mild asthma, or… something else. I'd like to order a chest X-ray, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. And a basic blood test to rule out any underlying inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… and a blood test… yes, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. If it will help determine the cause, then please, proceed. I trust your professional opinion. I suppose it is best to be thorough. I do hope it is nothing too serious. But… I understand the need for investigation.
DOCTOR: It's likely nothing serious, Ms. Kobler. But it’s always best to rule things out. Okay, here’s the order for the blood test. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be expecting you. And here's the referral for the chest X-ray. The imaging center is on Elm Street. Once you have those results, please bring them back to me. We can discuss them and figure out a plan. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, and if you feel any worsening of your symptoms—particularly any sharp chest pain, or difficulty breathing at rest—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. Hydrate, and be mindful of any worsening symptoms… I understand. Actually… yes, I do have a question. If it is something like asthma, is that… common for someone my age to develop it? I haven't had any breathing problems before this. And… is it something that can be managed?
DOCTOR: It’s not uncommon, Ms. Kobler, though less typical. Sometimes asthma develops later in life, triggered by things like stress, allergies, or environmental factors. And yes, it’s very manageable. Usually with inhalers and… lifestyle adjustments. We'd need to confirm the diagnosis first, of course, but if it is asthma, it’s something you can definitely live a normal life with. Don't jump to conclusions, though. Let's get the test results first. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that answers my concern. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience. I will schedule the tests as soon as possible and bring the results back to you. Thank you again, Doctor Gorga. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kobler. You take care now. And don't hesitate to call if you experience any changes. .
