DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. My blood pressure’s been…high, the nurse said. That’s why I’m here, I reckon. Been feelin' a little tired too, but mostly just high blood pressure. Don’t really know much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna. High blood pressure, and some fatigue. I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked. Now, when did you first notice your blood pressure being high, or were you told recently by the nurse?
PATIENT: The nurse told me just now, when she took it. I hadn't been told before. I don't usually go to doctors much. Just when somethin' really bothers me, you know? And this…well, she said it was high. Felt normal to me, honestly. I just bake all day, so I figured I was tired from that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the nurse just identified it today during your visit. And you haven't noticed any symptoms yourself—just the usual tiredness from baking. Alright. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I'm ninety years old, Doctor! I’ve lived a long life. I mostly just…keep busy. Baking, mostly. Used to garden a lot more, but it's hard on my knees now. Never had any serious sicknesses, nothin' that needed a doctor for long. A cold here and there, but that’s all. My husband…he had some trouble with his heart, but I don’t…I don’t know much about that either. He’s gone now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Ninety years is wonderful, and staying busy is good. And I'm sorry to hear about your husband. It sounds like you've generally been very healthy. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. Not even for my babies. I had ‘em at home, with the midwife. Good old days, they were. This blood pressure thing…is it serious? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, having those experiences. No surgeries or hospital stays is good to know. And to answer your question, high blood pressure can be serious if it’s not managed, but it's very common, and we can usually control it with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. It's good that we're checking it now. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never been allergic to anything. I can eat just about anything. I use a lot of different things in my baking, you know—wheat, nuts, fruits...never had a problem. Though, my hands get a little itchy sometimes from the flour, but that’s just from the dryin’, I reckon. Not a real allergy, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Just some dryness from the flour—that sounds more like a skin irritation. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my knees sometimes, when they're really botherin’ me. It's… acetaminophen, I think? The white pills. I don’t take it every day, just when I need to. And maybe a little vitamin D in the winter, 'cause I don’t get out in the sun much. Other than that…nothin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, acetaminophen for your knees as needed, and a little vitamin D in the winter. Good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take a look at your overall health. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don’t mind. Been poked and prodded enough in my life. Just try not to poke too hard at my knees! They’re sensitive.
DOCTOR: I'll be gentle, I promise. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Blood pressure is definitely elevated—160 over 95. Lungs sound clear. Let me check your pulse in both your wrists and ankles... Good pulses, a little weak in the ankles, but that's not uncommon. Your abdomen is soft. Now, let's take a look at your knees… A little swelling and tenderness, as you mentioned. Now, is there anything else you’ve been experiencing that we haven’t talked about—any changes in your vision, headaches, dizziness, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it…my vision has been a little blurry lately. Not terrible, just…not as sharp as it used to be. Figured it was just old age. And sometimes, when I stand up too fast, I get a little dizzy for a moment. But that happens every now and then, so I don’t pay it much mind. Shortness of breath…no, not really. I get a little tired when I’m bakin’, but that’s just from all the standin’, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and occasional dizziness when standing up. That's helpful information. It’s good you mentioned those. Given your age, high blood pressure, and the blurry vision and dizziness, I’m concerned about potential complications from the high blood pressure. Now, would you mind if I order some blood work and a quick EKG to check your heart function and kidney function?
PATIENT: Blood work and…an EKG? What’s that? Sounds…serious. Is somethin’ really wrong, Doctor? I just want to keep bakin’, that's all.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Venna. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us make sure your heart is working properly. The blood work will give us a better picture of your overall health and check how your kidneys are functioning—high blood pressure can sometimes affect them. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, but it’s important to rule out any potential complications. Think of it as being thorough. We’re just gathering information so we can create the best plan for you to keep doing what you love—baking. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you think it's best. But please…be gentle. And tell me what's goin’ on, okay? I don’t like bein’ kept in the dark. I just want to keep bakin' my pies. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: I absolutely will, Venna. I'll explain everything to you as we go. And you will keep baking your pies. That's our goal. The nurse will be in shortly to draw some blood and get you set up for the EKG. It won’t take long. In the meantime, I want to talk about some lifestyle changes that can help lower your blood pressure, regardless of the test results. Things like reducing salt intake, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise, even just gentle walking. Does that sound like a good starting point?
PATIENT: Sounds sensible, Doctor. I reckon I could stand to walk a bit more. Used to garden, like I said, but…it's hard on these old knees. And I do love my salt, I ain’t gonna lie. Put it in everything! But…I can try. For my pies. Tell me…what kind of diet are we talkin' about? Can I still have my sweets?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, you can still have your sweets! Everything in moderation is the key. We’re not going to take away all your joys. The goal is to focus on a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Things like lean proteins—fish and chicken are good choices. And limiting processed foods, sugary drinks, and, yes, salt. Instead of adding salt, we can use herbs and spices to flavor your food. It's a gradual process, so don't feel like you have to overhaul your entire diet overnight. Small changes can make a big difference. We can also talk to a registered dietitian if you'd like a more personalized plan. They can help you create a menu that fits your lifestyle and tastes. Now, while we wait for the nurse, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that’s all for now, Doctor. Just this blood pressure business and…tryin' to keep bakin’ my pies. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. You’re a good man. I guess I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venna. I’m glad I could help. And don't worry, we’ll get to the bottom of this. I’ll be right here if you need anything. The nurse should be in shortly. Just try to relax. .
