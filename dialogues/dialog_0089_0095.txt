DOCTOR: Hi Stephane, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburroagh. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t have all day. It’s my ear. It just…stopped working. On one side. And my face feels a bit droopy, you know? It started yesterday morning. It’s rather inconvenient, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time, and we'll try to be as efficient as possible. Ear stopping working and some facial droop…started yesterday morning, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Yesterday morning. Woke up, and it was just…gone. The hearing, I mean. And then I noticed when I was brushing my teeth, one side of my face doesn’t…move quite right. It’s not paralyzed, but it’s definitely weaker. Honestly, it’s very unsettling. I haven’t hit my head or anything. It just happened.
DOCTOR: Alright. No head trauma, that’s good to know. And it was a sudden onset yesterday morning. Any pain with this, Stephane?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little…pressure, maybe, behind the ear, but nothing I’d call pain. It’s more…odd. Like a fullness, if that makes sense. And it’s making me a bit dizzy, but that could be from worrying about it all, truthfully. I don't usually get dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant pain, just a fullness and some dizziness that started with the other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, taste, or swallowing at all?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. My vision is perfectly fine, thank you. And I had a lovely breakfast this morning, so my taste is working perfectly well. Swallowing is…normal, as far as I can tell. Really, it’s just the ear and the face. It’s quite distressing, frankly. I have commitments, you see. I can’t be walking around with half a face not working.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Stephane. Okay, let’s do a quick exam. Could you please sit up and face me?
PATIENT: Fine. Let’s get this over with. I have a very busy schedule, you understand. And please be quick. I really don't have time for…extensive poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to have a look in your ears and do a few quick checks. Smile for me, please. And now, raise your eyebrows as high as you can. And squeeze your eyes shut. Now, stick your tongue out as far as you can. Good. I’m now going to listen to your ears with this instrument. Okay… hearing is diminished on the left side. The facial muscles on the left side are noticeably weaker. There is no visible blockage in the ear canal. Reflexes appear normal. Based on what I’m seeing, Stephane, this could be Bell’s Palsy, but we need to rule out other possibilities. It’s likely a viral inflammation affecting the facial nerve.
PATIENT: Bell’s…what now? Is that serious? And what “other possibilities” are you talking about? Honestly, you’re not making me feel any better. Is it catching? I have a luncheon next week, and I absolutely must be presentable. A drooping face is simply not an option. And what do you do about it? Is it…treatable? I assume you’ll be prescribing something.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths. Bell’s Palsy is a condition where the facial nerve becomes inflamed, causing weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. It's not usually caused by a virus, but it can be triggered by one. It’s usually temporary, but we need to confirm that’s what's happening in your case. "Other possibilities" include a stroke, a tumor, or infection, which is why we’ll likely need some imaging. It’s not catching – you can't spread it to anyone. We'll need to rule those other things out first. I'm going to order a CT scan of your head to get a better look at everything. In the meantime, I can prescribe a course of Prednisone, a steroid, which can help reduce the inflammation. It doesn’t guarantee a full recovery, but it can improve your chances. I also recommend artificial tears for your left eye, as you might not be able to blink fully, and that can cause dryness.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Honestly. All this fuss over an ear. And Prednisone…is that one of those drugs with…side effects? I’ve read things. And this eye business…I suppose I can manage some drops. But a CT scan feels rather extreme. Is there absolutely no other way to determine this “Bell’s Palsy”? I’m rather reluctant to be subjected to radiation, if you understand. And how long will all this take? I have commitments, you see. This luncheon is important.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the CT scan, Stephane. It’s true, it involves radiation exposure, but the benefit of ruling out more serious causes outweighs the risk in this case. It’s a quick scan, and the exposure is minimal. Prednisone can have side effects – things like increased appetite, mood swings, and trouble sleeping – but they are usually mild and temporary. We'll discuss those in detail if you decide to take it. An MRI would be another option, but it’s more expensive and takes longer to schedule, and may not be as effective at visualizing the facial nerve. Without imaging, we can't definitively say it's Bell’s Palsy and rule out other, more concerning possibilities. The CT scan can be scheduled at the hospital radiology department. It typically takes about 30 minutes, including preparation and the scan itself. I can have someone from my office call and schedule it for you today. If it’s Bell’s Palsy, starting the Prednisone as soon as possible is important. Do you want me to proceed with ordering the scan, or would you like to discuss other options further?
PATIENT: Fine. Order the scan. But make it as quick as possible. And I expect a thorough explanation of the results. I don't want to be left in the dark. As for this Prednisone…I’ll consider it. But I want a list of all the potential side effects. And I want to know what the alternatives are, if any. Honestly, this is all very inconvenient. And I still have that luncheon to attend. Ensure the radiology department knows I have a busy schedule. And please, don't make me wait. Time is of the essence.
DOCTOR: Okay, the CT scan is ordered. I’ll have my assistant call you with the scheduling information as soon as possible. Here’s a detailed handout on the side effects of Prednisone. Alternatives are limited for Bell’s Palsy, but physical therapy – facial exercises – can sometimes help. And supportive care – artificial tears, keeping the affected eye covered at night – is important. We’ll review the scan results as soon as they’re available. I'll personally call you with the findings. If it is Bell’s Palsy, and you choose to take it, the Prednisone will be a 10-day course. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Just…get the scan done quickly. And call me with the results. I have commitments. This luncheon… it's very important. I suppose that will be all for now. Thank you. Or rather, thank you for expediting this process. .
