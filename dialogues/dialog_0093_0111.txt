DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, let’s get this over with. It’s… my skin. It’s gotten darker, and I tire so easily. It's quite bothersome, really. I haven't the time for these things, you understand. A man has things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Drahota. It sounds frustrating to have these changes occurring, especially when you have a busy schedule. “Darker skin,” you say. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it's just… darker. You know, less… vibrant. It’s hard to explain to someone who isn’t… discerning. It's not a pleasant shade, I assure you. And the fatigue… simply dreadful. I used to be able to work all day, now I need… rests. Frequent rests. Honestly, it’s quite humiliating. Is there a quick fix for this? Because I truly haven’t the patience for a lengthy investigation.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you describing it to me, Mr. Drahota. It's helpful to understand what you're experiencing. When you say “less vibrant,” has the change been gradual or sudden?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, I haven’t the faintest idea. Time… it all blurs together after a while. Perhaps… gradual? I suppose. It wasn’t a single morning when I woke up looking like… this. It just… happened. Slowly, I think. Though, my memory isn’t what it once was, you understand. Are you writing all this down? Good. Don't bother me with questions about dates. It's a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Drahota. We don't need exact dates. Just a general sense is fine. Now, besides the skin changes and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Well, I’ve been a bit… warmer than usual, perhaps? Nothing alarming. And my appetite… it fluctuates. Some days I eat heartily, others… not so much. It’s likely just old age creeping in, doctor. I’m 85, you know. Things wear down. Is this going somewhere, or are we simply cataloging my decline? I have commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We are certainly working towards understanding what's going on, Mr. Drahota, and I assure you, we're not simply cataloging your decline. The fluctuations in appetite and feeling warmer than usual are useful information. Now, have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Doctor, I haven't stepped on a scale in decades. Honestly, why would I? It’s quite vulgar, really. I eat when I’m hungry, and I don’t eat when I'm not. As for whether I’ve lost weight… I wouldn’t know. I assure you, I’m not wasting away. Now, if you’ll excuse me, is there a test you can simply give me to determine what’s wrong? Something swift and conclusive? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick answer, Mr. Drahota. However, determining the cause of these symptoms requires a bit more information. Since you haven't been weighing yourself, can you recall if your clothes have been feeling looser or tighter recently?
PATIENT: Good heavens, doctor, are you serious? You want me to ponder the fit of my trousers? I have more important things to occupy my mind! This is… preposterous. I dress the same as always. Perhaps a little more comfortable these days, as one does when getting on in years. But that’s hardly a medical diagnosis, is it? Look, are you going to do something or simply interrogate me about my wardrobe? I’m starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem trivial, Mr. Drahota. I assure you, they are all relevant. We're trying to build a complete picture. Since a definitive diagnosis is not possible without further investigation, would you be open to a brief physical examination and some blood work?
PATIENT: Blood work? A physical examination? Absolutely not. I haven’t the time for poking and prodding. And as for blood work… the very thought. Look, I am a busy man. If you can’t determine the problem without resorting to such… indignities, then I suggest you refer me to someone who can. I haven't got time for this. This is a complete waste of my afternoon. .
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Drahota. However, without further investigation, it's difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate care. Given your concerns about blood work and a physical exam, I believe the most responsible course of action would be a referral to a specialist. I recommend Dr. Lin, a hematologist and oncologist, who can further evaluate your condition. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
