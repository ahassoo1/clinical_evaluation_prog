DOCTOR: Right, yes. Sherion Chelberg, 62. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Osga, right? Yes. My chest. It’s been… not good. A pain. Not all the time, but… it worries me. Feels like… a tight squeezing. Mostly when I walk, you know? Like going up the stairs.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A tight squeezing, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, squeezing. Like someone is… holding my chest very firm. Not a sharp pain, never sharp. More… heavy? And it goes away when I stop and rest. It just… comes and goes. It started maybe… two weeks ago, I think. It's hard to remember exactly when. But it’s been happening more lately.
DOCTOR: Two weeks, alright. And it’s brought on by exertion…walking stairs specifically, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, stairs are the worst. But also… sometimes just walking to the mailbox. Not always! Sometimes I walk fine. But when it happens, it’s scary. It feels like I can’t… breathe good when it’s squeezing. Not can’t can’t, but… harder, you know? It makes me stop. My husband, he worries too. He says I look pale when it happens.
DOCTOR: Pale, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, he says I get very white. He’s always watching me, bless his heart. He says my face changes. I don't always notice, to be honest. I just feel… tired and scared when the squeezing starts. It’s not a pain I’ve ever felt before, and I… I worry it’s something serious. I don’t want to… you know… cause trouble. But it’s been happening more, and I thought I should come see you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other symptoms with this…squeezing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… no dizziness. Not really any sweating. Sometimes… a little bit of shortness of breath, even without the squeezing, but that happens sometimes anyway with my… you know… the air. I live near the highway. But nothing else really. No pain in my arm, or jaw, or anything like that. Just the squeezing, and the tiredness. And the worry! That’s a symptom, right? A lot of worry.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I have… high blood pressure, the doctor told me a long time ago. I take a little pill for it every day. And… arthritis in my knees. That’s why the stairs are so hard, you see? It's not just the heart, it's the knees too! And… I had a gallbladder taken out, years and years ago. But that doesn’t bother me anymore. Everything else… I think I’m pretty healthy for my age. Mostly. Except for this chest.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure… what medication are you on for that?
PATIENT: Let me see… the bottle… Oh, here it is. Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, one a day. Every morning with my breakfast. And I try not to miss any, but sometimes… when we travel to visit my daughter… it's easy to forget. But I always remember eventually. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had one. My mother always said I was a strong baby, never got sick. I can take most things, I think. Penicillin, I've had it before, no problem. Nothing bothers me, really. I'm a pretty easy patient, I hope! Except for this worrying, of course. But that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a listen to your chest. And I'm going to check your blood pressure just to be sure. Then we’ll see.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. It's a little cold, isn't it? But that's alright. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 150 over 90. Chest sounds… clear, but there’s a slight… murmur. Not alarming, but worth noting. I’ll need to do an EKG, just to be safe. And probably some blood work. Routine stuff. We’ll see what that shows.
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated, you say? That doesn't sound good, does it? A murmur too? I… I don’t know what any of that means. Is that… bad? The EKG and blood work… is that going to hurt? I’m not very good with needles, Doctor. I get… a little faint sometimes. But I’ll do whatever you need me to, I promise. Just… tell me what’s going to happen, okay? And how long it will take. My husband is waiting in the car.
DOCTOR: It’s… not necessarily bad. Elevated blood pressure requires monitoring. The murmur is… something we need to investigate. The EKG is painless, just some stickers on your chest. The blood work… a little pinch, yes. We’ll get it over with quickly. It will take about… half an hour, maybe a little longer. The nurse will draw the blood. Just relax, and try not to worry. It's routine, I assure you. I’ll order those tests now.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Half an hour… that’s alright. My husband can wait. Just… stickers and a pinch, you say? I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I just want to know… is it my heart? Is it serious? I keep thinking… what if it’s something really bad? My mother… she had a bad heart. But she smoked, you know? I never smoked. But still… it worries me.
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions. We have to wait for the results of the tests before we can say anything definitive. Worrying won’t help. We’ll get this sorted out. Now, the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Try to relax. .
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Right. Wait for the results. Relax. I’ll… I’ll just sit here then. And try… try to relax. .
