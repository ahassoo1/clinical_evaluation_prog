DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's... well, my daughter, bless her heart, she said I should come. Something about… needing to know my blood type? She worries so. I can’t quite recall why it's important, but if she says so... it must be. It’s just a little thing, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Your daughter is concerned about your blood type. Right. And you're unsure why that’s relevant at this time?
PATIENT: Relevant… hmm. No, not really. I mean, I feel fine. Perfectly fine! I haven’t been sick in… well, a long time. She just said it’s good to have the information, you know? In case of… something. My memory isn't what it used to be, so I don't remember what she was talking about. Is it a new thing they’re doing now? Checking blood types for old ladies?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily a new thing, Mrs. Nini, but it’s… prudent. Knowing your blood type is helpful for several reasons. Primarily, it’s important in case of a transfusion. Though you feel well now, it’s always best to be prepared. Let’s start with a little background information. Have you ever had your blood type checked before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Oh, a transfusion… yes, that sounds serious. I… I really don't remember. It was a long time ago, if I ever did. Perhaps when I was very young? I used to travel a lot with my work… rigging, you know? Lots of different places, lots of different doctors… I’m afraid I don’t keep track of these things. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. Was I in Spain? Or… somewhere else?
DOCTOR: Rigging?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! It was… well, it was important work. Moving things. Big things! Ships, mostly. And… and some other things. It required a lot of strength, and a good head for heights. I used to be very good at it. My husband, bless his soul, he was a carpenter. We worked together, mostly. Though he didn’t like the heights so much. It was a good life, a busy life. Not much time to think about… blood types.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s focus on the present. Aside from not knowing your blood type, are you experiencing any symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, no. Nothing at all. Like I said, I feel perfectly fine. A little tired sometimes, perhaps. But that's just… being my age, isn't it? I sleep well enough, eat regular… well, mostly regular. My daughter makes sure I'm eating enough. She fusses over me. But no aches, no pains, no… dizziness or anything like that. Just a little forgetful, which, again, I expect at my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears. It’s just a standard check-up. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A check-up. Yes, that sounds sensible. Is this table… comfortable? My knees aren’t what they used to be. Perhaps I should just sit… but alright, alright. If you say so, Doctor. Be gentle, now.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 145/90. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear, but breath sounds are a bit shallow. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious abnormalities in the oral cavity. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Pulses are weak, but present bilaterally. Everything appears within normal limits, though your blood pressure is a bit high, and your pulses are a little weak. Do you experience any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm. No, not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes they feel… a little heavy, perhaps. But not swollen. My daughter keeps telling me to put my feet up more. She says it's for the circulation. But honestly, I forget half the time. It's hard to remember all these things, you know? Is the blood pressure… bad? She always worries when I go to the doctor. Is it something I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: It’s not immediately concerning, Mrs. Nini, but it's something we should monitor. Elevated blood pressure can lead to other health issues down the line. We'll need to track it over time. Now, regarding your initial concern—determining your blood type—I recommend a simple blood test. It’s standard procedure. While we’re at it, let’s also run a complete blood count. That will give us a broader picture of your overall health. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A blood test… yes, alright. If that's what you think is best, Doctor. Honestly, I just want to get this over with so my daughter stops fretting. She means well, bless her heart, but she does worry so. A blood test… is it painful? I’ve never been very good with needles.
DOCTOR: It’s a very quick and minor procedure, Mrs. Nini. A small prick, really. Most people don’t even feel it. I’ll have the nurse draw the samples. We’ll send them to the lab, and we should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I'd like you to start keeping a log of your blood pressure at home. Nurse, could you please come in and draw some blood for Mrs. Nini?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A small prick… that doesn't sound too bad. My daughter has one of those machines for checking the blood pressure? The one with the cuff? She’ll be happy I’m finally doing something useful. A few days, you say? That's good. Hopefully, it’ll put her mind at ease. I do try to be a good patient, you know. When I can remember.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will explain everything. We'll discuss the results when they become available. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions…? Hmm… no, not really. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I think I’m all set. Just… thank you. For everything. And… tell your nurse to be gentle with the needle, alright? I do bruise easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be as gentle as possible. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort after the blood draw. I’ll see you again when the results are back. That will be all for today, Mrs. Nini.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, I will. Thank you again, Doctor. Tell your nurse I appreciate it, alright? Old knees...
