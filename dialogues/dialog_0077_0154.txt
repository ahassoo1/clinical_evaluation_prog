DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Pirl, was it? Yes. Well, it’s… the waterworks, really. Been botherin’ me. A lot. It's… difficult to explain, honestly. I keep getting these… troubles. Down there. It’s happened a few times now, and it's… unpleasant. I don’t remember exactly when it started, just that it’s been going on for a bit.
DOCTOR: “The waterworks,” alright. And you said this has been happening for a “bit”?
PATIENT: Yes, a bit. Not… not recently recently, but… not ages ago either. A few months, maybe? I really can’t be certain. Time… it just slips away, you know? It feels like it happens when I forget to… drink enough, perhaps? Or when I get a little… chilly. But that might not be it. I truly don't recall.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wease. It can be difficult to pinpoint the exact timing. When this… trouble happens, could you describe what you feel?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… it burns. Down there, when I… go to the bathroom. And it feels like I haven’t… emptied everything, even when I have. It’s uncomfortable, and… urgent, you know? Like I need to go right now. And sometimes… sometimes there’s a little… ache in my lower tummy. It's not a bad ache, just… there.
DOCTOR: Burning with urination, a feeling of incomplete emptying, urgency… and a mild lower abdominal ache. Do you notice any blood in your urine, Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed. Everything looks… normal, I suppose. Though, to be honest, I don’t examine it closely, if you understand. It’s just… not something one does, is it? I’ve just felt… unwell, mostly. And tired. It’s all rather… bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly. No blood noticed, alright. And you mentioned feeling tired. Is this fatigue new, or has it been ongoing?
PATIENT: Oh, the tiredness… it’s been a while, really. But it feels… worse lately, I think. Everything feels worse lately. It's difficult to say what came first, the waterworks or the tiredness. I just… don’t have much energy anymore. I used to be very active, you know. Working on those… those campervans. But now… it’s a struggle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any fever, chills, or pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I’ve noticed. I don't usually take my temperature, you see. And chills… perhaps a little bit, when it’s cold. But that's just me being cold! Back pain… sometimes. But I’m an older woman, Doctor! My back aches all the time. It's probably just… old age. I don't think it's connected to the waterworks. Really, I don’t.
DOCTOR: I understand. Still, it’s important to rule things out. Would you mind if I performed a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? Well… I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. I'm not overly fond of… poking and prodding, but I want to get this sorted, really. It's just… a bit embarrassing, isn't it?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension completely, Ms. Wease. It is a sensitive area, and we’ll proceed with the utmost respect and discretion. We'll just take a look, and listen to your abdomen, and possibly collect a urine sample. It will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. Let’s start by having you lie down on the examination table, if you’re comfortable. And then we’ll do a quick check of your lower abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A urine sample… yes, I can manage that, I suppose. It's all a bit much, isn't it? But if it gets to the bottom of things… very well. Just… be gentle, please. And try not to take too long. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. We will be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to have you provide a urine sample. I’ll leave you a container, and there are instructions in the bathroom. Once you’ve collected that, please let me know, and we’ll proceed with the abdominal examination. Take your time.
PATIENT: Oh… very well. The bathroom… which way is that again, Doctor? My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Just over there, Ms. Wease. Through that door, and it's the first room on the left. Take your time, and let me know when you're finished. I'll be right here. You can sit down if you'd like while you wait.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease, thank you. Now, if you wouldn't mind lying back down on the table, I’ll just listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope.
PATIENT: Oh, here we are. Is it cold? This table… it feels rather cold.
DOCTOR: Apologies, Ms. Wease. Yes, it can be a bit chilly. Hopefully, this will help. Alright, take a few deep breaths for me. In… and out… good. I’m just listening for any unusual sounds. Everything sounds normal, thankfully. No tenderness to palpation either, which is encouraging. Let’s take a quick look at your skin now, just to rule out any obvious signs of infection.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Normal is good, isn’t it? Skin… alright. Though I do get a little rash sometimes. Mostly on my arms. But that’s just… old age again, I expect. Nothing to worry about.
DOCTOR: I see a little dryness and some mild discoloration, but nothing that appears concerning at this time. We can discuss some moisturizing options later if you’d like. Now, Ms. Wease, I’m going to send this urine sample to the lab for a urinalysis. This will help us check for any infection, blood, or other abnormalities that might be causing your symptoms. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back.
PATIENT: Oh, a couple of days… alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. I do have… commitments, you know. Campervans don’t fix themselves.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible. While we’re waiting, based on your symptoms and the physical exam, it's most likely a simple urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, we need to confirm with the lab results. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids—water is best—to help flush out your system. Also, avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Do you have any questions so far, Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: Oh… water, alright. I can manage water. And no caffeine, that’s… difficult, but I can try. But what if it is an infection? What do I do about that? Will I need… pills? I don’t like pills.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question, Ms. Wease. If the lab results confirm a UTI, you would likely need a course of antibiotics—pills, as you suspected. I understand you don’t like taking pills, and we can discuss different options to minimize any side effects. Thankfully, UTIs are usually very treatable with antibiotics. Are you allergic to any medications, by any chance?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. I… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I've taken… things, over the years. For aches and pains, mostly. But nothing… serious. I don't remember having a bad reaction to anything. It's all a bit hazy, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good. In the meantime, Ms. Wease, if you develop a fever, chills, or pain in your back or sides, please go to the emergency room immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious infection. Otherwise, focus on drinking plenty of fluids and we’ll get those lab results back as quickly as possible. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and any necessary treatment. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh… emergency room. I don't want to go to the emergency room. That sounds… dreadful. Yes, alright. A follow-up appointment sounds… sensible. But please, Doctor, don't keep me waiting too long. I have… responsibilities, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Wease. We’ll get you scheduled for the earliest possible follow-up appointment—likely within a few days, once the lab results are back. I'll also send a copy of my notes and the lab order to your home address. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if your symptoms worsen before your appointment. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don’t think so. You’ve been very… thorough, Doctor. I suppose… that will be all for now. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wease. I'm glad I could help. Let me walk you to the door. And remember, drink plenty of fluids and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and we’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. A good day… I hope so. Yes, alright. Goodbye.
