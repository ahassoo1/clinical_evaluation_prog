DOCTOR: Right, Terasa Mayhugh. 59 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been… acting up. It’s hard to explain. Sometimes I just… can’t hear. And then everything spins. It doesn’t last long, but it’s scary when it happens. My daughter, Lani, she told me I should come see someone. She worries, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Acting up” and then not hearing, and dizziness… dizziness is never good. So, it’s both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… I think it’s been both, but it’s… hard to remember which one first. They both feel a bit funny sometimes, you know? Like… muffled. And then the spinning. It’s not every day, thankfully. Maybe once a month, or… less? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. My husband, bless his soul, he always dealt with these things. I’m not very good at remembering details.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, memory isn't always reliable, is it?
PATIENT: No, it really isn’t. Lani keeps telling me I need to write things down, but… well, I just don’t. It all feels a bit… overwhelming, you know? And it’s been happening for a while now. Not new, exactly. Just… there. My family… we’ve had some trouble with ears, I think. My brother had… something, when he was younger. But I don’t remember what. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, intermittent hearing loss and dizziness, possibly a family history of ear issues… Have you noticed any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Hmm… sometimes. It’s not a constant thing, not like a phone. More like… a faint hum. Or a whistle, maybe? It comes and goes. It’s usually when my ears are feeling… funny. Is that normal? I don’t know what’s normal anymore, honestly. Everything just feels… off sometimes.
DOCTOR: Well, tinnitus – that's the medical term for ringing in the ears – can be associated with hearing loss. It's not uncommon. Let's take a quick look at your ears, just to get a baseline. Have you ever had any ear infections?
PATIENT: Ear infections… oh, goodness. When I was a little girl, maybe? A long, long time ago. Nothing recently, not that I remember. Just the usual colds, you know? Nothing serious. Lani worries about everything, so if I had anything bad, she’d definitely know. But… no, I don’t think I’ve had an ear infection in… decades. Is that okay? I feel like I should be more helpful, but my mind just isn’t working properly today.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll just do a quick examination. Open wide, please. I need to take a look inside your ears. This won't take long.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just tell me if it tickles or anything? I’m a bit sensitive, you see. My daughter says I flinch at everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Both ear canals are clear. Your eardrums appear…slightly dull. Not perforated, thankfully, but not as shiny as they should be. Some fluid behind the eardrums. It’s not a large amount, but it's there. This could be contributing to your symptoms. Now, have you been experiencing any nausea or vomiting with the dizziness?
PATIENT: Nausea… sometimes. Not every time, but when the spinning gets really bad, yes. A little bit. It’s not like… throwing up, just… feeling sick to my stomach. And a bit sweaty. Oh, and I get a terrible headache afterwards. It’s usually on the side that’s… worse. Is that making sense? I’m probably just rambling, aren’t I? I’m so sorry. It’s just… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay. Intermittent dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, nausea, headache... It sounds like a possible case of Meniere's disease. But we need to rule out other things first. I'm going to order a hearing test, just to get a baseline of your hearing levels. And possibly an MRI, to rule out anything more serious. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh, goodness. I don’t think so. I haven’t had… anything like that before. I’ve never really been sick enough to need anything fancy. I’m not allergic to anything, as far as I know. Just… old. And a bit forgetful, I suppose. Is that dye… dangerous? My daughter… she’ll be so worried if it’s dangerous. She always worries.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard precaution. The contrast dye helps us get a clearer picture on the MRI. It’s generally very safe, but it’s important to be aware of potential reactions. We’ll give you a questionnaire before the scan to assess your risk. For now, let's focus on getting those tests scheduled. I’m going to refer you to Dr. Sharma, an ENT specialist. He’ll be able to give you a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Dr. Sharma… That sounds good. As long as he’s nice. My daughter, Lani, she always makes sure the doctors are nice. I’m just… tired. All this… talking. And remembering. It's a lot. Can we… hurry it up a bit? I have a bit of an appointment later today. It's just… a hair appointment. But still.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the referral for Dr. Sharma. His office will contact you to schedule an appointment. It might take a week or so. As for getting things done quickly... the tests are standard procedure. We can’t skip steps. I’ll also write you a prescription for some anti-nausea medication, just to help manage the symptoms in the meantime. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh. No, I suppose not. Just… thank you. For everything. I just… want it to be over. It’s all a bit overwhelming, you know? I think I’ll just… go now. Thank you again. And… please tell Lani I’m alright. She worries too much. .
