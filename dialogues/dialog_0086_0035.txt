DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sucich, please have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It’s these hiccups, really. Been going on for… well, a good while now. Not constantly, mind you, but they come and go. Quite annoying, they are! It’s just… unsettling, you know? Never had them stick around this long before.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes. And I do apologize, I probably should have mentioned… it started right after I had a bit of a scare with my grandson, Leo. He tripped at the market and bumped his head. He’s alright now, thankfully! But I think… I think I might have held my breath without realizing when it happened. Could that be it, do you reckon?
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Sucich, sometimes a sudden fright can cause hiccups. It’s not uncommon. But “a good while now” is vague. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, you're right to ask. Specific… let me think. It started… the 27th of July, I believe. Yes, the 27th. That was the day at the market. So, about a week now, on and off. Mostly after I get a little flustered, or excited. Not all the time, though. Sometimes they just… happen. And they aren’t painful, just… startling!
DOCTOR: Alright, a week. And you said they occur after…fluster?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. When I get a bit worked up. Like when Leo is being mischievous, and I scold him, a little bit. Or if I try to rush around too much. I’m not a fast woman anymore, you see. But it's not every time. Sometimes I'll be perfectly calm, and whoop there they are! It's very peculiar.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sucich, with all due respect, hiccups that persist for a week, especially in someone your age… well, it's not usually just “fluster.” While anxiety can play a role, we need to rule out other possibilities. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Other symptoms… let me think. No, not really. I haven’t felt unwell, not a fever or anything. Maybe a little… tired sometimes, but that’s just getting old, isn’t it? And my appetite’s been alright. I’m still enjoying my mangoes, thank goodness! No pain, no shortness of breath… just the hiccups. It’s just… unsettling, like something isn’t quite right, even if I can’t put my finger on it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick examination, then. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll feel your abdomen. It's just a standard check, nothing to worry about, but it's important to be thorough. And I'll check your reflexes. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I always trust your judgment. It's just... I haven't been terribly sick in years, so it feels a bit silly to be fussing over hiccups! But I appreciate you being thorough. Do you need me to do anything special? Like breathe a certain way?
DOCTOR: No, just relax and breathe normally for now. I'll tell you if I need anything different. Heart sounds are… regular. A little diminished, as expected for your age, but nothing alarming. Lungs are clear bilaterally. No wheezing, no crackles. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses detected. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Can you extend your arms?
PATIENT: Oh, very good. I'm glad everything sounds alright so far. I used to be quite a swimmer, you know. Back in Fiji. Strong arms, I had! Not so much anymore, I suppose. But they still work. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll try to stay as still as possible. It's just… I always feel a bit awkward during these examinations. I'm not used to being poked and prodded! But I understand it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… slightly diminished, again as expected. Nothing concerning. Everything seems… normal, Mrs. Sucich. Which, frankly, is perplexing. Persistent hiccups with a completely normal physical exam… it’s unusual. I'm going to order some blood work. Just a basic panel to rule out any underlying issues. It’s routine, really. And I would like to order a chest X-ray, just to be absolutely sure nothing is going on in your lungs.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work and an X-ray? That sounds… rather serious, doesn't it? I was hoping it was just a bit of nerves, or something simple. But if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I’m not terribly fond of hospitals, you see. But I understand you need to be thorough. When do you want me to come back for the results? And where do I go for the X-ray? Perhaps I should bring Leo with me for moral support? He’s quite good at calming me down.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sucich, I assure you, these are precautionary measures. We are simply ruling things out. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. I'm going to give you a requisition for the blood work. You can go to the lab at City General Hospital. They’re open until 5 pm. And the X-ray can also be done at City General, just across the hall from the lab. Come back to see me next week, on Thursday at 2 pm. We’ll review the results then. Bringing Leo is… unnecessary. These are routine tests. But if it will ease your mind, that is your prerogative. I'll write a note for the technicians explaining your anxiety. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Of course. Precautionary. I understand. City General… good, good. I know where that is. And thank you for writing a note about my anxiety. That’s very kind of you, Doctor. No, I don’t think so. Just… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like avoiding certain foods, or… trying to relax more? I suppose I should probably take Leo’s advice and spend less time worrying! He tells me I fret too much. But it’s hard not to, when you get older, you know? Everything seems a bit more… serious.
DOCTOR: Avoid caffeine and carbonated beverages. Those can sometimes exacerbate hiccups. And yes, try to reduce stress. Easier said than done, I know. But there’s really not much else you can do at this point. We'll have a better idea of what's going on after the tests. Don’t worry excessively, Mrs. Sucich. And if the hiccups become unbearable, or you develop any other symptoms – like shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever – go to the emergency room immediately. Alright then. I’ll see you next Thursday.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. No caffeine, no fizzy drinks. I can manage that. And I will try not to fret. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, even if you think I’m just worrying over nothing. I’ll see you next Thursday then. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mrs. Sucich. .
