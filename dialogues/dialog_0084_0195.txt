DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It's not really a problem problem, you understand. Just...well, my sister, she's been feeling a bit down lately. Nothing serious, but she just needs a little… boost, you know? I thought maybe a card from a real doctor would cheer her up more than anything I could say. A “Get Well” or something encouraging. Is that…is that something you do here?
DOCTOR: Hmm. That’s…unusual, but I understand wanting to help your sister. While I don’t typically just write cards, I’m happy to see what we can do. To make sure I write something appropriate, could you tell me a little more about what’s been going on with her?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not that complicated, Doctor. Honestly, she just worries too much. About everything! Her kids, her garden, the price of lentils… it’s exhausting. She’s always saying things like, “Oh, my life is ruined because the tomatoes aren’t ripening fast enough!” It's silly, really. But she gets…down. And I thought, well, a nice card from a professional might make her see things a little differently. You know, lend some… authority to my reassurances. Is that making sense? I don’t want to bother you with a long story.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, she's expressing a lot of worry and seems to be getting upset over relatively small things. Has this been going on for a long time, or is this a recent change?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, a long time. She's always been a worrier, my sister. Even as a little girl, she'd fret over scraped knees like it was a broken leg! But it's…worse lately, I think. Since her husband retired. He used to keep her busy, always projects going, things to do. Now she just…has too much time to think. And think, and think, and think. It's really quite draining, to be around, honestly. Not that I don’t love her, of course. I just thought a card…well, sometimes hearing it from someone else makes a difference, you know? Someone…official.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the increased worry seems to have coincided with her husband’s retirement. Has she mentioned feeling sad or hopeless, or is it more just…constant worrying?
PATIENT: Oh, hopeless? No, not really. She wouldn’t put it like that. She’s a practical woman, my sister. She’d never say she’s hopeless. But she sighs a lot. And she complains. A lot. About everything being too hard, or too much trouble. And she used to love her garden, love it, but now she just stares at it and says it’s all going to weeds. It’s…frustrating, really. I tell her to pull the weeds, but then she says her back hurts! It's a cycle. A very tiring cycle. I just thought a card, a little encouragement… it couldn’t hurt, could it?
DOCTOR: No, it certainly couldn’t hurt. But based on what you’re telling me, it sounds like your sister might be experiencing some symptoms of depression. It's common for people to feel this way after a big life change like retirement, and it’s important to address it. While I’m happy to write a card, I would also strongly recommend she see someone for a proper evaluation. It sounds like more than just needing a little cheering up. Would you be open to discussing that option with her?
PATIENT: Oh, depression? Goodness, no. She's not depressed. She just…needs a hobby. Or a good scolding! Honestly, Doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. She’s a strong woman, my sister. She doesn’t need a doctor. She needs someone to tell her to stop feeling sorry for herself and pull the weeds! A card is all she needs. A nice, encouraging card from a professional. Is that really too much to ask? I’m starting to think I shouldn’t have come here at all. You’re just trying to complicate things.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Janeth. It’s common to want to minimize things, especially when it comes to loved ones. However, dismissing these feelings as simply needing a hobby or a “scolding” could prevent her from getting the support she truly needs. I’m not trying to complicate things, but as a physician, I have a responsibility to consider all possibilities. I respect your wishes, and I am happy to write the card for your sister. But I want to be clear: a card is not a substitute for professional evaluation and treatment if needed. Before I write the card, could you tell me her full name and date of birth, just for my records?
PATIENT: Fine. Her name is Kamala Micucci. And her birthday is… let me think… July 12th, 1958. But honestly, Doctor, I still think you're overreacting. She’s a perfectly normal woman having a bit of a…difficult patch. A card will do just fine. And please, nothing too…sympathetic, alright? Just something encouraging. “Keep your chin up!” or “Things will get better!” Something like that. Not a whole long speech about feelings. She wouldn't appreciate that at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Kamala Micucci, July 12th, 1958. I’ve got it. And I understand, nothing too sympathetic. I’ll keep it brief and encouraging. Just one more quick question, and then I'll get started on the card. Has she been sleeping and eating normally?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well…she sleeps a lot. More than usual, I think. She says her back hurts, so she spends most of the day in bed. And the eating…well, she used to be a wonderful cook, but now she mostly just picks at things. A little rice, a bit of yogurt. She doesn’t have much of an appetite, she says. But she insists she's fine. She always insists she's fine, even when she's clearly not. Honestly, she’s very stubborn. And she hates it when people fuss over her. That's why I didn’t want to bring her here myself. She'd be furious.
DOCTOR: Okay. Changes in sleep and appetite, combined with what you've already told me…it does sound like there's more going on than just a difficult patch. While I respect your wishes regarding the card, I really do encourage you to talk to your sister about the possibility of seeing someone. Even just a brief consultation could be helpful. But, I will write the card as you requested. It will be encouraging and supportive. One moment, please.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…make sure it sounds cheerful. And please don’t mention anything about doctors or…feelings. Just a nice, simple message. She’s a practical woman, my sister. She wouldn’t understand. I’m sure a kind word from a professional is all she needs. Honestly, I’m starting to regret even coming here. It’s all so…complicated.
DOCTOR: Here you go. I’ve kept it brief and positive, as you requested. It reads: “Dear Kamala, Wishing you strength and brighter days ahead. Remember your resilience and all that you’ve accomplished. Take things one step at a time, and know that you are capable of overcoming any challenge. Sincerely, Dr. Belynda Voytek.” I’ve also printed out some information on local resources for senior wellness and mental health, just in case. No obligation, of course. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Janeth?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Thank you. No, that’s all. I think I’ve wasted enough time here already. Honestly, Doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. I’m sure a little encouragement is all she needs. And please, don’t send her any bills. She’ll never forgive me if I have to explain a doctor’s visit on top of everything else.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Janeth. I understand. I won't send a bill. And I wish you and your sister all the best. Please, don't hesitate to reach out if you change your mind about the resources.
