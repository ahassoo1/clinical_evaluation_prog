DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Tkac. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lennie Tkac, as you know. I am here today because I am hoping to be cleared to move into the Meadowbrook Senior Living Facility. They requested a check-up before I can be admitted, you see. A formality, really, but a necessary one, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. A pre-admission physical. Well, that’s… sensible, I suppose. Though honestly, most folks are perfectly capable of deciding where they want to live without needing a doctor’s permission. But alright. Let’s get this over with. Do you have any current medical complaints, or are we just going through the motions here?
PATIENT: Well, I appreciate your frankness, Doctor. No, I don't have any complaints, precisely. I’m eighty-one years old, you understand. Things creak and groan now and then, as they are wont to do. But nothing that keeps me from my baking, thankfully. I still make a mean blueberry pie, if I do say so myself. I suppose Meadowbrook just wants to be certain I don’t require any… specialized attention. Is that what you are asking?
DOCTOR: “Specialized attention.” A delicate way of putting it. Alright. Let’s start with a basic history then. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Dr. Emily Carter, she’s my primary care physician. Been with her for… oh, must be fifteen years now. She’s a good woman. I see her for my yearly check-ups, and occasionally for a touch of the arthritis in my hands. Nothing serious, mind you. She handles all my prescriptions. I believe she sent over my records to you already?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see them here. Dr. Carter is… thorough. Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see... yes, actually. Back in ’78, I had my appendix removed. And… oh, and a repair to a torn rotator cuff about ten years after that. A silly accident involving a stubborn horse, if you can believe it. Aside from those two, no, nothing else. Both were quite some time ago and recovered well, thankfully. Do you need the exact dates, Doctor? I recall them precisely.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright for now. It's good you remember. Now, family history. Any major illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother lived to be ninety-three, a very strong woman. She passed away peacefully in her sleep. My father… he had some heart trouble later in life, a bit of angina, I believe. And my older brother, he had diabetes, though he wasn’t particularly careful with his diet. On my wife’s side… her mother had arthritis, much like myself, and her father had some trouble with his eyesight as he aged. Is there anything specific you are looking for, Doctor? It's been a while since I've thought about all this.
DOCTOR: No, not particularly. Just trying to get a complete picture. Alright. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, bless her soul, she tried a few times when she was younger, but I convinced her to give it up. Not a good habit, you see. And I do enjoy a good beer with my supper now and then, but only one. A little something to wash down the baking, if you understand. Do you need to know how much I drink, Doctor? I assure you, it’s quite moderate.
DOCTOR: I need to ask. It's part of the assessment. How many beers per week, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: Well, when I was still working, perhaps three or four a week. But since I retired, and my wife passed… I've cut back. Now it’s more like… five. Perhaps six on a particularly slow week. I generally have one with my supper, and sometimes another while I’m watching the news. It doesn't affect my baking, I assure you. My hands are steady as a rock. But I understand the need to ask, Doctor. I am an honest man.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not to my knowledge. I've never had a reaction to anything. My wife always said I had a cast-iron stomach. She used to tease me about eating anything she put in front of me. I did have a bit of a sensitivity to dust when I was a boy, but that cleared up years ago. No, no allergies. I can eat shellfish, nuts, anything you can think of. It's a blessing, really. Makes for a wider variety of pie fillings, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll need you to hop up on the table for me. We’ll start with your vitals and listen to your heart and lungs. Just a routine check, don't worry.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Happy to oblige. Just let me know if I need to adjust myself in any way. I might creak a bit, as I mentioned. I haven't been as nimble as I used to be. But I assure you, my heart is still strong. It’s seen a good many years, you see.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 150 over 90. Not ideal. Pulse is a bit irregular, 82 and… yes, there's a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a little labored. Abdomen is soft, a little bit of tenderness in the lower quadrants. Significant arthritis in both hands, some swelling and limited range of motion. Alright. Overall, you appear… your age, Mr. Tkac. But there are some concerning findings here.
PATIENT: Concerning? In what way, Doctor? Is it something that would prevent me from being admitted to Meadowbrook? I understand they have excellent facilities and staff. I was hoping to perhaps get involved in some of their baking classes, if they have any. I still have much to offer, you see. And I am quite capable of caring for myself, despite the… creaks and groans. Could you elaborate on what you mean by “concerning?”
DOCTOR: Well, the elevated blood pressure and irregular heartbeat are significant. The murmur needs further investigation. It could be benign, but it could also indicate underlying heart disease. And frankly, the tenderness in your abdomen is a little worrying. It's not debilitating, but it needs to be ruled out. I’m not saying you can't go to Meadowbrook, Mr. Tkac. But I strongly recommend a full cardiac workup – an EKG, possibly an echocardiogram – and some blood work to investigate the abdominal pain before you make any decisions. I'm also concerned about your… alcohol consumption and how it's affecting your overall health. We need to get a clearer picture before I can sign off on this pre-admission form.
PATIENT: I see. That… doesn't sound very good, does it? A cardiac workup… I hadn’t expected that. My Dr. Carter never mentioned anything about my heart. She always said I was as strong as an ox. The abdominal pain… that comes and goes. I just assumed it was indigestion. I do enjoy a good pie, you see. Perhaps too much pie. And the alcohol… I suppose I do have a bit more than I used to. It's just… lonely, since my wife passed. I understand your concerns, Doctor. I want to be honest with you. I want to go to Meadowbrook. I want to be around people again. But I also don't want to be a burden. Perhaps… perhaps you're right. Perhaps I should get these tests done before making a final decision. Could you write me a referral, Doctor? And could you recommend a good cardiologist in the area? One who… explains things clearly? I'm an old man, you see. I don't understand all the medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Alright. I can certainly write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s excellent, very thorough, and does a good job explaining things to her patients. I’ll also order a full blood panel and an EKG to be done here at the clinic. We'll schedule those for you immediately. Here you are. The referral is for Dr. Sharma, and the requisition is for the blood work and EKG. They'll call you to schedule the appointments. I also strongly advise you to cut back on the alcohol consumption, Mr. Tkac. Even moderate drinking can exacerbate underlying health conditions. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out to Dr. Carter with any concerns. This is a team effort, you see. We need to work together to ensure your health and well-being. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I believe you've covered everything, Doctor. Thank you. Thank you for being so thorough, and for not dismissing my concerns. And thank you for recommending Dr. Sharma. I will schedule an appointment with her as soon as possible. I appreciate your advice about the alcohol, as well. You are right, of course. It’s just… a habit. A bad habit. I will try to break it. For my health, and for the sake of being admitted to Meadowbrook. Well, I suppose that’s all for today. Thank you again, Doctor Todorovich. You’ve been very kind and patient with an old man. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I’ll go bake a pie. Perhaps a blueberry one. It always makes me feel better. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome, Mr. Tkac. And please, follow up with me once you have the results from Dr. Sharma. Have a good day. And perhaps… consider a low-sugar recipe. .
