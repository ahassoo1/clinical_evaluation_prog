DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, that's all. Want to get it over with quick if we can.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I understand wanting to be efficient. This is a standard medical examination for insurance purposes. We’ll cover a bit of your medical history, do a physical exam, and potentially order some routine tests. That will give the insurance company the information they need. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. I work, you know? Long hours at the hotel. Gets tiring. Other than that… not much, really. I try to eat okay. Sometimes it's hard with the job. I guess I'm alright. What kind of things are you wanting to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, thank you. When you say “eat okay,” could you describe a typical day’s diet for me?
PATIENT: Well, breakfast usually isn't much. Coffee, maybe a piece of toast if I have time. Lunch is usually something quick from the hotel kitchen – a sandwich, leftovers sometimes. Dinner… that depends. If it's busy, it’s whatever I can grab – maybe fast food. If I have time, I try to cook something, fish usually, we eat a lot of fish back home. But it's not every night.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And when you say "back home," are you originally from the Marshall Islands?
PATIENT: Yeah, Majuro. Been here… almost twenty years now. It's different, that's for sure. But work's here, you know? Got family here too.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s good you have family nearby. Now, thinking about your medical history, have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven't been to a doctor much, honestly. Just when I have to. Got a bad back from lifting stuff at the hotel, that's been bothering me for years, but never really saw a doctor for it. Took some over-the-counter pain stuff. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never been in the hospital. No surgeries either. I try to stay out of those places, if I can. Everything always seems… complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the pain pills for my back, when it's really bad. Ibuprofen, I think? The regular kind you get at the store. And sometimes a multi-vitamin, if I remember. That's it. I don't really like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife… well, ex-wife… she was allergic to a lot of stuff. But I don't have those problems.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, regarding your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a tough one. Back home, a lot of people… well, things happen. Diabetes, I think? And heart problems. My grandfather… he had a bad heart. And my aunt… she got sick, cancer, I think. It was a long time ago. Things weren't like here, you know? No one really talked about it much. It's hard to say for sure what exactly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s helpful to know what you recall. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds… fine. Just want to get this over with, if you don't mind. The quicker the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I will do my best to be as efficient as possible. Please have a seat on the examination table. Alright, your blood pressure is 142/88, pulse is 78, temperature is 98.6, and your respiratory rate is 16. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but we can discuss that further after the exam. Now, if you could please lie back, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackles in your lower lungs, particularly on the left side. I'll need to listen more closely after you take some deeper breaths. The crackles are still present, but not significant. This could be due to several things. Now, let’s briefly examine your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly noted. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. Just feels… normal, I guess. Like always. Crackles? What does that mean? Is that bad? I don't want anything bad. Just need this insurance thing done, that's all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Putney. The crackles are a subtle finding, and they don’t necessarily mean anything serious. They could be caused by a variety of things, such as mild fluid buildup in the lungs, which can sometimes happen with a cold or even from changes in posture. It's more likely just a minor issue, but it’s something I’d like to investigate a little further to be certain. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. This will help us rule out any potential problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? More tests… Ugh. Look, is it going to take long? I got work, you know? And I really just need this form signed for the insurance. Can’t I just fill it out myself? I'm a grown man. What kind of questions are they even asking?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Putney. I truly apologize for the inconvenience. The insurance company requires a certain level of medical documentation to assess your eligibility, and the chest X-ray is a relatively quick and simple test that provides valuable information. It will take about 10-15 minutes, including the time to get changed and the actual imaging. Regarding the form, it asks about your medical history, current medications, and any previous diagnoses. While you are a grown man and perfectly capable of filling it out yourself, the insurance company requires a physician’s assessment to ensure accuracy and completeness. They need to verify the information and rule out any potential pre-existing conditions. I want to assure you that I'm doing everything I can to make this process as efficient as possible. The X-ray will give us a better understanding of your overall health and allow me to complete the form accurately, which is ultimately in your best interest. Would you like me to explain the X-ray procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Explain it, yeah. But make it quick, please. I got a hotel to run. And people waiting. This is taking too long already.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. The X-ray is a very straightforward procedure. You'll be asked to remove any jewelry or metal objects around your chest and neck. A technician will position you in front of an X-ray machine, and you’ll need to remain still for a few seconds while the image is taken. It doesn’t involve any radiation exposure beyond what you’re exposed to daily from natural sources. The technician will then take a few images from different angles. The entire process should take no more than 5-10 minutes. After the images are taken, they will be reviewed by a radiologist, and I'll receive the results within 24-48 hours. I'll have the technician come in and get you set up. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it done. I don't want to be here all day. Just let me know when I can leave after. And make sure they get the results to you quick. I need this form signed ASAP.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Putney. I understand. I’ll personally follow up to ensure the results are received promptly. I’ll let the technician know you're ready. Please follow him, and he’ll guide you through the procedure. I'll be here to review the results with you as soon as they're available. Don't hesitate to let me or the technician know if you have any questions or concerns during the process.
