DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knock. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Johney Knoch, though everyone calls me just Johney. I'm here… well, I'm here about the smoking. I’m hoping you can help me quit. It’s gotten to be quite a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Johney. It takes courage to address something like this, and I commend you for taking this step. We certainly can explore options to help you quit smoking. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Where to begin… I started, oh, goodness, when I was sixteen. Back in Lithuania, it was… common. Everyone smoked. Just part of growing up, it seemed. Started with just a cigarette here and there with friends, then… well, it just escalated. I’ve been smoking ever since, so… that’s about sixty years, give or take. Mostly cigarettes, though I’ve tried pipes and cigars on occasion. Not much luck with those, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Sixty years is a long time, Johney. And it sounds like it’s been a significant part of your life. Do you currently smoke cigarettes, and if so, approximately how many per day?
PATIENT: Yes, still cigarettes, Doctor. Though I've been trying to cut back, I admit. I used to go through a pack a day, easily. Now… maybe fifteen to twenty a day. It varies, depending on the stress. When the weather is bad, like it has been, it’s more. And after a meal, always. It's a bad habit, I know.
DOCTOR: Fifteen to twenty a day is still a considerable amount, but it’s good that you’ve already started cutting back. That shows dedication, Johney. Have you tried to quit before?
PATIENT: Oh, many times, Doctor. Too many to count, really. Patches, gum, even those… hypnotist things. They helped for a little while, perhaps a week or two, but then… the craving would always come back, stronger than before. I’ve tried going ‘cold turkey’ a few times, too. That was… unpleasant. Very unpleasant. My wife, God rest her soul, she tried to get me to stop for years. Never could stick with it, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve put in a lot of effort already, and I appreciate you being so honest about what’s worked and what hasn’t. Those cravings can be incredibly difficult to manage, and it's not a sign of weakness that you've struggled in the past. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, and to ensure we choose the safest approach, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let’s see… I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, makes walking a little difficult on cold days. High blood pressure, been managing that with medication for about ten years now. And… oh, I had my appendix out when I was a boy. Beyond that, not much, thankfully. I’ve always been a fairly active person, even with the arthritis. I used to work on a farm, very physically demanding work. And I've never been a fan of hospitals, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful information, Johney. So, arthritis in the knees, managed high blood pressure, and an appendectomy. Do you know what medication you’re currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I believe it’s… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, twenty milligrams a day. My wife used to handle the refills, so I don’t always pay close attention to the details. I just take it every morning, as prescribed. It seems to be working alright, my doctor has been happy with my numbers, at least. She was very good at keeping track of things, my wife.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Johney. It’s good to know your blood pressure is well-controlled. And I understand it can be difficult remembering details, especially after a loss. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, breathe anything, no problems at all. My wife always said I had a cast-iron stomach. Though perhaps sixty years of smoking has changed that a little. But no, no known allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Johney. Now, before we discuss specific options for quitting smoking, I’d like to ask a few questions about your social habits. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much and how often?
PATIENT: Occasionally, Doctor. I used to enjoy a glass of beer with dinner, especially on weekends. But since my wife passed, I haven’t been drinking as much. Maybe one or two glasses a month, if that. Mostly when I'm visiting with friends. I don't need it, you see. It doesn't… help. It reminds me too much of her, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Johney. It’s understandable that you’ve reduced your alcohol intake. Now, lastly, have you ever worked in any occupations where you were exposed to asbestos, or any other harmful chemicals?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Let me think… On the farm, we used some pesticides, yes. Not a lot, but some. And… before the farm, when I first came to this country, I worked in a factory for a short time. Making… I can't quite remember what, now. Something with metal, I think. There was dust, certainly. A lot of dust. But asbestos… no, I don’t think so. Not that I recall. It was a long time ago, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Johney. That gives me a good overview of your history. Now, would you mind if I performed a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. Whatever you need. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, so I’m sure I need checking up on anyway.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Now, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, though there is some slight diminished breath sound at the bases, which is not uncommon with age. Blood pressure is 140/90, slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range considering your history of hypertension. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’d like to take a look in your ears and throat… and just a quick examination of your neck. Ears appear clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Neck is supple, no enlarged lymph nodes. Finally, I'll just listen to your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, bowel sounds are normal. Overall, your examination is within normal limits for your age and history, Johney. The slightly diminished breath sounds and elevated blood pressure are things we’ll want to monitor, but nothing immediately concerning.
PATIENT: That's… reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you. I always worry about my breathing, to be honest. Never smoked enough to really cause trouble, though. At least, that's what I tell myself. So, what do we do about the smoking? What are my options? I'm ready to try anything, as long as it doesn't involve hypnotists.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about your breathing, and it’s good we checked it. And I completely respect your aversion to hypnotists! There are several options we can explore, Johney. The most effective approach often involves a combination of methods. We have nicotine replacement therapy – patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, nasal sprays – to help manage the withdrawal symptoms. There are also prescription medications, like bupropion or varenicline, that can reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. These medications do have potential side effects, so we’d need to discuss those carefully. Beyond medication, behavioral counseling can be very helpful. This could involve individual therapy, group support sessions, or even a quitline. Finally, there are resources online and in the community to provide support and guidance. Given your history, and the fact that you've tried several methods before, I think a combination of nicotine patches, behavioral counseling, and possibly a prescription medication might be the most effective approach. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible, Doctor. A combination does make sense. I suppose I've been trying to do it all myself for too long. The patches… alright, I can handle patches. I've tried those before, though not consistently. The counseling… yes, that might be good. Talking to someone who understands. The medication… that's what I'm most hesitant about. Side effects worry me. I don't want to trade one problem for another, you see. What kind of side effects are we talking about, with those pills? Are they… serious?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Johney, and it’s important to be fully informed. With bupropion, the most common side effects are things like dry mouth, difficulty sleeping, and sometimes mild anxiety or irritability. More serious side effects are rare, but can include seizures, so it’s important to follow the dosage instructions carefully and let me know if you experience any unusual symptoms. Varenicline can cause nausea, headache, and vivid dreams. There have been reports of some mood changes, like depression or suicidal thoughts, but these are rare and typically occur in people with a pre-existing mental health condition. We would definitely need to discuss your mental health history before considering varenicline. We don’t have to jump into medication right away, Johney. We can start with the nicotine patches and behavioral counseling, and see how you respond. If those aren’t enough, we can revisit the possibility of medication later. Would you be open to starting with that approach?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… much better. Patches and counseling. Let's start there. I don't want to mess with those pills unless absolutely necessary. And if I start feeling… strange, I'll come right back and tell you. I promise. So, what kind of counseling is available? Do I have to go somewhere? Is it expensive? I don't have a lot of money, you see. My wife… she handled all the finances. I'm still getting used to it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Johney. That’s a very understandable concern. There are several options for counseling, and we can definitely find something that fits your budget. There are several free quitlines available, both nationally and locally, that offer phone-based counseling. We also have some low-cost group counseling sessions available at the community health center. And there are some online resources that offer affordable individual counseling. I can provide you with information on all of these options, and we can discuss which one might be the best fit for you. We can also explore potential financial assistance programs if needed. For the nicotine patches, we can start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed. I’ll provide you with detailed instructions on how to use them properly. Would you like me to write down the phone number for the national quitline and the information for the community health center?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be wonderful. The quitline sounds good, and the community health center might be nice, too. Meeting other people who are trying to quit… that might be helpful. And thank you. Really. You've been very patient with me. It's not easy talking about this, you see. It's a… shameful habit, sometimes. I know it's bad for me, but… it's just so hard to stop.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Johney. It takes courage to acknowledge these things, and there's absolutely no shame in struggling with addiction. It’s a very common and difficult challenge, and you've already taken a huge step by seeking help. Here's the information for the national quitline: 1-800-QUIT-NOW . They're available 24/7 and can provide you with immediate support and guidance. And here's the information for the community health center. They offer group counseling sessions on Mondays and Wednesdays at 6:00 PM. The cost is $10 per session, and financial assistance is available if needed. I'll also write down the phone number for their financial assistance department. I'll also give you a prescription for the nicotine patches. Start with the lowest dose, as directed on the package, and gradually increase it as needed. Do you have any questions for me at this point, or anything else you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I suppose it's up to me now, isn't it? To actually try. I'll call the quitline, and maybe… maybe I'll even go to one of those meetings. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve given me hope.
DOCTOR: You've already taken the biggest step, Johney – deciding to quit. And I have no doubt you can do this. Remember, it's okay to struggle, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you today, Johney. And please, take care. .
