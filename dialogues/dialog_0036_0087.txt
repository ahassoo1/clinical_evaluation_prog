DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just... lab work, I think. That's what the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don’t really remember why I need it. Been a lot on my mind lately. Just want to get it done, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. It's common to have a lot on your mind. We can definitely get that lab work done. Just to be sure I have everything correct, do you recall who scheduled the appointment for you, or perhaps what doctor requested the labs?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… I really don't. I think it was my primary care doctor? A nice young man. Used to come to the plant, do check-ups for us. But the name… slips my mind. Everything’s a bit foggy these days, you know? Sorry about that.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Croonquist. Memory can be tricky. Let me check your record here… Ah, yes. It looks like Dr. Ahmadi requested a comprehensive metabolic panel and a complete blood count. He was doing some routine follow-up after a recent wellness check. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Ahmadi… yes! That’s it! Dr. Ahmadi. A good man, a good man. Wellness check… right, right. Something about my… levels? I don't remember the specifics, honestly. But yes, that sounds right. Whatever he asked for is fine with me. Just want it over with, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can get right to it. Just so I have a clear picture, have you been feeling any different lately – any unusual fatigue, changes in your appetite or thirst, any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… not really. Maybe a little achy in my knees, getting old, you know? Appetite’s been… normal, I suppose. Not much of an appetite these days, but that's just me. And tired… well, aren't we all? I work at the power plant, long hours… hard work. So, yes, tired, but that's nothing new.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your urination—more frequent, less frequent, or any difficulty?
PATIENT: Urination… hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe a little more frequent. But, like I said, everything’s a bit foggy. Could be I'm just drinking more water. Hot weather, you know? Don't really pay attention to those things unless something's really wrong.
DOCTOR: That’s reasonable. Increased frequency could be related to the heat and fluid intake. Let’s move on to a quick physical assessment and then get those labs drawn. I'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief abdominal exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, alright? Don't want to be here all day. I got a shift to get back to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: There you go. Hope this doesn't take long.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 145 over 88. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let's check your pulse. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. And finally, your respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute, nice and steady. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? Hurry it up, would you?
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little there. Just a little. Gets tender sometimes. Old injury, I think. Working on the plant… you bump into things. Nothing serious, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Old injury is likely the cause. Just making sure. Everything else feels normal. Now, the labs. I’ve already requested the comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw the samples. They’ll need about two vials of blood. Is there anything you’ve eaten or drunk in the last few hours?
PATIENT: Had a cup of coffee this morning. That’s about it. Don’t really eat much these days. And I haven’t had any juice, soda… anything like that. Just coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the coffee is good to know. The lab results should be back within a couple of days. I’ll have the results sent to Dr. Ahmadi, and his office will contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s it. Just… get this over with. Ready for the blood draw whenever they are. Want to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll let the phlebotomist know you're ready. Just try to relax while they draw the blood. If you feel lightheaded at any point, please let them know immediately. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Croonquist. It was good meeting you. .
