DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. My blood pressure’s been up, that’s what the nurse said. It’s been botherin’ me a bit, makin’ me feel tired easier. Don't really know much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venna. It’s nice to meet you as well. Alright, so the nurse mentioned your blood pressure has been elevated, and you’ve been noticing some fatigue. That’s a good place to start. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this fatigue?
PATIENT: Well, it ain’t like I can’t do things, y’know? I still bake, still keep the house. But at the end of the day, I’m just… worn out. More so than usual, I guess. Used to be able to go all day, now I need to sit down after a few hours. And it feels like it’s gettin’ worse. It’s just…tirin’. Is that makin’ sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Venna. It sounds like you're experiencing a noticeable change in your energy levels, and it's concerning to you that it seems to be gradually worsening. To help me understand this a bit better, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I wake up… usually around 7, sometimes earlier. Have a little coffee, then I start bakin’. I sell pies and breads at the farmers market on Saturdays, so I gotta get a good start on those. I usually bake 'til lunchtime, then clean up a bit. Afternoons I try to rest, maybe read, or visit with my grandkids if they're around. Evenings are quiet. Just supper and TV, mostly. I try to get to bed around 9. Like I said, I'm always movin' somehow. Even restin’ feels like work these days!
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Venna. That gives me a good sense of your daily routine. You certainly keep busy! Now, let’s talk a little bit more about this blood pressure. Do you know what your blood pressure readings have been, or has the nurse shared those with you?
PATIENT: No, she didn't say nothin’ 'bout numbers, just that it was high. I don't rightly understand them numbers anyway. My husband, bless his heart, he always took care of all that doctor talk. I just told him what was botherin' me, and he'd handle it. It’s been a few years since he passed… I just… don't keep up with that stuff. Is it somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: I understand, Venna. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed with medical details, especially after losing a partner who handled those things. And it's perfectly okay to not know the numbers. High blood pressure can be serious if left untreated, but it’s also very manageable. We can definitely get it under control. It’s good you’re addressing it now. Before we move forward, I'd like to ask a few more general health questions, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Had the usual aches and pains as I got older, but nothin' a little rest and liniment couldn't fix. My knees bother me sometimes, but that’s just old age, I reckon. I had the flu a couple times, but that’s about it. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly. Lots of fruits and vegetables from my garden. Never been much of a smoker, and I don’t drink much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Venna. It sounds like you’ve lived a very healthy lifestyle overall. Now, let’s talk about any medications you are currently taking. Are you on any prescriptions or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my knees sometimes. It’s called…glucosamine, I think? Helps with the achin’. And I take a multivitamin every day, just to be safe. That’s it. Really. I don’t like takin’ pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, glucosamine and a multivitamin. Thank you for letting me know. And I understand your preference to avoid medications when possible. Now, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin'. Maybe a little sniffle with pollen in the spring, but that's all. Never been stung by a bee or nothin' like that. My grandkids are always bringin' me different foods, and I usually try everything. They like seein’ me try new things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Venna. No known allergies. One final question about your medical history. Do you have a family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a hard one. My mama… she had somethin' with her heart, I think. She died when I was pretty young, so I don’t remember much about it. And my daddy… he had high blood pressure, I think that's what it was. He was a worrier, always stressed about somethin'. He ended up havin’ a stroke, maybe that’s what took him. It was a long time ago, though. I don’t remember all the details. It runs in the family, I guess. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Venna. It is helpful to know that there’s a family history of both heart problems and high blood pressure. It doesn't necessarily mean you will have the same issues, but it does mean we need to be a little more diligent in monitoring your health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. Just try not to poke too hard, my bones are gettin’ brittle, y’know? Always been a bit fragile.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venna. I’ll be very gentle. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Then, I'll check your pulse and blood pressure. I’ll also take a look in your ears and throat. Finally, I’ll feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's likely benign, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your blood pressure is 158/92. That is elevated. Your ears are clear and your throat looks healthy. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some slight tenderness in your lower quadrants. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, but nothing to be overly concerned about at this time. Alright, Venna. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, your elevated blood pressure is definitely something we need to address. The slight tenderness in your abdomen is something we'll want to monitor, and the diminished reflexes are likely age-related. However, the elevated blood pressure is the most pressing issue. We need to rule out any underlying causes and get it under control to prevent any long-term complications. Would you be willing to get some blood work and an EKG done today?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s a lot. Blood work and… an EKG? What’s that even for? Is somethin’ terribly wrong? I'm gettin’ a bit worried now. I just want to feel like myself again, not poked and prodded and worried about all sorts of things. Is there somethin’ I can just take for it, maybe? Just a little pill?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Venna, and I want to assure you we’re doing this to get you feeling better, not to cause more stress. The blood work will help us look at your overall health, including your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and any potential imbalances. The EKG – that’s a simple test that checks the electrical activity of your heart. It will help us make sure your heart is healthy and rule out any underlying cardiac issues. It's not necessarily that something is terribly wrong, but these tests give us a more complete picture so we can make the best decision about your care. You’re right to ask about medication. There are medications that can help lower your blood pressure. However, before we start you on anything, I want to have the results of these tests so we can choose the right medication and dosage for you. We want to avoid unnecessary medication if possible and address any underlying causes of your high blood pressure. Would you be comfortable proceeding with the blood work and EKG?
PATIENT: Well… I reckon I don’t have much choice, do I? If you think it’s best. But please, be gentle with the needle. My veins ain’t what they used to be. And explain everything to me, alright? I don’t want to be surprised by nothin’. And what’s involved with this… EKG? Do I have to lie down? Will it hurt? I just want to be comfortable.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask questions, Venna. And you always have a choice. We’ll take things at your pace. The blood work will involve a simple blood draw from your arm. The nurse is very skilled at drawing blood, and we’ll make sure you're comfortable throughout the process. She'll use a small needle, and it shouldn't hurt more than a quick pinch. As for the EKG, you will lie down on a comfortable examination table. We'll attach small, sticky pads – called electrodes – to your chest, arms, and legs. These pads don't deliver any electricity; they simply detect the electrical activity of your heart. It's completely painless and takes only a few minutes. You’ll be able to lie comfortably while the machine records your heart’s activity. We'll explain everything to you every step of the way, and you can ask questions at any time. I want you to feel comfortable and informed. Would you like me to call the nurse now to get things started?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, go ahead and call the nurse. But please, tell her to be gentle. And maybe… maybe have a glass of water ready for me afterwards? Gets me a bit shaky, these things. And could you come back and explain the results to me yourself? I don’t want to have to talk to a different person. Just you, alright? I trust you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. I will personally ensure the nurse is very gentle, and I’ve already made a note to have a glass of water brought in for you afterwards. And I will definitely be the one to explain the results to you personally. I understand you prefer to discuss them with me, and I want to make sure you feel comfortable and supported throughout this process. “Hi, Mary?
