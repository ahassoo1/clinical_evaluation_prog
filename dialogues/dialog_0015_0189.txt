DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Rowbottom’s the name. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors, but my daughter insisted. Said I needed to get this… looked at. It’s my, well, my stool. There was blood in it. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to worry her. I feel fine otherwise. Perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Blood in the stool is certainly something we need to investigate, Mr. Rowbottom, even if you feel otherwise. It’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in. To clarify, you said in your stool?
PATIENT: Yes, in it. Not… around it, if you know what I mean. Honestly, it was a bit of a shock. I eat a perfectly good diet – mostly. Steak, potatoes, the usual. Not one of these fancy diets, I can tell you that much. And I haven’t been, well, straining or anything like that. It just… appeared.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no changes in bowel habits – no constipation, diarrhea, or increased effort?
PATIENT: Diarrhea? No. Look, I’m a man of routine. Everything’s… regular. Always has been. And I certainly haven’t been… rushing things along, if that’s what you’re getting at. I’m not one for… medicines that do that. Makes a body weak, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. No laxatives or anything of that nature. And you said you haven’t noticed any abdominal pain, bloating, or nausea accompanying this?
PATIENT: Nausea? Goodness no. I haven’t been sick in… well, I can’t even remember the last time. And my stomach feels perfectly alright. It's just… unsettling, you know? Blood. It’s never a good sign. Though I've lived a long life, seen a few things. Doesn't mean I want to see blood in my… you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any weight loss recently, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now that you mention it… my trousers have been a bit loose lately. Though, to be fair, I haven't been eating as much steak as I used to. It’s expensive, you know? And my daughter keeps trying to get me to eat… fish. Can you imagine? Though I doubt that’s what’s causing this. It's probably just... old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: While it’s possible, Mr. Rowbottom, we need to rule out other causes. Given your age and the presence of blood in your stool, even without other symptoms, it’s important to investigate further. I'd like to perform a physical exam, including a rectal exam, and order some lab work. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Now hold on just a minute. I don't much care for doctors poking around in… well, you know. I came in here because of a little blood, not for a… thorough inspection. And lab work? What kind of lab work? Is it going to be expensive? My daughter will be furious if I run up a big bill.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, a rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating blood in the stool. It allows me to physically assess the area and check for any abnormalities. The lab work – a complete blood count and a fecal occult blood test – will help determine if there’s anemia or further evidence of bleeding. As for cost, I understand your concern. We can discuss options for affordable testing, and I will provide you with a clear breakdown of charges beforehand. However, delaying proper evaluation could have serious consequences. We need to determine the source of the bleeding, and that requires these tests. Are you willing to proceed?
PATIENT: Consequences? Now you’re trying to scare me. Look, I’ve lived a good life. Eighty-eight years, you know. I don’t need you telling me about… consequences. But… alright. Fine. But no poking around for long, and I want a very clear explanation of those charges. And if it's going to take all day, I’m not staying. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. The exam will be as quick and thorough as necessary, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll explain each step before I perform it. We’ll start with an abdominal exam, then proceed to the rectal exam. After that, I’ll order the lab work. The lab results typically take a few days. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood before you leave. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, nothing like that. I eat everything. Steak, potatoes, even the occasional bit of… well, never mind. Just no fish. And don’t go poking around too much, alright? This isn’t a fishing expedition. I'm trusting you to be quick about this. And no surprises with the bill, understand? My daughter will have my hide.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Please lie down on the table, and we’ll begin with the abdominal exam. I will palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. And I assure you, this is not a “fishing expedition,” it’s a necessary medical evaluation.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get on with it. And be gentle, will you? I’m not as young as I used to be, you know. And don't you go telling my daughter I complained. She'll never let me hear the end of it.
DOCTOR: I’m being as careful as possible, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm checking for any areas of tenderness, masses, or enlargement. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oof. There. A little bit there. Not terrible, but… yeah. That's a bit tender. Probably just old age, though. Or maybe too much steak. Don't go blaming my diet, though. It's kept me going this long, hasn't it?
DOCTOR: I see. And what about here?
PATIENT: No, that's alright. Not a thing. Just leave it be. You're poking around too much. Honestly, I thought doctors were supposed to be… quicker about this. And less… thorough.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, a thorough examination is essential for accurate diagnosis. I understand your discomfort, but I need to complete the assessment. Now, I’m going to need you to reposition yourself so I can perform the rectal exam. Please turn onto your left side with your knees drawn up. We’ll proceed as quickly and discreetly as possible. And frankly, your insistence on minimizing the examination is hindering my ability to provide you with appropriate care.
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. A man can't even get a simple check-up without being poked and prodded like a… like a prize-winning pig. Fine. But if you find anything unpleasant, don’t go making a fuss. I don't want a lecture.
DOCTOR: I will explain anything I find, Mr. Rowbottom, in a clear and professional manner. Now, I’m going to gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to check for any abnormalities. This may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. Please relax as much as possible.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Quickly, please. This is… undignified. Absolutely undignified. And don’t go poking around too deep. I mean it.
DOCTOR: I’ve detected some… firmness in the left lower quadrant. There’s also a small amount of occult blood present. The stool is also guaiac-positive, confirming the presence of blood. It’s not a large amount, but it is concerning. We'll need to pursue further investigation, likely a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? What in the world is a colonoscopy? Sounds… invasive. And expensive. Absolutely expensive. I knew it. I knew this would lead to something awful. I should have just stayed home and ignored it. This is all your fault.
DOCTOR: A colonoscopy is a procedure where we insert a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your rectum to examine the entire colon for any abnormalities, such as polyps or tumors. It is the gold standard for diagnosing the cause of rectal bleeding and preventing colon cancer. While it may seem invasive, it's a relatively safe and effective procedure, and early detection is crucial. As for cost, we can discuss payment options. But frankly, ignoring rectal bleeding is significantly more dangerous than undergoing a colonoscopy. I will write a referral to a gastroenterologist and order the necessary pre-procedure tests. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tumors? You think I have… tumors? Goodness gracious. This is a disaster. Absolutely a disaster. I don't want any tubes inserted anywhere. And I certainly don't want to think about… polyps. This is all too much. I need to sit down. I think I'm going to be sick. Get my daughter. She needs to hear this. She'll know what to do. And you… you owe me an explanation. A very thorough explanation.
DOCTOR: I'll have the nurse assist you. She can get your daughter and explain the referral process and pre-procedure instructions. Please remain seated until she arrives. I will document my findings and recommendations in your chart.
PATIENT: .
