DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. MacVittie. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been needing to go to the bathroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, I mean. I can’t seem to go very long without feeling the urge. It’s been going on for a little while now, but it's starting to disrupt things. I don't… I don’t really know how long exactly, to be honest. A few weeks, perhaps?
DOCTOR: A few weeks, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. It's difficult to pinpoint, truly. Things have been… a bit of a blur, recently. I apologize for the vagueness. It's just… a constant feeling, you know? Not painful, not burning, just… frequent. And it’s happening both day and night. It’s just… inconvenient. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: "Inconvenient" is... not a medical term, Ms. MacVittie. But alright. Frequent urination, day and night. Are you drinking more fluids than usual?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. If anything, I’ve been trying to drink less because of it, actually. It doesn’t seem to make a difference. I find myself constantly aware of where the nearest restroom is, which is… not ideal. I’m not sure if that’s helpful. I really don’t recall changing anything in my routine that would cause this. Perhaps it's just… getting older? I'm thirty-one, is that old enough for this to start happening? I feel quite foolish even discussing this.
DOCTOR: Thirty-one is not "old," Ms. MacVittie. Though, frankly, some people seem to think any ailment after twenty-five is a personal failing. Now, let's try to be a little more specific. When you do go, are you emptying your bladder completely?
PATIENT: Oh, um… that’s a good question. I think so? It's hard to tell, isn't it? I try to, of course. But sometimes it feels like… I haven't quite gotten everything out. Not a large amount, just a lingering sensation. I often find myself going again shortly after, which is, frankly, quite frustrating. I don’t want to be rude, but is this something I should be very worried about? I haven’t experienced any pain, fever, or… anything alarming, just the constant need to urinate.
DOCTOR: "Not alarming" is also not a diagnosis, Ms. MacVittie. Alright. Incomplete emptying, frequent re-trips. And no pain or fever, you said. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, changes in the urine… I hadn’t really thought about it. Let me see… It seems normal in color, I suppose. Not dark or cloudy, nothing like that. No blood that I’ve noticed, which I would certainly remember. And the smell… well, it smells like urine. I know that’s not a very helpful answer, but I honestly haven't paid close attention. I really apologize. I'm not very good at this sort of thing. I tend to… block things out when I'm stressed. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: "Blocking things out" isn't a medical assessment, either. Ms. MacVittie, I need you to try to recall details. It's important. No changes in color or smell… Okay. Have you had any recent infections?
PATIENT: Oh, um… recent infections? Not that I’m aware of. I don't get sick very often, honestly. I had a bad cold a couple of years ago, but nothing since then. And no, nothing… down there. I'm divorced, Doctor, if that’s relevant. It's been a few years, so… there haven't been any issues along those lines. I apologize for the personal information, it’s just… I’m trying to recall everything I can. My memory… it’s not what it used to be, I suppose. Is it possible this is just… stress? I’ve been rather preoccupied lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stress is possible, though rarely a sole cause. Let’s quickly review your medical history. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies! Um… let me think. I don’t believe so, not really. I get seasonal allergies, a little bit of a runny nose in the spring, but nothing severe. No medications that I'm aware of cause a reaction. I haven't been to a doctor in quite a while, actually, so this is all rather… new. I'm not insured, which is why I tend to avoid it, if that makes sense. I apologize for being so vague again, Doctor. I wish I had more helpful information to offer. I'm simply trying to recall everything I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies, no regular medications. You said you haven’t been to a doctor recently… any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, um… past medical conditions. Let me see… I had chickenpox as a child, of course, and the usual childhood illnesses. Nothing serious, nothing requiring hospitalisation or… anything like that. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think? And my father had… something with his heart, but I don't recall the specifics. It was a long time ago. I’m perfectly healthy otherwise, as far as I know. I've always been quite active, I try to eat well, although I haven’t been exercising as much lately. I just… I can’t seem to recall anything else significant. I apologize for being so unhelpful, Doctor. This is just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history of hypertension and cardiac issues. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, check your reflexes, and then a quick urine sample. That’ll give us a bit more information to work with. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. A physical exam, of course. Anything that might help. A urine sample, yes. I just… I hope it’s not anything too serious. It’s probably just stress, isn't it? I try not to worry, but… it’s difficult. I appreciate you taking the time, Doctor. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if you think of anything else. I’ll try my best to recall it. Although, I must confess, I'm quite a worrier. And my memory… well, you’ve already noticed. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Drink more water? Less? I’m quite confused, if you don’t mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: For now, drink normally. Don’t restrict fluids or force them. And please, try to relax. Let's get this exam done. Could you please lie down on the table?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Lie down on the table. Right. Just let me know if there’s anything I should be doing, Doctor. I’m quite a nervous patient, I confess. I’ll try to remain still, although I’m afraid I fidget quite easily. And… is there anything I should be telling you while you examine me? Or just… breathe? I'm rather unsure of the procedure.
DOCTOR: Just breathe normally, Ms. MacVittie. Relax. Abdomen is soft, no obvious tenderness. Heart sounds are normal, though a bit elevated. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Now, we'll need a urine sample. I’ll leave you with a collection cup. Please try to collect at least a couple of ounces. I’ll be right outside.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Breathe normally, reflexes normal… a urine sample. Right. A couple of ounces… Yes. I can manage that. I’ll… just call out when I’m finished.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Doctor? I’m finished.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. We’ll send this to the lab for a urinalysis. It’ll take a few days to get the results back. For now, based on your history and the physical exam, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. It could be a urinary tract infection, though you don't have the typical symptoms. Stress and anxiety can cause frequent urination, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, just to get a broader picture of your health.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A urinalysis, a complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel… that sounds… thorough. Is it something serious, Doctor? I understand you need to rule out possibilities, but… my anxiety is quite bad, as you've noticed. And the thought of further tests… well, it’s quite overwhelming. I’m perfectly fine, I assure you. Perhaps it is just stress. Could we not… avoid further testing if possible? I’m not insured, you see, and the expense… it's quite concerning. I apologize for being difficult, but I’m truly worried about the cost. Perhaps we could simply monitor my symptoms for a while? If they worsen, I’ll come back immediately.
DOCTOR: Ms. MacVittie, I understand your concerns about the cost, and I’ll do my best to minimize unnecessary tests. However, completely ruling out underlying medical conditions is important. Ignoring potential problems won’t make them disappear, and it could lead to more serious complications down the line. The blood work is relatively inexpensive, and will give us valuable information. As for the urinalysis… we can delay that for a week, see if your symptoms improve. But I strongly advise against delaying it indefinitely. And frankly, “hoping it’s just stress” isn’t a diagnosis. We need data. I'll give you a referral to a local lab with a sliding scale fee. Will that work?
PATIENT: Oh… a sliding scale fee. That… that would be very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. A week, then, for the urinalysis. And the blood work with the sliding scale fee… yes, I can manage that. I appreciate you taking my concerns into consideration. I truly do. It's just… the anxiety, as you know. It makes everything seem much worse. And the thought of further tests… it triggers it. But… you’re right. Data is important. And I don’t want to ignore potential problems. It’s just… difficult. So, a week for the urinalysis, and I’ll schedule the blood work as soon as possible with the referral you’ve provided. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Avoiding caffeine? Drinking more water? Or less? I’m quite confused, as you’ve noticed. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient.
DOCTOR: Avoid excessive caffeine, drink normal fluids—don’t restrict or force it—and try to manage your stress. Easier said than done, I know. And no, I haven't seen you in a while and I do not know your medical history, therefore I can't know if this is routine. The results will be sent to me, and I’ll contact you as soon as they are available. If your symptoms worsen before then—fever, pain, blood in your urine—go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Avoid caffeine, manage stress, normal fluids… and the emergency room for fever, pain, or blood. I’ve written that down. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don’t think so. Not at the moment. Although… The stress… is there anything you can recommend? Anything at all? Perhaps a referral to a therapist? I’m just… overwhelmed, as you know. And the anxiety is making everything much worse. If you have any recommendations, I would be very grateful. Thank you again for your patience. You’ve been very kind. I’ll schedule the tests immediately. .
DOCTOR: Here's a referral to a reputable mental health clinic. They offer a sliding scale fee as well. It's a good place to start. Alright, Ms. MacVittie. I have other patients waiting. Please schedule your tests and follow up as instructed. Take care of yourself. .
