DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been… forgetting things. Little things mostly, but it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re addressing this, Ms. Heidenthal. Forgetfulness can be concerning, and we want to figure out what’s going on. When you say “little things,” can you give me some examples?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Like, I went to the grocery store yesterday and completely forgot milk. I needed milk for my coffee, and I just… didn’t get it. And then, this morning, I couldn’t remember where I put my keys for a good ten minutes. It's stuff like that. Not huge things, but it's happening more and more.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And has this been a gradual change, or did it seem to start suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It's hard to say exactly when it started, but I'd say over the last… six months or so, it’s definitely gotten worse. It used to be just occasionally misplacing things, now it feels like a few times a week, I’m really struggling to remember something.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are these memory lapses accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like… what do you mean? I haven’t really noticed anything else, no. I sleep okay, I guess. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but everyone feels tired, right? I don't have headaches or anything like that. Is there something specific I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Just to be thorough, I want to ask about things like changes in your mood, difficulty with familiar tasks – like balancing a checkbook or following a recipe – or any problems with your vision or speech. Sometimes those things can be related. Also, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Okay, um… my appetite is okay, I haven’t really lost or gained any weight. I do sometimes get a little frustrated when I can’t remember something, so maybe a bit more irritable than usual? And… I haven’t been doing much cooking lately, to be honest. More takeout. But that’s mostly because I’ve been busy, not because it’s hard. Balancing a checkbook… I mostly do that online, and haven't had any trouble with that. Vision and speech are fine, I think. Oh! Wait. Sometimes I fumble for the right word, but I thought that was just getting older.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. The occasional difficulty finding a word can be normal, but it’s good you mentioned it. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not really. My doctor always says my blood pressure is a little high when I'm at the office, but he hasn't put me on any medication for it. And no diabetes or heart problems. I had pneumonia a few years ago, but I recovered fully. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat well and get some exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. No surgeries, no other hospital stays. Just the pneumonia. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago! I don't think that's relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: No, a childhood broken arm isn't relevant, Ms. Heidenthal. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any instances of memory loss, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she… she got very confused towards the end of her life. I don’t know if it was Alzheimer’s or just old age, honestly. No one really talked about it much. My mother, she's still very sharp, thankfully. And my father… he just died a few years ago, and he was always pretty healthy. So, not that I know of, really. It wasn't something we discussed much in my family.
DOCTOR: I understand. Those things aren't always easy to talk about. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. I don't smoke, I rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while – and I've never touched any drugs. I'm pretty boring that way.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a multivitamin every day, and sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches. But that’s it. Nothing else, really. I try to avoid taking medication whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Heidenthal, thank you for answering all those questions so thoroughly. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you're experiencing some concerning memory lapses, and it’s good you’re seeking medical attention. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical and neurological exam, just to get a better baseline and rule out any obvious causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on, you know? I'm a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and we will do our best to figure this out. First, let’s check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 142 over 88, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6. Slightly elevated blood pressure, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to do a basic neurological exam. This will involve checking your reflexes, balance, coordination, and some simple cognitive tests. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Balance appears stable. Coordination is good with finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests. Cognitive function… I'm going to ask you to repeat three words: apple, table, penny. Please try to remember those. Then, I’ll ask you a few more questions. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Um… it’s 2025, right? Yes, 2025. And… the three words were… apple, table, and… penny. Is that right? I think so.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. And now, can you tell me the current president?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… I always have trouble remembering names. Let me think… is it… Biden? Yes, I think it’s Biden. President Biden.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, can you spell the word “world” backwards?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s tricky… Let me see… d-l-r-o-w? Is that right? I'm terrible at spelling backwards.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Heidenthal. Thank you for completing those tests. Based on the exam and your history, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific cause for your memory lapses at this time. The cognitive testing was within normal limits, however, your concerns are valid, and we need to investigate further. There are several possibilities, ranging from normal age-related memory changes to vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or even early signs of cognitive impairment. To rule out potential medical causes, I’d like to order some blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 and D level. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to do them. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? And hopefully, it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll start with the blood work, and once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They specialize in cognitive function and can perform more detailed testing if needed. In the meantime, I recommend staying mentally active – puzzles, reading, social interaction – and ensuring you have a healthy diet and adequate sleep. I also want you to keep a log of your memory lapses – when they occur, what triggers them, and how frequently. This will be helpful for the neurologist. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds like a good plan. A neurologist… yes, that makes sense. Um… how long will it take to get the blood work results? And… is there anything I should avoid doing in the meantime? Like, should I stop driving or anything like that? I drive to work every day.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions. The blood work results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I’ll have the results sent directly to my office, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. As for driving, at this time, there’s no reason to stop driving. Your concerns are valid, but based on your exam, you don’t present with any immediate impairment. However, it’s important to be honest with yourself and others about your memory lapses. If you begin to experience frequent disorientation or difficulty navigating familiar routes, please let me know immediately, and we’ll reassess your driving ability. For now, focus on the blood work and keeping a log of your symptoms. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that answers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we’re getting things checked out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and provide you with instructions. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please take care.
