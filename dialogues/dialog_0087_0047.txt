DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. I'm Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Soodeen, you said? Yes… well, it’s about… long-term care. My… my wife, she took care of things. Insurance stuff. Now… now I just gotta figure it all out. It's a little confusing, to be honest. I got a letter… said I needed this assessment.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here that you received a notice regarding a comprehensive needs assessment. That’s perfectly alright, it is often confusing. It sounds like this is related to long-term care planning following your wife’s care. We'll go through everything step by step. To start, could you tell me a little more about what specifically is causing you concern?
PATIENT: Concern… hmm. It’s not so much concern now, it’s… remembering what she wanted. She always handled all this. We lived out on the Kenai… a long time. Things are blurry now, you know? She made arrangements… for if… if something happened. I just… don’t recall the details. Mostly, I’m worried about… messing things up. She put a lot of trust in this insurance, and I wanna make sure I don't… lose anything. Is that makin’ sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Rover. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and anxious in this situation, especially after such a loss. It's very common to have difficulty recalling details during times of stress, and wanting to honor your wife’s wishes is admirable. Let's focus on gathering information. Do you recall what kind of arrangements she made – was it a long-term care policy, a trust, or something else?
PATIENT: I… think it was a policy. A long-term care policy, yeah. She talked about… needing help someday. Not just for her, but… for me too. She said somethin’ about… not wantin’ me to be a burden. I remember her talkin’ to a man on the phone. A nice man. He explained things… a long time ago. I think the policy… covered help at home? Or maybe… a place? I really can’t say for sure. It was a lot of paperwork. She kept everything organized. I’m… not good with that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. We can definitely look into that for you. Do you happen to have any of the paperwork related to the policy?
PATIENT: No… I don't, Doctor. I looked… everywhere. After… after she passed, I went through all her things. Tried to find it. I thought I did, at one point, but… it must’ve been somethin’ else. She had a filing cabinet… in the office. But it’s all… mixed up now. I haven’t been able to sort through it properly. It’s… it’s been hard. I just… don’t remember where she kept the important stuff. Maybe the insurance company has a record of it?
DOCTOR: That's a very good point. Most insurance companies maintain records electronically. Let me see what I can find using your name and date of birth. One moment, please. Okay, I've located a long-term care policy under your name with [Insurance Company Name]. It does appear to cover in-home care, as well as some coverage for assisted living facilities. It was originally issued on July 12, 2018. Do you recognize that date?
PATIENT: July… 2018… Hmm. That… that sounds about right. She was talkin’ about gettin’ insurance around then. Said she was worried about… gettin’ older. That was a good year… we took a trip to… Kodiak, I think. Yeah, Kodiak. That date… feels right. But I… honestly, I don’t remember the specifics of gettin’ the policy. She handled it all. Is it a good policy? Will it… cover enough? That's what I'm worryin' about.
DOCTOR: Let's take a look. The policy has a daily benefit amount of $250, and it covers up to 365 days per year. It also includes a three-month elimination period, meaning coverage begins after 90 consecutive days of care. To give you a better understanding of your options, we need to assess your current needs. Do you currently require any assistance with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, or eating?
PATIENT: No… not yet. I manage okay. Still… a little slow, sometimes. But I get by. I can cook for myself, clean… do most things. But… the stairs are gettin’ harder. And… reachin’ things. Small things. I haven’t needed anyone to help me, not yet. But I know… it’s comin’. That’s why I’m here, I guess. Before I do need help. I don’t wanna be a bother. That’s what she always said. "Don't be a bother, Cleo."
DOCTOR: It's good that you're thinking ahead, Mr. Rover. It’s much easier to plan before a crisis occurs. And it’s perfectly understandable to want to maintain your independence as long as possible. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a brief physical assessment. It'll just involve checking your strength, balance, and range of motion. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… a physical assessment? You mean… like, checkin' if I'm strong enough? I… I haven’t been to a doctor in a while. I mostly just… keep busy. But… if it helps figure things out, yeah. Okay. If it’ll help with the insurance, and… and what she wanted, I’ll do it. Just… go easy on me, alright? I'm not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rover. We’ll take everything at your pace. It's a very simple assessment, and I’ll explain each step as we go. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Alright… careful now, it’s a little achy sometimes. Old injury… from when I was workin’ on the boats. A long time ago. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 76, regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Next, I’m going to check your strength in your arms and legs. Could you please squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? I don't wanna break anything. I used to have strong hands… workin’ on the boats. But they ain't what they used to be. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: That’s good strength, Mr. Rover. Not maximal, but certainly adequate. Now, could you please try to stand up from the chair and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Woah… steady now. A little wobbly, I gotta admit. My knees ain’t what they used to be. There we go… one… two… three steps. I feel a little dizzy… maybe it’s just gettin’ up too fast. Is that good enough? I don't wanna fall or nothin'.
DOCTOR: That was good, Mr. Rover, thank you. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little unsteady. And it's good that you're aware of your limitations. I noticed a slight hesitation in your gait and some difficulty with balance, but nothing overly concerning at this point. Now, just to complete the assessment, could you please sit back down and I’ll check your reflexes?
PATIENT: Reflexes? You mean… like tappin' my knee with that little hammer thing? I… I always hated that when I was a kid. But go ahead. I guess it can’t hurt. Just… don’t hit me too hard. I'm an old man, you know?
DOCTOR: I promise, I’ll be very gentle, Mr. Rover. It’s just a quick check to assess your nervous system. Okay, your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally – meaning normal. Everything appears within normal limits for your age and medical history. Alright, Mr. Rover. Based on this brief assessment, you’re functioning relatively independently, but you do have some mild limitations with balance and gait. Your long-term care policy, as we discussed, will cover assistance with activities of daily living if you need it. Do you have any specific concerns about what type of care you might need in the future?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I worry about the stairs. That’s what I'm most afraid of. I live alone now, you know? And fallin’… that’s the worst thing. Maybe someone to help with groceries… and cookin’ sometimes. And… and just someone to check on me. I don’t wanna be a bother… but I don’t wanna end up lyin’ on the floor for days. That’s what I'm worryin’ about. What kind of help can I get? And… and how much will it cost? I just wanna know what my options are. And make sure she… my wife… that she would be happy with what I do.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Rover. Those are all very valid concerns. Your policy does cover in-home care, which could include assistance with those things – help with groceries, meal preparation, and companionship. We can arrange for a care assessment to determine your specific needs and create a customized care plan. The cost will depend on the level of care you require and the number of hours you need assistance each week. I can connect you with a care coordinator who can explain the costs in detail and help you navigate the insurance process. To ensure we're honoring your wife’s wishes, do you have any documentation outlining her preferences for your care, such as a power of attorney or advance directive?
PATIENT: No… not that I know of. She always handled all that stuff. I… I don't remember her talkin' about a power of attorney or anything like that. She just said… she wanted me to be comfortable. And not a burden. That's all I remember. She always took care of everything. I'm just… tryin' to figure things out now. I wish she was here to tell me what to do. I'm sorry… I'm gettin’ emotional. It's hard talkin’ about this.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Mr. Rover. It’s completely understandable to feel emotional, especially when discussing such personal matters. It's a significant loss, and it's natural to grieve and feel overwhelmed. Without a power of attorney, you have the authority to make your own decisions. We can still proceed with the care assessment to determine your needs and create a plan that aligns with your preferences. I'm going to write a referral for a care assessment with [Care Agency Name]. They're a reputable agency in the area, and they can provide a comprehensive evaluation and help you explore your options. Would you like me to also provide a list of resources for grief counseling and support groups?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that would be nice. A list of resources… for grief counseling. I… I haven’t really talked to anyone about it. Mostly just… kept to myself. And the care assessment… yes, please. Anything that will help. I just… want to be prepared. And… and make sure I do the right thing. For her. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And patient. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Rover. I’m happy to help in any way I can. I’ll print out the referral for the care assessment and the list of grief counseling resources for you now. Here you are. The care agency will contact you to schedule an appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I guess… I’ll just take it one day at a time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rover. That's a good approach. Take things at your own pace, and remember that you're not alone. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. .
