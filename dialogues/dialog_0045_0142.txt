DOCTOR: Alright, Jaxston Lawther, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Though…Lawther's the ex's name, really. I dunno why they still have me down for it. It's a bit of a mess, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we can sort the paperwork later. Let’s focus on you for now. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Sorry. Um…headaches. Bad ones. And…sweating. And my heart kinda races when they happen. It's been going on for a while now, on and off. I can’t really…pinpoint when it started, exactly. It just…does. They’re really unpleasant, though.
DOCTOR: "On and off" isn’t terribly helpful, Jaxston. Can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It feels like…maybe the last six months? No, wait…longer. It's hard to say. I was…busy with things, you know? A lot going on. It definitely wasn't happening before that, though. Before…well, before the divorce, definitely not. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Six months, give or take. And these headaches…where do you feel them?
PATIENT: Everywhere, kinda? Like…all over my head. But mostly…around my temples, I guess. And sometimes it feels like a tight band squeezing my head. It’s hard to explain. And like I said, with the sweating and…the fast heartbeat. It's pretty scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: And is there anything that triggers these headaches, Jaxston?
PATIENT: Triggers…that’s a good question. I don't think so? Not that I've noticed, anyway. It just…happens. Sometimes I'm doing nothing, just sitting around, and bam. Other times I’m…moving around, working, I guess. It doesn’t seem to matter. Is that…unusual?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal. Any other symptoms with these episodes?
PATIENT: Uh…not really. Maybe a bit dizzy sometimes, right before it hits. But that could just be…me being clumsy, to be honest. I'm not very graceful. And…sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, but I don't usually actually get sick. Does that make sense? I’m probably not very helpful. It all feels a bit jumbled in my head.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision…hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. Everything looks…normal, I think. I haven’t been to the optician in…years, to be honest. Probably should, but…never got around to it. I don’t think my vision’s changed, though. Everything’s still blurry at a distance, same as always, if that’s what you mean? Is that…bad? I’m really bad at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision isn't helping us narrow this down. Now, any past medical problems?
PATIENT: Not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that healed fine. And…I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox, measles, stuff like that. Nothing serious. No allergies, no ongoing conditions, nothing like that. I'm pretty healthy, usually. Apart from these headaches, obviously. Do you…need a list? I’m probably forgetting something.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I don’t really take anything. I try to avoid it if I can, to be honest. Never been a fan of pills. Just…the occasional painkiller for a bad back, if I’ve been lifting heavy stuff at work, but that’s it. It’s probably not even worth mentioning.
DOCTOR: And what kind of work do you do, Jaxston?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, production work. Just…general stuff. Packing, moving things, that sort of thing. It’s pretty physical, to be honest. Long hours on my feet. It's not glamorous, but it pays the bills. And I’m…relatively good at it, I guess. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It can. Now, family history. Anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm…family history. That’s a tough one. My mum had…high blood pressure, I think. And my grandad had something with his heart, but I don’t remember what. It was a long time ago. No one else that I can think of had anything major. Everyone else seemed pretty healthy. To be honest, we weren't really the type to talk about that stuff. Does that…help? I’m really sorry if I’m being useless. I just…can’t really remember a lot of details.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds…good. Whatever you need to do. I'm happy to help however I can. Just let me know if it's going to be…uncomfortable or anything. I’m a bit of a wimp when it comes to needles, if that matters. Though, you said you weren't giving me any…right? Just listening and checking?
DOCTOR: Just listening and checking, Jaxston. Please sit back and relax. Blood pressure is a little high, 140/90. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Neurological exam is also normal. It doesn't explain much, but rules out some of the more serious concerns.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds…good, I guess? High blood pressure…is that…bad? Is it from stress? I mean, the divorce was…rough. And work’s pretty stressful sometimes. Should I be worried? I’m probably worrying too much, aren't I? I always do.
DOCTOR: It's something we'll monitor. It could be stress-related, but it’s too early to say. We need to rule out other possibilities. Given your symptoms and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I think we should order a few blood tests. Just routine stuff, to check your thyroid, kidney function, and rule out any infection. And I'm going to order an EKG, just to get a baseline reading of your heart's electrical activity.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds…sensible. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests and…an EKG. Is that…painful? I'm really not good with medical stuff, as you’ve probably gathered. And how long will it take to get the results? I have work tomorrow, and…I really need to keep my job, you know? It's just…a lot going on, and I can't really afford to be off sick. Is there anything I should…avoid doing while we wait for the results?
DOCTOR: The EKG is painless, Jaxston. It just involves sticking some electrodes on your chest. The blood tests will be a standard draw, a little pinch. Results usually take a couple of days. As for avoiding things…no strenuous activity until we have the results. And try to manage your stress. Easier said than done, I know. For now, let's get the orders in and get you scheduled. And I'll give you a referral to a cardiologist, just for a second opinion. No harm in getting it checked out thoroughly.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds…okay. No strenuous activity, stress management, cardiologist referral. I can…try. Honestly, I'm just glad you're taking it seriously. It's been…scary, feeling like something's wrong and not knowing what it is. Thank you. Where do I go for the blood tests and…the EKG? And will someone contact me when the results are back? Or do I need to…call you? I’m probably asking stupid questions.
DOCTOR: The lab is across the street, the cardiology office is in the medical building next door. They’ll contact my office with the results. I’ll review them and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. And no, you're not asking stupid questions. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see. Just try to relax, and follow the instructions on the paperwork. .
PATIENT: Okay. Right. Relax. Blood tests. EKG. Cardiology. Got it. Thank you, Doctor Billman. I appreciate your help.
