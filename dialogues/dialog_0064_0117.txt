DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… cough. Yeah, I got a cough. Been coughin’ up… stuff. Red stuff. Not good, that part. I smoke, you see. Always have. Don’t remember much else about it, honestly. Just… want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, a cough, and you've noticed some red… material being coughed up. And you mentioned smoking. Okay. It’s good you brought this to our attention. When did this cough start, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly…? Hmm. A while. A few weeks, maybe? Hard to say. Time… it gets away from me. I just noticed the red stuff a couple days ago, I think. Before that, just a normal smoker’s cough. I guess.
DOCTOR: A few weeks… alright. And has anything changed with the cough recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? Well, it’s… more now. More coughin’, more… red. And it feels… tighter in my chest, maybe? Like somethin’ heavy sittin’ there. Not sure. I don't really pay attention to things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, more frequent and more… productive cough, with some red material, and a feeling of tightness in your chest. We definitely want to get to the bottom of that. Now, besides the cough and the tightness, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… I get tired easy. Always have, but maybe worse lately. And… no, I don't think so. No fever, no chills… I ain't been eatin’ much. Lost a little weight, probably. But that’s just ‘cause I don’t have much of an appetite, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue, decreased appetite, and some weight loss along with the cough. Now, have you noticed any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of… breath? Not really. I get winded walkin’ up hills, but I always have. This town is built on a hill, you know. But… no, not short of breath. Not like… wheezing or nothin’. Just… get tired easy, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's have a listen to your lungs and your heart, and I’ll take a look at your throat just to get a better picture. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… get it over with, if you don't mind. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, just breathe normally for me, in and out. Okay. I’m hearing some… diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs, and a slightly irregular rhythm. Nothing too alarming at this point, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to take a look at your throat. Can you open wide for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Just… hurry, please. This tickles.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your throat looks a little irritated, but no major inflammation. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart again, and then check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. Your oxygen saturation is a little low, at 92%. We prefer to see it closer to 95 or higher. I'd like to order a chest X-ray, and also a sputum sample to check for any infection. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: X-ray…? Sputum…? Look, Doctor, I don't understand all this… fancy talk. Is it bad? Just tell me if it's bad, and what we gotta do. I don't wanna run all over town for tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Reyno. It's not bad yet, but the X-ray and sputum sample will help us figure out why you're coughing, why your oxygen is a little low, and what’s causing the red material. It's important to get a clear picture, especially with your history of smoking. The X-ray is just a picture of your lungs; it doesn’t hurt. The sputum sample is just you coughing up a bit of mucus into a cup. It helps us see if there’s any infection. We need to rule things out. It's a precaution, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… precaution. That sounds… better. But where do I go for the X-ray? And what about the… mucus cup? Is it gonna be a long wait? I got things to do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to give you a referral to the imaging center just down the street, at 14th and Elm. They're usually pretty quick. As for the sputum sample, you can do that right here in the clinic. The nurse will give you a sterile cup and show you how to collect it. It's best to do it first thing in the morning, when you've had a good cough. It shouldn’t take too long, maybe 10-15 minutes to collect the sample once you get it started. I will also have the nurse check your weight and blood pressure before you leave. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay. 14th and Elm. And the nurse will help with the… cup. Alright. That’s… alright, I guess. Just… get it done quick, please. I got things to do. And... how long 'til I know somethin'?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Reyno. I’ll put a rush on the X-ray report. Usually, it takes 24-48 hours for the results to come back, but I’ll call you as soon as I have them. We’ll discuss the results then and figure out the best course of action. The nurse will be in shortly with the cup and instructions. In the meantime, please try to avoid strenuous activity and drink plenty of fluids. I'll also write you a temporary prescription for a mild cough suppressant to help alleviate some of your discomfort. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay… 24-48 hours. And the cough stuff. Yeah, that sounds… good. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you rushin’ it. Just… don’t wanna sit around waitin’ forever, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Reyno. We’ll do everything we can to get you answers quickly. If you experience any worsening symptoms – like increased shortness of breath, high fever, or chest pain – please go to the emergency room immediately. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Now, let me have the nurse come in and get you set up with the sample collection. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… it. Just… get it done quick, please. And thank you, Doctor.
