DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, right. Just… the lab work. The usual stuff, I guess. Doctor said I needed it done again. Honestly, I don’t really remember why exactly. Gets a bit fuzzy, you know? I just got the paper, and here I am.
DOCTOR: Right. "The usual stuff." Okay. Well, we do need to keep track of things. I see here it's a comprehensive metabolic panel and a complete blood count. Just to be sure, are you currently feeling any different than usual?
PATIENT: Different…? Hmm. No, not really. I feel… old, mostly. But that's just… being my age, isn’t it? Everything aches a bit, but that’s always been the case. I don’t feel sick, if that makes sense. No fever, no cough, no… anything specific. Honestly, I’m just trying to get this over with so I can get home.
DOCTOR: Right. “Old” isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Croonquist. But I understand you don't feel acutely ill. Any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… weight… Oh, jeez. I haven’t weighed myself in… a long time. Probably lost a bit, I suppose. Everything seems a little looser than it used to be, but I just figured that was… time again. I haven’t really been trying to eat more or less, just… eating. Does that make sense? I eat when I'm hungry, skip a meal when I'm not.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss. And you said appetite is… stable, just normal fluctuations?
PATIENT: Yeah, stable. Normal. I think so. I eat rice, mostly. And some vegetables when my neighbor brings them over. She's a good woman. I don't really cook much anymore. It's just... easier this way. Look, are we almost done? I've got… things I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just a few more questions, then we'll get to the blood work. Do you have any trouble with your memory?
PATIENT: Memory… Well, now that you mention it… yes. A bit. I forget things. Names, mostly. And… dates. Why I came in here five minutes ago, sometimes. Nothing serious, I don't think. Just… old age again, probably. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what you’re getting at.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh, dear. Now you’re asking about… private things. Well… they’re a little… slower, maybe? Everything is slower these days. I didn’t even think to mention it. Is that… important? I really just wanted the lab work.
DOCTOR: Everything is relevant, Mr. Croonquist. Constipation can be a symptom of several things. Alright. One last thing – any difficulty with urination?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re really getting into it. Look, I’m an old man. Everything leaks a little. What do you want me to say? It's… normal. I get up a few times at night, that’s all. Can we please just get the blood drawn? I’m starting to feel… flustered.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Fine. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Then we’ll get the lab work done. I just need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. Can you lie back on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Getting up is the worst part. Examination table, you say? Alright, alright. But please be quick about it. My back isn’t what it used to be. And try not to poke too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie flat. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths, if you would. Heart sounds are regular, a slight murmur, which is common for your age. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Tell me if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, no significant tenderness. Some mild guarding, likely due to age and discomfort. Reflexes are diminished, as expected. I'm noting some peripheral edema in your lower extremities. Okay. That's enough for now. Now, let’s get that blood work done. Nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: Edema? What’s… edema? Is that bad? Look, Doctor, you’re scaring me now. I just wanted the routine checkup. Honestly, I’m starting to wish I hadn't come. Can you just tell me if everything is… okay? Or do I need to worry?
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, edema just means some swelling in your legs and feet. It’s often related to age, inactivity, or… well, it can be a sign of other things. That's why we're doing the blood work, to rule those things out. Look, I’m not trying to scare you, I just need information. The blood work will give us a better picture. I'm not going to speculate until we have the results. Let’s just focus on getting that done, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Blood work. Just… please hurry. And tell me what it’s for, exactly. I hate not knowing. What are you looking for? Just tell me plain English, please. No medical jargon. I'm an old man, Doctor, not a… a scientist.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. We're checking your kidney function, looking at your blood sugar levels, checking for any signs of infection, and assessing your electrolytes. Basically, making sure your organs are working properly and there isn’t anything serious going on. We'll also check your thyroid. It's a pretty standard panel. The nurse will explain the process. I’ll review the results when they come back, and then we’ll discuss them, okay?
PATIENT: Alright. Kidneys, sugar, infection… thyroid. Okay. Just… get it over with, please. I just want to go home.
