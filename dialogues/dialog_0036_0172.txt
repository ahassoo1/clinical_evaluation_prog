DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m here, precisely. Some… social worker, I believe, arranged this. I just moved to the area, you see. New Medicare business, I suppose. It all feels quite unnecessary, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Sometimes these initial check-ups are just to get a baseline, especially with a new Medicare enrollment and a recent move. We want to make sure everything is as it should be. So, let’s start with a little bit about why you feel you might need to be seen. Are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or new symptoms that have been bothering you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness. At my age, one always has something. A little ache here, a little stiffness there… it’s called growing old, Doctor. And honestly, I don’t believe in dwelling on such things. It doesn’t improve them, does it? I haven’t collapsed or anything, if that’s what you’re asking. Perfectly capable, still. More than I can say for some these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to hear you're generally feeling capable. And you're right, dwelling on aches and pains doesn't usually help. Just to get a more complete picture, would you mind if I ask a few questions about specific areas of your body?
PATIENT: Oh, really? Must we? I assure you, Doctor, I’m quite familiar with my own anatomy. It’s been… a long time in the making, you see. And I find these inquiries rather… indelicate. But if it must be done, I suppose. Just… get on with it. Quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll keep it brief. Let’s start with your heart. Have you noticed any fluttering or racing sensations in your chest?
PATIENT: My heart? Perfectly sound, I assure you. I’ve always had a… robust constitution. Never been faint, never been prone to palpitations. Though, I must say, listening to some of the gossip these days… that might quicken one’s pulse, but that’s hardly a medical matter, is it? Are we quite done with the internal organs now? They're dreadfully personal, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can move on. How about your lungs?
PATIENT: My lungs? I’ve never smoked a day in my life. Disgusting habit, frankly. A proper lady does not engage in such things. I used to sing, you know. A little… opera. Required excellent breath control. Though that was… decades ago. Are we cataloging my past hobbies now, Doctor? This is becoming rather tedious. Honestly.
DOCTOR: No, not cataloging hobbies. Just gathering information. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, wheezing, or a persistent cough lately?
PATIENT: Oh, a little… seasonal sniffle, perhaps? It’s August, you know. Things are… dusty. And old houses creak. One gets a little… congested, naturally. I wouldn't call it persistent. More… sporadic. Really, Doctor, I’m perfectly well. This feels rather… unnecessary. Is there a time limit on this interrogation, perhaps? I have a luncheon engagement.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Candice. We're almost through this initial part. Just a few more questions, then we can do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that, and then we can discuss your luncheon. Let’s talk about your stomach and bowels. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite, weight, or bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Good heavens. Are you attempting to ascertain my… elimination schedule, Doctor? Honestly! This is beyond the pale. I assure you, my digestive functions are… adequate. Perfectly normal for a woman of my age. I maintain a sensible diet, and I do not wish to discuss these… intimate details with a complete stranger. Really. This is quite enough. I believe I’ve answered enough questions. I'm feeling rather faint now, actually. Perhaps it's the stress of it all. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Candice. I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable. You are absolutely right, we can stop here. It sounds like you are feeling stressed. Let's take a moment. Perhaps a brief physical exam would be best to simply get a baseline reading, but we can skip anything you're uncomfortable with. Would you like me to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
