DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, my legs. They bother me something awful at night. Cramps, mostly. Just… ache and tighten up. It’s been going on for a little while now, I reckon. Not sure exactly how long. Time… slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, time does have a way of doing that. And these cramps… are they in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, both of them, mostly. Though sometimes one feels worse than the other. It’s hard to say. They just… clench up. Makes it difficult to sleep, you see. I used to be able to sleep like a log, but now… not so much. Do you… understand what I mean? I’m not very good at explaining these things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Clenching up" is a perfectly good description. And how long would you say these episodes last when they happen?
PATIENT: Oh dear… lasting? That’s a good question. Not very long, I don’t think. A few minutes, maybe? Sometimes longer, sometimes shorter. It's hard to tell when you’re trying to get comfortable, you see. I usually just try to stretch them out, wiggle my toes. Does that… make sense? It doesn't always help, mind you.
DOCTOR: Stretching… alright. And do you notice anything specifically triggers these cramps?
PATIENT: Triggers? Oh, goodness. No, not that I’m aware of. I don’t think so. I eat… regular. Not much excitement in my diet, truth be told. I walk a little, when the weather’s nice. Nothing strenuous, mind you. I don’t do much sitting, except for… well, right now! I suppose it could be anything. I just wish they’d stop. It’s… unsettling, waking up with a tight leg.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking anything for these cramps at all?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Nothing at all. Never been much for taking pills, you see. My mother always said, “Let nature take its course.” And I’ve mostly followed her advice. Though, nature seems to be having a bit of a course with these legs! I don't believe in bothering with medicine unless it’s absolutely necessary. Are you suggesting I should be taking something, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Bilstein, while I respect your mother’s advice, sometimes "nature" needs a little assistance. Before we decide on anything, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me think… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, no. My shoes feel… comfortable enough. I haven't had to loosen them or anything. I suppose I haven’t looked closely, if that makes a difference. I mostly just get dressed and get on with the day, you see. Not much time for examining my feet.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that’s a question. Let me see… Well, my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, obviously. That’s why I have these glasses. And my hearing… comes and goes. Old age, mostly. Nothing… serious, you understand. I used to have a bit of trouble with my back, years ago, but that’s mostly settled down. I don’t think I have anything… truly wrong with me. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you see. It’s a natural process, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: And what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Like I said before, I don't take much in the way of pills. Just a little something for my stomach, sometimes, if I eat something that doesn't agree with me. But that’s it. My mother always said too much medicine is worse than too little. She lived to be 92, you know. Very strong woman. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Alright. And, Ms. Bilstein, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, allergies. I don’t think so. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I used to help my mother with her garden, and I was always around flowers and plants. Never had any trouble with pollen or anything like that. She always said fresh air was the best medicine, you know. Though, I suppose these legs don't seem to agree with that advice either.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your legs and feet. It’ll only take a few minutes. I want to assess the circulation and reflexes in your legs, and feel for any swelling or tenderness.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it can’t hurt. Though, I’m not very good at sitting still for long, you see. My knees aren’t what they used to be. Just… let me know if I need to do anything. I'll try to be a good patient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein, just relax. I'm feeling your calves now. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not particularly. A little… tight, maybe. But I suppose that’s to be expected. I haven’t been doing much walking lately, you see. Just a little around the house. Is it… normal for them to feel tight? Oh, that’s a little… sensitive. But not terribly painful. It's just a little… achy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about here?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… what are you feeling for? I can't quite see what you're doing. Is everything alright? It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it’s… strange. I feel a little bit of a… tickle, maybe? Is it normal for you to feel around my feet like that, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Just checking your circulation and reflexes, Ms. Bilstein. It's standard procedure. Now, I’m going to tap your knees and ankles. Just relax your legs. Any reaction here?
PATIENT: Oh! That's a bit startling! It made my leg jump a little. Is that… normal? I haven’t had anyone tap my knees since I was a little girl! It feels… peculiar. Did you see a reaction? I hope everything is alright, Doctor. My mother always said you shouldn't poke around too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein. Based on the exam, your reflexes are a bit diminished, and there’s some tenderness in your calves. While it’s unlikely to be anything serious, given your age and history, I suspect this is likely peripheral neuropathy, possibly exacerbated by decreased activity. It's a common condition that affects the nerves in the legs and feet.
PATIENT: Neuropathy? Oh dear. Is that… bad? I don't think I've ever heard of that. Does that mean I’m… sick? My mother always said worrying about things makes them worse. So… what does that mean, exactly? And what can we do about it? I’m not fond of being poked and prodded, you see, and I really don’t want to take a lot of pills. Is there anything… simpler we can try?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "bad," Ms. Bilstein. It just means there's some nerve damage. Often it's related to age, circulation, or sometimes even vitamin deficiencies. We’ll need to run some blood tests to rule out any deficiencies – Vitamin B12 and D levels are good places to start. In the meantime, the best thing you can do is to stay as active as possible – gentle walking is good, even just around the house. And I’d recommend a warm Epsom salt soak for your feet a few times a week. That can help with the pain. I’m also going to prescribe a low-dose Vitamin B12 supplement, just to be on the safe side. It won't hurt, and it might help. As for pills, this isn’t a high dose and it’s often quite effective.
PATIENT: Oh… blood tests? I don't much care for needles, you see. And Epsom salts… my mother used to use those for her roses. Vitamin B12… that sounds… complicated. Will it interact with anything? I don't take many things, but I do have a little something for my stomach now and then. And what if it doesn't help? I’m not sure I want to spend a lot of time and money on something that won’t make a difference. Is there… anything else we can try? Perhaps some sort of ointment for my legs? Or a different kind of soak? I just… don't like the idea of taking pills if I can avoid it. It feels… unnatural, somehow.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bilstein, I understand your reluctance, but sometimes a little assistance is necessary. The blood tests are crucial to rule out any underlying causes for your neuropathy. As for ointments, topical creams rarely provide significant relief for neuropathy. While I appreciate your concerns, I strongly recommend we proceed with the blood tests and the Vitamin B12 supplement. It’s a conservative approach, and it could significantly improve your symptoms. We can always reassess if it doesn’t provide relief. I’ll write you a referral to the lab, and a prescription for the Vitamin B12. And if you're really concerned about the pills, we can discuss a liquid form if that makes you more comfortable. But please, let’s start with these basic steps before we explore other options. It's important to rule out other causes first.
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. But I do wish there was something… simpler. Liquid… that does sound a little better. And I suppose blood tests are… necessary, if you say so. But please, no needles bigger than absolutely necessary. My mother always said a gentle touch is the best medicine. Will the lab be very busy? I don't like waiting around in crowded places. And how long will it take to get the results? I have a little tea party with my neighbor next week, and I wouldn't want to miss that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein. I’ve noted your preference for a smaller needle. The lab is usually busiest in the mornings, so try to go later in the day. As for the results, they typically take about a week. I’ll have the lab fax them directly to my office. And I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the results and how you're feeling. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh… two weeks. That’s a long time to wait. No, I don't think so, Doctor. Unless… will the Vitamin B12 make me jittery? I do enjoy my afternoon tea, and I wouldn’t want to be too… lively. And… is there anything I should avoid eating while I’m taking it? I do so appreciate your patience. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Bilstein, Vitamin B12 shouldn't make you jittery. In fact, it can sometimes have a calming effect. And there are no dietary restrictions while taking it. It's a water-soluble vitamin, so any excess will simply be excreted in your urine. Very well. If you experience any unusual side effects, don't hesitate to call my office. Otherwise, I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. Have a good day, Ms. Bilstein.
PATIENT: Oh, alright then. Thank you so much, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease. I'll try not to worry too much. A good day to you as well, Doctor. And thank you again. Oh, and Doctor? Do you think… it might rain later? .
