DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I suppose you could say I’m here about a bit of a… predicament. I’ve gained weight, and quite a bit of it, rather suddenly. It’s… concerning, to say the least. I haven’t changed my habits, so I was hoping you could perhaps shed some light on the matter.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Selbitschka. Weight gain, especially when it occurs without changes to diet or exercise, is something we should investigate. To get a better understanding, could you tell me approximately how much weight you’ve gained, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s been, perhaps, the last six months, maybe a little longer. And… well, I haven’t weighed myself regularly, you understand. But I’d estimate… around 20 pounds, give or take a few. It’s… noticeable in my clothes, certainly. And… I feel it. It's not muscle, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Selbitschka. That gives us a starting point. And you’ve stated no changes to your diet or exercise routine during this time?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I’ve been… quite consistent, actually. My husband and I walk the dog every evening, as we always have, and I prepare most of our meals myself. Nothing particularly extravagant, just… normal, everyday food. I haven't started eating more sweets or anything like that, I assure you. It’s… very perplexing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it is good you've maintained your usual routines. To help narrow down the possibilities, let’s delve a little deeper into your medical history. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. Let me think… well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, perhaps. Not debilitatingly so, just… a general lack of energy. And… my ankles have been a little swollen lately, especially at the end of the day. But I thought that was just from the walking. It’s not painful, just… puffy. I haven’t noticed anything else, not that I recall. Is that… significant?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Selbitschka. The fatigue and ankle swelling are relevant. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, well, let’s see… I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia when I was younger, perhaps twenty years ago. Fully recovered, though. And… I have slightly elevated blood pressure, but it’s always been well-controlled with… well, just watching my salt intake, mostly. The doctor said it wasn’t anything to worry too much about, as long as I kept an eye on it. Other than that… nothing major, really. No surgeries, no chronic illnesses. My husband keeps telling me I worry too much!
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Selbitschka. And it's good that your blood pressure has been managed. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard, thankfully. I try to avoid hospitals whenever possible! My mother always said they were breeding grounds for germs. It's probably silly, but… I’ve always been a bit wary.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly understandable, Ms. Selbitschka. Many people feel that way. Now, regarding your family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, thyroid problems, or obesity?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that's a bit complicated. My mother’s side… she had some sort of heart trouble later in life, I believe. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he was… rather large, yes. Obese, I suppose you’d call it. He wasn’t very active, and he did enjoy his… pastries. As for diabetes or thyroid problems… I don’t recall specifically. My father wasn't one for discussing medical matters, and my mother has… passed away, so I’m afraid that’s all the information I have. Is that… enough?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing what you know, Ms. Selbitschka. That gives us a good starting point. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Just… the occasional ibuprofen for a headache. Nothing regular, I assure you. And… sometimes, a multivitamin, but honestly, I forget to take it half the time. My daughter bought it for me, said I needed to “boost my immune system.” But… that’s it. No prescriptions, no herbal remedies, nothing at all. I’m rather averse to taking too many pills, if you don't mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Selbitschka. It's good to be mindful of what you're taking. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I've never had any allergic reactions, not that I'm aware of. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven't noticed any sensitivities to… dust or pollen or anything like that. I'm quite lucky in that regard, really. My daughter is terribly allergic to cats, though. Poor thing! But me… no, no allergies at all.
DOCTOR: Excellent. To help me understand your situation more fully, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. That sounds… sensible. I was expecting that, actually. Please, proceed. I’ll do my best to be… cooperative. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. My husband is expecting me home for dinner.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Selbitschka. We will keep it as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is 138/88 mmHg, pulse is 72 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and temperature is 98.6°F. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Thyroid is normal in size and consistency, no nodules appreciated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are normal. There is mild pitting edema in both ankles. Skin is warm, dry, and intact. Based on this preliminary examination, I note the mild edema in your ankles, which correlates with your reported swelling. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not significantly. Everything else appears within normal limits. I’d like to order some laboratory tests to help determine the cause of your weight gain and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. If tests can help figure out what’s going on, then absolutely. I’d much prefer to know than to simply… worry about it. What sort of tests are we talking about? And… will they be painful? I do have a rather low tolerance for needles, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Selbitschka. The tests I’m recommending include a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. We will also test your urine. The CBC will help assess your overall health and detect any signs of infection or anemia. The CMP provides information about your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte balance. The TSH test will evaluate your thyroid function, which can significantly impact your weight and energy levels. The lipid panel will assess your risk for heart disease. And the urine test can detect any kidney problems or infections. The blood draw will involve a small needle prick, and there may be a slight discomfort, but it should be brief. The urine test is non-invasive, simply requiring you to provide a sample. We will have a phlebotomist draw your blood, and I will interpret the results. Would you like me to explain any of these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, that's… quite a list! It all sounds very thorough, which is reassuring, I suppose. No, I think I understand. The thyroid one makes sense, given what you said about energy levels. And the heart one, considering my mother… No, please, don’t go into too much detail. I trust your judgement, Doctor Shely. Let’s just… get it done. When can I expect the results? And… will I need to fast before the blood draw? I do enjoy my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Selbitschka. You will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw, so breakfast will have to wait. We typically schedule the blood draw first thing in the morning for this reason. The lab results usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back, and we will contact you as soon as they are available. I will review them carefully and then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or severe symptoms, such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, or significant swelling, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor Shely. Fasting… I can manage that, I suppose. And I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. It’s… comforting to know what to expect. Alright then. Let’s get these tests done. I have a feeling this will be a long day. Perhaps I should have brought a book. But… thank you again, Doctor. I feel… slightly more at ease now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. I'll have the nurse draw your blood, and she will provide you with instructions on where to drop off your urine sample. After that, we’ll schedule your follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime.
PATIENT: .
