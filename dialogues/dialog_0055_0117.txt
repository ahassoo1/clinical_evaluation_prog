DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re 54 years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, 54. Just… a cough. Been coughin’ for a bit now. And… there’s blood. Not a lot, but… in the stuff I cough up. I smoke, you know. Always have.
DOCTOR: A cough with hemoptysis, as you say. Right. And how long precisely has this cough been bothering you, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Hemop… what now? Look, I just told you, coughin' and blood. Been goin' on… a while. Maybe a month? Hard to say exactly. Time kinda… slips. I don't really keep track.
DOCTOR: "Hemoptysis" simply refers to coughing up blood, Mr. Reyno. It’s a medical term, that is all. A month is… somewhat vague. Has the amount of blood changed at all over that month?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Hemop… okay. Well, no, I don’t think so. Seems about the same. Little streaks, mostly. Not like… a whole lot. Enough to worry me, though. That's why I'm here, I guess. Don't want to ignore it.
DOCTOR: Very good. And aside from the cough and the blood, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me think. I get tired easier, maybe? But I always been a bit of a sleepy fella. And… sometimes I get a little short of breath. But that could just be walkin' up hills, you know? We live kinda high up. I don't really know what's normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and dyspnea… understandable. And are you experiencing any chest pain, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Chest pain… Not really. Not like a sharp pain. Sometimes kinda… achy. But mostly just when I cough a lot. It's hard to explain. It’s just… uncomfortable, mostly. Not somethin' I'd call pain. You know? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Reyno. Now, let’s delve into your medical history a bit. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Pre-existing… well, I had the flu once, a long time ago. And my back’s been botherin’ me for years. Old injury. Doc told me it was just somethin’ I’d have to live with. Never really got it checked out properly. Mostly just take some pills when it flares up. Besides that... nothin' I can think of. I don't go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: And what about surgical history, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Surgical… Hmm. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. That’s about it. And… my appendix, maybe? I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago. I was pretty young. Mom took me, I think. I was just a little fella. Don't recall much about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my… my dad smoked too. He got… sick. Real sick. Lungs, I think. But he didn't go to the doctor neither. Mom took care of him at home. That was a long time ago. Nobody talked about it much. I don't know nothin’ about what kinda sick he was. Just… sick.
DOCTOR: And do you currently take any medications, Mr. Reyno, aside from the pills for your back?
PATIENT: Just the back pills, like I said. Sometimes. When it gets bad. I don't really like takin’ pills. Try to avoid it when I can. I'm not good with rememberin’ names, though. Whatever the doc gave me. Little white ones, I think. Don't ask me for the name. I wouldn't know it. Can we just get this over with? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Reyno. Now, I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. I will listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen saturation. This will only take a few moments. Please remove your shirt, and I'll begin.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Shirt off. Just get it over with, Doc. I ain't got all day. And try to be quick, alright? It gets cold in here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. I am hearing some wheezing in both lung fields, and a slight decrease in breath sounds at the bases. Your heart rate is regular, but a little elevated. Oxygen saturation is currently 92%, which is slightly below optimal. I also note some mild clubbing of your fingertips. Do you recall if these have always been this way?
PATIENT: Clubbin’…? What now? They look normal to me. I ain't ever really looked at 'em, to be honest. Been workin' with my hands my whole life. I don't know nothin' about clubbin'. Is that bad? Can we just get to the bottom of this cough? I'm startin' to feel lightheaded.
DOCTOR: The clubbing of your fingertips can be indicative of chronic lung disease, Mr. Reyno, but requires further investigation to determine the cause. Given your history of smoking, your hemoptysis, your wheezing, and the decreased breath sounds, I am concerned about the possibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, and potentially, lung cancer. To further evaluate this, I need to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. Are you able to schedule these tests at the clinic?
PATIENT: COPD… cancer… Whoa, hold on now. Cancer? You're tellin' me I got cancer? I just got a cough! Look, I don't want no tests. I don't like hospitals. And I definitely don't want nothin’ poked and prodded. Can’t you just give me somethin’ for the cough? Some pills? Please, Doc. I just wanna go home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, I understand your apprehension, but dismissing these symptoms without proper investigation would be irresponsible. I cannot simply prescribe medication without knowing the underlying cause of your cough. These tests are essential to determine the severity of your condition and develop an appropriate treatment plan. While I respect your reluctance, I strongly recommend that you allow me to order these tests. If you refuse, I advise you to seek a second opinion from another physician. However, I must reiterate that delaying diagnosis and treatment could have serious consequences. I will schedule the X-ray and pulmonary function test for you. They are non-invasive, and will provide valuable information. Do you have any questions before I proceed?
PATIENT: Non-invasive… you mean you ain't gonna cut me open? Fine. Do the tests. But make it quick. And don’t tell me nothin’ I don’t need to know. Just give me the results. I ain’t good with bad news. When can I get 'em done? Just tell me when and where. I wanna get this over with. I got things to do, remember?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Reyno. I have scheduled a chest X-ray and pulmonary function test for you at the clinic imaging department tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. A technician will guide you through the procedures. The results will be sent to me, and I will contact you as soon as they are available, typically within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I will prescribe a bronchodilator to help alleviate your cough and shortness of breath. It is crucial that you take this medication as directed. Do you have any further questions or concerns before we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Broncho… whatever. Just give me the pills. And make sure they don't have any side effects. I get enough trouble sleepin’ as it is. No, that's all. Just… get me outta here. I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Reyno. The prescription information includes potential side effects, which are typically mild. Please read it carefully. I urge you to contact the clinic immediately if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or any concerning side effects. Thank you for your cooperation, and I wish you well.
