DOCTOR: Right. So, Ms. Redeye, you're here today… for what, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sorry. It’s these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and it’s getting really annoying. I thought they’d go away on their own, but no luck.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, yes. Two days is… unusual. Alright. Let's try to get some details. Can you describe them?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… normal hiccups, I guess? You know, the kind where your chest jerks and you make that “hic” sound. It's not painful, just… startling. And they happen pretty randomly. I could be sitting, walking, talking… doesn't seem to matter. I haven't noticed anything specific that starts them, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Random, you say. And how frequent are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… it comes and goes. At first, it was just a few every hour or so. But yesterday, it was almost constant. Like, every couple of minutes. Today it’s… a little better, maybe one every ten or fifteen minutes? But it’s still happening, and it’s wearing me out. It’s hard to concentrate, you know? Especially with my job.
DOCTOR: Right. And what do you do for work, Ms. Redeye?
PATIENT: I'm an entertainment manager. I mostly organize events – little festivals, concerts in the park, that sort of thing. Lots of talking, lots of being around people. It’s hard to be professional when you’re constantly hiccuping! It’s… distracting for everyone.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's impacting your work. Alright. Let's go through some other things… Have you tried anything to get rid of them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Everything I could think of, really. Holding my breath, drinking water really fast, getting someone to scare me… you know, all the old tricks. None of them worked. I even tried a spoonful of sugar, but that just made me feel sticky. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit silly trying everything.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, those are the typical things. Have you had hiccups this persistent before?
PATIENT: No, never. I get hiccups sometimes, like anyone, but they always stop after a few minutes. This is… different. It’s just gone on for so long. I’m starting to worry something is actually wrong, you know? I haven't been sick or anything, no fever, no cough, just… these hiccups.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out a few years ago, but that’s it. And I don’t take any regular medications. I try to stay healthy, eat well, get some exercise… I'm not usually one to complain about things. This hiccup thing is just… strange.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some problems with his heart when he was older. But nothing really relevant to hiccups, I don’t think. No one in my family was ever a chronic hiccupper, if that's a thing! Mostly just… normal old age stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And social history?
PATIENT: Oh! Um… I’m divorced, been that way for about ten years now. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I live alone, but I have some friends nearby. I try to stay busy, mostly with work and volunteering at the local animal shelter. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Just to rule things out. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Nothing major.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. It's just… embarrassing to hiccup while someone’s listening to my chest, but I understand.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. No obvious masses. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. No immediate concerns, physically. Still, two days of hiccups is… unusual. Have you had any recent changes in diet?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. I did have a spicy curry last week, but I eat spicy food fairly often. And I've been drinking plenty of water, as I said. I haven't started any new foods or anything. I'm really trying to think, but I can't come up with anything obvious. Maybe it's just stress? Work has been a bit hectic lately, getting everything organized for the summer festival. But I usually handle stress pretty well. See? It's still happening!
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, Ms. Redeye, persistent hiccups can be caused by a lot of things. Most of the time, they resolve on their own. We’ve ruled out anything immediately obvious physically. I’m going to order a basic blood work panel, just to check your electrolytes and rule out any underlying metabolic issues. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it's better to be safe than sorry. And I'm going to suggest a referral to a gastroenterologist, just in case it is something related to your digestive system.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. I appreciate that. Blood work and a specialist, right? Will the blood work tell us anything specific? And is a gastroenterologist really necessary? I mean, it’s just hiccups, not… I don’t know, a stomach problem. But if you think it's best, I trust your judgment. It’s really getting annoying.
DOCTOR: The blood work will check for things like potassium and sodium imbalances, which can sometimes cause hiccups. It's a standard procedure. And while it is just hiccups, persistent hiccups can sometimes be a sign of something underlying. Better to get it checked out by a specialist. I'll give you a requisition form for the blood work. The lab is just down the hall. And I'll get the referral to the gastroenterologist started. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and avoid anything that might trigger your hiccups. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… how long should I wait before contacting you if the hiccups don’t go away after the blood work and specialist appointment? And… is there anything I can do right now to help? Like, any over-the-counter medications or anything? I really need to get this under control before the festival starts. It's next week.
DOCTOR: If the hiccups persist for more than a week after seeing the gastroenterologist, or if you develop any other symptoms – difficulty breathing, chest pain, severe abdominal pain – contact me immediately. As for over-the-counter medications… honestly, there’s not much that’s proven to be effective for hiccups. You've already tried the typical remedies. I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on things that are unlikely to help. Here's the form for the blood work. Try to relax, and avoid anything stressful if possible. I know it's easier said than done, but stress can exacerbate hiccups. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Thank you for your time, Ms. Redeye.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Dr. Memmolo. I appreciate your help. I'll get the blood work done right away. I guess I’ll just try to relax… if I can.
