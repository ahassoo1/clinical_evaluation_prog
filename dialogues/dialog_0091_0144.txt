DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Talen, was it? Yes, well… honestly? Curiosity, mostly. My neighbor, Eunice, she’s always going on about how wonderful you are, and I thought… well, I thought I’d see for myself. It’s been a while since I’ve been to a doctor, you see. Not that anything is wrong, exactly. Just…checking things out. I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Calvery. Preventative care is excellent, and it’s always wise to be proactive about your health. I appreciate you coming in for a check-up. While it sounds like there isn't a specific concern at the moment, it’s still helpful to get a comprehensive understanding of your overall well-being. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… hmm. Well, I’m… old, I guess. Sixty-four. Used to be a surgical tech, for… oh, goodness, decades. Lots of standing. My knees aren't what they used to be, naturally. And I get tired easier now. But who doesn’t, at my age? I mostly just… take it easy these days. Read a lot. Watch my shows. Eunice brings over soup sometimes, which is nice. Is that what you mean by general health?
DOCTOR: That gives me a good starting point, Ms. Calvery. Thank you. Knowing your history as a surgical technician is very helpful. Standing for extended periods can certainly take a toll on the joints. And feeling more fatigued with age is common, but we want to ensure there isn't an underlying cause contributing to that. To get a clearer picture, could you elaborate on this fatigue?
PATIENT: Elaborate… well, it's not like I'm exhausted all the time. It's more… like I just don't have the energy I used to. I used to be able to garden all day, and now, after an hour, I need to sit down. It's… frustrating, I suppose. And sometimes I just feel… blah. Not sick, just… lacking something. You know? It’s probably just old age creeping up on me. Honestly, I doubt it’s anything serious.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Calvery. That's a very helpful description. It’s good you’re able to articulate that distinction. Feeling less energetic and a general sense of “blah-ness” are certainly things we want to investigate, even if it's likely related to age-related changes. To help me understand this a bit better, have you noticed this fatigue worsen recently, or has it been a gradual change over time?
PATIENT: Oh, it's been gradual, definitely. Not like suddenly one day I was full of pep and the next I wasn’t. It's been… creeping up on me for, oh, maybe a year or so? Hard to say exactly. Time just… goes, you know? I suppose it’s probably just getting older. My husband, bless his soul, he always said I worried too much. And maybe he was right.
DOCTOR: A gradual onset is important information, Ms. Calvery. And it’s wise to consider all possibilities. It's good you can recall the timeframe – about a year. Now, aside from the fatigue and feeling generally less energetic, have you experienced any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes… let me think. My knees, they ache more, like I said. Eunice keeps telling me to get a brace. I haven’t, though. Don’t like the idea of wearing a brace. Feels… limiting. Oh! And I’ve been a little more forgetful lately. Not terrible, but… I sometimes misplace my glasses. Or forget what I was about to say. It's probably just my age, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased knee pain and some increased forgetfulness. It’s helpful you’re able to share these details. We'll address each of these. It's common for memory to change with age, but it's important to note the extent of the changes. Regarding the forgetfulness, has this been interfering with your daily life in any way?
PATIENT: Interfering… well, not really. It’s more annoying than anything. I just have to… concentrate harder, I suppose. Sometimes I’ll go into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll start telling a story and… lose my train of thought. Nothing major, Doctor. Honestly, I think it’s just getting old. I used to have a wonderful memory. Could remember everything! But… things change.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like it's more of a nuisance than a significant disruption to your daily functioning. We’ll keep it in mind as we proceed. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my gallbladder out, ages ago. And… I think I had pneumonia once? A long time ago. Nothing serious, though. Mostly just… the usual things old people get, I suppose. My husband always took care of all the paperwork, so I don’t really remember the details. He was very organized.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. It's understandable that you don't recall all the specifics. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and pneumonia is helpful. And what about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. Just a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. I take it every morning. And… sometimes I take something for my knees when they really ache. Ibuprofen, I think it is. But not every day. Only when I need it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. So, a medication for blood pressure, and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. Do you recall the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, I really don’t. It's in a little orange bottle. And it’s… small. I just have the pharmacy fill it every month. I don’t really pay attention to the names, you know? I just take the pills. My husband always handled all that, too.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Calvery. We can easily look up your medications in the system. I'll just need a moment to verify your insurance information. Okay, it looks like you are currently prescribed Lisinopril 20mg daily for your blood pressure. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes, that sounds right. And no, I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Never had a reaction to any pills, as far as I know. Though, like I said, I don’t really pay attention to all that. My husband always asked about allergies when he filled the prescriptions.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, Ms. Calvery, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, he used to smoke a little, years ago, but he quit. Said it was bad for his health. I always made sure he had plenty of fresh air, though. I always believed in taking care of myself, you know?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Calvery. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. A glass of red, maybe. Nothing too much, Doctor. Just a little something to relax. My husband and I always enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner, years ago.
DOCTOR: That's fine, Ms. Calvery. Just a glass of red wine occasionally. Now, I'd like to ask a bit about your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tough one. My mother, she had… I think it was high blood pressure, like me. And my father, he had… something with his heart, I think. It was a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t remember the details. My family wasn’t really one for talking about health, you know? They just… dealt with things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Calvery. Knowing about the high blood pressure and heart condition in your family is helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your throat and ears. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, if you think it’s necessary. It’s been a while since anyone checked me over. I suppose it can’t hurt. Just… don’t poke too much, alright? My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I’ll be very gentle. We’ll take things slowly. Your blood pressure is 140/85. That’s a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your throat looks fine, and there's no obvious inflammation in your ears. I'm noticing some mild tenderness and swelling in both knees. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, Doctor. Mostly when I stand for too long. Or if the weather is cold. It's just… achy, you know? Not a sharp pain, just… bothersome. I’ve been meaning to get a brace, like Eunice says, but… I don’t like the idea of wearing one. Feels… restrictive.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about the brace, Ms. Calvery. We can explore other options for managing the knee pain. Now, I'd like to ask a few more questions to get a more complete picture of your health. Have you experienced any recent weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, not really. I think I've stayed about the same weight for… well, for as long as I can remember. Maybe a little bit of weight gain over the winter, just from being less active. But nothing major. Eunice always says I should eat more soup.
DOCTOR: Okay, stable weight. And what about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh dear… must we? Well… they’re… regular enough. Not perfect, but… I don’t really have any problems. Except sometimes a little… sluggish. But nothing to worry about, I’m sure. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s important to ask. And thank you for your honesty. Now, one last thing. Have you noticed any changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, my vision isn't what it used to be. I need my glasses more often, that's for sure. And sometimes things sound a little muffled, like everyone's talking underwater. But that’s just… getting old, isn’t it? I just turn up the volume on the TV.
DOCTOR: That's quite common, Ms. Calvery. Alright, based on our conversation and the brief examination, it seems you are experiencing some age-related changes, including fatigue, knee pain, mild vision and hearing loss, and slightly elevated blood pressure. It’s good you’re proactive about your health. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the fatigue, I recommend we schedule some blood work to rule out any underlying causes. This will also give us a baseline for your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work… alright, if you think it’s necessary. I suppose it can’t hurt. Just… try not to take too much, alright? I get a little faint sometimes. And let me know where I need to go, and if I need to fast beforehand. I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. We won’t take too much blood, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable. You will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood work – that means no food or drinks other than water. I’ll give you a lab requisition with detailed instructions. You can go to the lab at St. Luke's Hospital – it’s just down the street. I also recommend we discuss strategies for managing your fatigue and knee pain. We can explore options like physical therapy for your knees, and I can offer some general advice on lifestyle changes to help boost your energy levels. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, well… physical therapy sounds… tiring. But maybe it would help. And… I suppose if you think it’s necessary. As for questions… hmm. Let me see. Oh! Yes. When should I expect the results from the blood work? I always worry when I have to wait for results.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable concern, Ms. Calvery. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. My office will call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We will review the results together and create a plan tailored to your needs. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your current level of activity, but be mindful of your energy levels and listen to your body. Avoid pushing yourself too hard. Is there anything else I can address today, or any other questions I can answer for you?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Honestly, it’s good to just… talk about these things, you know? I always worry too much, so it’s nice to have someone tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Ms. Calvery. That's what I'm here for. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, Ms. Calvery.
