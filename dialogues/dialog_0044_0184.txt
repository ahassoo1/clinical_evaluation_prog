DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. It's a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day. It's about… well, it’s about this. It just… ain't what it used to be. Used to be strong, you know? Now it’s…soft. Wife always liked a firm belly. She's gone now, but still. I want it fixed. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re experiencing a change in your abdominal area, and it's concerning to you. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When did you first notice this change, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Notice it? Oh, I been noticing it for a good… six months, maybe? Longer. It’s gradual, you see. Not like one day it was hard as a rock and the next it was… pudding. Just…slow. And annoying. I ain’t a man who likes things…slack. You understand? I used to be a pile driver operator, strong work, keeps a man… tight.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. A gradual change over six months… and you’re understandably concerned about it, especially given your history of physically demanding work. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you describe the feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Feeling? Like… like there's nothing in there anymore. Used to feel… solid. Now it just… wobbles. And it sticks out a bit more, you know? Not a lot, but enough to bother me. I used to be able to pull my trousers real tight, now… well, now I got a bit of a gap. It's… embarrassing. Used to have a proper shape, a proper waist. Now it’s just… round.
DOCTOR: Okay, a feeling of looseness, a change in your shape, and some discomfort with your clothing. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort along with this change?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not exactly pain. More like… a dull ache sometimes. When I bend over, maybe. Or if I lift something heavy, a bit of a strain. But I still can lift things, mind you. I ain't old yet! Just… it takes a bit more effort. It used to be effortless. Like everything these days. Everything takes more effort.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache with exertion, and a feeling of increased effort. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What kinda question is that? You askin' about… when I go to the bathroom? Look, I ain’t here to talk about… that. I told you, it’s about this. It ain't about what comes out of me, it’s about what’s in here.
DOCTOR: You're right to bring me back to your primary concern, Mr. Trendler. My apologies for going off on a tangent. It’s just good practice to rule things out. We are focusing on your abdomen. Let’s go back to the physical feeling. Have you noticed any bloating, or any visible changes in the size of your abdomen throughout the day?
PATIENT: Bloating? Hmm. Sometimes. Especially after I eat. A bit of a… puffiness. Not a lot, but I notice it. And… yeah, it seems a bit bigger at the end of the day. Like it fills out. But then it goes down a bit overnight. Maybe. I ain't lookin' at it all the time, you know? I got other things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, some bloating after eating and a slight increase in size throughout the day, resolving somewhat overnight. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not much. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but he put me on a pill for that. I take it every day. Other than that… no. Never been a sickly man. Always worked hard, stayed strong. Pile drivin’ ain’t for the weak, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, high blood pressure managed with medication. That's good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see… There was that time I cut my hand real bad when I was young, workin’ with the timber. Had to get stitches, but that ain’t a surgery, is it? No, no real surgeries. Never needed 'em. I always took care of myself. Strong hands, strong body. That’s what I always believed in.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, just a hand injury requiring stitches. Okay. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my mother… she had diabetes, I think. And my father… he had trouble with his heart when he got older. Always complainin' about chest pains. But that was a long time ago. I didn't pay much attention to it then. We weren't a family that talked about…feelings. Just got on with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes in your mother and heart trouble in your father. And what about your lifestyle, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I work. Always have. Worked hard all my life. Retired now, but still keep busy. Do a bit of gardening. Walk around a bit. Eat regular. Not fancy food, mind you. Just… proper food. And I don't drink much, maybe a small rum on special occasions. That's about it. Never been one for sittin' around doin' nothin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you stay active with gardening and walking, eat a regular diet, and have minimal alcohol consumption. That's all good to hear. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. I can take most pills without issue. They give me a bit of a stomach ache sometimes, but that's all. No, no allergies. I'm a tough man, I tell you. Never been one to complain about a little discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Mr. Trendler. That gives me a good understanding of your situation. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on with your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam, eh? What kinda exam? I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded. I told you, I'm a tough man, I know my own body. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. But don't go makin' it too uncomfortable. And be quick about it, I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Trendler. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and it won’t take long. First, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then I’ll gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please lie back on the table, and I’ll explain everything as I go. Your bowel sounds are normal, active. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I’m noticing some mild softness to your abdomen overall, but no significant tenderness. There’s no guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. It doesn’t feel like anything acutely concerning. It’s primarily the feeling of softness you described. Your abdomen is slightly distended, but not dramatically so. It feels like some subcutaneous fat has accumulated. Do you feel any discomfort when I press here, on your lower abdomen?
PATIENT: A little. Not pain, exactly. More like… pressure. Like somethin’ is… pushin’ back. But it's nothin' serious. I told you, just soft. Always been a bit of a belly on me, even when I was workin’. Used to be muscle, now it's… not. So? What does it mean? Is it somethin' I need to worry about? I ain't got time for fancy treatments or long hospital stays. Just tell me straight, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, it appears you are experiencing some loss of abdominal muscle tone, with some accumulation of subcutaneous fat. The mild distension and softness are consistent with this. It doesn’t sound like anything acutely concerning. It's important to understand that as we age, it’s very common to lose some muscle mass and gain some fat, even with a healthy lifestyle. This can be due to a variety of factors, including decreased metabolism, hormonal changes, and reduced physical activity. It sounds like, in your case, it’s likely a combination of these factors. However, it's always good to rule out other possibilities. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to order some routine blood work. This will help us check your overall health, rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this, and assess your nutritional status. It will also help us determine if there's anything specific we can do to improve your muscle tone and reduce your abdominal fat. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? More pokin’ and proddin’? Look, I told you, I ain’t sickly. I eat proper, I stay active. I don’t need a bunch of tests to tell me what I already know. But… …if it’ll get you off my back, alright. But I ain’t expectin’ no fancy results. Just tell me if somethin's really wrong. And be quick about it. I got a garden to tend to, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. I understand your reluctance, and I’ll keep it as simple as possible. The blood work will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. It's standard procedure, and it will help us get a baseline for your overall health. Here's a requisition for the blood work. You can go to the lab at [Name of Lab] at your convenience. They don't require an appointment. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to maintain a healthy diet and regular exercise routine. If you're interested, I can also provide you with some resources on abdominal exercises and nutrition. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get on with it. I’ll get the tests done. And no fancy exercises, Doctor. I know how to work a garden. That’s exercise enough for an old man. Look, I appreciate you not tellin' me I’m dyin’ or somethin’. That’s good. But I ain’t expectin’ miracles. Just… want to feel a bit firmer, that’s all. Is that too much to ask? Alright then. I’ll be seein’ you. Hopefully, this won't take too long.
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all, Mr. Trendler. And I certainly don’t expect you to do anything drastic. We’ll take things one step at a time. The blood work will give us a better understanding of what’s going on, and then we can discuss the best course of action. Thank you for coming in today, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Trendler. Have a good day, and enjoy your gardening.
PATIENT: Alright. You too, Doctor. Good day.
