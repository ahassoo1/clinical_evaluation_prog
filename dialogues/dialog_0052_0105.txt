DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, I’m here about getting surgery. For… weight loss. My wife helped me set this up, honestly. I don't really remember all the details, but it's… bariatric surgery, right? Something like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, bariatric surgery. That's correct. It’s good of your wife to assist you with scheduling this consultation. To best understand your situation and determine if surgery is the right option for you, I’m going to ask you a number of questions. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember all the details; we can work through everything together. First, can you tell me a bit about how long you’ve been considering weight loss surgery?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Honestly, it feels like a while. Maybe… a few months? It’s kind of blurry. My wife has been talking about it for longer, I think. She was worried about my health. I… I’ve been feeling tired a lot, and just not myself. But I don’t really keep track of dates well. Sorry. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It's understandable to not remember exact dates, and it’s very helpful that your wife is so involved in your care. We’ll take things at your pace. You mentioned feeling tired and “not yourself.” Can you elaborate on that a bit?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. It's… hard to explain. Just really worn out, even after sleeping. And… getting out of breath doing simple things. Like walking up the stairs. Or playing with my grandkids. It makes me sad 'cause I want to do more with them. And my knees… they ache a lot. It's just… everything feels harder than it used to. I used to be more active, I think. But it's been a while. Sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Mr. Kochubey. This is all very helpful information. Fatigue, shortness of breath with exertion, and knee pain – those are all important things to discuss. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you may have?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Let me think. I… I think the doctor told me I have high blood pressure, a few years back. And maybe some cholesterol issues? I take pills for it, I think. My wife handles most of the doctor stuff, so I don't always remember the names of everything. I haven't been to the doctor much lately, to be honest. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and possible cholesterol issues. And you take medication for that. It’s not a problem that you haven't been to the doctor recently; we'll review everything together today. Knowing you're on medication for blood pressure is important. Do you happen to know the names of those medications, or can you tell me what they look like?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don't remember the names. They’re little white pills, I think. And maybe some bigger blue ones? I take them every morning with breakfast. My wife puts them in a little box for me. Honestly, I just take what she gives me. I'm not good with remembering names or details. Sorry again. Is it okay if we just skip that part? Maybe my wife can tell you?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. We can absolutely ask your wife. It's very common for patients to have difficulty remembering medication names, and it's helpful that she assists you with that. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don't think so. Nothing I know of, anyway. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything recently. I used to get hay fever as a kid, but I outgrew that, I think. It was just sneezing and itchy eyes. Nothing serious. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, thank you. Childhood hay fever doesn’t typically pose a problem for surgery, but it’s helpful information to have. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had my appendix out when I was younger. That's the only thing I can remember, for sure. And… maybe some dental work? Fillings, I think. But nothing major. Not like a big operation. Does that count? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, thank you. Appendectomy and dental work are both important to document. Next, could you tell me a little bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Oh boy… family medical history… That’s tough. My… my dad had heart problems, I think. And my mom… she had diabetes, maybe? I’m not really sure. We didn’t talk about it much. It was a long time ago, and… we didn’t have a lot of money for doctors back then. I wish I knew more, but I don't. Sorry. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It's common for families to not have detailed medical histories, especially if access to healthcare was limited. Knowing that your father had heart problems and your mother may have had diabetes is helpful, even if we don't have specific details. Now, I'd like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I… I used to drink a little beer sometimes, with friends. But I haven't had a drink in years. And no drugs, never. Just… a regular guy. I like my tea with my wife in the evenings. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, thank you. Now, let's talk a bit about your current weight and height. I see on the form you're 5'0" and 139 pounds. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Oh, uh... Yeah, that sounds right. 5 feet and... well, I guess about 139. It fluctuates a little, you know? It's been… up and down. I haven’t weighed myself recently, to be honest. My wife probably knows better. She's always keeping track of things. I just… try not to think about it too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ll verify those numbers with your wife. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… tell me if anything feels weird, okay? I’m not good with… you know… medical stuff. It makes me nervous. But I'm trying to do this for my health, and for my wife.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. I will explain everything as we go, and please, tell me immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. We will take things at your pace. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just let me know if it's going to hurt. I bruise easily, sometimes. Not a big deal, but… just letting you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know about the bruising. That's helpful. This may feel a little tight, but it shouldn’t be painful. Your blood pressure is 158/92. Your pulse is 88 and regular. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated. We’ll discuss that further. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Is that okay? I'm a little shaky, I think. It's just… being at the doctor's. I don’t like feeling poked and prodded. It reminds me of… never mind. Just tell me if everything looks okay.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs. Your lung sounds are a little diminished, but clear. Now, I’d like to examine your abdomen. Could you please lie back?
PATIENT: Okay. Is this going to be… uncomfortable? I worry about… you know… my stomach. It's… sensitive, sometimes. And I don't want to feel embarrassed. My wife always says I worry too much. But I can't help it.
DOCTOR: We will be very gentle, Mr. Kochubey. I'm simply checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. I'll start by lightly pressing on your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Do you feel any pain here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… a little bit firm, maybe. It's always been that way, I think. My wife says it's because I eat too much. But I can't help it sometimes. Especially when she makes her delicious cookies. Is that okay? Am I talking too much?
DOCTOR: No, you're not talking too much at all, Mr. Kochubey. It's good to know what you're feeling, and your wife's cookies sound wonderful. And what about here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yeah. That's a little… tender. Not painful, exactly. Just… sensitive. Like a dull ache. It's been like that for a while, I think. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s worse after I eat. Especially if I eat something… rich. My wife says I should eat smaller portions. She's probably right. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Mr. Kochubey. Tenderness in the lower abdomen, especially after eating, is something we'll want to investigate further. I’m not overly concerned at this point, but it’s important to understand the cause. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please bend your knees and let your legs dangle freely?
PATIENT: Okay. I’m a little scared I'm going to fall. I'm not very good with balance anymore. My wife says it's because I'm getting old. Is this going to involve hitting my knees with something? I bruise easily, remember?
DOCTOR: No, no hitting your knees, Mr. Kochubey! I simply use a small rubber hammer to gently tap your tendons and check your reflexes. It shouldn’t be painful, and I’ll be very careful. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. Now, let’s take a look at your feet.
PATIENT: Okay. Ooh, that's a little sore. That's where my bunion is, it always hurts when someone touches it. My wife says I should get it fixed, but I'm scared of surgery. It's funny, I'm here about surgery, but I'm scared of it!
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the bunion. It does appear a bit inflamed. And it’s understandable to feel apprehensive about surgery, even when considering it for another issue. Many patients feel that way. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on the exam and what you’ve told me, it’s clear you’ve been experiencing fatigue, shortness of breath, and knee pain, along with some tenderness in your abdomen. We also have slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes. Given your weight and these findings, we’ll need to order some blood work and potentially an imaging study to get a clearer picture of your overall health and determine if you are a suitable candidate for bariatric surgery. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Blood work and… imaging? Is that like an X-ray? I don't mind, as long as it helps. I just want to feel better. It's hard doing things with my grandkids when I'm always tired and out of breath. My wife deserves someone who can keep up with them, too. So, whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… let me know if anything is going to hurt, okay? And… could we schedule this with my wife? She's better at remembering things than I am.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. We will schedule everything with your wife. And I assure you, we’ll do everything possible to minimize any discomfort. The imaging study will likely be an abdominal ultrasound – it doesn’t involve any radiation and is generally painless. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, including your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. I’ll have my assistant, Maria, schedule those tests for you and your wife. She’ll also coordinate a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Maria, huh? Good. My wife loves a good assistant. She's always telling me I need one! Tell her to schedule it whenever’s best for her. She's the organized one. And… thank you, Doctor. For listening, and for not making me feel… silly. I worry a lot, you know? But you made me feel… hopeful. That's good. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It’s my pleasure. And you have no reason to feel silly – your concerns are valid, and I’m here to help. I’m glad I could offer some reassurance. I’ll have Maria come in shortly to schedule those tests. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don't think so. I think I’ve asked everything I need to. My wife will probably have a million questions, though. She always does. Just tell Maria to be prepared! And… thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I appreciate it. I think that’s all. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It was a pleasure meeting you. I look forward to discussing the results with you and your wife soon. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your appointment.
