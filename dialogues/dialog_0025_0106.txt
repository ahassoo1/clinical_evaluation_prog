DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Cannington, I see you're 89 years young. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. Honestly, it's a bother. A real bother. Been having this sore on it for…oh, goodness, a while now. Seems to just get worse, no matter what I do. It’s painful, especially when I try to walk. And I need to walk, you know. Keeps me going.
DOCTOR: A “sore,” you say?
PATIENT: It’s not just a sore, Doctor. It’s an ulcer! A proper hole, practically. And it’s red and…well, unpleasant looking. My daughter keeps fussing over it, telling me I need to come see someone. She worries too much, that girl. But it is painful, I’ll admit. It throbs, especially at night.
DOCTOR: Right. An ulcer. And you say it's been present for…how long, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it must be… well, since before Christmas, certainly. Maybe even November? Time just slips away, you know, when you’ve lived as long as I have. A good two, three months, at least. I tried some ointment, the kind my neighbor uses for her…well, never you mind what her trouble is. Didn't do a lick of good. That’s why I’m here, finally. Though I still think it's probably just a bit of a scratch that won't heal.
DOCTOR: So, two to three months. And the ointment did nothing. Alright. I'm going to need to take a look at this foot. Please, have a seat on the examination table and remove your shoe and sock. And please, try not to exaggerate. I haven’t got all day.
PATIENT: Exaggerate? I don't exaggerate! Honestly, the nerve. Very well. Just let me sit down here… . It’s not as easy as it used to be, you know. And here… . There. Be careful now, it’s quite tender. And don’t go poking around too much!
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, well. It is rather more than a “scratch,” isn't it?
PATIENT: I told you! My daughter fussed and fretted, insisted it was something serious. Honestly, sometimes I think she enjoys seeing me suffer just so she can say “I told you so.” But what is it, Doctor? Is it infected? Will I need…amputation? Don’t look at me like that! I've heard stories, you know. Terrible stories.
DOCTOR: Amputation is a rather extreme thought at this stage, Mrs. Cannington. It does appear to be infected, yes. We'll need to run some tests to determine the severity. I'm ordering a wound culture and a blood test to check for infection levels. It's likely a diabetic ulcer, given your age and the slow healing. Do you have a history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Well, now… … Doctor Thompson, back in the ‘90s, he mentioned something about my sugar being a bit high. He put me on a diet, told me to cut back on the sweets. I did, for a while. Then my husband passed, and…well, sweets are comforting, you know? I haven’t been back to a doctor regularly since then. So, yes, I suppose I have a history, if you want to call it that. A lapsed history, perhaps. Does that change things? Will I need…needles? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: It changes things considerably, Mrs. Cannington. Uncontrolled diabetes significantly impairs healing and increases the risk of complications. And yes, you will likely need blood sugar monitoring, which involves finger pricks. We can discuss options for managing your diabetes, but it is essential. For now, we need to address the infection. I’m prescribing an oral antibiotic. Take it exactly as directed, and finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better. And we absolutely need to get your blood sugar under control. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to review the lab results and discuss a diabetes management plan. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Antibiotics, you say? And more poking and prodding, I presume? . Well, alright. But I want you to know, I’ve lived a long life without all this fuss. And I’m not promising to change my ways. Sweets are a small pleasure, you know. A small pleasure. But if you insist… . Yes, alright. I’ll take the pills. And I’ll try to come back next week. But I make no promises about the sugar. And please, try not to give me too many needles. It’s simply dreadful. Now, can I get dressed? It’s rather chilly in here.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Cannington. The nurse will go over the medication instructions with you. And yes, we’ll try to minimize the discomfort. Now, please get dressed. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: . Always other patients. As if my time isn’t valuable. Honestly, the rudeness of some people. Very well. . Here’s hoping this antibiotic works, and I don’t have to come back for any more…fuss. . Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
