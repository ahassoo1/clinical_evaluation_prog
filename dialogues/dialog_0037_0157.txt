DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start us off, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don’t have time for this. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand you're concerned about the high blood pressure and are worried about the time commitment. We'll certainly try to be efficient. It's important to get this checked out properly, though, so we can make sure we’re addressing everything. To get started, can you tell me a little more about how you found out about the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: My husband’s mother has it, and she kept telling me to get checked. He made the appointment, actually. I felt fine, perfectly fine, until he started worrying. He’s a bit… much sometimes. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: That's good information, Ms. Dudney. It’s helpful to know how this came to our attention. It's good your husband is looking out for you, even if he is a little… enthusiastic. So, just to clarify, you’ve been feeling completely well with no symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Yes, perfectly fine. No headaches, no dizziness, nothing. I work long hours, though. Out in the field, surveying land. It's hot, it's dusty, but I'm used to it. I drink water. Usually. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely matters. Working long hours in the heat and dust is relevant. And it's good you're making an effort to stay hydrated, although “usually” is something we might want to explore a bit more. Just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit more about a typical day for you at work?
PATIENT: It’s… a lot. We’re usually up before sunrise. Drive out to the site – sometimes it's an hour or more, dirt roads, bumpy. Then it’s walking the land with all the equipment, taking measurements, marking things. My team and I, we try to get as much done as possible before it gets too hot. Lunch is whatever we packed – usually sandwiches, chips… not always healthy. Then more walking, more measuring, until it's time to pack up and drive back. Then dinner, then… well, then I’m usually too tired to do much of anything. Honestly, it's exhausting. I’m a technician, I don't sit at a desk all day. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. That is a physically demanding job, and it sounds like you work very hard. And being out in the sun for extended periods can definitely impact your health. Okay, Ms. Dudney, I’m going to ask a few more general health questions. Then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, including checking your blood pressure, of course. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do this afternoon. Do you need a list of everything I eat? Because honestly, it’s not that exciting. Mostly just trying to find something quick and easy.
DOCTOR: No, a detailed food diary isn’t necessary right now. I was just trying to get a sense of your overall lifestyle. We can always revisit that if needed. Let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, asthma, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I’ve always been healthy. Until my husband started fussing, anyway. I had the usual childhood illnesses, chickenpox, measles, but that was a long time ago. I don't take any medications regularly, not even vitamins. He keeps telling me I should, but I just don't bother. Waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No chronic conditions or regular medications. And you said you had the usual childhood illnesses?
PATIENT: Yes, chickenpox, measles, mumps… the normal stuff. I was vaccinated, I think. My mother made sure of that. It was a long time ago, though. I don't remember the details. Honestly, I try not to dwell on the past. It doesn't change anything now, does it?
DOCTOR: You're right, Ms. Dudney. Knowing about the past helps us understand your current health, but it doesn’t define it. Now, thinking about your family... are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: My mother’s side… well, my grandmother had diabetes. And my uncle, on my father’s side, had something with his heart, I think. He died young. But that’s about it, really. Everyone else was pretty healthy, as far as I know. They didn’t go to doctors much. Old-fashioned people, mostly. Believed in letting nature take its course. Not like people these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of diabetes on your mother's side and heart problems in an uncle on your father's side. That's helpful information. Now, just one more set of questions before the exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none. I can eat anything. I haven’t had any reactions to anything, ever. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. He thinks I should be careful with pollen, because of the allergies out here, but I don't bother. It’s just… dust, mostly. And I’ve been breathing that my whole life. I need to get this over with, honestly. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. No known allergies. And I understand your frustration with the length of time. We're almost finished with the questions, then we'll move onto the physical exam. To be thorough, could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: What’s to tell? I work. A lot. I sleep when I can. I don't drink much, maybe a glass of wine on the weekends. I don’t smoke. I don't really have hobbies. Honestly, there’s not much time for anything else. He tries to get me to exercise, but I’m already on my feet all day. What more do you want to know?
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture. You have a very demanding job, and you maintain a fairly healthy lifestyle otherwise. Just a couple more quick questions. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Really? Is this necessary? I don’t see what that has to do with my blood pressure. Look, my husband and I are married. Is that enough information? I'd really like to skip this part if possible. It’s… personal.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask. My apologies, Ms. Dudney. That was inappropriate and unnecessary given your current complaint. We can absolutely skip that part. I should have been more considerate. Let’s move on to the physical exam, if you’re ready. It will just involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief neurological exam. It shouldn't take long. Would you like me to explain each step as I go?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. No, I don’t need an explanation. I’m not a child. I’ve been to a doctor before. Let’s just hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please sit on the examination table, we can begin. I’m going to start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, Ms. Dudney. It's reading 162 over 98. We’ll want to monitor this closely. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath…
PATIENT: I knew it. He was right. Just tell me what it means. Is it serious? I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear, Ms. Dudney. Your pulse is regular. However, as you suspected, your blood pressure is elevated. A single high reading doesn't necessarily mean you have high blood pressure, but it does warrant further investigation. Based on this initial assessment, it appears you have what we call isolated systolic hypertension. It means the top number, your systolic pressure, is higher than normal, while your diastolic pressure is relatively normal. Now, a number this elevated means we need to work to find out the root cause, and ensure it doesn’t cause long-term health complications. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Isolated… what? Look, I don’t understand all that medical jargon. Just tell me in plain English. Is this something I need to worry about? And what do I have to do about it? Because honestly, I don't have time for a lot of tests and appointments.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask for a clearer explanation. Let’s put aside the medical terms. What it means is your blood pressure is higher than it should be. Think of it like a pipe with too much water flowing through it. It puts extra strain on your heart and blood vessels. It is something we need to address, Ms. Dudney. Ignoring it can lead to serious health problems down the road, like heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems. Now, we’ll need to do a few tests to find out what’s causing the high blood pressure, so we can come up with a plan to get it under control. The first step is a simple blood test to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. We’ll also do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. That just involves placing some stickers on your chest to measure your heartbeat. Do you have any questions before we move on?
PATIENT: Stickers? Blood tests? Fine. Just… how long will this take? And can I still go to work tomorrow? I really need to be there. I’m the lead surveyor on the Henderson project. If I miss a day, everything gets delayed. Honestly, this is a disaster.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry about the Henderson project, Ms. Dudney. And I will do my best to minimize any disruption. The blood tests and EKG shouldn't take more than 30-45 minutes. The lab results will take a few days to come back. As for going to work tomorrow, it's perfectly safe. However, I do recommend avoiding strenuous activity for the rest of the day, just to be on the safe side. The priority is to get some baseline information, and then we can create a plan. I want you to feel comfortable, so we will proceed with care. Would you like me to write a note for your employer explaining the situation?
