DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Petrimoulx. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank... I have a problem with... passing gas. A lot of it. It's become quite… noticeable, and frankly, a bit embarrassing. It started a few weeks ago, maybe a month. I'm not sure exactly when.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Passing gas, or flatulence, can certainly be bothersome and embarrassing. It's good you're addressing it. About a month ago… Has it been gradually increasing, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: That is a good question. I believe it started… slowly. At first, it was just a little more than usual, and I didn’t think much of it. But it has been getting… more frequent, yes. And… louder, if I may be so bold. It’s not constant, but it happens many times a day now.
DOCTOR: Not at all, please be as frank as you need to be. That’s helpful information. So, several times a day, and it's been increasing in both frequency and… volume, over the last month. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the increased gas?
PATIENT: That is a very good way to put it, “volume.” Yes, that is accurate. And… no, not really. I don't have any pain. No… bloating, exactly. Perhaps a little discomfort sometimes, but not pain. And no… changes in my… bathroom habits, if you understand what I mean. Just… the gas.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. No pain, no bloating, and no changes in your bowel movements. That's good to know. Let’s talk a little about what you've been eating recently. Has there been any change in your diet over the past month or so?
PATIENT: That is… a very sensible question. Hmm. Let me think. Not a major change, no. I eat… mostly the same things. I work at the burger shop, you see. So I have… burgers sometimes, of course. And fries. And… soda. But I've always eaten those things. I did try a new kind of bean salad at the shop a few weeks ago... around the time it started, now that I think about it. It was… a white bean salad. Perhaps that is the problem?
DOCTOR: That’s very possible, the bean salad. Beans are known to produce gas. And it's good you connected the timing. Do you recall how much of the bean salad you ate?
PATIENT: Hmm. I had a… a fairly large portion, I believe. It was part of my lunch. Maybe… a cup? A large cup. And I had it… three days in a row, I think. It was… quite tasty, actually. But now I am thinking maybe it was too tasty. Perhaps too much of a good thing?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know – a large portion for three days. That certainly could be a contributing factor. Beyond the bean salad, are there any other foods that you’ve noticed seem to make the gas worse?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. Milk. I have a glass of milk with my lunch sometimes. And when I do… it seems to make it worse. Not always, but… often. And… onions. If I have a burger with onions, it is definitely… more noticeable. I didn’t really put two and two together, but… now that you ask… yes. Milk and onions.
DOCTOR: Okay, so milk and onions seem to be triggers as well. That’s very good information. It sounds like you might be experiencing some lactose intolerance, with the milk, and possibly some issues digesting fructans found in onions. We can explore those possibilities further. Do you have any family history of digestive issues, like irritable bowel syndrome, or lactose intolerance?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a… a complicated question. My mother… she had some stomach trouble sometimes. She always complained of… “indigestion,” she called it. But I don’t think she ever saw a doctor about it. And my father… he was a very healthy man. Never any problems. As for lactose… I don’t think anyone in my family ever talked about it. So… I don't know, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible family history of indigestion, but nothing definitive. That's alright. Let's move on to a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'd like to listen to your abdomen to rule out anything else going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… perfectly acceptable. I do not mind at all. Please, go ahead. I am here to… get this sorted out. I hope it is not anything serious. I just want to… be able to eat a burger in peace, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a few deep breaths for me… and another… good. I'm not hearing any abnormal sounds, no signs of distension or tenderness. Your abdomen feels soft and normal to the touch. That’s a good sign. It's unlikely to be anything serious. Based on what you've told me and this exam, it sounds like we're dealing with increased gas likely due to dietary factors. I'd like to recommend a trial of a low-FODMAP diet for a couple of weeks, and potentially trying a lactose-free milk alternative. Have you heard of the low-FODMAP diet before?
PATIENT: No, I have… not heard of that. A low… what did you call it? FODMAP? Is that… complicated? I am not very good with… complicated things. I mostly just make burgers and take orders, you see. Is it… difficult? Will I be able to still eat… some burgers?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright! It sounds a bit daunting, but it's not as complicated as it seems. FODMAP stands for Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols, which are types of carbohydrates that can be poorly absorbed in the gut, leading to gas and bloating. The idea is to temporarily reduce foods high in FODMAPs to see if your symptoms improve, then slowly reintroduce them to identify your triggers. And yes, you can still eat some burgers! It’s about making a few adjustments. You'll want to avoid onions in the burger, and maybe limit the portion size. We have some resources here – a handout and a website – that list foods to avoid and those that are okay. Would you like me to go over some of the basics with you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very helpful. Avoiding onions… I can do that. They make me cry anyway. A handout and website… that sounds good. And if I understand correctly, this is a… temporary thing? I don't have to give up burgers forever? That would be… a very sad day indeed.
DOCTOR: That's correct. This is a temporary elimination diet, usually for 2-6 weeks. The goal isn't to eliminate these foods forever, but to identify which ones are causing your symptoms so you can manage your diet and enjoy the foods you like – burgers included! This handout lists high-FODMAP foods – things like onions, garlic, apples, pears, dairy, beans, and some artificial sweeteners. We’ll focus on avoiding those for a few weeks. Then, we slowly reintroduce them, one at a time, to see how your body reacts. The website has more detailed information and recipes. It's Monash University’s FODMAP diet app, and it’s a very reliable resource. I'll also write a note for your primary care physician outlining this plan. Do you feel comfortable starting with this approach?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe… I can manage that. Avoiding onions and… some fruit. And being careful with dairy. It sounds… a little bit difficult, but… if it means I can still eat a burger occasionally, I am willing to try. I will look at the website. And thank you for… writing a note for the doctor. I appreciate that. I just want to… stop feeling so… gassy, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand perfectly. It sounds like you have a good attitude about this, and that's half the battle. So, to summarize, we're going to try a low-FODMAP diet for 2-6 weeks, avoiding high-FODMAP foods. We'll focus on limiting onions, dairy, and certain fruits initially. I recommend keeping a food diary to track your symptoms and what you're eating, so we can pinpoint your triggers more easily. I'll write the note to your doctor, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to discuss your progress. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: A food diary… that is… a good idea. I can write that down. And a follow-up… yes, that is good too. I don’t think I have any… other questions at the moment. You have explained everything very… clearly. Thank you, Doctor Petrimoulx. I feel much better already. Even if I am going to have to give up onions for a little while.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'm glad I could help. And don't worry too much about the onions! You might be surprised at how many foods you can still enjoy. If you have any questions or concerns between now and your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s a card with our number. I wish you all the best with the low-FODMAP diet. And remember, you can still enjoy a burger occasionally. .
PATIENT: Yes, thank you very much. I will… call if I have any problems. And… I will try not to worry about the onions too much.
