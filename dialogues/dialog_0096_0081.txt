DOCTOR: Alright then, Jailia. Have a seat. Now, you're eighteen, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Eighteen years of age, precisely. And if you don’t mind me saying, I find this initial assessment… rather unnecessary. It's quite obvious, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Obvious to you, perhaps. But I’ve been a doctor for fourteen years, dear, and "obvious" isn’t a clinical finding. Now, let’s not waste time. Tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, as my paperwork clearly states – and I trust your staff are competent enough to have relayed this information – I am experiencing… a decline in my physical condition. Specifically, unwanted weight loss, coupled with debilitating fatigue and, quite frankly, alarming night sweats. It's disrupting my schedule, and frankly, it's inconvenient. I’m a graphic designer, you see, and one requires a certain… level of presentability and energy for client meetings.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I see the notes here. “Decline in physical condition.” Very… vague. "Unwanted weight loss" – how much weight, exactly?
PATIENT: Approximately… seven kilograms, over the last three months. It’s a substantial amount, Doctor. And I assure you, it is unwanted. I maintain a very disciplined lifestyle, and this… regression is quite perplexing. I do Pilates three times a week, and my diet is meticulously planned. It’s not as if I’m indulging in… unhealthy habits.
DOCTOR: Pilates, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Reformer Pilates, specifically. At “Core Balance Studio” on Elm Street. A highly reputable establishment, I might add. It’s quite rigorous, and I’ve been attending consistently for the past year. The instructor, Ms. Eleanor Vance, is exceptionally qualified. I fail to see how this is relevant, however, given the… sudden onset of these symptoms. Are you implying my exercise routine is somehow flawed?
DOCTOR: I'm not implying anything, dear. I'm simply trying to get a complete picture. And frankly, you’re volunteering a lot of unnecessary details. Let’s stick to the medical facts. Have you had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms besides the weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. Certainly not. And chills are… rather unpleasant, and I haven’t experienced any. As for other symptoms… my appetite has been slightly diminished, although I attribute that to the general malaise. And… occasionally, a mild headache. Nothing debilitating, of course. I’ve also noticed a… slight increase in my thirst. But I’m a very active individual, so I assumed it was simply dehydration. Though, now that I mention it, it is more pronounced than usual. Do you have a particular theory, Doctor? I trust you haven't simply dismissed this as… stress?
DOCTOR: Stress?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It wouldn’t be the first time a perfectly legitimate ailment was attributed to… emotional factors. I assure you, my life is quite organized. I have a supportive husband, a successful career, and a very structured routine. While I acknowledge that modern life can be… demanding, I am perfectly capable of managing my responsibilities. I simply require a diagnosis, and, ideally, a solution. Is a blood test in order, perhaps? I’ve read extensively about differential diagnoses, and I suspect something more… systemic is at play.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves with self-diagnosis, dear. A blood test is standard procedure. And we'll do a physical exam, of course. Now, have you noticed any swollen lymph nodes?
PATIENT: Swollen… lymph nodes? I confess, Doctor, I am not in the habit of routinely palpating my neck. I leave such examinations to qualified professionals, which is precisely why I am here. Though, now that you mention it… there was a slight tenderness behind my ear a few weeks ago. I dismissed it as… muscle strain. I do spend a considerable amount of time hunched over my computer, designing graphics, as I’ve already explained. Is that relevant, Doctor? I find this line of questioning rather… haphazard.
DOCTOR: Haphazard?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. With all due respect, it feels as though you are proceeding without a clear methodology. I provided a concise summary of my symptoms, and you’ve responded with… a series of unrelated inquiries. It's rather inefficient. Are you familiar with the principles of evidence-based medicine, Doctor? Perhaps a more focused approach would be… beneficial. And might I inquire as to your specialization? Are you a general practitioner, or do you have expertise in… internal medicine? My husband insists on a thorough investigation, and I’m inclined to agree.
DOCTOR: Internal Medicine, dear. Fourteen years. Now, let's get this exam over with. Please, if you could just lie down on the examination table. And try to relax. It will make things easier for both of us.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must caution you, I am rather particular about hygiene. I trust the examination table is thoroughly sanitized? And please, do refrain from asking any further… irrelevant questions. I’m beginning to feel quite… drained. I hope this process will be expeditious.
DOCTOR: Table is sanitized. Please lie down. I need to listen to your heart and lungs first. And please, try not to talk while I'm listening. It makes it difficult to concentrate.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must reiterate, I find this entire process… rather undignified. I trust you have a clean stethoscope? One wouldn’t want to… compromise my health further. Proceed, if you must, but please be gentle. I have a very sensitive constitution.
DOCTOR: Breathing is slightly diminished on the right side. Heart rate is normal, but a little fast. Any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Asthma? Absolutely not, Doctor. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, as I’ve repeatedly emphasized. Bronchitis… perhaps a mild chest cold several years ago, but nothing requiring medical intervention. I attribute my… current condition to a systemic issue, perhaps hormonal imbalance or… even a subtle infection. I’ve been researching various possibilities online, and I believe a comprehensive blood panel is essential. Are you prepared to order one, Doctor? I trust you have access to a reputable laboratory? And might I inquire as to the turnaround time for the results? My husband is quite anxious, and I'd like to provide him with some reassurance as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: "Researching online," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am a highly informed individual, and I believe it is prudent to be proactive in one's healthcare. I am not simply content to… passively accept a diagnosis without having conducted thorough research beforehand. The internet provides a wealth of information, and I have carefully vetted numerous sources. I understand that it is not a substitute for professional medical advice, but it allows me to… articulate my concerns more effectively. And frankly, Doctor, I find your skepticism rather… condescending. Are you implying that my research is… unreliable? Perhaps you underestimate my intellectual capabilities.
DOCTOR: Look, dear. I appreciate your… enthusiasm. But frankly, you’re distracting me. Let's just finish the exam. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Please, relax your stomach muscles. And please, try not to tense up. It makes it difficult to assess anything.
PATIENT: I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly relaxed. It is simply… my natural physique. I maintain a very disciplined core, as I’ve already mentioned. Pilates, you see. It requires a considerable amount of… abdominal control. And frankly, I find this examination rather… invasive. Are you certain this is necessary? Perhaps a less… tactile approach would be preferable. I trust you are employing proper hygiene protocols? And might I inquire as to the purpose of this particular maneuver? Is it to assess potential organ enlargement or… something else entirely? I trust you will refrain from any… unnecessary pressure. My husband will be quite displeased if I return home with any… bruising.
