DOCTOR: Hi Chelise, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, the nurse told me it was about my cholesterol. It was high, she said. I don't really understand what that means, exactly, but I figured I should get it checked out. I feel perfectly fine, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a perfectly good reason to come in. High cholesterol is something we definitely want to take a look at, even if you're feeling fine. A lot of times, there aren’t any symptoms until something more serious happens. Let me just take a look at the results the nurse mentioned… Okay, I see here your total cholesterol is elevated, as is your LDL – that's the "bad" cholesterol. Your HDL, the "good" cholesterol, is a little on the lower side. Before we jump into treatment options, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. “Bad” and “good” cholesterol… I can try to remember that. Let's see… medical history. Not much, really. I've been pretty healthy my whole life. Had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… but nothing serious. No big illnesses, no surgeries, haven’t broken any bones. My mom had… something with her heart when she was older, but I don't remember the details. She passed away a few years back. I don’t have any allergies, and I’m not taking any medications regularly. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Family history is important, so anything you do remember about your mom’s heart condition is helpful, even if it's vague. We can always try to get more information later if needed. Okay, so no major medical problems, no surgeries, no allergies, no current medications. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he tried it for a bit when he was younger, but he quit years ago. He passed away five years ago, too. I try to be pretty healthy. I walk most days, about thirty minutes or so. I like gardening, that’s good exercise, right? And I eat… well, I try to eat healthy. I like to cook, but sometimes it's easier to just grab something quick. Do you need to know what I usually eat?
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your husband. It sounds like you've been through a lot. And yes, knowing what you typically eat would be helpful. It doesn't need to be a perfect detailed list, just a general idea of what a typical day looks like for you, meal-wise. Also, how often do you eat out?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It's alright, it was a long time ago. Okay, food. Let me think. Breakfast is usually oatmeal, with some fruit. Sometimes toast. Lunch… that varies. If I'm home, a sandwich, maybe a salad. If I'm out, probably a soup and salad thing. Dinner… I try to make something with vegetables and a protein, like chicken or fish. But honestly, maybe three or four nights a week I just… heat something up, or get takeout. Pizza, Chinese… stuff like that. I do like a glass of wine with dinner, most nights. Does that sound bad? I go out to eat… maybe once a week, usually with friends.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound bad, Chelise, it sounds pretty normal! It's good to be honest about these things. The wine, that’s something we’ll factor in. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just a general look around. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I always feel a bit funny when someone listens to my heart. It’s probably beating too fast just from talking! But go ahead. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel that way! It's just a routine part of the exam. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 142/88. Not terribly high, but something we want to keep an eye on. I'll also quickly palpate your abdomen... no tenderness or masses noted. Everything seems okay from a basic physical exam, but the elevated blood pressure and your cholesterol levels definitely warrant further investigation. I think the next step would be to repeat the cholesterol test to confirm the results. We should also do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Confirm the results, check my kidneys, blood sugar… absolutely. I want to know what’s going on, so whatever you recommend is good with me. I'm happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. Is it… is it something serious? I mean, I feel fine. Are these numbers really that worrying?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Chelise. It's good you're asking. The numbers do put you at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease—heart attack and stroke—but it doesn't mean you will develop those things. This is why we're being proactive. Many things contribute to heart disease, and high cholesterol is just one of them. We can manage this with lifestyle changes—diet, exercise—and if necessary, medication. The goal is to lower your cholesterol and blood pressure to reduce your risk. Right now, it’s more about prevention than emergency treatment. I would also recommend we rule out any underlying causes of the high cholesterol, just to be thorough. I’m going to order the blood work now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the samples. After we get the results back—usually takes a few days—we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Prevention is always best. And explaining everything like that makes me feel a lot better. So, just the blood work for now, and then we'll see what the results say. Okay. I can do that. Please let me know if there's anything I need to do to prepare for the blood draw. And thank you for taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It’s very… reassuring.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chelise. I'm glad I could reassure you. The only preparation for the blood draw is to fast for 12 hours beforehand – so no eating or drinking anything except water. The nurse will give you specific instructions. I'll have the nurse come in now to get that arranged. In the meantime, if you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to ask. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. I’m all set for now. Just waiting for the nurse. Thank you again for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. It’s a weight off my mind, honestly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chelise. I'm happy to help. I'll let you get settled, and the nurse will be in shortly. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Goodbye!
