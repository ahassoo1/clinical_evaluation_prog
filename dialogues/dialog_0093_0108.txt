DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, well, it’s… unpleasant. Been throwing up blood, mostly. Not a ton, but enough to worry a fella. And it smells… well, you can imagine. Happened a couple times now, over the last few days. It's not like I'm expecting a parade, but it's not normal, is it?
DOCTOR: Certainly not normal, Mr. Gentz, and I understand your concern. Vomiting blood – even a small amount – warrants investigation. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Describe it? What’s to describe? It’s red. Like… blood. Look, I’m not a doctor, alright? I deal with… other things. It’s not bright red, if that makes a difference. More… dark. Like coffee grounds, maybe? I saw that on TV once. And it’s mixed with… everything else, naturally. Not just straight blood, if that’s what you’re getting at. Honestly, it's just… gross. Is this really necessary? Asking a man to talk about his vomit... it's a bit much, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You are quite right to find the topic unpleasant, Mr. Gentz, and I apologize for having to ask. However, the color and consistency of the blood are important clues. The fact that it resembles coffee grounds is particularly noteworthy, as that suggests it may have been partially digested in the stomach. To clarify, has this been happening with every instance of vomiting, or just some of them?
PATIENT: Look, I told ya, a couple times. Not every time I feel sick, no. Just… when it’s bad. Real bad. Like, cramping, sweating, the whole nine yards. And yeah, the coffee ground stuff was with those times. The other times it’s just… regular sick. You know, what you’d expect. I haven’t been eating much lately though, truth be told. Everything tastes like ash. Makes it hard to keep anything down. Especially after… well, after my wife passed. Lost my appetite, haven’t really gotten it back. Does that matter? It's been almost a year now.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Gentz, that absolutely matters. The loss of appetite following your wife’s passing is significant, and I am very sorry for your loss. Grief can certainly affect one’s physical health. The decreased appetite and subsequent nausea, combined with the vomiting of blood, gives me some initial thoughts, but we need to gather more information. To continue, have you noticed any abdominal pain, aside from the cramping you mentioned during the vomiting episodes?
PATIENT: Pain? Yeah, some. Not constant, though. Comes and goes. It's… hard to describe. Like a dull ache, mostly in the upper part of my stomach. Feels… bloated, too. Like I ate a whole Thanksgiving dinner. And it's worse when I try to… well, when I try to eat anything. Which, like I said, isn't much these days. Honestly, Doc, I feel like somethin’s just… wrong. I haven't felt right since… since everything happened. Is it possible it's just stress? A bad stomach? I don't want a bunch of tests if it's just gonna be somethin' simple. I ain't got the money for that, you know. No insurance. Not since… well.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about costs, Mr. Gentz, and we will certainly proceed with caution and only order what is absolutely necessary. The bloating, the dull ache in the upper abdomen, and the association with eating are all important pieces of the puzzle. Given your history and the presence of blood in your vomit, it would be unwise to simply attribute this to stress alone. To help me rule out more serious causes, I would like to ask about any other symptoms. Have you noticed any black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Tarry… what now? Like… really dark poop? Yeah, actually. Now that you mention it, it’s been… darker than usual. Stickier, too. Harder to… well, you know. Haven't paid much attention, to be honest. I just… deal with things. I've always been a practical man. But yeah, it’s been black. Like… oil. Not normal, I guess. Look, I don’t want to make a big deal outta nothin', Doc. Just tell me if it's somethin’ I gotta worry about. And if it's gonna cost me a fortune to find out, I need to know upfront. I'm on a fixed income, and my wife… well, she handled the finances. I’m just not good with that stuff.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I appreciate your honesty and your practicality. The black, tarry stools are a significant finding, and combined with the vomiting blood and your other symptoms, it does raise some concern. This suggests there may be bleeding in your upper digestive tract. I understand your financial concerns, and I will be transparent with you regarding any tests we order. At this point, to get a clearer picture of what's happening, I would like to order a complete blood count to assess your overall health and look for signs of anemia, and a stool test to confirm the presence of blood. We may also need to consider an upper endoscopy, but we can discuss the costs and benefits of that procedure further if the initial tests warrant it. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not that I know of. Never been much for pills, if I can help it. A little aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's about it. No reactions, no nothin’. And, uh… I don’t think so. I’m pretty sure. My wife always handled the doctor stuff. She remembered everything. I just… went along for the ride. It's just… it's hard to think straight these days. This is a lot to take in, Doc. Bleedin’… endoscopy… It sounds serious. What are you thinkin’? Is it somethin’ bad? Be straight with me. I'm a practical man, remember? I can handle the truth.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask directly, Mr. Gentz, and I will be straight with you. The combination of symptoms – the vomiting blood, the coffee-ground emesis, the black, tarry stools, and the upper abdominal discomfort – suggests a potential issue in your upper digestive tract, such as a stomach ulcer or bleeding in the esophagus. These conditions can be serious if left untreated. While it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, we need to investigate further to determine the cause and severity of the bleeding. The CBC and stool test will provide valuable information, and if those results are concerning, we will discuss the possibility of an upper endoscopy, which allows us to visualize the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to identify the source of the bleeding. I want to assure you that we will proceed cautiously and discuss all options with you before making any decisions. We can also explore financial assistance programs to help with the cost of testing and treatment. Before we proceed with the tests, let's quickly review your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or liver disease?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. Heart disease, not that I know of. My wife always said I was as healthy as a horse, stubborn as one too. Liver… I don’t drink, never have. She always worried about my stomach, though. Said I had heartburn something awful. Used to take those little pink pills… Maalox, I think? For years. Just to keep the acid down. That’s all. Nothing else. She always told me to watch my diet, not eat too much spicy food. But I liked spicy food. And I liked my wife too much to argue. Look, Doc, is this somethin’ I got from eatin’ too much chili? Is that it? Because I can stop eatin’ chili. I really can.
DOCTOR: It’s possible that diet could be a contributing factor, Mr. Gentz, and reducing spicy foods is certainly a reasonable step to take. However, heartburn and long-term use of antacids like Maalox can sometimes mask underlying issues, and the bleeding we’re seeing could be due to something more serious. It’s unlikely to be solely due to chili, though modifying your diet won't hurt. To get a clearer picture, let's proceed with the blood and stool tests. While we’re waiting for those results, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements?
PATIENT: Like I said, Doc, not much. Just a little aspirin now and then for a headache. Maybe once a month, if that. And, uh… I take a multivitamin. Just a cheap one from the drugstore. Helps with the appetite, or so my wife said. That’s it. Nothing else. I don’t believe in pills. Always said they just mask the problem. I tried one of them blood pressure things once, but it made me feel awful, so I stopped. She didn’t like that. She always said I was stubborn. I reckon she was right. This is all a lot of fuss over nothin’, ain’t it? I just need to get back to work. I got things to do. Bills to pay. A house to maintain. Can we just get this over with, Doc? I’m startin’ to feel lightheaded.
DOCTOR: You are right to be concerned about feeling lightheaded, Mr. Gentz, and we will proceed as quickly as possible. The lightheadedness could be related to the blood loss, and it’s important to address this promptly. I’m going to order the CBC and stool test immediately. I'll also have the nurse take your blood pressure and pulse to get a baseline reading. While we're waiting for the results, I'd like to examine your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Examine my… stomach? Look, I ain’t one for bein’ poked and prodded, Doc. But… alright. If you gotta. Just be gentle, alright? I’m a sensitive man, despite what folks say. And don’t go lookin’ for nothin’ fancy. It’s just indigestion, probably. Stress, like you said. But please, hurry up. I don’t like bein’ laid up. It makes me anxious. And… can I have a glass of water? My mouth’s all dry. This whole thing is makin’ me nervous. Really nervous. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I will be as gentle as possible. Just let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I am noticing some tenderness in the upper abdomen, particularly in the epigastric region. It’s not severe, but it's present. There is no guarding or rebound tenderness, and I don’t feel any masses. Your abdomen is slightly distended, but that could be related to the bloating you mentioned. I’ve finished the abdominal exam. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw blood for the CBC and collect a stool sample. While we're waiting for the results, I will review your history again and prepare a plan of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? Uh… Yeah, actually. How long is this gonna take? The blood test, the stool… everything. I got work to do, Doc. And… what if it is somethin’ bad? What’s the worst-case scenario? Be straight with me. I can handle it. I’ve handled worse. But I need to know. I need to be prepared. And… will this be expensive? I’m really worried about the money. No insurance, like I said. I don’t want to end up bankrupt over this. And… is it contagious? I don’t want to get anyone sick. I’m a practical man, Doc. I need facts. Not fancy medical jargon. Just the straight truth. Please.
DOCTOR: Those are all very important questions, Mr. Gentz, and I will answer them as honestly and directly as possible. The blood test and stool sample should take approximately 30-45 minutes to process. We should have the initial results within a couple of hours. Regarding the worst-case scenario, the symptoms you are experiencing could indicate a more serious condition such as a bleeding ulcer, gastritis, or, less likely, a more severe issue like stomach cancer. However, it’s important to remember that these are just possibilities at this point, and we need the test results to determine the exact cause. If it is a bleeding ulcer, treatment typically involves medication to reduce stomach acid and promote healing. In some cases, an endoscopy may be necessary to stop the bleeding. Regarding the cost, I understand your concerns. The blood test and stool sample will likely cost between $150-$250. If an endoscopy is required, the cost will be significantly higher, potentially $1000-$2000. We can explore financial assistance programs and payment plans to help manage the costs. I also have information on local charities that may be able to provide assistance. And finally, no, this is not contagious. It’s related to an issue within your digestive system and cannot be spread to others. I want to assure you that we will proceed cautiously and explore all possible options. We will work together to determine the best course of action and manage any potential costs. Now, let’s focus on getting those tests completed. The nurse will be here shortly to assist you. Do you have any immediate questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, I hear you. A thousand to two thousand dollars… That’s… that’s a lot. I don’t know how I’m gonna swing that. But I guess I don’t have much choice, do I? I need to know what’s wrong. No, I don’t think so. No more questions right now. Just… get it over with. And… thanks, Doc. For bein’ straight with me. It ain’t easy, hearin’ things like that. But I appreciate it. Just… let the nurse come. I’m ready. I guess.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gentz. I will let the nurse know you are ready. Please, try to relax. We will take things one step at a time. I will be back to discuss the results as soon as they are available. .
