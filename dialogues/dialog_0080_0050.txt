DOCTOR: Hi Brodie, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… good to meet you too, I think. My… cough. That’s what brought me in. It’s been… a while now. A dry cough. Just… keeps happening. I don’t really… remember when it started, exactly. Just always seems to be there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough that’s been going on for a while. I understand. It's tough when something just…hangs on. You said it’s dry – meaning it doesn’t bring up any mucus?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Dry. No… nothing comes up when I cough. Just… air. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. More like… irritating. Like something’s tickling my throat, and I have to cough. Does that make sense? I… I forget if I explain things well.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Brodie. No need to worry about explaining things – I’m happy to help you sort it out. And it's good it's not painful, just irritating. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. That’s a good question. I… I think maybe when it's cold? Or… dry air. Like when the heater’s been on a long time. But… honestly, I mostly just notice it all the time. It doesn’t really seem to get much better with anything, either. I've tried… water, I think? And… some lozenges once. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be aggravated by cold or dry air, and hasn't really responded to simple remedies like water or lozenges. Have you had a fever, chills, or any shortness of breath along with the cough?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. Not that I remember. I… sometimes feel a little tired, but I'm 90 years old, so… that's probably just old age. Shortness of breath… not really. I get a little winded going upstairs, but I always have. It's not… new. I hope that makes sense. I'm not very good at remembering things these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no new shortness of breath, just usual fatigue for your age. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any health problems that you've been diagnosed with before?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a hard one. I… I’ve been to doctors, of course, over the years. But I… I don’t really remember what they said. Maybe… something with my heart, a long time ago? And… arthritis, I think? My joints ache, but… that’s just getting old, isn’t it? I don’t know if I’ve ever had anything serious. My wife… she used to keep track of all that. It’s been a few years since she passed.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brodie. It's completely okay if you don't remember everything. We’ll do our best to piece things together. Knowing about possible heart issues and arthritis is good. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries… I think I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. That was… painful, I remember that. And… I was in the hospital once when I broke my hip. That was… a while back. Maybe ten years ago? Fifteen? I… it’s hard to remember dates. Everything feels like a long time ago now. I don't recall anything else major.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a hip fracture. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I take… a little pill for my blood pressure, I think? A small white one. My daughter… she brings it to me. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis when my joints are really bothering me. Ibuprofen, maybe? Or… naproxen? Something like that. I don’t really pay attention to the names. I mostly just take what she tells me to. And no… I don't take any of those herbal things. I don't really believe in them.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for blood pressure and ibuprofen or naproxen for arthritis. And you don’t have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No… no allergies, not that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years. My wife used to make… everything. Spicy food, seafood… never had a problem. And… I haven't been stung by a bee or anything like that, either. Just… getting older, that’s the biggest problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brodie. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, alright? My bones… they're not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Okay. Lungs sound a little… diminished, but no wheezing or crackles that I can hear right now. Now, let's check your heart rate and blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/85. Heart rate is regular, but a bit slow at 68. And finally, let's just take a look at your throat. Say "ah" for me. Throat looks a little dry, but no obvious signs of infection. Now, let’s take a quick look at your oxygen level using this little clip on your finger. Oxygen saturation is 94%, which is good. All right, Brodie. Everything seems to be within reasonable limits, but given your cough and age, I think it would be a good idea to get a chest X-ray to rule out anything serious, like pneumonia or congestion. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… hmm. That sounds… serious. Is it expensive? I don't really… have much money. And… does it hurt? I don't like being poked and prodded. I just want to get rid of this cough, that's all. But if you think it’s necessary… I suppose I can do it. Just… tell me how much it will cost.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Brodie. It's perfectly reasonable to be worried about the cost and discomfort. A chest X-ray is generally very quick and doesn’t involve any poking or prodding, you just stand still for a moment while the machine takes the picture. As for the cost, it can vary, but since you don’t have insurance, the clinic offers a discounted rate of $75 for self-pay patients. We can also discuss payment plans if that would be helpful. And to be clear, I’m recommending it not because I think something is definitely wrong, but as a precautionary measure. Your age and the persistence of the cough warrant a closer look. It will give us peace of mind. If the X-ray is clear, then we can focus on managing your cough symptomatically, perhaps with a prescription cough suppressant and some advice on staying hydrated and avoiding irritants. What do you think?
PATIENT: $75… well, that’s… not as bad as I thought. Still… I don't really like spending money. But you're right, peace of mind… that’s important. And I do want to get rid of this cough. Alright, Doctor, you talked me into it. Let’s do the X-ray. But… tell me, how long will it take? And… will I have to stand up? My knees… they aren’t very good.
DOCTOR: That’s a great decision, Brodie. You won't regret it. The X-ray itself only takes a few minutes – maybe five at most. And no, you won’t have to stand. You can sit in a chair during the scan. The technician will help position you comfortably. We have a very nice technician, she's very gentle. I’ll write an order for the X-ray now, and then I’ll have the nurse escort you over to the radiology department. They’re just down the hall. Once the radiologist reads the results, we'll review them together and discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Sitting is much better. And a gentle technician… that’s good to hear. Alright. Let’s get it done. I just… hope it doesn’t take too long. I have… a little nap I was planning on taking later. Old bones need their rest, you know. But… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Brodie. Rest is very important. I completely understand. I'll have the nurse come in and escort you to radiology right away. She'll take good care of you. And don't hesitate to ask her any questions you might have. We’ll get to the bottom of this cough and hopefully get you back to your naps in no time. Just one moment… While we're waiting, is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… getting rid of this cough. That’s all I want. Thank you again, Doctor Rosanova. You’ve been very patient with an old man like me. I appreciate it. Now… I just hope this X-ray doesn't find anything too bad. But… I trust you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brodie. And please don't worry, we'll take things one step at a time. It's good that you trust me, and I'll do my best to provide you with the best care possible. We'll wait for the results together. Ah, Nurse Anya, thank you for coming. This is Brodie, and he’s going to head over to radiology for a chest X-ray. Can you please escort him and help him get settled?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: You have a good day, Brodie, and please let us know if you have any questions or concerns after the X-ray. Please ensure he’s comfortable and informed throughout the process. And let me know if there are any issues. .
