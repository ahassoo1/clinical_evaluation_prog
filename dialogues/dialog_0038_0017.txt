DOCTOR: Good morning, Danny. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Auelua, you say? Hmm. Yes, well, I’m here for… a check-up. For the team. You know, the… the sports thing. I gotta get cleared. It’s… important. I think. It’s been a while since I had one of these.
DOCTOR: Okay, a check-up for the team. That's good to be proactive. And you said it's been a while?
PATIENT: A long while. Years, I reckon. Maybe… ten? Something like that. It’s hard to keep track. Used to be… easier. Before. Things. I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. They just want me to get a paper signed, I think. So I can play. It’s… baseball. Or softball. One of those. It involves a bat.
DOCTOR: Alright, ten years is a good while, no worries, we can get you sorted. And it's good you're getting it checked out before playing, even if it's just to get a paper signed. Baseball or softball, excellent! So, just to clarify, are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or other symptoms right now that are concerning you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… No, not really. Everything feels… okay. A little creaky, maybe? Old age, you know? But nothing… bad. I can still swing the bat pretty good, I think. Though sometimes my shoulder… feels a bit tight. But that’s just from… using it, I suppose. It's probably nothing. Honestly, I mostly just want to get this over with so I can go. I have things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little creaky and some shoulder tightness. That's helpful to know. And you think it's related to playing?
PATIENT: Well, it happens when I play. Or when I try to, anyway. It’s not… constant. Just a little ache sometimes after I throw the ball. Or swing. It’s… probably just old age, like I said. I don't want to make a fuss about nothing, you understand? I’m not one for complaining. Just need a doctor to say I’m okay and I can get back to it. It's important to stay active, you know? Can't just sit around.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, staying active is important. We'll definitely try to get you sorted. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about this shoulder tightness?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s hard to explain. It’s… not a sharp pain. More like a… pulling feeling? When I lift my arm to throw. Or when I swing hard. It doesn’t bother me all the time, just… when I use it a lot. And it usually goes away after a little bit. I just rub it, you know? Seems to help. I’ve been doing that for years. It's probably just a muscle, I figure. Old muscles. They get… tight. It's nothing serious, really. I hope.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pulling feeling when lifting your arm to throw or swing, relieved with rubbing. That gives me a better idea. And it sounds like it's been happening for a while. Just to be thorough, have you ever injured your shoulder before?
PATIENT: Injured…? Hmm. Now you’re asking me things… Years ago, maybe? I played a lot of baseball when I was younger. A lot of rough play. I think… I think I might have dislocated it once? Or twisted it badly? It was a long time ago, I don’t remember the details. It didn’t seem that bad at the time. I just… wrapped it up and kept playing. Back then, you just ignored the pain, you know? Different times. I don’t even know if that’s what happened, to be honest. Things get fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible past shoulder dislocation or injury. That's good to know. We'll need to take that into account. To get a better understanding of things, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Now you're asking the hard questions. Honestly, Doctor, I don't really have a medical history. I don't go to the doctor much. Never have. I’ve been pretty lucky, I suppose. Just the usual… colds, flu, that sort of thing. No serious illnesses, no operations, nothing like that. I think I had the flu shot a few years back, but that's about it. My ex-wife used to drag me to the doctor, but… well, that was a long time ago. I honestly don't remember anything specific. I hope that's helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Danny. It's good to know you generally stay healthy. No major illnesses or surgeries is good. And it’s fine if you don’t recall much. Let's talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant conditions… Hmm. My mother… she had… something with her heart, I think. She was always tired. But she lived to be a good age, I remember that. And my father… he had diabetes, I believe. He always had to watch what he ate. But that was a long time ago, and honestly, I don't remember much about it. They’re both… gone now. I don’t really talk about it much. I have a sister, but we don’t see each other often. I wouldn’t know what’s going on with her, to be honest. It’s been… years. Is that helpful? I'm trying to remember, but… it’s hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mother with a heart condition and a father with diabetes. That’s helpful to know, thank you. Just to round things out, are you currently taking any medications, and do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Not a one. Never been much of a pill-taker. I prefer to… tough things out, you know? Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I think I might be a little sensitive to… dust, maybe? I sneeze a bit sometimes. And I don’t like bee stings, but that’s just common sense, isn’t it? Nothing serious, nothing I need to carry an EpiPen for. Just the usual… stuff. I’m pretty healthy, like I said. Mostly just creaky. And a little sore sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or serious allergies. That's good. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on with your shoulder, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just checking your range of motion and feeling around a bit. It shouldn’t take too long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Yes, yes, that’s fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do, you know? But yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright? It’s a bit sensitive. And try to be quick. I appreciate it. Do I need to… undress or anything?
DOCTOR: No need to undress, Danny. Just a quick look and feel around your shoulder. I'll have you lift your arm a few different ways, and I'll gently feel for tenderness. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything is painful. Okay, can you slowly lift your right arm straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: There we go… It’s a little stiff. You can feel that, right? A little… tight. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a… pulling sensation. Like a rubber band stretching too much. I try to lift it higher, but it’s uncomfortable. I stop halfway. It’s not bad, but… you can feel it. It’s been like this for a while, honestly. I just ignore it. It doesn’t really bother me much. Unless… you poke it. And you are poking it, aren't you?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am gently palpating to feel for tenderness. And you’re right, I can feel some tightness in the rotator cuff muscles. There’s some discomfort with that movement, and some tenderness when I press here… That’s consistent with some possible rotator cuff strain. Now, can you rotate your arm inwards, like you're reaching behind your back?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… not comfortable. A little ache in the back of the shoulder. It feels… tight. Like something is… stuck. I try to go further, but it’s painful. I stop halfway. See? It's not bad bad, but it’s definitely not good. I don’t usually do that movement, to be honest. It’s not something I need to do when I play baseball. Or softball. Whatever it is. It’s just… stiff. Maybe I need to warm up more? I used to be more flexible, when I was younger. Things get… old, you know? Is that bad? Am I going to need an operation? I don’t want an operation.
DOCTOR: Okay, that movement definitely elicits some discomfort. And no, Danny, it doesn't sound like you need an operation at this point. This sounds more like a rotator cuff strain, possibly aggravated by some previous injury or overuse. We'll need to confirm that with some imaging, but for now, let's talk about what we can do. First, can you describe your typical warm-up routine before you play?
PATIENT: Warm-up routine…? Hmm. That’s a good question. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t really have a warm-up routine. I usually just… start throwing. A few practice swings. You know, get the muscles loose. I don’t spend a lot of time stretching. Never really have. It always seemed like a waste of time. I just get out there and play. I’ve been doing that for years. It’s never bothered me much before. Until… recently. Maybe I should stretch more? My sister always tells me to stretch more. She’s very… health conscious. But I just… don’t have the patience for it. Is that bad? Am I going to need to start stretching now? It sounds… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a limited warm-up. That could definitely be contributing to this. Stretching is important, but we can start slowly. We’ll work on some simple exercises to improve your range of motion and strengthen the muscles around your shoulder. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order an X-ray to rule out any bone issues. And an MRI would be helpful to see the soft tissues, like the rotator cuff tendons, more clearly. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray… MRI… Sounds… complicated. And expensive. Is it necessary? Can’t you just… tell me what’s wrong? I don’t want to spend a lot of time in hospitals. And I don’t have a lot of money. My ex-wife… well, that’s a different story. But yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. But please, make it quick. And not too expensive. And no needles, alright? I don’t like needles. Are those machines… safe? I’ve heard things about those machines… Is my Medicare going to cover it? I hope it does. I wouldn’t want to have to pay for it out of pocket. Is that okay? Is everything okay? I'm a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Danny. It’s perfectly reasonable to be worried. The X-ray is quick and painless – it’s just a picture of your bones. The MRI is a little longer, but you’ll be lying flat, and you won’t feel anything. It uses magnetic waves, not needles, and it’s very safe. Let me check your Medicare coverage… Yes, it should cover both the X-ray and the MRI, although there may be a co-pay or deductible depending on your plan. We’ll have the billing department verify everything for you before the procedures. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any activities that aggravate your shoulder pain. Continue to rest it. We can also start some gentle range-of-motion exercises at home. I'll give you a handout with some instructions. Do you have any questions about these exercises or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm… these look… complicated. I'm not very good at following instructions. And I'm not very flexible. This says… "pendulum exercises"? What does that even mean? It sounds like something you do in a circus. And "external rotation"? I don't even know what that is. Is there someone who can show me how to do these? My sister is very good at this sort of thing. Maybe she can come with me? But she lives far away. And she… judges me. Is this going to take long? I just want to get back to playing baseball. Or softball. Whatever it is. And I hope these exercises don’t hurt. I don’t want to make it worse. Everything feels… overwhelming now. Are you sure I need all of this?
DOCTOR: I understand it feels overwhelming, Danny. It's a lot to take in, and you’re right to be concerned about making things worse. We're not aiming for perfection here, just gentle movements to help improve your range of motion and strengthen your shoulder. Let me demonstrate the pendulum exercises. You stand relaxed, let your arm hang down, and gently swing it forward, backward, and side to side. It shouldn’t be painful, just a gentle movement. As for the external rotation, we can work on that during a follow-up appointment with a physical therapist. They can show you the proper technique and ensure you’re doing it correctly. I'm going to order a referral to physical therapy for you, and I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re progressing. We’ll review the results of the X-ray and MRI then. In the meantime, try to do the pendulum exercises a few times a day, as long as they don’t cause pain. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: Hmm… I guess that doesn’t look too hard. But I’m worried about doing it wrong. And I don't want to pull a muscle. Physical therapy… more appointments? More waiting? I really just want to get back to playing. But alright. If you think it's best. Two weeks… that seems like a long time. What if it gets worse in two weeks? What if I can't play at all? Alright. So, pendulum exercises and physical therapy. And waiting. And hoping. Is there anything else I need to do? Anything else I’m forgetting? This is all very stressful. And I’m getting a headache now. I think I need a nap. And maybe a drink. Is it okay if I have a drink later? Just to relax? It helps with the stress. And I hope this all works. I really do. But I'm not very optimistic. Everything always seems to go wrong for me. .
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Danny, and it's okay to feel stressed. But we're going to take things one step at a time, and we’ll work together to get you back to playing. For now, just focus on the pendulum exercises, and try to rest your shoulder. Avoid any activities that aggravate your pain. And yes, it’s perfectly okay to have a drink to relax – just in moderation, of course. I’ve scheduled a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks. The physical therapy referral will be sent electronically to your preferred provider. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. “And to address your concerns about things going wrong, we’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better. Remember, we're a team, and we’ll work through this together." "Get some rest, Danny, and I’ll see you in two weeks." .
