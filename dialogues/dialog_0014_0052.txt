DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. So, you're here today... what brings you in?
PATIENT: Aye, well, good morning to ye. It's this nausea, see? Been happenin' every mornin' now for... oh, I'd say close to a fortnight. It's not terrible, mind ye, but enough to ruin a good cup o' tea, and that's sayin' somethin'. The doctor back home – she's retired now – said somethin' about my heart not bein' as strong as it used to be, and that this could be connected. She mentioned heart failure, but I dinna really understand it all.
DOCTOR: Right, nausea for two weeks. And your previous doctor alluded to… heart failure. Hmm. Well, let's not jump to conclusions, but it's good you brought that up. It can be a symptom, amongst many others. Now, is it just in the mornings, or does it happen at other times too?
PATIENT: Aye, mostly mornings. Like clockwork, almost. Sometimes it lingers a bit, but usually it's gone within an hour or so o' gettin' up. Never happens after breakfast, or in the evenin', thankfully. Just... that first hour, feelin' a bit queasy and generally unwell. It's not like I'm throwin' up, just... uncomfortable, ye ken? Makes me a bit shaky, too, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Shaky, okay. And just to be clear, it's not associated with anything you eat specifically?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. I’ve tried changin’ what I have for breakfast – toast, porridge, even skipped it altogether a couple o' times – and it makes no difference at all. Still the same. It’s just… when I wake up, that's when it starts. No matter what I've eaten – or haven't eaten – the night before. It’s a wee bit baffling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea and shakiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I get a bit breathless, sometimes, just walkin’ up the stairs. Not terribly, mind ye, but enough to need a wee pause at the top. And my ankles do swell up a bit at the end o’ the day, especially if it’s warm. I thought it was just old age, to be truthful, but now ye mention it… maybe it's connected? I dinna know much about these things, Doctor. I just want to feel a bit better, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath and ankle swelling... yes, those could be related. It’s good you’re telling me all this. Now, have you had any chest pain, palpitations—that’s a racing or fluttering heartbeat—or dizziness?
PATIENT: No chest pain, thankfully. Never had a bother with that. Palpitations… now and again, maybe. Not often, and it's never been severe. Just a wee flutter, like a bird in my chest, and it passes quickly. Dizziness... aye, sometimes when I stand up too fast, but I put that down to gettin’ old. It’s only for a second or two. I'm not fallin' about or anything. Is this all worryin', Doctor? I’m startin’ to feel a bit flustered now, thinkin’ about it all.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re describing everything so clearly, Mr. Benic. And no, you're not being unreasonable to feel flustered. It's a lot to think about. We need to investigate this properly, though. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Aye, well, the high blood pressure, yes. The doctor caught that a few years back. I take a tablet for it, every mornin’. Other than that… nothin' major, nothin' that I’m aware of. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but I was a healthy wee lad. I've never been much for complainin’, to be honest. I like to keep myself goin’, ye ken? Do ye need the name o’ the tablet for the blood pressure? I can remember it if ye like.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. The name of the medication would be helpful. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Aye, it’s... amlodipine, I think. Five milligrams. And let me think about surgeries... Oh! Years ago, when I was a young man, I had my appendix out. And I broke my arm once, fallin’ off a fence, but that was a long time ago. Just the appendix, really. Nothin’ else I can recall. A few stitches here and there over the years, but nothin’ major. I was always a bit clumsy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, amlodipine five milligrams, appendix removed, and a history of clumsiness. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat most things, and I've never had a problem with any tablets or medicines the doctor has given me. I'm quite lucky, to be honest. My wife – God rest her soul – she had all sorts o’ allergies, poor woman. But me? Nothin’. Just a bit o' a sniffle now and again, with the change in the weather. But that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any serious illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Aye, well, my father… he had a bad heart. Spent the last few years o' his life in and out o' hospital. Eventually, that’s what took him, a heart attack. And my mother… she had diabetes. She wasn’t very well, to be honest. It caused all sorts o' problems. My sister's fine as far as I know, but we don’t see much o’ each other these days. She lives down south. It's a bit of a worry, thinkin’ about it, but what can ye do? These things happen, don’t they? Is that relevant, Doctor? Worryin' about my family history, that is?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very relevant, Mr. Benic. A history of heart disease in your father and diabetes in your mother… that does increase your risk. Now, I’m going to need to do a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, of course. That's fine. Do whatever ye need to do, Doctor. I've never minded a bit o' proddin' and pokin'. Just get to the bottom o' this, that's all I ask. I’m startin’ to feel a bit anxious now, to be honest. It's this worry about my heart, ye ken? It's naggin' at me. Get it checked, and I'll feel much better, I'm sure. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. 160 over 90. A bit elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart. I’m hearing a bit of a murmur, and it sounds slightly irregular. I’ll listen to your lungs now. Your lungs sound clear, but a little bit of crackling at the base. And finally, I’ll check your ankles. There is some noticeable swelling in both ankles. Now, based on what you've told me, your family history, and the findings from the physical exam, I’m concerned about the possibility of heart failure. However, we need further testing to confirm this diagnosis. I want to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an EKG, and a chest x-ray. Would you be able to get those done at the clinic tomorrow?
PATIENT: Aye, tomorrow’s fine. I can come back tomorrow. So, heart failure, ye say? My father... is that what he had? I dinna understand all these medical terms, Doctor. It's all a bit bewilderin', to be honest. What does it mean, heart failure? What will happen? I'm gettin' a wee bit scared now. Will I need to be… hospitalised? Will I need… medication? I’m sorry, I’m askin’ a lot o’ questions. It’s just… all this talk o' heart failure... it's a bit worryin'. Just explain it to me, Doctor, in plain language. What's happenin' to my heart?
DOCTOR: It's alright to be scared, Mr. Benic. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you hear those words. And yes, it's perfectly alright to ask questions. That's what I'm here for. Heart failure doesn't mean your heart has stopped working, but it means it's not pumping blood as efficiently as it should be. Think of it like a pump that's getting a bit tired. It still works, but it has to work harder to do the same job. Your heart is slightly enlarged and weakened. The symptoms you’ve been experiencing – the nausea, shortness of breath, ankle swelling, and shakiness – those can all be signs of heart failure. Your father likely had a similar condition. The tests I’m ordering will help us understand exactly how your heart is functioning and determine the best course of treatment. This will involve blood tests and an EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart. A chest x-ray to give us an image of the heart and lungs. Depending on the results, you may need medication to help your heart pump more efficiently and reduce fluid buildup. Whether or not you need to be hospitalised will depend on the severity of the condition. We'll discuss all of that after we have the results of the tests. For now, try to rest, keep your fluid intake moderate, and avoid strenuous activity. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I think so. A tired pump, ye say? And medication… that’s fine. Better than bein’ hospitalised, I suppose. Moderate fluids… I like a good cup o' tea, but I can cut back if I need to. Rest… I can manage that. So, these tests tomorrow… how long will it take to get the results? And will I see ye again after that? I’m still a wee bit anxious, but I feel better knowin’ what’s happenin’, even if it’s not good news. I appreciate ye explainin' it all so clearly, Doctor. It's a relief to have someone takin' it seriously. I'll come back tomorrow, as ye say. And I'll try to rest and cut back on the tea. Just tell me when to come, and I'll be there.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. And it's good to hear you feel a little more at ease. The lab should have the results by the end of the day tomorrow. I'll have my nurse schedule you for an appointment with me first thing the following morning – that will be Thursday – to discuss the results and create a treatment plan. It will likely be a longer appointment so we have time to go through everything thoroughly. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, significant shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Now, do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now, Doctor. Just rest and cut back on the tea... aye, I can remember that. And come back on Thursday. I appreciate your kindness and your clear explanations. It's a relief to have someone takin' care o' me. Thank ye again, Doctor. I'll see ye on Thursday.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you on Thursday. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then.
