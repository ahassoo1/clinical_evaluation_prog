DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes. Good morning to you too, Doctor… Soodeen, yes? I just… moved here. New place, new doctor, you know? Medicare said I should come. Something about… checking things. Old age, probably. I don’t really remember what they said. It was a lot of papers.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. Medicare does recommend routine check-ups, and it’s good you’re getting things established here. We’ll just go through a few questions, and then I’ll do a quick physical exam. Is there anything specific that’s been bothering you, or any particular concerns you have?
PATIENT: Concerns? Not really. I mean, my back… it gets a little stiff sometimes. From the work, you know? I do… faces. Makeup. For the theater. It’s not a big deal. I’ve had it for years. Mostly just… old. Everything is old these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some back stiffness related to your work. And you do makeup for the theater. That's good to know. When you say it gets stiff, can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Feels like… well, like an old door. You know? Needs oil. Creaks when you open it. Not painful, mostly just… there. I bend over, it’s a little slow. I can still do the work, though. I’m a professional. I make people beautiful. It's not… what do you call it… debilitating.
DOCTOR: An "old door" – I understand. Not painful, just stiff and slow with bending. That’s helpful. And you’re still able to do your work without significant difficulty. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet, or any weakness in your legs when you walk?
PATIENT: Numbness? No. Tingling… sometimes my fingers get cold. But that’s just the theater. Drafty places, you know? Old buildings. Weakness… I walk just fine. I go to the market. I get my… cabbage. Everything is fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some coldness in your fingers, likely related to the environment you work in, and no weakness in your legs. Have you tried anything to help with the stiffness – like stretching, heat, or over-the-counter pain relievers?
PATIENT: Pain relievers? No. I don’t like those things. Mess with your stomach. Stretching… sometimes I bend over and touch my toes. But I’m not very flexible. Never was. I used to dance, a long time ago. But that was… another life. Heat… I sit in a warm room sometimes. That helps a little. Mostly, you just get used to it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Avoiding medication is perfectly reasonable. So, warm room and occasional stretching. Now, just to get a better picture of your overall health, can you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Let me think. I had my… gallbladder out. A long time ago. Maybe twenty years? And… I had a bad cold last winter. A very bad cold. But everyone gets colds, right? And… my wife… she had all sorts of things. But that was… before. I don't really remember the details. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal about twenty years ago, and a recent cold. I appreciate you sharing that. And you mentioned your wife had some medical issues. Do you have a family history of any significant illnesses – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… oh, that’s a difficult one. My mother… she died when I was young. Something with her heart, I think. My father… he smoked too much. Lungs, probably. And my wife’s family… they all lived to be very old. Very old and… grumpy. I don’t remember specific illnesses. It was a lot of people, a long time ago. Mostly, they just… aged.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s common to not have a complete family medical history. We have some information here, but it's good to confirm. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: No. No pills. I don't like them. Maybe sometimes I take a little… vitamin C. When I feel a cold coming on. But it's not regular. Just when I'm… fragile. And sometimes, a little something for my stomach. But only when it’s really bad. Not every day, no. I prefer tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional Vitamin C and something for your stomach when needed. No regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. I don’t think so. I eat everything. Cabbage, potatoes, fish… I don't avoid anything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy from the makeup. But that’s just the chemicals, you know? Not a real allergy. I’ve never had a… a big reaction to anything. Not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Oh. Yes, yes, alright. I suppose so. Just… don’t poke too much. I’m a sensitive artist, you know? And please be gentle with my back. It's an old door, remember?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your back. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright. But… is it cold in here? I think I felt a draft. Maybe I should have brought my scarf. And please, be quick. I have… things to do. Faces to make beautiful, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a bit cool. I’ve adjusted the temperature. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 138 over 82. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration is 16 and even. Now, if you could just take a deep breath for me… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, can you bend forward and touch your toes, if you're able?
PATIENT: Oh, my… it creaks. Like an old door, I told you. This is as far as it goes. Please don’t make me go further. It’s not a pretty sight. And… is that draft still there?
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Szmyd. No need to push it. I’m feeling some tenderness in your lower back, and your range of motion is a bit limited. No signs of any acute injury, thankfully. It appears to be more of a chronic muscle strain. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Everything else appears to be within normal limits.
PATIENT: Chronic muscle strain… that’s what my wife said. Years ago. She knew a lot about things. So, it’s just… old age? And drafts? Is there a pill for drafts, Doctor? Because that would be very helpful.
DOCTOR: It's likely a combination of factors, Mr. Szmyd – your work, some age-related changes, and yes, potentially the drafts. Unfortunately, there isn’t a pill for drafts! However, we can manage the muscle strain. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I’m thinking this is likely a musculoskeletal issue, specifically lower back strain. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you’re able to tolerate them. If those don’t help, we can discuss other options. I also suggest gentle stretching exercises, and applying heat to your lower back. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Pills… I don’t like pills. And stretching… it hurts. Is there anything else? Something… simpler? Maybe a special chair? Or a heated scarf? And what about the drafts? They are very persistent.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to take medication. A special chair with good lumbar support could be helpful. I can give you a referral to a physical therapist who can recommend specific exercises and stretches tailored to your needs, and advise on ergonomic adjustments. For the drafts, perhaps a small space heater near your workstation, or wearing layers, would provide some relief. We can also consider a referral to an occupational therapist to assess your workstation and suggest modifications to reduce strain. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: Occupational therapist… physical therapist… so many people. And I have faces to make beautiful. But… a heated scarf does sound nice. And maybe a special chair. Alright. Yes. A chair and a scarf. And no pills, if possible. Write down the chair people. And the scarf.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Szmyd. This is a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in musculoskeletal issues. They can evaluate your back and develop a personalized treatment plan. And this list has some local stores where you can find ergonomic chairs. We'll keep your primary care provider updated on this visit. Do you have any other concerns today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Lots of names. And addresses. I hope they sell comfortable chairs. And… no, I don’t think so. Just… try to remember the drafts. They are very important. And make sure the chair people know about the makeup. It’s a delicate profession, you know?
DOCTOR: I will certainly make a note about the makeup, Mr. Szmyd. And I'm happy to discuss your concerns about the drafts at your next appointment. I’m glad we were able to come up with a plan. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I hope you can make many beautiful faces!
PATIENT: Thank you. Yes. Beautiful faces. That's what I do. And… remember the drafts.
