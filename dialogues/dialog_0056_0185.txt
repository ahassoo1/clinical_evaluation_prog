DOCTOR: Hi Zelina, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s my breath. It smells, okay? It just… does. And it’s embarrassing. I don’t need a whole song and dance about it, just tell me how to fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's definitely good you're addressing it – it's common to feel self-conscious about that. We can figure out what's going on. “Fixing” it usually means finding the cause first. So, it’s just that you notice a bad odor?
PATIENT: Yeah, obviously. What else would I be here for? It’s not like I enjoy having bad breath. It's pretty constant, I guess. Not like it comes and goes, just… there. And honestly, people have… avoided talking to me, you can tell.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Constant is good to know. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Like… what do you mean? I’ve been working the same job, highway maintenance, for… a few months now. It’s not glamorous, if that's what you're getting at. I don’t think the job has anything to do with it. I brush my teeth, okay? I don’t live under a rock.
DOCTOR: Okay, highway maintenance… that's good info. And you brush regularly – how often, usually?
PATIENT: Look, I brush my teeth twice a day. Maybe sometimes just once if I’m really tired after work, okay? It's not like I never brush. It's just… life gets busy. Is that a problem? I thought twice a day was enough.
DOCTOR: It can be enough, but let’s explore a little more to be sure. Do you use fluoride toothpaste?
PATIENT: Fluoride? I… honestly, I don't pay attention to the box. It’s toothpaste. It makes my teeth clean. I just grab whatever’s cheapest at the store, you know? I’ve got bills to pay. Does it matter what kind?
DOCTOR: It can matter, yes. Fluoride helps strengthen enamel. Okay. And do you floss?
PATIENT: Floss? Honestly, no. Never really got into it. It’s annoying. And it makes my gums bleed. So, no, I don’t floss. Is everyone going to lecture me on flossing now? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, no flossing. That’s good to know. Let's quickly go over your medical history. Any conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I got divorced last year, if that counts. Aside from that, I'm perfectly fine. Nothing major. No diabetes, no asthma, nothing like that. I'm healthy. Just… cursed with bad breath.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical history. Good. Any medications you're currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I had some ibuprofen last month for a headache, but that was it. I really try to avoid doctors and medication. Honestly, I’m just hoping for a quick fix here, not a whole prescription list.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And no allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. I've never had a reaction to anything, honestly. Look, can we get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick exam. I just want to take a look at your mouth and see if there's anything obvious going on. Open wide for me, please.
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. Don't poke around too much. It's sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just looking… Your teeth look generally healthy. Some slight redness along the gum line, particularly on the molars, but nothing major at this point. Your tongue is quite coated, and that can contribute to odor. And it appears you have a high tenar index. Okay, thanks. It's likely a combination of things – the coating on your tongue, the gum redness, and potentially, not using fluoride toothpaste. It's also worth mentioning that dehydration can cause bad breath. Do you drink a lot of water during the day?
PATIENT: Dehydration? I drink… coffee. A lot of coffee. Does that count? I usually have like, four or five cups before noon. Water… not so much. I forget to drink it. It doesn’t taste like anything, you know? Is that really causing this? Coffee shouldn’t give me bad breath.
DOCTOR: Okay, the coffee could definitely be a contributing factor – it's dehydrating, and it can also stain teeth, providing a medium for bacteria. It's a common cause of bad breath, actually. Here’s what I recommend: First, increase your water intake. Aim for eight glasses a day. Second, switch to a fluoride toothpaste. Third, consider a tongue scraper to help remove that coating. And finally, maybe reduce the coffee intake a little, if you can. We could also look into a mouthwash specifically designed to fight odor, but let's start with these changes first. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Water, fluoride toothpaste, scrape my tongue… it all sounds awful, honestly. And less coffee? That's just cruel. But… okay, I'll try. How long before I see a difference? I'm not walking around smelling like… whatever I smell like forever.
DOCTOR: You should start to see a difference within a week or so, if you stick to it. It takes time to build good habits. If you're not seeing improvement after two weeks, we can explore other possibilities, like a possible sinus issue or referred to a dental specialist to rule out anything more serious. Any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. Just… tell me if I need a prescription or anything. I’m not spending a fortune on fancy mouthwashes, okay? I’m already wasting money on fluoride toothpaste. This better work. I think I'm done here.
DOCTOR: No prescription needed at this point. Just those simple changes. I’ll give you a printout with those recommendations as well. I understand your frustration, and I hope this helps. If you don’t see improvement, please schedule a follow-up appointment and we can reassess. Have a good day, Zelina.
