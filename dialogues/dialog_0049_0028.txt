DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. I'm Dr. Nestingen. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… well, you know about my heart. It feels… weaker with it. It’s been going on for about three weeks now, I think. Maybe a little longer. Hard to keep track sometimes.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, alright. And you said it feels related to your heart?
PATIENT: Well, not exactly related, but when I cough a lot, my heart gets all fluttery. And tired. It’s like it has to work too hard, you know? I get short of breath just walking to the kitchen. It used to not bother me so much.
DOCTOR: “Fluttery,” you say. Can you describe that feeling more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not a pain, exactly. More like… skipping a beat. Or a bunch of quick little beats all at once, instead of steady. Like a bird’s heart, maybe? A little bird flapping really fast. And it makes me feel… dizzy sometimes, if I’m really pushing myself. It doesn't last long, just a few seconds usually.
DOCTOR: Skipping beats… dizziness… Alright. And this cough itself – is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up?
PATIENT: It is bringing something up now. Started out dry, but it's gotten… thick. White, mostly. Sometimes a little yellowish, especially in the mornings. Not a lot, but enough to be bothersome. I have to cough to clear my throat a lot, and it makes my chest ache. It’s just… tiring, Doctor. Everything feels tiring lately.
DOCTOR: And when did you notice this change – when did it start bringing up the mucus?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… about a week ago, I’d say. Maybe a little less. Right around the time the weather got so humid, I think. It just… seemed to get worse with the dampness. It's always worse in the mornings, but the humidity seems to make it worse overall. I remember thinking it felt different than just a regular cold cough, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had a fever at all with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. I check myself regularly, you know, with that thermometer I have. Always normal. It's just the cough, the mucus, and this… feeling in my heart. And the tiredness, of course. It’s like I’m dragging myself through mud all day.
DOCTOR: Do you smoke, Ms. Sadhu?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never have. My husband, he used to, but he quit years and years ago. I always told him it was bad for his health, and I certainly wouldn't start! No, just this cough, and the worry about my heart. It’s what worries me the most, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medications. Can you tell me what you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I have a little bag here with everything. There's Lisinopril, for my blood pressure, I take that every morning. And then there's… Metoprolol, for the heart, of course. That one I take twice a day. And… oh, yes! Furosemide, the water pill. That one too, every morning. And… that’s it, I think. Unless… oh! Sometimes I take Tylenol for aches, but not regularly. It's just when things get bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Furosemide. And Tylenol as needed. Any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve been taking those for… oh, goodness, years now. My old doctor, Doctor Ramirez, he put me on them, and I haven't had any problems. I always tell my doctors everything, you know. It’s important to be honest. And I always make sure to get my refills on time! It would be terrible to run out.
DOCTOR: Good. And, Ms. Sadhu, I'm going to need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take your blood pressure as well. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I want to figure out what’s going on. My heart feels… strange. Go ahead, please. I’ll just sit here and try to relax. It’s hard sometimes, but I’ll try.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a deep breath for me. I hear a bit of congestion in your lungs, and your heart rate is a little fast, though regular. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles. . Do you notice this swelling yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the ankles. They've been a little puffy lately. I thought it was just from the heat, you know? Staying off my feet hasn't helped much. It's worse at the end of the day, especially. Not terrible, but… noticeable. It’s like they fill up with water, just sitting here. Is that bad, Doctor? Is it the heart? I worry about the water. Dr. Ramirez always warned me about the water.
DOCTOR: Alright. The swelling, along with the congestion and your heart rate, does warrant some further investigation. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help figure out what's going on, then yes, please. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to feel better. Is the X-ray… painful? I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know. And the blood test… will it hurt much? I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray is not painful at all, Ms. Sadhu. You simply stand in front of a machine, and it takes a picture. It’s very quick. As for the blood test, it will be a small prick, and yes, there might be a little bruising, but it shouldn’t be anything significant. We’ll use a small needle and apply pressure afterwards to minimize it. The lab technician will be very careful. We’ll get those results back as quickly as possible, and then we can discuss a plan. In the meantime, I'd like you to limit your salt intake and keep a close eye on any further swelling. Is that something you can do?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. No salt. I remember Dr. Ramirez always telling me that too. And watch the swelling. It's good to have something to do, you know? Keeps me from worrying too much. When will I get the results, Doctor? Will someone call me? I don't have one of those fancy computer things, you know. I still use the telephone.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within 24 to 48 hours, Ms. Sadhu. The clinic will call you with the results, I’ll make a note for them to contact you by telephone. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them in person. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Next week sounds… good. Whatever works. Tuesday? If that’s alright. I have my… book club on Thursdays, you see. And Wednesday is… well, Wednesday is for cleaning. I like to keep a schedule, it helps me.
DOCTOR: Tuesday at 2 PM works perfectly. We’ll get you scheduled for that. Now, I understand you’ve been feeling quite tired, and this cough is persistent. While we await the test results, if you experience any significant shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately, do not wait. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness… go to the emergency room. I will. My son, he lives nearby, he can take me if I need to. He worries about me too, you know. I appreciate you telling me all this. It’s good to know what to look out for. I hope it doesn't come to that, but… it’s good to be prepared. Is there anything else I should be doing, Doctor? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Just rest, Ms. Sadhu. Drink plenty of fluids, and try to elevate your legs when you're resting to help with the swelling. We'll have a better idea of what’s going on after the tests. We'll get those orders sent to the lab, and someone will be along shortly to take your blood. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. Thank you for listening to me. It's always nice to have a doctor who takes the time. I just want to feel better, you know? It’s hard getting old, but… one takes it one day at a time. I appreciate everything you've done for me today. I’ll see you next Tuesday, then. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sadhu. We’ll see you next Tuesday. Please don't hesitate to call if anything changes before then. Have a good day, and rest well. .
