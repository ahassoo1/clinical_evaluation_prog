DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Andraca, you say? Yes, yes… a tryout. For… sports. That's right. A physical, for the team. I need a paper, to say I’m okay. My…ex-wife, she said I need this. Something about… insurance? It's all a bit of a mess, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. A sports physical. That’s perfectly alright. We can definitely get that done for you. It sounds like it’s for a new team, and there’s some paperwork involved related to insurance – that's common. Just to clarify, what sport are you trying out for?
PATIENT: Sport? Oh, uh… it’s with the… the fellas. Down at the field. You know, throwing the… the ball. It’s… important. It keeps me… active. Not that it matters much to her, of course. Honestly, I don't keep track of names anymore. Is that okay? Just… throwing. That’s what I do.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Mr. Bartok. “Throwing” is a good start. It sounds like it’s a casual league, which is great. To make sure I have everything I need for the physical and the paperwork, could you tell me a little more about how often you play, and if you’ve had any injuries while playing, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Injuries? Oh, boy. Where to begin? Old man aches, mostly. My knee acts up sometimes, the one from… well, a long time ago. Football, I think. High school. And my shoulder, too. Threw it too much, probably. Nothing serious, mind you. Just… things getting old. We play… once a week, usually. Sometimes twice, if the weather is nice. It’s not like professional, you understand. Just a way to pass the time. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Bartok. “Old man aches” is a good way to put it. And knowing about the football injury and the shoulder pain is important. Just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any pain anywhere else recently?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm… well, my back’s been a little stiff lately. From… lifting things. Around the house. Nothing a little stretching can’t fix. And sometimes my ankles feel a bit… wobbly. But that’s probably just my shoes. They’re getting old too, everything is, it seems. Look, Doctor, is this really necessary? All this asking about pain… I just need a paper to play ball.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bartok. It can feel like a lot of questions when all you want is to get back to playing. But it’s important to make sure you’re healthy enough for the activity, and to identify anything that might need attention before it becomes a bigger problem. This isn’t about preventing you from playing, it's about keeping you safe and enjoying the game. Okay, so a stiff back and sometimes wobbly ankles. Have you had any recent falls or twists?
PATIENT: Falls? No, no falls. Just… clumsy sometimes. You know how it is when you get older. Things aren’t as steady. A little wobble here, a little wobble there. Nothing to worry about. I haven’t been hurt hurt, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… things ache. Everyone aches, Doctor. It’s part of life. Can we just get this over with? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. We can certainly get started with the physical exam. It will just take a few minutes. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and then take a look at your knee, shoulder, back, and ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, alright? My old bones aren’t what they used to be. Let's just get it over with. The sooner I have this paper, the sooner I can get back to the field.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. I’m just listening to your heart and lungs now. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes… Alright, reflexes are good on both sides. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to gently examine your knee. Can you bend it for me?
PATIENT: Ouch. Careful now, Doctor. That always feels a bit… creaky. It’s been acting up lately, like I said. Especially after… exertion. Just playing ball. It’s probably nothing, just old age catching up. You feel anything funny? I don’t want you poking around too much.
DOCTOR: I feel some mild tenderness along the inner side of your knee, Mr. Bartok, and a slight creaking sound when you bend it. I don’t feel any significant swelling at the moment. Does the pain radiate anywhere, or is it localized to the knee itself?
PATIENT: Radiate… hmm. It doesn’t really travel, if that’s what you mean. It’s just… in the knee. Sometimes it feels a bit stiff afterwards, like it needs to be… loosened up. I usually just walk it off. Is that bad? Walking it off? I don’t want any trouble with my knee, Doctor. I need it for the team.
DOCTOR: No, walking it off isn’t necessarily bad, Mr. Bartok, but it’s good to know what’s causing the pain so we can manage it properly. Now, let’s take a look at your shoulder. Can you raise your arm for me?
PATIENT: There we go. A little… tight. It’s been like this for years, to be honest. Threw too much baseball when I was younger. Probably just a bit of… wear and tear. Don’t poke around too much, alright? It doesn't bother me too much, usually. Is something wrong? Is it serious? I just want to play ball, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I feel some tenderness in the rotator cuff area, Mr. Bartok, and a slight grating sensation when you move your arm. It doesn’t seem to be anything acute, but it suggests some mild inflammation or wear and tear, as you suspected. We can certainly talk about some exercises to strengthen the muscles around your shoulder and prevent further irritation. Now, if you could just sit up and let me check your back…
PATIENT: My back… always bothers me in the mornings. Lifting things around the house, you know? It’s just… old age. Don’t expect too much, alright? It’s probably just a bit stiff. You poke around too much and you’ll make it worse. Just tell me when we can get this paper, Doctor. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I'm feeling some mild tenderness in your lower back muscles, Mr. Bartok. It doesn't seem to be any structural issues, but your muscles are a bit tight. Stretching and gentle exercise would likely help. Now, I want to check your ankles. Can you point your toes and flex your feet for me?
PATIENT: There. A little… wobbly. Like I said, my shoes are old. Probably need new ones. It doesn’t really bother me too much, usually. Just feels a bit… unsteady sometimes. Is that bad? I just want to be able to play ball, Doctor. Can we just get this paper already? I’m starting to get worried.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. I’ve completed the examination. I do feel some mild tenderness in your ankles, and some tightness in your lower back. Your knees and shoulder do show some signs of wear and tear, as we discussed. Based on this examination, it appears you have some chronic musculoskeletal issues, likely related to age and previous activity. While these issues aren’t acutely severe, it’s important to manage them to prevent further injury. Before we proceed with the paperwork, I want to be thorough. Do you have any history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No. High blood pressure? Never been told. Diabetes? Absolutely not. I eat pretty good, mostly. Just… old age, like I said. Everything aches. That’s all. Can we just get this paper already, Doctor? I don’t want any trouble. I just want to play ball with the fellas.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Based on the examination and your history, I can clear you for participation in a low-impact sports activity, with some important recommendations. However, given your existing musculoskeletal issues, I strongly advise you to start slowly and gradually increase your activity level. I also recommend regular stretching and strengthening exercises to support your muscles and joints. I will write a note for your records outlining these recommendations. I also suggest you consider a good pair of supportive athletic shoes. And it's important to listen to your body – if you experience any significant pain, stop and rest. I’m going to write up this physical exam report now and we'll get that paper for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes! That sounds perfect, Doctor. Just… the paper. That’s all I need. Thank you. Thank you very much. The sooner I have it, the sooner I can get back to the field. Can I… can I sign something? Just to make it official?
DOCTOR: Here you go, Mr. Bartok. This is the physical exam report. It outlines my findings and recommendations for your participation in sports. Please sign here to acknowledge that you’ve received and understand the information. Also, this is a waiver form for participation in a sports league. It is always good to have a signed waiver. Once you’ve signed these, you are cleared to play! But please, remember to listen to your body and take it easy at first. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: There, done! Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. No questions. Just… the paper. I’m good to go, right? Can I get back to the field now? I appreciate your time. This has been… helpful.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bartok, you are cleared to play, with the recommendations we discussed. Please keep a copy of these forms for your records. And remember, if you experience any worsening pain or new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to see me or another healthcare professional. Enjoy your time on the field, and be careful! Have a good day, Mr. Bartok. .
