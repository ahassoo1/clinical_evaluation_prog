DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s good to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's... good to meet you too, I think. Hmm. Well, my wife, she says I need to get some papers. Something about… time off? Or maybe… not working for a bit? She handles most of that stuff, you see. It’s a bit fuzzy, honestly. Something about FMLA, she mentioned… or disability? I just… need the paperwork, I guess. If that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. So, it sounds like you're needing some documentation for possible time off work, perhaps related to FMLA or disability?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Something like that. It’s… well, I’ve been feeling a bit off, you know? Not sick, exactly. Just… tired. And a little… confused sometimes. My wife says it’s been getting worse, and that’s why she wants the papers. I don’t really remember when it started, though. It all blends together, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint when things started. “A bit off” and “tired” can mean a lot of different things. Could you tell me a little more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like… regular tired. Like after a long day of work, you know? It’s… through me, almost. Like all my energy is just… gone. Even after sleeping. And it’s not just physical, either. It’s… hard to think sometimes. Like words get stuck, or I forget what I was doing. Small things, mostly. But my wife says it’s more than small. She's probably right, she usually is.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re experiencing both physical and mental fatigue. And it’s good that your wife is noticing these changes as well. When you say “words get stuck,” can you give me an example?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, just now, actually! I was trying to say… what was I saying? Oh, right! The words. It's like… I know what I want to say, but it takes a long time to come out. Or… sometimes the wrong words come out. Not all the time, but… enough to be annoying. And then… I’ll be talking to someone, and… forget what I was talking about mid-sentence! It's frustrating, for everyone, I think.
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds frustrating indeed, and it’s good you’re able to describe it to me. Has this been happening for a long time, or has it gotten worse recently?
PATIENT: Recently, I think. It’s hard to say for sure, like I said. But my wife… she says it’s definitely worse in the last few months. She's been getting more worried about it, and that’s why we’re here now. She noticed I was… repeating myself more, and getting lost in familiar places. Nothing major, but enough to… make her nervous. I don’t like worrying her.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that your wife is paying attention and that you're here to address these concerns. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to ask you a few more questions, and then maybe do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Questions are good. I… I don’t mind. A physical exam is fine too, I suppose. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… try not to take too long, alright? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll take things at your pace. Let's start with your medical history. According to the records, you’ve seen doctors here before. Do you have any major medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… major conditions… Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was young, but that was ages ago. And… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it was managed with… with pills. I think. My wife handles the medications, mostly. She’ll remind me if I forget. Honestly, I can’t really remember what else. Nothing… serious, I don't think. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Like I said, my wife handles that. But I think I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill, maybe? And something for… my cholesterol? Or was that for my blood pressure? Oh dear. See? This is what I mean! I really don’t keep track of these things. She’ll know, she definitely will. Maybe we should just call her? I don’t want to give you the wrong information.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Let's see if we can find the information in your records. Ah, here we are. It looks like you’re currently taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension, and Atorvastatin 40mg daily for high cholesterol. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… Atorvastatin… Hmm. Those sound familiar, yes. Probably the little white pill and the… bigger one? Yes, yes, that’s right! You see? You’re much better at remembering than I am! Thank you for looking that up.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you ever had any surgeries besides your appendectomy?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see. No, I don’t think so. Just the appendix when I was a boy. I remember being very sick afterwards, but that was a long time ago. Nothing else comes to mind. No broken bones, no… anything else, really. A few stitches here and there, but nothing major. I've always been a careful man.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, thinking about your family… Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family… My mother… she had some trouble with her heart when she was older, I think. And my father… he was always very strong, but he did get… confused sometimes, towards the end. Not like me, but… he’d forget things. And my sister… she had diabetes, I believe. But that was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details. We didn’t see each other very often. It's hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. You mentioned your father getting confused towards the end. Do you remember approximately when that started, or how it progressed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That was a long time ago. He… I think it started slowly. Just little things, like forgetting names or misplacing things. Then it got worse… He started getting lost, even in his own neighborhood. And he’d repeat himself a lot. My wife helped take care of him. She’s very good at that sort of thing. It all happened… I don’t know, maybe ten or fifteen years before he passed? It’s all a bit hazy now. It was sad, very sad.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a difficult time. Now, switching gears a bit… Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I'm retired now. Used to be a… well, I did some work with the church, mostly. Religious activities and education. It was a good life. Now I mostly stay home, read, and spend time with my wife. We go for walks sometimes, but I don’t get around as much as I used to. I don’t really have much of a hobby these days. Mostly just… relaxing. And trying to remember where I put my glasses!
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you drink alcohol, use tobacco, or drink a lot of caffeine?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I don't drink alcohol at all. Never really liked it. And I've never smoked. My wife… she doesn’t allow it in the house! As for caffeine… I have a cup of coffee with breakfast, that’s about it. Just one cup. Nothing strong. I'm not much of a drinker, you see. Prefer tea, myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I can't remember ever being allergic to anything. I’ve taken a few different medications over the years, for my blood pressure and cholesterol, but never had any problems. My wife always makes sure to tell the doctor if I’m allergic to anything, though. She's very careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a simple neurological exam, like checking your reflexes and balance. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I do get a little dizzy sometimes, you see. But go ahead. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. That's slightly elevated blood pressure, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, breathing normally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Can you just relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Just let me know if it’s going to be… startling. My wife says I jump at shadows these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let’s check your balance. Could you stand up for me, if you’re able?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. But be careful, Doctor. As I said, I get a little dizzy sometimes. Oh dear… I do feel a bit unsteady.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, please sit down. That's perfectly alright. We’ll take things slowly. You do seem a little unsteady. I’m noting that. Now, let's try a quick memory test. Can you spell the word “WORLD” backwards for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… WORLD backwards… Oh dear. That’s… difficult. Let me think… D-L-R-O-W? Is that right? No… wait… It’s… It’s slipping my mind. I used to be very good at spelling. This isn't easy. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. No need to apologize. Now, I asked you to remember three objects: apple, table, and penny. Can you tell me what those were?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… There was… an apple, yes. And… a table, I think. But the third one… It’s slipping my mind. Oh dear. Was it a… chair? No… It wasn’t a chair. It was something small… a… I just can’t seem to remember. It’s on the tip of my tongue, but… it won’t come out. I’m sorry. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Don’t worry about it. Based on your answers and the brief exam, it seems like you’re experiencing some cognitive difficulties. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. I also recommend a neurological consultation with a specialist, Dr. Ramirez, who can perform more in-depth testing, like an MRI of your brain, if necessary. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… a specialist? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. But if it will help, I suppose. My wife will want me to do whatever it takes. Is it going to be expensive? And how long will it take? I don't want this to drag on for too long. My memory, you see… It's getting worse every day, it feels like. I just want to feel normal again.
