DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Bakan, is it? Yes, well, honestly, I'm not entirely sure why I'm here. My daughter, bless her heart, thought I should… get checked out. She worries too much, that one. Said I've been a bit… forgetful. It's probably nothing, really. Just old age creeping in, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Calvery. It’s very thoughtful of your daughter to encourage you to come in, and it’s quite common for changes in memory to prompt a visit. Even if it is simply age-related, it's always best to have a thorough look. To help me understand what’s been going on, could you describe what your daughter has noticed that concerns her?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. She says I repeat myself. A lot. And… misplaced things. Keys, mostly. Though I’m sure I put them somewhere sensible. She also thinks I ask the same questions over and over. Honestly, I just want to make sure I’m not becoming a bother, you know? It's probably just a phase. I used to have a wonderful memory, back in the day. Top of my class, surgical tech for forty years… it’s just… things slip. I don't need a big fuss, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like these changes are a bit frustrating for you, and you’re very astute to notice them yourself. It’s good you have such an observant daughter, and it’s certainly not a ‘fuss’ to want to investigate these things. Forty years as a surgical tech – that’s quite a career! A sharp mind is essential in that field. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately when you first started noticing these memory slips?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… when did it start? That’s a tricky one. It hasn’t been… sudden, you know? It’s been… gradual. Maybe… six months ago? Perhaps a little longer. It’s hard to say. Things just started… not sticking as well, I suppose. I remember being perfectly fine before that. I was still organizing my spice rack alphabetically, for goodness sake! Now… well, sometimes I forget which ones I already used. It’s embarrassing, really. And my daughter points it out every time.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like it’s been a slow progression over the last six to twelve months, which is helpful to know. And it’s quite common for family members to notice these changes before we do ourselves. Now, beyond the memory concerns and misplaced items, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Let me think. Hmm… well, I get… a bit more tired than I used to. Not physically, exactly. More… mentally tired, I suppose. It takes more effort to concentrate, if that makes sense. And sometimes… I struggle to find the right words. Not often, but it’s happened a couple of times. Like… the name of that flower… you know, the purple one… starts with a 'V'? Oh, never mind. It’ll come to me eventually. It’s probably just a senior moment, Doctor. Don't bother writing that down.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know all of these details, Ms. Calvery, even if you feel they're minor. The mental fatigue and occasional difficulty finding words are all useful pieces of the puzzle. It sounds like you’re very self-aware, which is excellent. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. And my knees aren’t what they used to be, so I get a little achey sometimes. As for serious illnesses… nothing much, really. I’ve always been fairly healthy. My blood pressure's usually okay, though the nurse at the pharmacy always gives me a funny look. I think she thinks I’m lying about my salt intake! My daughter keeps telling me I need to watch my cholesterol, but honestly, I just love my kimchi. It's good for the soul! She worries too much, that one. Does kimchi count as a medical condition?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Calvery. Kimchi is certainly a vital part of a good life! It doesn't count as a medical condition, although a healthy diet is always important. So, to clarify, just a gallbladder removal in the past, and some knee pain currently?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Gallbladder gone, knees a little creaky. And… oh! I had a bout of shingles a few years back. It was awful. Thankfully, it didn’t bother me for too long. My daughter took excellent care of me during that, though. She practically moved in! Other than that… I think that’s it. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. I always said fresh air and a good sense of humor are the best medicine. Though, admittedly, the sense of humor isn't what it used to be, either. Everything's a bit… hazy these days. But don’t write that down!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. That’s very helpful. So, gallbladder removal, knee pain, and a past history of shingles. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just a little something for my knees, sometimes. Ibuprofen, when they really bother me. And… a multivitamin, every morning. My daughter makes sure of it. Says I need my nutrients. Other than that… no, nothing much. I don't believe in loading up on pills, if I can help it. My mother always said natural remedies are the best. Though, I suppose a little ibuprofen every now and then isn’t the end of the world. Is that all you need to know about pills? Because I really don't have much of a pharmacy habit.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Ms. Calvery. Ibuprofen as needed for your knees and a daily multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies? Let me think… No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything! My daughter always tries to get me to switch to gluten-free bread, but I refuse. It tastes like cardboard. And… no, nothing in the garden bothers me either. I practically live in my garden, digging around in the dirt. So, no allergies. Definitely not. Though, I suppose I’m a little allergic to being told what to do. But that’s not a medical allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Calvery, that’s not a medical allergy! It sounds like you have a very healthy constitution. Now, just a couple more questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, when I was a young woman, everyone smoked, you know? It was considered… fashionable. I didn't do it for very long, though. Just a few years, back in the 60s. I quit when I met my husband. He didn’t approve. And truthfully, I didn’t enjoy it that much. It made me cough. So, yes, I used to smoke, but I haven’t touched a cigarette in… oh, goodness, probably fifty years. That feels like a lifetime ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little wine with dinner, sometimes. Nothing fancy. Usually, a glass of Merlot. My daughter says it's bad for my brain, but a little wine is good for the soul! And honestly, I don't drink very much. Maybe one or two glasses a week, if that. It helps me relax, you know? And I certainly don't drink alone. My daughter would have a fit! So, yes, a little wine. That's all. Nothing to worry about, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. That’s very helpful. Now, just a few final questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, family history… that's a tricky one. My mother lived to be ninety, but she didn't really talk about illnesses. She was a very stoic woman, you know? My father had… something with his heart, I think. But he passed away when I was young, so I don't remember much. My sister… she had high blood pressure, I think. And… oh, my aunt, on my mother's side, she had some sort of memory problems when she got older, but I don't know what it was. Alzheimer's, maybe? It's all a bit hazy. Honestly, my family wasn't very good at talking about these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s common for families to not discuss these things openly. So, to summarize, some heart issues in your father, high blood pressure in your sister, and potential memory problems in your aunt. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes and balance. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just don't expect too much, Doctor. I’m a bit… wobbly these days. And my reflexes aren’t what they used to be. I’ve always been a bit clumsy, to be honest. But go ahead. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, if you could just sit back and relax. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight crackling in your lower lungs, bilaterally. It’s subtle, but worth noting. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88, which is slightly elevated. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, as you mentioned, and your balance seems slightly unsteady. I’m going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps for me, if that’s alright. Your gait is a bit wide-based, and you do seem a little unsteady on your feet. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… today’s date? Let me think… it’s… August, isn’t it? Yes, August… the second? Or is it the third? Oh, dear. It’s so hard to keep track these days. I used to know all the dates. I had a calendar in the kitchen, meticulously marked with birthdays and appointments. But now… it’s all a bit of a blur. It’s the second, I think. Yes, August the second. I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty with dates occasionally. Now, can you tell me the names of three objects in the room?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Three objects… Let me see… There’s… that chair, of course. And… that desk. And… hmm… that picture on the wall? It’s… a flower, I think. Yes, a flower. Is that good enough, Doctor? My brain feels a bit… foggy today.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Ms. Calvery. You remembered three objects correctly. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. I’ll say them slowly, and then I’ll ask you to repeat them back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready. Go ahead, Doctor. I’ll try my best. My memory isn’t what it used to be, but I’ll give it a shot. Don’t make them too difficult, though.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them for me.
PATIENT: Oh… apple, table… and… hmm… penny? Yes, apple, table, penny. I think. Did I get them all? My brain feels like a tangled ball of yarn. I used to be so good at remembering things. I'm pretty sure those were the words. But I wouldn't bet my life on it.
DOCTOR: You remembered two out of three words, Ms. Calvery. That’s alright. It’s helpful to get a baseline assessment. Based on the physical exam and your responses, I'm concerned about some mild cognitive impairment. The crackling in your lungs, slightly elevated blood pressure, unsteady gait, and some difficulty with memory recall are all factors to consider. However, these findings are not definitive, and further investigation is needed. I recommend a few tests, including a blood workup to check for any underlying medical conditions, and a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive assessment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… tests? A neurologist? I don’t like the sound of that, Doctor. Is it something serious? Am I… losing my mind? My daughter always said I should slow down, but I'm still active, you know? I garden every day! I don’t want to be… a burden. I suppose… if you think it's necessary. But please, don't tell my daughter yet. She'll worry herself sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Calvery. It’s natural to feel anxious when faced with these possibilities. These tests are simply to help us understand what’s going on and rule out any underlying causes. Many things can cause mild cognitive impairment, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or even medication side effects. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re “losing your mind,” as you put it. We'll start with blood work to check those possibilities. And the neurologist can perform more detailed tests to assess your memory, thinking skills, and overall brain function. We're being proactive, Ms. Calvery, not jumping to conclusions. And I respect your wishes regarding your daughter. We won’t discuss these results with her without your explicit permission. First, let me write down the orders for the blood work. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist that I highly recommend. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh… well. I suppose not. It's all a bit overwhelming. A neurologist… I haven't seen a specialist in years. Is it going to be expensive? Medicare should cover it, shouldn’t it? And… what if they find something bad? I don't want to be a bother to anyone. Just… please be gentle, Doctor. This is all very frightening. And… thank you for being so understanding.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Ms. Calvery. It’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed and frightened. Regarding cost, yes, Medicare should cover both the blood work and the visit with the neurologist, as long as it’s deemed medically necessary, which it is in your case. We'll double-check with your insurance to ensure coverage, and my office will assist you with any necessary paperwork. As for what if they find something bad, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. If there is an underlying condition, early detection is always best. There are many treatments and support options available, and we’ll work together to develop a plan that’s right for you. I assure you, I’ll be with you every step of the way. And you’re not a bother at all. Caring for my patients is my job, and I’m here to support you in any way I can. Here are the orders for the blood work and the referral to the neurologist. The neurologist's office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions about scheduling or the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Oh… well. I suppose not. Thank you, Doctor. That’s… very kind of you. I appreciate your patience. My daughter always said I should ask more questions, but I never know what to ask! I’ll… I’ll call the neurologist’s office tomorrow. And I’ll try not to worry too much. It's just… hard to accept that things aren't what they used to be. I just want to be independent. Is it alright if I… just take a moment to collect my thoughts?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. Take all the time you need. There’s no rush. I’ll step out for a moment to give you some privacy. Please don’t hesitate to let my nurse know if you have any questions or concerns. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. .
