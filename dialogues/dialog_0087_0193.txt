DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Soodeen. I see here you’re 39 years old. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Yes, 39 is correct. It is… a bit embarrassing, but I have been having… a lot of gas. More than usual. It is… disruptive. I apologize for bringing this up.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize at all, Mr. Goodstein. Digestive issues are quite common, and there's no need to be embarrassed. It's important to address things that are impacting your quality of life. “Disruptive” is a helpful way to describe it. Could you tell me a little more about this gas?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. It is… well, it happens many times during the day. After I eat, usually. Even if I eat something small. And… sometimes at night. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it is… loud. And… it smells. I work at the burger place, you see, so… it is difficult. I try to… excuse myself, but… it is not always possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. Several times a day, primarily after eating, even small amounts, and occasionally at night. No pain, but you're concerned about the loudness and odor, especially given your work environment. To help me understand this better, could you describe what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. A typical day… Well, for breakfast, I usually have toast with a little bit of jam. Sometimes an egg, if I have time. Lunch is usually a sandwich from the burger place, a small one. I get a discount, you see. And for dinner… it varies. Sometimes soup. Sometimes pasta. I like potatoes. I drink a lot of water. And… sometimes soda. Not every day, but sometimes. I do not eat much fruit, I think. Or vegetables. I should, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, toast with jam, occasionally an egg for breakfast. A small sandwich from work for lunch, and varying dinners – soup, pasta, potatoes. You drink a lot of water and some soda. And you feel you could incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet. Are there any particular foods that seem to worsen the gas, or any that don’t bother you at all?
PATIENT: That is… a good question, Doctor. Hmm… I think beans make it worse. Definitely beans. And… cabbage. My mother used to make cabbage soup, and… yes, that was not good. Anything with a lot of onions also… causes problems. But… the burgers themselves do not bother me too much. I know it is strange, considering where I work, but… yes. And… potatoes are usually okay. Unless they are fried, maybe. Fried potatoes are… different.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful information, Mr. Goodstein. Beans, cabbage, and foods with a lot of onions seem to be the biggest culprits. And fried potatoes are more problematic than boiled or baked. It is good to know that the burgers themselves don’t seem to be a major issue. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the gas?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… Let me think. No… no stomach pain, like I said. No… diarrhea. No constipation. No… heartburn. I… sometimes I feel a little bit bloated, maybe? But not always. And… no weight loss. I have not lost any weight. I do feel… tired sometimes, but… I work long hours, so… I assume that is from the work. I do not… sleep very well. But that is… also from the work, I think. It is a busy place.
DOCTOR: Okay, no stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation, or heartburn. Some bloating, but not constant. No weight loss. Fatigue, which you attribute to work hours. And difficulty sleeping, also linked to your work schedule. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in your bowel habits other than the gas?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No blood at all. And… my bowel habits are… regular. Just… a lot of gas afterwards. Not… different in any other way. It is… just the gas. It comes and goes, but it is… frequent. More frequent than it used to be. That is… the main problem. It is embarrassing at work. And… it makes me feel… uncomfortable. I do not like being around people when… it might happen. It is… difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Goodstein. You’re experiencing increased frequency of gas, with no other major changes in bowel habits. It's causing you discomfort and social anxiety, particularly at work. That’s certainly a valid concern. To get a better picture of things, and rule out anything more serious, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohn's disease, or Celiac disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never been diagnosed with anything. I have not been to the doctor in… a long time. I have always been… healthy. Mostly. Just… the occasional cold. But nothing… serious. My mother… she had high blood pressure, but… I do not have that. I do not think. I have not checked. And… I do not know about Crohn’s disease or Celiac disease. What are those?
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses, and you haven’t been to the doctor recently. That’s good information. Crohn’s disease and Celiac disease are both conditions that can cause digestive issues, among other symptoms. Crohn’s is an inflammatory bowel disease, and Celiac disease is an autoimmune reaction to gluten. We can discuss testing for those later if necessary. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. I have never been in the hospital. I… I broke my arm when I was a little boy, but… they just put a cast on it. No surgery. I… I am not a fan of hospitals. Or doctors, to be honest. But… I am here now. Because of the gas. It is… becoming a problem. I worry it will affect my job.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, and just a broken arm as a child which was treated with a cast. It’s perfectly alright to feel apprehensive about hospitals and doctors, and I appreciate you coming in to address this. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications at all. I do not like taking pills. I try to avoid them if possible. Sometimes… when I have a headache, I take… ibuprofen. But not very often. Just… maybe once or twice a month. And… sometimes I take a vitamin C tablet during the winter, to prevent colds. But that is it. Nothing else. I… I prefer to eat healthy and get enough sleep. When I can. But the gas… it is not getting better.
DOCTOR: Okay, you occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches and vitamin C in the winter, but otherwise you don’t take any medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies at all. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I… I eat everything. Except for… maybe olives. I do not like olives. But that is a preference, not an allergy. My mother… she was allergic to pollen, but… I do not have that problem. I… I breathe fine. I have never had trouble breathing. I… I am very lucky, I think. Except for the gas. This gas is… a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My social history… Well, I am single. I have never been married. I live alone. I work most of the time. At the burger place. I do not… go out very much. I do not drink alcohol. I do not smoke. I… I used to play soccer when I was younger, but… I do not have time anymore. I… I mostly just watch television. And… I talk to my mother on the phone every week. She worries about me. That is… my social history. It is not very exciting, I know. Mostly just work and television. And gas.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Goodstein. It sounds like you’re very focused on work, and you prioritize a quiet lifestyle. Alright. Now, let's move on to a physical exam. I'd like to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. I… I do not mind. I… I hope it does not take too long. I have to get back to work later. But… yes. You may listen. I will try to… relax. It is a bit embarrassing, but… I understand you need to do this. Just… be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Goodstein. I'll be as gentle as possible. It shouldn't take long. Please lie down on the exam table, and I’ll start with listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Okay, I'm listening to your abdomen now. Your bowel sounds are… active, within normal limits. I don't hear anything immediately concerning. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. …I'm not feeling any significant tenderness or masses. Is there any particular spot that is more uncomfortable than others?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. It does not hurt… anywhere. Maybe… a little bit on the left side, but… it is not very painful. Just… a little bit uncomfortable. Like… a fullness, maybe? But… it is not sharp pain. Just… a bit bloated. I… I get that sometimes after I eat. Especially if I eat too much. Or… if I eat the wrong things. Like beans. Or cabbage. But… it is not constant. It comes and goes. And… it is not very severe. Just… a bit uncomfortable. That is all. But… thank you for checking. I… I appreciate it. You are very thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mild discomfort on the left side, which you describe as a feeling of fullness, and which seems related to your diet. That’s helpful information. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a complete picture. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds normal there as well. Alright. Based on the history and physical exam, and given your age and the nature of your symptoms, I suspect this is likely a case of excessive gas, possibly related to dietary factors. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… alright. If it will help. I… I want to know what is wrong. Even if it is just… gas. I… I just want to be sure. Blood tests… okay. What kind of blood tests? I… I do not like needles. But… if it is necessary, I will do it. What are you looking for? I… I hope it is not anything serious. Just… gas. Please?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Mr. Goodstein. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. We’ll keep it as quick and painless as possible. We'll do a complete blood count to rule out any infection or anemia, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. We'll also check a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause digestive issues. And finally, we'll check a celiac panel, to rule out celiac disease. These are all routine tests, and we’ll get the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend keeping a food diary for the next week, carefully noting everything you eat and drink, and any symptoms you experience. This will help us identify any specific triggers. We can also discuss some dietary changes and over-the-counter medications that may help relieve your symptoms. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. A food diary… okay. I can do that. I… I will try to remember everything I eat. And… the blood tests… okay. I… I hope everything is alright. A week… okay. Dietary changes… what kind of changes? I… I do not want to give up all my favorite foods. But… I will try. If it will help. And… over-the-counter medications? What kind of medications? I… I do not like taking pills. But… if it is just for the gas, I will try. Thank you, Doctor. You are very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. We're not going to ask you to give up all your favorite foods, just to identify any potential triggers. I recommend starting by reducing your intake of gas-producing foods like beans, cabbage, onions, and carbonated beverages. You might also try smaller, more frequent meals, and eating slowly. For over-the-counter medications, simethicone can help break up gas bubbles, and activated charcoal can help absorb gas. Be aware that activated charcoal can interfere with some medications, so it’s important to check with a pharmacist before taking it. I'll have the nurse draw the blood, and we'll get the results back as soon as possible. In the meantime, keep the food diary, try the dietary changes, and if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, or blood in your stool, please contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that is all. You have answered all my questions. Thank you very much. I… I appreciate your help. I will keep the food diary. And… I will try the dietary changes. And… I will be careful with the medications. Thank you again. I… I hope the blood tests are alright. And… I hope I can get back to work soon. It is… very busy there. Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. We'll contact you as soon as the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. Goodbye.
