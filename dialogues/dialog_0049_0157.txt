DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don’t have time for this. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, yes. The nurse relayed that information. While I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Dudney, a proper assessment is necessary. It will take some time – how much depends on what we find, naturally. But we need to determine the cause and severity before simply… dismissing it. Now, can you tell me a little more about why you were told you have high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Honestly? I have no idea. My husband makes me go to these things. He worries too much. I feel fine. They just… took my blood at work, and then the phone rang. That’s it. I don’t go to doctors unless he drags me. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: I see. So, no prior diagnosis, no symptoms you've noticed… just a reading at work prompted this visit. While your husband’s concern is… noted, Ms. Dudney, simply feeling fine doesn't negate a potentially serious medical issue. We still need to investigate. Do you happen to know what the blood pressure reading was?
PATIENT: No. I don’t keep track of numbers. Seriously, I’m not a nurse or anything. My husband probably knows, but he’s… at the casino. Don’t ask. Look, can’t you just… give me something for it and be done with it? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your frustration, but prescribing medication without a thorough evaluation is… irresponsible. It’s not simply a matter of “giving something for it.” High blood pressure can be caused by numerous factors, and the wrong treatment could be… unhelpful, or even harmful. Let’s start with a basic review. Have you ever been told you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve always been healthy. I work outside, you know? Civil engineering. It's physical. No sitting around. So, I doubt it’s anything serious. Honestly, this whole thing feels like a waste of my time. Is there a quicker way to just… confirm I'm okay?
DOCTOR: “Confirming” requires assessment, Ms. Dudney. Working outside is commendable, but it doesn’t preclude medical issues. Physical activity is beneficial, but it doesn't address potential underlying problems. Alright. Let's move on. Any family history of heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh. My grandma, on my mom’s side, I think… she had something with her heart. But she was really old. Like, ancient. And she smoked. A lot. Does that count? I don’t really know anything about it. My mom doesn't talk about it. Look, is this going to be a long list of questions? Because I really don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: A history of heart disease in the family is relevant, even if it was in someone “ancient,” as you put it. It suggests a potential genetic predisposition. And yes, it will be a few more questions, Ms. Dudney. It’s standard procedure. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… vitamins. You know, a multivitamin. And sometimes ibuprofen if my back hurts from work. That's it. Please, can we speed this up? I have a deadline. And honestly, I don't understand why I even need to tell you all this if you're just going to give me something to take anyway. It feels like you’re just going through the motions.
DOCTOR: The purpose of gathering this information, Ms. Dudney, is not merely to “go through the motions.” It's to ensure I can provide you with appropriate and safe care. Ibuprofen, even an occasional dose, can impact blood pressure. Very well. Let's proceed with a physical examination. I'll need to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a brief neurological assessment. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And don't take too long. I have a very important project due.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 158 over 92. Pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Reflexes are normal, strength is adequate in all extremities. As suspected. Blood pressure is significantly elevated. I'm going to order some blood work to assess your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any other underlying causes. I’d also like an EKG to check for any cardiac abnormalities. This is not something to dismiss, Ms. Dudney. We need to determine the cause of this elevated blood pressure and manage it appropriately.
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Can’t you just give me a pill? I really don’t have time for all this running around. What kind of pill are you even thinking about? And how long will these tests take? I have a deadline, remember?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I’ve explained repeatedly that prescribing medication without proper investigation is irresponsible. We need to understand why your blood pressure is elevated before considering any treatment. Starting medication without a diagnosis is like treating a symptom without knowing the cause – it’s potentially dangerous. The blood work and EKG will take a few days to process. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend some lifestyle modifications: reduce your sodium intake, increase your potassium intake, and engage in regular exercise. And I strongly advise you to avoid strenuous activity until we have a better understanding of your condition. As for what kind of pill, that's precisely what we need the tests for! There are various types of blood pressure medication, and the appropriate one depends on the underlying cause and your individual health profile. I will have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I’ll try the… less salt thing. But if I miss my deadline because of this, I’m holding you responsible. Can I go now? I really need to leave. And please don’t tell me anything I don’t need to know. Just tell me when the tests are done.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Dudney. The nurse will provide you with the lab requisition forms and instructions. I expect you to follow through with the testing. And I strongly suggest you reconsider your dismissive attitude towards your health. Patient reluctant to comply with recommended testing and treatment. Exhibits a concerning lack of engagement with her health. You may go now. The nurse will contact you when the results are available. .
