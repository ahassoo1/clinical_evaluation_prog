DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer, let's get right to it. You're 87, so forgive me if I keep this brief. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Memmolo, is it? Yes. Briefly is excellent. It’s… the library. The students. Honestly, the whole thing is rather… draining. I’ve been doing this a long time, you understand. A very long time. And things… aren’t what they used to be. I suppose that’s the polite way of putting it.
DOCTOR: Right. The library. And this is…draining. Is this a physical complaint, Mr. Schlatterer, or are we discussing…stress?
PATIENT: Stress, Doctor. Really, what a modern ailment. Though I suppose it feels physical, the constant… exasperation. It’s not as though I’m unwell, precisely. Just… worn. Excessively worn. Do you need me to elaborate on the… inadequacies of the youth? Because I assure you, I could.
DOCTOR: No, no, I think I get the picture. You’re feeling… overwhelmed. Any specific physical symptoms accompanying this “overwhelm”?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… the usual. A bit of… stiffness. And I find myself rather… fatigued. Though at my age, one expects fatigue, doesn’t one? It’s hardly a revelation. I don't require a diagnosis for simply being… older. Is this going to be a long process, Doctor? I have a catalog to review this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Stiffness and fatigue… and you’re 87. Let’s just cover some basics to rule things out, alright?
PATIENT: Rule things out? I assure you, Doctor, I’ve been ruled in. Ruled in to a long life, mostly. And a rather demanding profession, I might add. But… very well. Proceed. Though I’m not certain what good it will do. I suspect it’s merely… life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any pain associated with the stiffness?
PATIENT: Pain… not precisely pain. More of an… ache. A dull, persistent ache. It’s mostly in my back, I suppose. Though, truthfully, everything aches a little these days. It’s the price of… upright posture, I’ve always said. And moving books, naturally. A great many books. Do you specialize in geriatric complaints, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Internal Medicine covers a broad range of issues, Mr. Schlatterer. The ache in your back – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, I should say. Though it intensifies with… exertion. Lifting, bending, thinking… all of it. Honestly, the students require so much… explanation. It’s quite exhausting. And rather frustrating, I must add. Is there a quicker way to accomplish this? I do have commitments, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness… occasionally. A little pins and needles, I suppose. Mostly in my feet, after I’ve been standing for a while. Though I attribute that to… sensible shoes. One must be practical, you know. I don’t recall any serious numbness. Just the usual… discomfort of aging. Are we nearing the end of this, Doctor? I have a rather delicate Dewey Decimal re-organization planned.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any changes in your bowel or bladder habits recently?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really! Is this truly necessary? I fail to see what my… personal functions have to do with my… professional exhaustion. This is quite impertinent, I must say. I’ve been a library science teacher for decades, and I’ve never been subjected to such… probing questions. Let us stick to the matter at hand, shall we? The students, the books, the relentless… stupidity. That is where the problem lies, not in… that.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I am merely attempting to rule things out. Forget I asked. Any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And as for weight loss… perhaps a pound or two. But that's simply due to a lack of appetite, I assure you. All this… stress, you understand. It rather spoils one's enjoyment of a good meal. Honestly, the thought of food is… unappetizing these days. Can we please conclude this, Doctor? I’m beginning to feel quite agitated. This is an entirely unproductive use of my time. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Sounds like… age related complaints. I'm going to recommend a multivitamin and some gentle stretching. If things worsen, or you develop any new symptoms, come back. Otherwise… try to delegate more tasks to the students.
