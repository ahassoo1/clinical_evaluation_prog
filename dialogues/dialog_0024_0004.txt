DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just came in for my shots, you know? Routine stuff. My husband always reminds me to stay on top of these things. He worries.
DOCTOR: “Shots,” you say. Very well. While I appreciate your… diligence, simply stating “shots” isn’t particularly helpful for a proper medical assessment. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Sorry! I didn't mean to be vague. It's just… well, I get a bunch, right? Every year, something different. I think this time it was…tetanus? And maybe flu? Honestly, I don't really keep track. They just tell me to roll up my sleeve. Is there a list somewhere?
DOCTOR: A list… somewhere. Yes, of course. We maintain records, Ms. Fornes. Let me access your chart here… It appears… there is a rather limited immunization history documented. Which is… concerning. To ensure we administer the correct vaccinations, could you recall when you last received a tetanus booster, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Limited history? That doesn't sound good. Hmm… let me think. Tetanus… goodness. It was… probably when my oldest grandchild was born? That was… oh, fifteen years ago, maybe? I had to get one then for visiting. But honestly, Doctor, I’m not good with dates. It feels like a long time ago. I just usually let the nurse handle it when I come in.
DOCTOR: "Usually let the nurse handle it." Right. Well, Ms. Fornes, while I appreciate your trust in our nursing staff, a responsible medical practice requires verification. Fifteen years is… quite a gap. We must proceed with caution. Do you have any allergies to vaccines, or any adverse reactions to vaccinations in the past?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had any problems with them, honestly. A little soreness afterwards, maybe, but nothing serious. My mom always said I was a tough kid, never got sick much. I don't think I've ever had a reaction. Does that make sense? I mean, I haven’t ever avoided them or anything because of a bad reaction.
DOCTOR: No documented reactions. Adequate, I suppose. We will need to administer a Tdap booster today to ensure adequate protection against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. And, given the time of year, a flu vaccine is also recommended. Have you had the flu vaccine this season already?
PATIENT: Oh, pertussis... that's whooping cough, right? Yes, that sounds important. And the flu… hmm. I don’t think so. I might have gotten it at work, they sometimes have a clinic come around, but I don’t really remember. I’d have to check with my husband, he keeps better track of things like that. Let's just do whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Very well. We shall proceed under the assumption you have not received a flu vaccine this season. Please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve. We will administer both vaccinations today. It may cause some discomfort, but it is a necessary precaution. I trust you understand the importance of preventative medicine, despite… the lack of thorough record-keeping.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. A little poke never hurt anyone. Just let me know when you’re ready. And thank you, Doctor, for making sure I’m all up-to-date, even if I'm not the best at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Alright, that is complete. Both vaccinations have been administered. Please remain seated for fifteen minutes for observation, in the unlikely event of an adverse reaction. I will document this visit and update your, shall we say, limited record. Do you have any other concerns, or shall we consider this visit concluded?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Fifteen minutes sounds good. Just a little sore arm, I guess. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you experience any significant swelling, redness, or difficulty breathing, seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, you are free to leave after fifteen minutes. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay, I will. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll just sit here quietly then. I appreciate you fitting me in.
DOCTOR: Fifteen minutes have elapsed. You are free to go. Do try to maintain a more detailed record of your vaccinations in the future, Ms. Fornes. It simplifies matters for everyone.
PATIENT: Okay, I will, I promise. Thank you again for everything, Doctor. Have a good day!
