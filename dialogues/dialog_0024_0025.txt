DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Laury is good. Um… I want to know about… my people. Where they come from, long time ago. I hear you can do a test for that now? With spit, maybe? I want to know about my ancestors.
DOCTOR: Ancestry testing?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s right. My daughter, she told me about it. She said it can tell you where your family come from… before they get to the Marshall Islands. I want to know. Is that something you can help with?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, this is a medical practice. I am a physician. We address health concerns here, not genealogical curiosities. While I understand your… interest, ancestry testing is not within the scope of my expertise, nor is it a medically indicated procedure. It’s… frankly, a rather frivolous use of medical resources. Are you experiencing any actual health problems that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I didn’t know. My daughter, she said doctors do this now. I thought… maybe you could tell me what test to get? I’m not sick, no. Just want to know where I come from. Is that so bad? I just want to understand my family better.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I assure you, the vast majority of physicians are focused on treating illness and maintaining health, not providing historical background checks. Your daughter is…misinformed. There are companies that specialize in these sorts of tests, available online. I cannot endorse or recommend any specific service, and frankly, I find the entire concept… unnecessary. Now, if you have no pressing medical issues, I have other patients waiting. Do you wish to schedule an appointment for a legitimate health concern, or shall we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: I… I don't know any website. My daughter, she does everything on computer. I’m old. I just thought… a doctor could help. No, I’m not sick. Just… forget it. Maybe I’ll ask my daughter again. Thank you, Doctor. For your time.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you experience any changes in your health—fatigue, pain, dizziness—do not hesitate to schedule a proper appointment. Good day, Mr. Scobie. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. .
