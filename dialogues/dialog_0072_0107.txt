DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I am Dr. Hembrey. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. My heart... it feels funny sometimes. Like it's flapping. Not always, but when it happens, it's... weird. Like a bird inside. It scares my wife a little.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Flapping,” you say. And it’s causing your wife some concern, which is perfectly reasonable. Can you tell me more about when this "flapping" occurs?
PATIENT: Hmm... it doesn't seem to be when I'm doing something. Not when I work, or walk. Sometimes when I'm just… sitting. Watching TV, maybe. Or before I go to sleep. It's not every night, though. Maybe once or twice a week? Hard to say exactly. It stops after a little bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it occurs at rest, primarily—when you're relaxing or preparing for sleep—and it's intermittent, happening perhaps once or twice a week. How long does each episode typically last?
PATIENT: Not long, Doctor. Maybe... thirty seconds? A minute, the most. It feels longer when you're scared, I think. But my wife says it's not very long. She times it sometimes. She worries a lot, she does.
DOCTOR: Thirty seconds to a minute, observed by your wife. That’s helpful to know. And I appreciate her concern. Now, besides the sensation of "flapping," do you experience any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think. Sometimes I feel a little… shaky. Not all over, just… in my chest. And maybe a little short of breath. But that could be just because I'm scared, you know? It happens fast, so it’s hard to tell what's happening. I don't get dizzy or anything like that. Just the flapping and maybe a little shake.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you're experiencing palpitations—that’s the medical term for the “flapping” sensation—along with occasional shakiness in your chest and a bit of shortness of breath. No dizziness. Now, Mr. Puder, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing before. I've always been healthy. I work hard, eat okay... no problems with doctors until now. My wife tells me to go when I complain, she’s always worried. But I usually feel better after a bit. It just started happening a few months ago. Not a big deal, I thought.
DOCTOR: A few months ago. And you’ve been generally healthy otherwise. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. No hospital. I cut my finger bad when I was a boy, but my wife bandaged it. That’s it. I tell you, I am a healthy man. I just have this… flapping. It worries my wife more than it worries me, I think. I don’t like her to worry.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your family history. Do either of your parents, siblings, or other close relatives have any heart conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. He was older when he got it. And my mother… she was healthy, mostly. But she passed away when I was young. She had… I don't know what you call it… her feet got big. Swollen. But not heart problems, I don’t think. I don’t know much about my family’s health, really. We don’t talk about that stuff much.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure in your father, and your mother’s health history is less clear. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I work. I am a chemical equipment operator. It's hard work. I'm on my feet a lot. I don't smoke. I drink tea, sometimes. Not much coffee. I try to eat good. My wife cooks. Mostly rice and chicken, vegetables. I walk some, but not much exercise. Just from work, you know? I don’t sit around all day.
DOCTOR: Chemical equipment operator, active job, no smoking, moderate tea consumption, generally healthy diet. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. I get headaches sometimes, but I just drink water. My wife says I should take something, but I don't. I just rest and it goes away. I am a strong man, I don’t need pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. And to clarify, no known allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had one. My wife asks me that every time we go to the doctor. She's very careful. I think she worries too much, but she's a good woman. I just want to know why my heart flaps sometimes. Is it something bad? I need to get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll do a quick physical exam. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes for these palpitations. Please lie down on the examination table, Mr. Puder.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. It's not too bad, is it? I don't like doctors very much, but I want to know what's wrong.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be anything serious, Mr. Puder, but we need to be thorough. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Please try to breathe normally. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be due to your anxiety, or simply from telling me about your symptoms. Rhythm is regular. Lungs are clear. Pulse is also regular, but a bit fast. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140/90. I also want to check your reflexes. Please extend your arms. Reflexes are normal. Thyroid is normal. Everything appears generally normal on initial examination, but your slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure? That's new. My wife always tells me I worry too much. Could that be it? Maybe I just need to rest more. Is it something I should be scared about? And what kind of investigation? More poking and prodding? I need to get back to work... is it okay to go back now?
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, it’s good that you're concerned, but dismissing it as simply worrying isn’t sufficient. Elevated blood pressure, even slightly, can be a precursor to more serious cardiovascular issues. While it may be anxiety-related, it requires further evaluation. I’m going to order some basic blood work: a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. I also want to perform an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart's electrical activity. This is not extensive "poking and prodding," as you say, but a standard procedure. It’s too early to say if this is something to be alarmed about, but we need to rule out any underlying medical causes. I recommend you do not return to work today. I want you to get these tests done, and then we'll discuss the results. We may also need to consider a 24-hour Holter monitor to assess your heart rhythm over a longer period. This will give us a clearer picture of what’s happening. Would you like me to get a nurse to draw the blood and set up the EKG?
PATIENT: A Holter monitor? That sounds… complicated. And I really need to get back to work. But… my wife would want me to do it, I guess. If it makes her feel better. Blood work and the EKG… okay. But no Holter monitor today, please? Can we talk about that later? I don't want to be hooked up to machines all day. And what if it's something bad? Will I need to take pills? I don't want to take pills. Can we just see what the blood work says first? Maybe it's nothing. Nurse to draw blood… okay. Please just be quick.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Puder. We will start with the blood work and EKG. We can discuss the Holter monitor after we review the results, if necessary. I understand your reluctance, and we won’t proceed with any further testing without a thorough discussion. It is important to understand that I cannot definitively say whether or not you will require medication at this time. The blood work and EKG will help us determine the cause of your palpitations and elevated blood pressure, and then we can discuss appropriate treatment options. It's possible the cause is benign, and no treatment will be necessary. However, it's crucial to rule out any serious underlying conditions. Nurse, could you please come in and draw Mr. Puder’s blood for a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level?
PATIENT: Okay. I just want to know what's wrong. And I hope it's quick. I have work to do. Will the nurse tell me what the blood work is for? I like to know things. My wife tells me to ask questions.
DOCTOR: The nurse will explain the procedure, but she will not be able to provide you with the results. I will review the results when they are available, and we will discuss them at your follow-up appointment. Mr. Puder, I understand your concern about getting back to work. However, it is important to prioritize your health. Pushing yourself while potentially having an underlying medical condition could be detrimental. I strongly advise you to refrain from strenuous activity until we have a clearer understanding of what is happening. Here comes the nurse now. She will explain everything. Please cooperate with her, and remember to inform her of any allergies you may have, even if they seem minor.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I will tell her I don't like needles. And I don't like being poked. Is it going to hurt a lot? My wife always says I have a low pain tolerance. I just want this to be over with. And can we still skip the Holter monitor? Please?
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, I assure you, the blood draw will be relatively quick and should not cause significant pain. The nurse is very experienced, and will do her best to make you comfortable. A brief, sharp prick is all you should feel. As for the Holter monitor, let's focus on the blood work and EKG first. We can revisit the discussion about further testing after we have reviewed the results. I understand your apprehension, and I will not pressure you into any procedures you are not comfortable with. However, please understand that it may be necessary to gather more information to ensure your health and well-being. Let’s allow the nurse to explain the procedure. Try to relax, Mr. Puder. The sooner we get this done, the sooner we can determine the cause of your palpitations and find a solution. .
