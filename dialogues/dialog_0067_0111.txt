DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, I suppose I'm here about…my skin. It’s darkening, and I’m terribly fatigued. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this, so if we could get right to it… I work with iron, you see. Reinforcing. A strong trade, but…it's tiring work. And this skin…it just doesn’t look right.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Darkening skin and fatigue… and you mentioned working with iron, reinforcing, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, reinforcing iron and rebar. For…buildings, mostly. Bridges sometimes. Important work. Though, truthfully, I can’t recall the specifics of every project these days. My wife usually keeps track of those details. She has the memory in this family, thankfully. Now, about this skin…it feels…unsettling. I've never experienced anything quite like it.
DOCTOR: I see. It's good you have your wife to help with details. We’ll take our time and figure this out. You mentioned the skin feels unsettling. Can you describe the darkening?
PATIENT: It's…difficult to explain. It's not like a sunburn, certainly. More…a general dullness, coupled with a brownish tinge. It's all over, I think. Though, my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. It’s just…not the color it should be. And this weariness…it's constant. I used to be able to work all day without a second thought. Now, I’m exhausted after just a few hours. Really quite debilitating. Is this going to take long? I have commitments, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Mr. Drahota. We’ll be as efficient as possible. The dullness and brownish tinge all over… that’s helpful. And you've noticed a significant change in your energy levels. To get a better understanding, has this change in skin color and fatigue come on suddenly, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I believe. It wasn't one day, suddenly different. More like…slowly fading. Like an old photograph. I suppose it’s been…several months. It’s hard to pinpoint, truthfully. Time gets away from you. And frankly, I didn’t pay much attention until it became…noticeable. My wife pointed it out, naturally. She has a keen eye for these things. Are we getting anywhere? I must admit, I'm not entirely sure what this has to do with anything. I work with iron. It's a physical job. Perhaps I'm simply getting old.
DOCTOR: That's a fair point, and it’s good you and your wife are noticing these changes. Several months of gradual darkening and fatigue… that helps narrow things down. Working with iron, being a physical job… that’s relevant, and we’ll explore that. To clarify, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue and skin changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I suppose I have been a bit… forgetful lately. More so than usual. Though, at my age, one expects a bit of mental slippage. And… my joints ache sometimes. Just a general stiffness, mostly in the mornings. Nothing debilitating, mind you. But… noticeable. Do you think this is something serious, Doctor? I really haven't the time for a prolonged illness. I have responsibilities.
DOCTOR: Okay, forgetfulness and joint stiffness… noted. And I understand your concern about time and responsibilities. To get a clearer picture, is the joint stiffness worse in certain joints, or all over?
PATIENT: Mostly my hands and knees, I think. The hands especially, as you might expect. All that gripping and bending with the iron. They feel… swollen sometimes. Not dramatically, but enough to be irritating. It makes it difficult to tie knots, which is…unacceptable. A good tradesman needs steady hands. Honestly, I’ve never had trouble with my hands before. This is… troubling. Are you going to take blood? I dislike needles. Immensely.
DOCTOR: I understand your dislike of needles, Mr. Drahota, and we'll keep that in mind. Swelling in the hands and knees along with the stiffness… that’s further helpful information. Yes, I do think some blood work would be beneficial to help us understand what’s going on. It will help us look at several things, including iron levels, kidney function, and other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well. Blood work it is. Though I must insist it be done quickly. And as little discomfort as possible, if you please. I have never understood the fascination with puncturing perfectly good skin. Frankly, it’s barbaric. But if it’s necessary…do make it swift. And afterwards, perhaps we can discuss a solution? I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Drahota, we'll do everything we can to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I'll personally ensure the phlebotomist is efficient. If you'll have a seat, I'll quickly review your chart and then we can proceed with the blood draw. While we're waiting, can you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Honestly, it’s rather unremarkable. A few childhood illnesses, nothing serious. A broken arm when I was a young man – fell off a scaffolding, rather foolish of me. Otherwise, I’ve been remarkably healthy. Good constitution, you see. I’ve always eaten well, worked hard, and avoided… unnecessary complications. My wife handles most of the doctor visits, so I don’t often recall specifics. She’s very diligent. And please, let's not dwell on this for too long. The sooner we're finished, the better. I have a delivery to oversee this afternoon. It's rather important.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Drahota, and it sounds like you’ve taken good care of yourself. A childhood illnesses and a broken arm… that’s a very clean medical history. And your wife is very attentive, that’s wonderful. I see here that you haven't had a full physical exam in several years. It also notes you are currently uninsured. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Uninsured, yes. A rather unfortunate situation, frankly. The cost of healthcare these days is… exorbitant. And allergies… hmm. No, I don't believe so. Nothing I'm aware of. My wife always double-checks before administering anything. She's very thorough, I must reiterate. Now, are we going to get to this blood work, or are we simply going to discuss my wife’s virtues all afternoon? I have a schedule to maintain, you understand. This is…inconvenient. Really quite inconvenient. And frankly, I’m starting to feel rather faint. Perhaps this fatigue is more serious than I initially thought.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the delay, Mr. Drahota, and for making you wait. You’re right, let’s get this blood work done. And I'm sorry to hear you're feeling faint. That’s concerning. Nurse Lee will take excellent care of you. It will just be a few vials of blood. She’ll start with your arm. Please let either of us know immediately if you feel lightheaded or unwell during the procedure. We can have you lie down if necessary.
PATIENT: Very well. Lead the way, I suppose. Though I must warn you, I have a terrible aversion to needles. A perfectly rational fear, if you ask me. A barbaric practice, really. And do hurry, please. I haven’t got all day. . I trust this Nurse Lee is…competent? I’ve heard stories… dreadful stories.
DOCTOR: Nurse Lee is exceptionally skilled and very gentle, Mr. Drahota. She has a great deal of experience and is very understanding of patient anxieties. I will stay here with you throughout the procedure to ensure everything goes smoothly. Nurse Lee, this is Mr. Drahota. He's a little anxious about the blood draw, so your gentle touch would be greatly appreciated. Just relax your arm, and Nurse Lee will take it from there.
PATIENT: Very well. Get it over with quickly, then. I haven't the patience for prolonged discomfort. And please, inform me before you insert the… instrument. I prefer to be prepared, as much as one can be for such an ordeal. This is…unsettling, to say the least. Honestly, I've faced more challenging situations reinforcing steel girders. Just hurry, please. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Nurse Lee: “Okay Mr. Drahota, I'm going to clean the area now. It will feel a little cold.” “Alright, now you’ll feel a quick pinch.” Dr. Pfennig: “You’re doing very well, Mr. Drahota. Just breathe deeply. It will be over in a moment.” "Keep a close watch, please." Nurse Lee: “All done, Mr. Drahota. Just keep pressure on this for a few minutes.” Dr. Pfennig: "Wonderful. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Unpleasant. Most unpleasant. And…rather undignified. A perfectly good arm, punctured by a… needle. Honestly, it’s barbaric, I tell you. But it’s over, I suppose. . It feels…sore. And I do feel a bit lightheaded. Perhaps I should lie down. Yes, I believe I should lie down. This entire experience has been… thoroughly demoralizing. When will we have these results? I have a delivery to oversee, you understand. It’s rather time-sensitive. And please, no more needles. I beg you. No more needles. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Drahota. Let’s get you lying down for a few minutes. It's perfectly normal to feel a bit lightheaded after a blood draw, especially if you’re not fond of needles. Your blood pressure is a little low, but nothing to be alarmed about. Resting for a few minutes will likely bring it back up. The lab typically takes about 24 to 48 hours to process the results. We’ll have them back by tomorrow afternoon at the latest. As soon as they're available, my staff will contact you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, please just rest. And I assure you, we'll do everything possible to avoid any further needle sticks if we can. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: Just… silence. A bit of peace and quiet, if you please. And perhaps a glass of water. This entire ordeal has been… draining. Honestly, I’ve faced more strenuous challenges reinforcing steel girders. A glass of water, if you please. And then, I suppose, I should return to my commitments. This delivery… it’s rather important. And please, inform my wife. She’ll be…concerned. She always is. Just…let me rest. A bit of rest. That’s all I ask. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Drahota. I’ll ensure you have everything you need to rest comfortably. I will inform your wife as soon as we're finished here, and she’ll know you’re resting comfortably. If you need anything at all, please don’t hesitate to let us know. .
