DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, honestly, it’s a bit hard to explain. People have been saying my speech hasn’t been very clear lately. It just… feels off, you know? Like I’m not saying the words properly. I don't really remember when it started, though. It just… happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn, I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. It's definitely worth looking into if you're noticing changes in your speech. “Feels off” is a good way to describe it, and it’s common for things to start gradually, so not knowing exactly when it began isn’t unusual. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about how it feels off?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. It’s not like I’m slurring all the time, but sometimes the words just… don’t come out right. Like my tongue feels a bit heavy, maybe? And I have to really think about how to say things, which makes it even worse, I think. It’s not painful, though, not at all. Just… frustrating. I’m not sure if that makes any sense. I apologize if it doesn’t.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Adyn. It sounds like you're very aware of what’s happening, and that's helpful. A heavy tongue and having to consciously think about forming words… those are important details. And it's good to know there's no pain associated with it. Now, has this affected anything else?
PATIENT: Affected anything else… let me think. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I haven't noticed any trouble swallowing, or anything like that. My husband says I seem a little more tired than usual, but he also says I always look tired! He’s a tease. I haven't had any headaches or dizziness, either. Just the speech, as far as I can tell. Oh… and maybe I’ve been a bit clumsier? Dropped a few things recently, but I'm not sure if that's related.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No trouble swallowing, no headaches or dizziness – that’s all helpful information. And the tiredness… we’ll keep that in mind, but it could be unrelated. The clumsiness is worth noting too, even if you’re not sure if it’s connected. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant medical problems… Honestly, Doctor, I don’t really remember much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and things like that, but nothing serious. I don’t have any long-term conditions that I know of. I do have Medicare, if that helps? My husband handles most of the paperwork, so I’m not always sure of the details. I’m married, by the way. Have I mentioned that? It just… slipped my mind.
DOCTOR: No, you hadn’t mentioned that yet, but thank you for letting me know, Adyn. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t recall all the details – that’s what we’re here for. We can look up your medical history through Medicare. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think… I might have had my tonsils out when I was a child? But it was so long ago, I barely remember it. It wasn't a big deal, as far as I know. And no, I don’t think I’ve ever been hospitalized for anything else. Nothing serious, anyway. I mostly just get the occasional cold. I’ve been quite lucky, really. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Adyn. Tonsillectomy is good to know. Okay, let’s move on to your family. Do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a hard one, Doctor. My family… well, we don’t really talk about medical things much. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I don’t remember her having any major illnesses. My father is still alive, but he lives in Jamaica, and we don’t speak often. I know he has high blood pressure, I think? And maybe diabetes? But honestly, I’m not very sure. It's just not something we discussed. I apologize for being so vague. It’s just… difficult to remember.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Adyn. That’s perfectly understandable. It's common for families not to discuss medical history openly. High blood pressure and potential diabetes in your father are good to know, though. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor! I don’t do any of those things. Never have, never will. I'm a churchgoing woman, you see. And my husband wouldn't allow it! He's very particular about my health, always making sure I eat right and get enough sleep. I drink tea, though. Lots of tea. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Adyn. And tea absolutely does not count! It's actually quite healthy. Now, let's talk about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones or vitamins.
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a multivitamin, just to keep things topped up. And sometimes, when my knees are acting up, I take ibuprofen. Just the regular kind, nothing strong. Oh! And I take a tablet for my blood pressure, my husband reminded me just this morning. It's… Lisinopril, I think? He handles the prescriptions, so I don’t always know the names. It's a small white tablet. That's all, I believe. Just the vitamin, ibuprofen when needed, and the blood pressure tablet.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Adyn. Multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed, and Lisinopril for your blood pressure. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don't think so, Doctor. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to think I was allergic to shellfish when I was a child, but it turned out I just didn't like the taste! My husband is allergic to bee stings, though. He carries an EpiPen, just in case. But as for me… no allergies, to my knowledge. I apologize if I'm being unhelpful. I'm just not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Adyn. It's good you recall your husband's allergy, though. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look in your mouth and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I’ll just sit here and try to relax. Hopefully, I won’t be too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn, deep breaths in… and out… good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Relax your arm… good. And the other arm… okay. Both reflexes are normal. Now, open wide for me… ah… your throat looks clear, no obvious swelling or redness. Tongue is midline. I don’t see any obvious lesions. Everything looks normal so far, Adyn. No immediate signs of anything concerning, but that doesn’t rule anything out. Based on what you’ve told me and this brief exam, I’m concerned about a possible neurological issue affecting your speech. It could be a number of things. I would like to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. What kind of tests, Doctor? I’m not very good with hospitals, you see. And I don’t like needles. I understand you need to find out what’s wrong, but… are they going to be painful? I really don’t want anything painful. What exactly are you looking for? I apologize for being so anxious. It’s just… I don't like being ill.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Adyn, and I want to assure you I'll explain everything thoroughly and we'll proceed at your pace. We'll start with a simple MRI of your brain, which doesn’t involve needles. It's a painless imaging scan that will help us visualize your brain and identify any potential areas of concern. We may also order a speech therapy evaluation to assess your speech patterns and identify any specific difficulties. The speech therapy evaluation involves simply talking with a therapist. As for bloodwork, a standard complete blood count can rule out other possibilities. If those initial tests are inconclusive, we might consider a referral to a neurologist, a specialist in brain and nerve disorders. We’ll start with the MRI and the CBC. The speech therapy evaluation can be scheduled separately. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: An MRI… no needles, you say? That’s… good. And just talking? I can manage talking. Bloodwork… I suppose I can handle a little bloodwork. As long as it’s not too much. I really don't like seeing blood. So, MRI, speech therapy, and a little blood. Okay. Yes, that sounds… manageable, as you said. When would these tests be scheduled? And where will they be done? I need to arrange transportation, you see. My husband usually drives me, but he’s working this week. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? I apologize for all the questions. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're not bothering me at all with your questions, Adyn. It's important to be prepared. The MRI can be scheduled at the Rural General Hospital, about 20 minutes from here. They usually have availability within the next week. We'll aim for Wednesday or Thursday, if that works for you. It takes about 30-45 minutes. You don't need to do anything special beforehand, just let them know if you have any metal implants. The bloodwork can be done right here in the clinic lab tomorrow morning. It will just be a standard vial or two, and our phlebotomist is very gentle. And we can schedule the speech therapy evaluation for next week, depending on their availability. I will have my receptionist, Sarah, schedule everything for you. She’ll call you with the specific times and any further instructions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect, Doctor. Wednesday or Thursday for the MRI is fine. Bloodwork tomorrow morning is good, too. And speech therapy next week. Sarah will call me… excellent. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I feel much better knowing what to expect. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any symptoms I should look out for in the meantime? I don’t want anything to get worse while I’m waiting for the tests. And… should I avoid anything? Any foods or activities? I apologize for being such a worry.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. For now, there’s no need to avoid any specific foods or activities. Just continue to monitor your speech for any changes—if it worsens suddenly, or if you develop any new symptoms like weakness, dizziness, vision changes, or difficulty swallowing, please contact us immediately. It’s unlikely, but it's always best to be cautious. We’ll proceed with the tests and then discuss the results with you thoroughly. If the speech therapy evaluation identifies specific exercises or techniques, they will provide you with instructions. I’m going to write a referral for the speech therapy evaluation now and give you a printed sheet with information about the clinic and Sarah's contact details. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. Thank you again for your patience and kindness. I feel much more at ease now. I’ll wait for Sarah’s call, and I’ll see you again after the tests.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your tests. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
