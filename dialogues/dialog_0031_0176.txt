DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just…won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re really getting on my nerves now. It’s been over 48 hours, which is…longer than they usually last, I think.
DOCTOR: I see. Hiccups that have persisted for over 48 hours. That is a bit unusual. Can you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Describe them? Hmm. Well, they're…normal hiccups, I guess. You know, that little jerk in your chest and then you…hic…breathe in quickly. It's just…constant. Not really painful, just…irritating. And they seem to happen randomly. I haven't noticed anything that specifically causes them, or makes them worse, or better, really. hic It’s just…hic…there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they’re not associated with any particular trigger, and they aren't painful. Just a persistent, irritating sensation. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the hiccups?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me think. hic No, not really. I’ve been a little tired, maybe? But that’s just…life, you know? I run a small entertainment venue, so late nights are common. hic Nothing else that I’ve noticed. No stomach pain, no trouble breathing…just the hiccups. And they’re really starting to make me look silly when I'm talking to clients. hic
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue can certainly accompany a demanding schedule. And persistent hiccups can be quite disruptive, especially in your line of work. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history…well, nothing major, thankfully. hic I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and broke my arm once falling off a…well, never mind that story. hic I've always been pretty healthy. No serious illnesses, no surgeries besides the tonsils, no regular medications…just the occasional pain reliever for a headache. I don't really go to the doctor unless I have to, honestly. hic And I haven’t been insured for…a long time.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Redeye. It's good to know you generally enjoy good health. No chronic conditions or regular medications. And you mentioned no current medications. Are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. hic Seriously. I eat everything, I haven’t had a bad reaction to anything…at least not that I remember. I've been around cats and dogs my whole life, no problem. Dust, pollen…usually just a little sniffle, nothing serious. hic I haven’t had a proper allergic reaction, like swelling or trouble breathing. hic Never.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had some heart trouble when he was older. hic Both of them lived a good long life, though. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. hic Nothing major, really. No one in the family has ever had anything…unusual. No cancers, no genetic diseases…just the usual aging stuff, you know? hic My grandmother had arthritis, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of hypertension, some heart trouble in your father, and arthritis in your grandmother. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…well, I’m divorced. Been divorced for about ten years now. hic I own a small venue – a sort of live music and comedy spot. Keeps me busy. hic I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially – maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then. hic I don’t use any drugs. I try to eat reasonably well, even with the late hours. And I try to get enough sleep when I can, but that’s…difficult. hic I don't have any pets at the moment. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. No smoking, minimal alcohol use, no drug use, and you own and operate a venue, which I understand can lead to a demanding schedule. Alright, Ms. Redeye. Given the persistence of your hiccups – over 48 hours – and the absence of any immediately obvious cause, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. hic Anything to get rid of these things. hic Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit silly trying to have a conversation like this. hic Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your abdomen. It's just a quick assessment. Please lie back for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, no masses or distension noted. I don't feel any obvious abnormalities. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 76 and regular. Respiratory rate is 16 and normal. No immediate concerning findings on the physical exam.
PATIENT: Okay. hic That’s…good, I guess. hic So, what does that mean? hic What could be causing these? hic I feel like I’m going crazy. hic Is there anything you can do? hic
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Redeye. It’s unsettling to experience prolonged hiccups without a clear cause. The good news is that in most cases, persistent hiccups are benign – meaning not caused by a serious underlying condition. However, because yours have lasted over 48 hours, we want to investigate a bit further to rule out anything less common. It could be something as simple as a mild irritation of the phrenic nerve – that’s the nerve that controls the diaphragm – or occasionally, it can be related to gastroesophageal reflux, even without noticeable heartburn. Rarer causes could include issues with the central nervous system, but those are less likely given your otherwise normal exam. I'd like to order a basic metabolic panel – that’s a blood test to check your electrolytes and kidney function – and a chest X-ray, just to be safe. The X-ray will rule out any lung issues that might be irritating the phrenic nerve. While we're waiting for those results, we can try some simple remedies to see if they help. Have you tried holding your breath, or drinking water quickly?
PATIENT: Holding my breath…yes, I’ve tried that. hic Several times. hic It helps for a few seconds, maybe, and then they come right back. hic Drinking water quickly…I think I tried that too. hic It didn’t seem to make any difference. hic I’ve also tried getting someone to scare me, which just annoyed my staff. hic Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like I'm losing my mind. hic A blood test and an X-ray…okay. hic Will that take long? hic And what if it’s…something serious? hic
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Redeye. It's perfectly natural to worry when something unusual is happening with your body. The blood test and X-ray shouldn’t take too long – typically, we can get the results within 24-48 hours. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. As for the possibility of something serious, it’s important to remember that it’s less likely. The vast majority of persistent hiccups resolve on their own or with simple interventions. However, it's always best to rule out any underlying causes. If the tests come back abnormal, we will discuss the findings with you and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, we can try a medication called baclofen, a muscle relaxant, which is sometimes used to treat hiccups. I'll write you a prescription for a low dose. Start with one tablet three times a day with meals. If that doesn't help within a few days, we can adjust the dosage. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, like I said before. hic Okay, baclofen… hic three times a day with meals. hic I’ll try anything at this point. hic Honestly, it’s just…exhausting. hic And embarrassing. hic Is there anything else I should be doing? hic Any foods I should avoid? hic Or anything I should be trying at home? hic I feel helpless. hic
DOCTOR: I appreciate your willingness to try the medication. It's good you’ve already tried some home remedies. There aren't any specific foods you need to avoid, but I would recommend avoiding carbonated beverages and spicy foods, as those can sometimes trigger hiccups or worsen them. Try to eat smaller, more frequent meals, rather than large ones, and avoid lying down immediately after eating. You could also try some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises or meditation. Stress can sometimes exacerbate hiccups. While it may seem counterintuitive, focusing on calming yourself down could potentially help. I’m going to give you a printed handout with more information about hiccups and some additional tips. It also has my contact information should you have any questions or concerns. Here's the prescription for the baclofen, and this is the information sheet. Please call my office if the hiccups don’t improve within a few days, or if you experience any side effects from the medication. We’ll follow up once we have the results of the blood test and X-ray. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. hic Thank you, Doctor. hic You’ve been very helpful. hic I just really hope this works. hic It’s… it’s starting to affect my work. hic And my patience with my staff. hic I’ll try the medication and the relaxation techniques. hic Thank you again. hic
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Redeye. I understand your frustration, and I’m hopeful that we can get this resolved. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and have a good day. And please try to rest.
