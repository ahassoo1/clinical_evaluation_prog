DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, doc, no offense, but I don’t really do small talk. Just… bleeding. From down there. Been happening a few days now. Not a little bit either. It’s… a lot. And frankly, it’s worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I understand. No need for small talk at all. Bleeding is definitely something we need to address. “Down there” – do you mean rectal bleeding, or bleeding from the urinary tract?
PATIENT: Rectal, obviously. What kind of question is that? Honestly. I’m not some… child. It’s blood in my stool. Dark stuff. And… well, there's been a fair amount of it. Look, I'm not here to play twenty questions, I just need it fixed.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Gentz. That was a poorly worded question on my part, and I didn't mean to imply anything. It’s important to clarify, and I understand your frustration. "Dark stuff" is good information. Is it consistently dark, or does the color change?
PATIENT: Consistently dark. Like… coffee grounds. And it’s not just a little streak, doc. It’s… substantial. I’ve been trying to ignore it, honestly. Figured it was just something I ate, but it hasn't stopped. I’m not a doctor, I wouldn’t know why it’s happening. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, coffee grounds is important to note – that suggests it might be higher up in the digestive tract. And you're right to come in when it doesn't stop. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bleeding?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I’ve been feeling tired, I guess. More tired than usual. And a little weak. Nothing major. Just… run down. Appetite’s been off too, but I haven’t been eating much anyway since… well. You know. But, yeah. Tired, weak, no real hunger. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does help, thank you. Fatigue and weakness with a decreased appetite are all things we need to consider. Now, have you experienced any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Some cramping, yeah. Lower abdomen. Comes and goes. Nothing that would send me to the hospital screaming, but… noticeable. And I’ve been a bit bloated too, I think. Hard to tell, honestly. I'm not exactly in peak physical condition if you couldn’t already tell. It’s probably nothing, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping and bloating are helpful to know. And don’t worry about peak physical condition—that doesn't change what’s going on. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical history? Not really. I had a bad case of the flu once, a long time ago. And… well, my wife, God rest her soul, passed away a few years back. That’s about it. Never been much for doctors, honestly. Figured I was healthy enough. Now… clearly, I was wrong.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Gentz. That must have been incredibly difficult. And it’s understandable you haven’t needed to see doctors often. Okay, no known medical conditions, that’s good to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed 'em. Always managed to avoid those. I’m a fairly… durable guy, usually. Or was, I guess. Look, I don't mean to be difficult, doc, but this whole thing is… unsettling. I'm just trying to give you what information you need.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all, Mr. Gentz. I appreciate you sharing everything with me. It’s completely understandable to be unsettled. No surgeries – good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely nothing. Never been one for pills. I avoid 'em like the plague. Always figured they did more harm than good, honestly. I'll suffer through it, thank you very much. Just… no medications. Ever.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, that’s helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I eat pretty much anything. Haven’t had a reaction to anything in my life, as far as I can remember. I’ve always had a pretty strong stomach. Until now, apparently. This bleeding… it's just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… I’ll have a beer with dinner sometimes, maybe. Nothing excessive. And recreational drugs? Are you serious? I’m a grown man, doc, not some… delinquent. Just the occasional beer, that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional beer. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of colon cancer, rectal cancer, or any other digestive issues in your family?
PATIENT: Digestive issues… Hmm. My mother had some stomach trouble later in life, I think. But she never really talked about it. Always kept things to herself. My father… I don't really know much about his medical history. He passed away when I was young. Nothing major, as far as I know. We weren't a family that… discussed these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, some stomach trouble in your mother, and limited information about your father’s history. That’s alright, we work with what we have. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen and a rectal exam. This will help me assess the situation and determine the next steps.
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Really? Look, doc, I appreciate you trying to figure things out, but… I’m not thrilled about that. Is it absolutely necessary? Couldn’t we… try something else first? I’m just… not comfortable with that. This whole thing is already bad enough without having to… do that.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Gentz. It’s not a pleasant procedure, and I wouldn’t suggest it if it wasn’t important. A rectal exam is a crucial part of evaluating rectal bleeding. It allows me to check for any abnormalities, such as hemorrhoids, fissures, or masses. It’s the best way to get a preliminary understanding of what’s causing the bleeding and will help me determine if further testing, like a colonoscopy, is necessary. We could start with some blood work to check your hemoglobin levels and rule out anemia, but that won’t tell us the cause of the bleeding. It’s really the most direct way to start. I want to assure you that I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. It will be over quickly. But I need to gather as much information as possible to provide you with the best care. Would you be willing to reconsider?
PATIENT: Look, doc, you make a good point. I don’t want this to drag on. And you’re right about needing to know the cause. Fine. Do it. Get it over with. But… be gentle, alright? And quick. Please. This is… unsettling, to say the least. And frankly, I’d like to get out of here as soon as humanly possible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Gentz. I will be as gentle and quick as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go, and you can let me know if you’re uncomfortable at any point. Okay. I did palpate some tenderness in the rectum, and there appears to be some internal hemorrhoids present. However, to rule out anything more serious – and given the consistency and amount of bleeding you’ve described – I strongly recommend a colonoscopy. It's the most thorough way to examine the entire colon and identify the source of the bleeding. I’m going to order some blood work to check your hemoglobin and other levels. That will give us a baseline. And I’ll write a referral for you to a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive health – for the colonoscopy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… great. Just what I needed. Another unpleasant procedure. Look, doc, I'm not thrilled about any of this, but I suppose if it’s necessary… fine. Do it. Get it over with. And… how long does this take? And… will I be… asleep? I really don't want to be awake for any of this. This is… a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Gentz. It’s not the most enjoyable procedure, but it’s the most effective way to get a definitive answer. The colonoscopy itself typically takes about 30-60 minutes. You’ll be given sedation – usually a combination of medications – to make you comfortable and relaxed. Most patients don’t remember much, if anything, of the procedure. You'll likely be groggy afterward, so you’ll need someone to drive you home and stay with you for a few hours. The gastroenterologist’s office will provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the procedure, including a special diet and bowel cleansing regimen. It’s important to follow those instructions carefully to ensure a clear view of the colon. I’ll send the referral electronically to a few gastroenterologists in the area, and they'll contact you directly to schedule an appointment. I'll also provide you with a list of their names and contact information. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and eating a high-fiber diet. Avoid straining during bowel movements. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay. Sedation… that's good. At least I won’t be awake for it. High-fiber diet… fluids… alright. I can manage that. Look, doc, I appreciate you explaining everything. Honestly. This is… unsettling. I suppose the only question I have is… how long will it take to get an appointment with one of these… gastroenterologists? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks if it’s something serious. And… will my insurance cover any of this? Wait… I don’t have insurance.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important point, Mr. Gentz. Not having insurance complicates things, but it doesn’t mean you’re without options. Many hospitals and gastroenterology practices have financial assistance programs available for patients who are uninsured. We can explore those options and see if you qualify. I also have a list of local resources that can help with the cost of care. As for the appointment timeframe, it can vary depending on the practice and their availability. It’s generally a few weeks out, but some practices may have earlier openings. I’ll make a note to call a few of the offices and see what their current wait times are. I'll also try to prioritize practices that offer financial assistance. I will get you that list of financial resources and the contact information for the gastroenterologists. We'll work to get you an appointment as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any increased bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Emergency room… great. Just what I needed. Look, doc, I appreciate you trying to help. Honestly. I really do. I just… this is a lot to take in. No, I don’t think so. I just… get me that list of resources, alright? And… try to find a gastroenterologist who won't take forever to get an appointment. And... one who’s… understanding. I really don't want to deal with anyone… condescending. Alright. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Gentz. I understand. I’ll make a note to prioritize practices known for their compassionate care. And I will call around tomorrow and see what appointment availabilities are like. I will also ask about their financial assistance programs. Here is the list of local resources that may be helpful. And here is the list of gastroenterologists. I’ll follow up with you tomorrow to let you know what I find. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much. We’ll get this sorted out. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thanks, doc. Honestly. You've been… helpful. Just… try to find someone who won't treat me like an idiot, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Gentz. I will keep that in mind. My priority is to find you a gastroenterologist who you feel comfortable with and who will provide you with excellent care. You take care now, and please call if you need anything. .
