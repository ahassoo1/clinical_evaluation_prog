DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it's this tiredness. Just dreadful, really. It comes and goes, but when it comes, I can barely lift a teacup. And the young man at the lab said something about my… my numbers being off. Something about my muscles? Honestly, I don't keep up with all that fuss.
DOCTOR: “Numbers being off,” right. And this tiredness… how long has it been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Ages, dear. Ages. I suppose… maybe six months? It’s hard to say. Time just… slips away when you’re older, you know. It’s not like it’s new, though. I just thought it was… well, being my age. But it's been worse lately, if I'm being honest. I used to be able to keep up with the garden, but now… now it's a struggle. My husband, Pem, has to do most of it. And he's not as young as he used to be, either.
DOCTOR: Six months… and it’s been progressively worse. And you mentioned difficulty with the garden. Are you experiencing any pain with that, or just weakness?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really… not sharp pain, anyway. It’s more of an ache, a deep, tired ache in my arms and legs. Like I’ve been doing hard labor all day, even when I haven’t. And it’s not just the garden, you know. Even climbing the stairs… it feels like a monumental task. Honestly, I just feel… old. Is that a complaint? I suppose it is. It's certainly feeling like something's wrong, and it's not just old age.
DOCTOR: A deep, tired ache in your arms and legs, and difficulty with stairs. Not sharp pain, just a general weakness. Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and ache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's hard to say. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. Sometimes I feel a bit… wobbly, like I might fall. And I've been rather thirsty lately, more so than usual. But that could be the weather, couldn’t it? It’s been terribly hot. Oh, and… sometimes my urine is darker than it should be. But honestly, Doctor, these things come and go. It's hard to pinpoint anything specific. It’s just a general feeling of… being unwell. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: "Wobbly" and increased thirst… and darker urine. Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is…well, it's not what it once was. I don't have much of a hunger these days, not like I used to. Pem keeps telling me I need to eat more, but sometimes I just don't feel like it. I mostly pick at my food. And when I do eat, things just don't seem to taste the same anymore, you know? Everything feels a bit… bland. But I’m not losing weight, if that makes a difference. I’m still… substantial, let’s put it that way. I always was a good eater, when I had the appetite for it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that’s a question. Let me see… well, I had my gallbladder out, ages ago. And… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it's been under control with medication ever since. Pem handles all the details, you see. He's very good with the doctor stuff. I can’t remember the names of all the pills I take, honestly. Just… a few, for my blood pressure and… something for my joints, I think. Oh, and I had the flu shot, every year, of course. I'm a sensible woman, after all. But other than that… not much, I don't think. Pem would know better, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Cholecystectomy… hypertension… Let's just confirm the medications. Do you have a list with you, or could Pem possibly bring one in?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I never carry a list. And Pem… he's at the market, picking up vegetables. He’ll be back later, I suppose. Honestly, Doctor, I just come when something feels really wrong. I don’t bother with lists and details. It all feels a bit… unnecessary, if you understand what I mean. I’m an old woman, I’ve lived a long life. I just want to know what’s making me feel so tired. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Oitker, that’s not too much to ask. It’s just that having a list of medications helps us ensure there aren't any interactions or conflicts. Very well. We'll proceed without it for now. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. It'll just be a quick check of your strength and reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A quick exam is fine. I suppose I should let you poke and prod, shouldn’t I? Just don’t expect too much, dear. I’m not as sprightly as I used to be. And please be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be, either. Though, to be honest, I’m not sure what difference poking and prodding will make. It all feels rather… vague to me, this whole process. But do what you need to do, Doctor. Just… be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please sit up straight for me. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished, but present. And finally, let’s check your muscle strength. Strength is notably diminished in both upper and lower extremities. As expected, you do exhibit some weakness. It’s difficult to assess the extent of it without further testing.
PATIENT: Oh, well, that’s hardly surprising, is it? I told you I was weak! It's not exactly a revelation, Doctor. So, what does it mean? Is it serious? Am I going to end up in a bed all day? Honestly, I’d rather not dwell on it. I just want to know what’s making me so tired, and if there's something you can do about it. What kind of “further testing” are we talking about? More poking and prodding? Or something… more invasive? Because frankly, I’m not fond of needles.
DOCTOR: It’s not simply a matter of “poking and prodding,” Ms. Oitker. We need to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, your electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels. And yes, it will involve a blood draw. It's standard procedure. We also need to rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue and weakness. This could be anything from a vitamin deficiency to… something more serious. Recommend comprehensive metabolic panel, CBC, TSH, Vitamin D.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All that? Honestly, Doctor, it sounds rather… alarming. A vitamin deficiency? Something serious? What kind of “something serious”? I don’t like this one bit. I just came in here because I was tired! Now you’re talking about “underlying causes” and… and blood draws. Are you sure it’s necessary? I mean, couldn’t we just… try a tonic? Or maybe some extra rest? My mother always said a good rest could cure anything. And frankly, the thought of all those needles… it's quite upsetting. Perhaps Pem can talk to you about it? He's much better with the medical details. I just feel rather faint thinking about it all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, with all due respect, a "tonic" and "extra rest" are unlikely to address the underlying cause of your symptoms. While I understand your apprehension, these blood tests are necessary to determine the cause of your fatigue and weakness. It's responsible medical practice. Ignoring the problem won't make it go away. It may even worsen it. As for the blood draw, it’s a simple procedure, and the discomfort is minimal. We can take it slowly. But we need these tests. It’s non-negotiable. We'll discuss the results thoroughly once they are available. Patient hesitant regarding laboratory testing. Emphasized necessity for diagnosis.
PATIENT: Well, I never! Non-negotiable? You make me sound like a naughty child! Honestly, Doctor, I’ve lived a long and full life, and I’ve never been spoken to like that before. I suppose I have no choice then. But I expect you and your… assistants to be very gentle. And I want a full explanation of everything. No medical jargon, mind you. I’m an old woman, not a doctor. And if I feel faint, I want to be taken care of immediately. Honestly, all this fuss over a little tiredness. The youth of today… always rushing to poke and prod. It’s quite ridiculous. Very well, do your tests. But don’t expect me to be happy about it.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. They are aware of your concerns. I’ve also made a note for them to be gentle and to take their time. Once the results are back, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and get as much rest as possible. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Oitker.
PATIENT: .
