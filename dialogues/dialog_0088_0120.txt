DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I'm Dr. Piet. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I don't really have a lot of time, so I'll just get straight to it. I want to… have a baby. And I want to make sure it happens easily, you know? I don’t want any trouble with it. My husband… well, he’s gone now, and I’m getting… on. I want to do this right, and quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand. You're hoping to conceive and want to optimize your chances, and you'd like to do this as efficiently as possible. That’s perfectly reasonable. To start, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a while ago. Yes, I had two. Decades ago. Everything was… normal, I suppose. No complications that I remember. Honestly, I don't recall much detail. Things just… happened. It wasn't like now, with everyone making such a fuss. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful information. Knowing your previous pregnancies and deliveries gives us a baseline. And yes, things have changed a bit since then – we have more tools and information available now. Do you have any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I had… a touch of the flu last winter, a bad one. And my knees ache sometimes, you know, getting older. But nothing serious. I don't go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. I just don't trust them, honestly. They always want to give you pills for everything. Do you need me to list everything I've ever had? It'll take all day.
DOCTOR: No, not everything. Just anything ongoing or that might affect pregnancy. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just vitamins. You know, a multivitamin, sometimes calcium for my bones. And I take something for my knees when they really bother me, but it’s… I don't even remember the name. Some cream, I think. Nothing else. Honestly, I try to stay away from all that stuff if I can. It can't be good for you. Are we almost done? I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: Almost. Just a few more questions, then we'll do a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I mean, I get itchy sometimes, but who doesn't? I think I was a little sniffly around cats as a child, but I haven't been around one in ages. Honestly, I think people just make up allergies these days. It's a fad. Is that important? I really don't think I'm allergic to anything. Can we speed this up?
DOCTOR: Alright. Last question for now. Could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, goodness. Where do I even begin? My mother… she lived to be old, very old. But she had… problems with her heart, I think. And my father… he was healthy, I guess. But a lot of his siblings died young, from… I don't know, things. Just… things. It was a long time ago, and nobody talked about it much. Is this really necessary? It feels like you’re just fishing for something to be wrong.
DOCTOR: It's helpful information to have, Ms. Villarreal, just to get a complete picture. It helps us understand any potential risks. Okay, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just your weight, blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But please be quick. I really don’t have all day, and I hate doctors poking around. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat. I’ll start with your weight and height. Okay, your weight is 130 pounds, and your height is 164 centimeters. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, rate approximately 72 beats per minute. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 128/78. Everything sounds normal so far, Ms. Villarreal. Now, I would like to order some routine blood work, just to check your overall health and hormone levels. This will help us determine the best course of action for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… Ugh. I really don't like needles. But… if you insist. I suppose it can't hurt. Just… please try to be quick about it. And no poking around too much! I hate all this fuss. Can we get this over with so I can leave? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll have the nurse draw the blood. It’s a standard panel – complete blood count, thyroid function, hormone levels, and a basic metabolic panel. It shouldn’t take long. I'll review the results as soon as they come in, and we can discuss them and develop a plan. Please take this to the lab just down the hall. They’ll get you taken care of quickly. Once you’ve had the blood drawn, you can get dressed, and I'll see you back in my office to discuss next steps. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me out of here. .
