DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh, my… where to begin? Well, it’s this pain. In my lower stomach, you see. It comes and goes, but when it comes… it’s quite severe. I believe that’s what prompted the visit. It’s been… troubling. I’m afraid my memory isn't what it once was, so recalling exactly when it started is difficult. But it's been happening with increasing frequency, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. Intermittent lower abdominal pain. Increasing frequency is certainly something we want to investigate. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How to describe it… It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… cramping, a deep ache. It feels like… twisting, almost? And it radiates… down into my legs sometimes. It's hard to explain. It certainly takes my breath away when it’s bad. I find myself just… curled up, trying to ride it out. I apologize for the vagueness; I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Cramping, deep ache with radiating pain down the legs. And it causes you to curl up due to the severity. Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Glymph. To help me get a clearer picture, can you tell me anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers… now that’s a good question. I haven’t really been able to pinpoint anything specific, Doctor. It doesn’t seem to be related to food, or activity level… at least, not that I've noticed. Sometimes it happens after… well, after a long day, I suppose. But other times it seems to come on completely randomly. I do find that stress makes everything worse, naturally, but it's difficult to say if that causes it, or just makes it more noticeable. I'm terribly sorry I can’t be of more help. My mind is… a bit foggy these days.
DOCTOR: I see. So, no clear identifiable triggers, though you suspect stress exacerbates it. And you’ve noticed it occurring even with minimal activity. Alright. Ms. Glymph, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Bowel habits… changes in them? Let me think… Yes, actually, now that you mention it. I have been… rather irregular, lately. Not consistent, at all. Sometimes I feel… quite bloated, and other times… well, other times it’s the opposite. And the color… I don’t wish to be indelicate, but it hasn’t been quite right, either. Darker than usual, I believe. It's all rather unpleasant to discuss, truthfully. Is this… is this concerning? I've simply assumed it was… a natural part of getting older.
DOCTOR: Irregularity, bloating, and darker stool… Yes, this is information we need to address. Ms. Glymph, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or with your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood? Let me think very carefully… That’s… a rather frightening question, Doctor. I… I haven't seen any bright red blood, no. But… sometimes, after a particularly difficult episode, the stool is just… darker. Almost black, I suppose. I assumed that was simply from… the digestion process. But you’re asking about blood… is that a cause for alarm? I apologize; I'm not very good at describing these things. My husband, bless his soul, always handled these matters. He always knew exactly what the doctor needed to know.
DOCTOR: Dark stool can indicate the presence of blood, Ms. Glymph, which is why I’m asking. It's important to rule out any serious causes. Now, let's move on. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or fever recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Well, that does sound worrisome. Dark stool indicating blood… I hadn’t realized. As for nausea… yes, actually. I have felt a bit queasy at times, particularly after the pain. Not full-blown vomiting, thankfully, just a general feeling of… unwellness. No fever, though. I haven't felt warm or shivery, or anything like that. Just… tired, and uncomfortable. This all sounds rather… serious, doesn’t it? I hope it's nothing too dreadful. I really must apologize for not being more observant. My memory is just… so unreliable these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, nausea with abdominal pain, irregularity, and dark stools… Ms. Glymph, I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your abdomen, and a gentle palpation. It's also likely we will need to order some blood work and a stool sample to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Whatever you deem necessary, I trust your judgment implicitly. A physical examination and some tests… yes, that makes sense. It's just… a little unsettling, to be honest. I haven’t had a thorough examination in… well, quite some time. But I understand it’s important to get to the bottom of this. Please, proceed as you see fit. I'll do my best to cooperate. And thank you for your patience with me; I apologize for being such a… difficult patient.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. We'll start with auscultation – listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. I'm listening for bowel sounds. They seem…hypoactive. And I'm noting some tenderness in the lower left quadrant. Not severe, but present. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that… that is a little uncomfortable. Not excruciating, but I definitely feel something. A dull ache, right there. It’s the same area where the pain usually begins, I believe. It's a bit like a… pressure, a tightening. And yes, I can feel… a slight resistance, perhaps? It’s hard to describe. I apologize; I’m not very good at pinpointing these things. But you are correct; there is definitely tenderness there. It feels… a little swollen, almost? I'm afraid I am rather flustered now; this is all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I noted some tenderness and slight resistance in the lower left quadrant. This, combined with your symptoms, is concerning for several possibilities. We need to rule out diverticulitis, a possible bowel obstruction, and other inflammatory conditions. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool analysis. I'm also ordering a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh my. A CT scan… that does sound rather serious, doesn’t it? Diverticulitis, a bowel obstruction… I hadn’t even considered such things. I must confess, Doctor, I am quite frightened now. As for allergies… let me think very carefully. I… I don't believe so. I've had contrast dye before, many years ago, for a… a different issue. I didn't have any reaction then, but my memory is, as you know, quite unreliable. I think I would have remembered if I had a reaction, wouldn't I? But… perhaps it’s best to err on the side of caution. I’m not certain. Is there any way to test for an allergy beforehand? I apologize for being such a worry. I really must try to be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Given your uncertainty, we will proceed with the CT scan with caution. The radiology department will take necessary precautions. Now, Ms. Glymph, I'm going to order a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation after we have the results of these tests. They specialize in the digestive system and will be best equipped to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. Do you have a preference for a gastroenterologist?
PATIENT: Oh, a specialist… that sounds wise. A gastroenterologist… no, I don’t have a preference, Doctor. I haven’t seen a specialist in quite some time, and I’m afraid I don’t know any personally. Whoever you recommend would be perfectly acceptable. I trust your judgment implicitly. And thank you for taking such good care of me; I truly appreciate your patience and kindness. It’s… reassuring to know someone is taking this seriously. I’m just… quite anxious now, awaiting the results of these tests. What sort of timeline are we looking at? Will it be long before we know something?
DOCTOR: The lab work should be back within 24-48 hours. The CT scan results will likely take a bit longer, perhaps 2-3 business days, given the need for a radiologist to review the images. I will personally contact you as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, I'm prescribing you a mild antispasmodic medication to help manage the abdominal cramping. It’s not a solution, but it may provide some temporary relief. Do you have any questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: Oh, 2-3 business days… that does seem a bit long, but I understand it takes time. A mild antispasmodic… that sounds good. Anything to ease the discomfort would be greatly appreciated. No, Doctor, I don’t think I have any further questions at the moment. You’ve been very thorough and informative. I suppose… I’ll just try to rest and… and try not to worry too much. Thank you again for everything. I do appreciate your kindness, and your patience with my… vagueness.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will provide you with the prescription and instructions for the medication. If your pain worsens significantly, or you develop a fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we will follow up as soon as the test results are available. I wish you well, Ms. Glymph. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I truly appreciate that. I will follow your instructions carefully. And I will try to remain calm. Thank you again for everything. Goodbye, Doctor Hembrey. .
