DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Krahn. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes… Doctor Vanochten, is it? Right. Well, it's… something about a check-up. For… work, I think. Something about needing to be cleared for a performance? It's all a bit foggy, honestly. They just sent me here. Is that right? A physical… for acting? Or something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a work physical. Yes, I see a note here about a performance clearance. That explains it. Alright, well, let's start with a little bit about your general health. Have you been feeling generally well lately?
PATIENT: Generally well… hmm. You know, as well as an old man can feel, I suppose. No big complaints, not recently. A bit of creaking in the joints, but that's just age, right? Nothing I haven’t gotten used to. I… honestly, I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about how I feel. Does that make sense? I just… keep going.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Krahn. “Creaking in the joints,” you say. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it's mostly in my knees, and sometimes my back. When I stand for too long, or if the weather's bad, it gets… stiff. Not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. It loosens up after a bit of moving around, though. I used to… I used to do a lot of walking. With work, you know? Ushering and such. Less of that now. It’s probably just from not being as active.
DOCTOR: Alright, knees and back stiffness that improves with movement. And you mentioned a history of walking with work… How long ago did you reduce your walking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It must be… a good five years now, maybe more? It’s hard to keep track. Things kind of blend together after a while, you know? I’m retired now, mostly. Just take on odd jobs here and there. It's not like I was running marathons or anything. Mostly just… being on my feet. A lot. Was that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Mr. Krahn. Just trying to get a picture of your activity level. Now, aside from the stiffness, have you noticed any other symptoms – anything at all – like shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, headaches, changes in your vision or weight, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. Not really. Maybe a little winded going up stairs, but I always figured that was just… being out of shape. No chest pain, no dizziness. Headaches, sometimes, but nothing severe. And my weight… I haven’t weighed myself in ages. Honestly, I try not to think about those things too much. Is there something I should be worried about? I just want to get this clearance and get back to… whatever it is I do.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant new symptoms, just expected changes with age. Let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks alright. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. The sooner we get this done, the better. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just… try to be quick, if you wouldn’t mind. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Please have a seat here. And then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. 140 over 85. Pulse is 78 and regular. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Heart sounds… normal S1 and S2. No murmurs, rubs or gallops. Lymph nodes are normal, no swelling. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s common with age. Knees show some crepitus with range of motion, consistent with what you described. Back has full range of motion, no tenderness to palpation. Alright, everything seems generally okay, but your blood pressure is a little high. It could be a one-time reading, or it could be a sign of something else. I'd like to run a few basic blood tests just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, okay. If that's what you think is best. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know much about any of this. Just tell me what needs to be done. The blood pressure… is that bad? Should I be worried? I really just need this clearance so I can… well, I don't even remember what I need the clearance for anymore. It’s all so confusing. Do I need to fast for the tests?
DOCTOR: No, no need to fast. I'll order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. That will give us a good overview of your general health. The blood pressure is mildly elevated, and it's something we should monitor. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it's good to have a baseline. Here's a slip for the lab. It’s just down the hall, room 203. They'll be able to draw the blood for you. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back, we can discuss them. Do you have any questions about the tests, or anything else we’ve talked about?
PATIENT: Room 203, right. Okay, I think I can manage that. No, I don’t… I don’t think I have any questions. Just… get the tests done, and tell me what I need to do. I really appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. I suppose I’ll go get this over with. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. You're very welcome. Let me know if you have any trouble finding the lab. We'll get these results back to you as quickly as possible. Have a good day.
