DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It’s… good to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Brum is fine. Yes, the headache… it’s in the back of my head. Been there a few days now. Not… terrible, but always there, you know? Like a… weight.
DOCTOR: A headache, you say. And it’s been present for a few days now, consistently located at the back of your head. You describe it as a constant “weight.” Hmm. Could you elaborate on that weight?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Yes. It’s not… a sharp weight. More like… if I carry something heavy all day, but I don’t remember carrying it. It doesn’t get much worse with moving, or looking down, or anything like that. Just… is. It makes it hard to think sometimes, you know? Like… fog. Not bad fog, just… there.
DOCTOR: I see. A constant, non-pulsating pressure at the base of the skull, not exacerbated by activity. And you mention some difficulty with concentration. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside this headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. My eyes, maybe? They feel tired. And sometimes, I feel… a little dizzy. Not falling-down dizzy, just… off balance. Not often, though. Mostly just the headache and the tired eyes. Oh! And… I forget things. More than usual, I think. But I’m ninety years old, Doctor. I forget things all the time.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, memory changes are certainly not uncommon at your age, Mr. Brum. However, we still need to investigate this headache. Have you noticed any changes in your vision – blurring, double vision, spots?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Vision is… okay. Not as good as it used to be, of course, but I wear glasses. And they help. No blurring, no spots, no… double anything. Just tired. They get tired easy, especially if I read too long. I used to read the newspaper every day, but… not so much anymore. It’s hard to see the small letters.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you experienced any fever, neck stiffness, nausea, or vomiting at all with this headache?
PATIENT: Fever? No. No fever. Neck… feels normal, I think. A little achy sometimes, but… I work with machines all my life. My neck is always a little achy. Nausea? No. I haven't been sick to my stomach. And no… throwing up. No, Doctor. Nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. I used to have… troubles with my back, from lifting things at the rail yard. But that’s old news. The doctor gave me some pills, and it got better. Mostly just aches and pains now. Old age, you know? I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. I don’t have insurance, and… well, I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes! A long time ago, when I was a young man, I had my appendix taken out. And… I broke my arm once, when I was a boy. That needed a cast. But that’s it, Doctor. Nothing else. That was… sixty years ago, maybe more.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, regarding your family… is there anyone in your family with a history of headaches, neurological problems, or any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father, he had trouble with his heart. He died when I was young, but I think it was his heart. My mother… she lived a long life, but I don’t remember any… special sicknesses. A lot of us just get old, you know? And… we die. No special headaches, no… problems with the brain. Not that I remember.
DOCTOR: And what about your lifestyle, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well… I live alone. My wife… she passed away five years ago. I mostly stay at home now. I like to watch the television. And I… putter around in the garden a little. Grow some tomatoes. Used to work on machines all the time, but… not so much anymore. I don’t drink, and I don’t smoke. Always been that way.
DOCTOR: Very good. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I can take most pills, I think. The doctor gave me some for my back, and I didn’t have any trouble with them. And… I can eat anything. No… special foods that make me sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. I’d like to perform a brief neurological examination to assess your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Neurological… examination? You mean… you want to look at me? And… poke me? Yes, Doctor. I suppose so. If you think it’s best. What will it… feel like?
DOCTOR: It’s quite straightforward, Mr. Brum. I will assess your reflexes with a small hammer, check your strength by asking you to resist my movements, and evaluate your coordination. It shouldn’t be unpleasant. Please just relax, and follow my instructions. First, let’s check your reflexes. Could you please sit comfortably with your legs uncrossed?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Legs… uncrossed. Like this? Just tell me what to do. And… be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Just relax your leg, Mr. Brum. Good. And now the other side. Both reflexes are present and equal. Now, could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like that, Doctor? Is that… enough? It’s been a long time since I’ve been asked to squeeze anything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very good. Excellent strength, actually. Now, I’m going to ask you to resist my movements. I want you to try to push my hand down while I apply pressure. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Resist… your movements. Push… down. Yes, Doctor. I understand. Like… arm wrestling?
DOCTOR: Try to push up against my pressure, Mr. Brum. Good. Now, let’s check your coordination. Could you please point to your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that… correct? It’s a little shaky, but… there.
DOCTOR: Very good. And now, touch your nose with your finger, and then touch my finger. Repeat that a few times.
PATIENT: Nose… then finger… nose… then finger… It’s… harder than it looks, Doctor. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Now, let’s check your gait – how you walk. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps forward, then turn around and walk back?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Walking… Like this? Is that… okay? I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine, Mr. Brum. Please be careful. Alright, thank you. That was helpful. Now, based on your history and this brief examination, it appears you are experiencing headaches accompanied by some mild balance issues and a slight tremor. Your reflexes and strength are intact, which is reassuring. However, given your age and the subtle neurological findings, I would like to order a few tests to rule out any underlying causes. Would you be willing to undergo a brain scan – a CT scan or an MRI – and some blood work?
PATIENT: Brain scan? MRI? What… what are you looking for, Doctor? Is it… serious? And… blood work? I don't like needles. It sounds… complicated. And… expensive.
DOCTOR: The tests are to rule out any serious causes for your symptoms, Mr. Brum. A brain scan will help us visualize your brain to check for any structural abnormalities – such as a tumor, stroke, or bleeding. The blood work will assess your overall health and rule out any infections or other medical conditions that could be contributing to your headaches. It's important to be thorough, even if it's just a precaution. As for the cost, we can discuss options with the hospital’s financial department to see if assistance is available. I understand your concern about needles, but the blood draw is a quick procedure, and we can make you as comfortable as possible. Would you be willing to proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: A tumor? Oh dear… My wife… she… she had a tumor. That’s what… that’s what took her. I don’t know, Doctor. I… I don’t want to know if I have a tumor. It sounds… terrible. And the needles… I really don’t like needles. Maybe… maybe it’s just old age. Maybe I just need to rest more.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, I understand your fear, and it’s perfectly natural to be anxious about these tests. However, it's essential to remember that the tests are not a diagnosis. They are simply a way for us to gather more information and rule out any serious possibilities. The vast majority of headaches are not caused by tumors. However, given your age and the subtle changes we observed, it’s important to be thorough and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I can order a simpler blood test initially, if that would make you more comfortable. It won’t provide all the information, but it’s a good starting point. And we can discuss alternative options if you’re truly averse to the brain scan. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: Simpler blood test… Yes… yes, that might be okay. Just the blood test, for now. No… no scan. Not yet. But… what if the blood test shows something? What then? Will you… will you tell me everything? I want to know… I need to know. Even if it’s bad.
DOCTOR: Very well. We can start with a basic blood panel. It will check your overall health and rule out any common infections or vitamin deficiencies that could be contributing to your headaches. And yes, Mr. Brum, I assure you I will be completely transparent with you regarding the results. I will explain everything in detail, regardless of what the tests show. We will discuss all your options and work together to develop a plan that is best for you. I will write an order for the blood work now. You can take this to the lab downstairs, and they will draw the sample. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we have them, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Downstairs… yes, I can manage that. A few days… No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Just… just write the order. And thank you. For… for listening. And for not making me have the scan… yet.
DOCTOR: Here is the order. The lab is just downstairs, to your left. They’ll take good care of you. Alright, then. I’ll see you in a few days. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms in the meantime.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Good day.
