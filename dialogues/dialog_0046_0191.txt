DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I requested to come in… to get tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do, and I thought it best to just get it done.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub, that's a very responsible decision. It's good you're taking proactive steps regarding your health. I see you requested an HIV test. Before we proceed, can you tell me a little bit about why you're wanting to get tested today?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s a bit difficult to talk about, truthfully. My husband and I… we haven’t always been the most careful. And it’s been a long time since either of us were tested for anything. I just want to be sure, you know? For both our sakes. It’s better to know, isn't it?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Shaub. It is always better to know, and you've come to the right place. It takes courage to discuss these things, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. To help me understand the situation better, and ensure we do the appropriate testing, could you tell me a little bit more about when you and your husband engaged in unprotected sex?
PATIENT: Oh dear… well, it wasn't just one time, Doctor. It's been… on and off over the years, really. Perhaps… the last time was… oh, maybe six months ago? It's hard to pinpoint exactly, to be honest. We’ve been married for a long time, and things weren’t always discussed openly. We've been trying to be better about that lately, though. Does it matter if it was many times, or just the most recent one?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know, Ms. Shaub, and thank you for being so open with me. The frequency does matter, as it affects the window period for accurate testing. The "window period" is the time between potential exposure and when a test can reliably detect the virus. For most standard HIV tests, this is typically three months, but can sometimes be longer. Because of that, and given the history you've described, we’ll want to consider some options to ensure the most accurate results. Before we discuss those, could you tell me if either of you have ever had a previous HIV test, and if so, when?
PATIENT: That makes sense about the window period… I hadn’t thought of that. Hmm… to my knowledge, neither of us has ever been tested before. Not that I recall, anyway. My husband… he doesn't talk about his past much. We met later in life, you see, and… well, it wasn't something that came up. It’s quite possible he has, but I truly don't know. It's…embarrassing to admit, but we didn’t discuss health matters much before getting married.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Ms. Shaub. Many couples find themselves in similar situations, and it’s good you're addressing it now. Okay, given that neither of you has a known history of HIV testing, and considering the potential for past unprotected exposure, I recommend we do a fourth-generation HIV antibody/antigen test. This test can detect the virus earlier than antibody-only tests. We'll also want to consider testing for other sexually transmitted infections , as they often occur together. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it’s more thorough, then yes, please. And testing for other things as well… that's a good idea. I don’t want any surprises. What does that involve, exactly? Will it be… painful? I’m not a fan of needles, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles, Ms. Shaub. We'll take things at your pace and make you as comfortable as possible. For the HIV test and the STI screening, we'll need to draw a small amount of blood. It’s a standard procedure, and I’m very skilled at minimizing discomfort. You may feel a brief pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. Afterwards, there might be a small bruise, but that usually resolves quickly. The STI screening typically includes tests for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Depending on your risk factors, we can also test for other infections if needed. Before we proceed with the blood draw, let's briefly review your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, well… let me think. My blood pressure has been a little high lately, the doctor mentioned it at my last check-up, but he didn’t prescribe anything, just said to watch my salt intake. Other than that… no, nothing major. I had a bad bout of the flu a few years ago, but that was it. And my husband… he’s generally healthy, as far as I know. He’s a strong man, works outdoors a lot. He doesn’t go to the doctor much, though, believes in “toughing it out.” Is that something we need to worry about? Him not seeing a doctor regularly?
DOCTOR: It's good to know about your blood pressure, Ms. Shaub. We can monitor that today and discuss it further. Your husband's preference to avoid the doctor is… common, unfortunately. However, it's important for everyone to have regular check-ups, even if they feel healthy, as many conditions have no early symptoms. For now, let's focus on getting you both tested. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies. I've always been lucky that way. No allergies to any medicines or… anything, really. Latex is fine as well. I’ve used latex gloves before without issue. I’m ready whenever you are, Doctor. I’m just… a little nervous, if I’m being honest. This is a bit daunting.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous, Ms. Shaub. It takes courage to face these concerns, and I commend you for taking this step. Alright, let's get started. I'll need to take a small blood sample from your arm. I'll clean the area with an antiseptic wipe, then insert a needle into a vein. It should only take a few minutes. After the sample is collected, I'll apply a bandage to the site. Just relax your arm for me, and take a few deep breaths. I’ll let you know when I’m finished. Do you have a preference for which arm you'd like me to use?
PATIENT: Oh… right. Okay. Um, the left arm, please. I think… I think I slept on my right arm funny last night, so it's a little sore. The left one should be fine. Please, be gentle. I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. The left arm it is. And I will be as gentle as possible, I promise. Okay, all done. Just keep that bandage on for at least 15-20 minutes to prevent any bleeding or bruising. You may feel a little bit of soreness later, but that should subside quickly. The lab results should be available in about 3-5 business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then, or I can call you with the results if you prefer. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness that’s over! That wasn’t as bad as I thought, but… still not pleasant. Thank you, Doctor. Yes, a phone call would be fine. I don't really want to come back to the clinic if I don’t have to. Um… what happens if… if it’s positive? What would we do then? That's what I'm really worried about, I suppose. Will my husband have to get tested too?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Shaub. I understand your anxiety, and it’s good you’re asking these questions. If the test results are positive, it means you have been infected with HIV. It’s important to remember that HIV is a manageable condition these days. With proper medical care, people living with HIV can live long and healthy lives. The first step would be to confirm the results with a follow-up test. Then, we would discuss treatment options, which typically involve antiretroviral medications. These medications can suppress the virus, prevent it from damaging your immune system, and reduce the risk of transmission to others. Your husband absolutely would need to be tested as well. If he tests positive, he would also need to start treatment. If he tests negative, we would discuss preventative measures, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis , to reduce his risk of infection. We'll also discuss safe sex practices and partner notification, to help prevent further spread of the virus. I know this is a lot to take in. I want to assure you that you are not alone. There are many resources available to help you and your husband cope with an HIV diagnosis. I can provide you with information about support groups, counseling services, and other organizations. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds alright, Doctor. Thank you. Information about support groups would be very helpful. And… thank you for being so patient. It’s just… a lot to think about. I need to tell my husband, of course. He’s going to be… upset. I hope he gets tested. We’ve been together a long time, and… I don't want this to change things. Do you have… a number for the support groups? Or a website, maybe? I think I need to read about this a bit on my own, too. Before I talk to him.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Shaub. It’s completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, and it’s good you want to be prepared before talking to your husband. Here are a few resources that might be helpful. HIVinfo: [https://www.hivinfo.nih.gov/] – A comprehensive website with information about HIV/AIDS, treatment, prevention, and support services. The Body: [https://www.thebody.com/] – A website with articles, personal stories, and expert advice about living with HIV/AIDS. Local Support Groups: I can provide you with a list of support groups in your area. Let me just pull up the resources for our suburban clinic location… This sheet has contact information for several local support groups and counseling services. Remember, it’s important to have open and honest communication with your husband. Let him know you are there for him and that you will face this challenge together. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you so much for your kindness and patience. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll look over these resources and… talk to my husband soon. I appreciate everything. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Shaub. I'm glad I could help. Remember, I'm here if you need anything in the future. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and please, take care of each other. .
