DOCTOR: Hi Marija, welcome. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, hello Doctor. Well, my husband, he insists I come. He says…one must be prepared. I believe he means these…documents. An Advance Directive, he called it. And a POLST form. I haven’t the faintest idea what those are, truthfully, but he’s quite insistent. It all seems rather…dramatic, don’t you think? For someone my age.
DOCTOR: It’s good of your husband to be proactive, even if it feels a bit overwhelming right now. Those documents – the Advance Directive and POLST form – are about planning for the future, making sure your wishes are known if you ever couldn’t speak for yourself. It is better to be prepared, and it doesn’t mean anything bad is going to happen. It just means we're thinking ahead. Before we dive into those forms, though, is there anything else bringing you in today?
PATIENT: Well, I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly capable of speaking for myself. And I maintain excellent health, thank you very much. Though…I suppose my knees ache a bit these days. It’s the weather, I suspect. Dampness. But that is hardly a reason to fill out…papers about my wishes. It sounds so…final. Is it a lengthy process? Because I have a luncheon scheduled this afternoon, and I simply must be prompt.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Marija. And I absolutely respect that you're feeling well and are capable of speaking for yourself. These forms aren’t about assuming you can’t, it’s about making things easier for everyone if something unexpected were to happen. About your knees… dampness can certainly aggravate things. But let's talk about it a bit more. When did the aching start?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I believe it was sometime last autumn. Perhaps October? It’s difficult to recall precisely. It’s a minor annoyance, truly. I take some over-the-counter remedies. Ibuprofen, I believe. And I try to avoid prolonged standing. But to dedicate valuable time discussing knees when I came for these…these end-of-life arrangements…it seems rather a misallocation of resources, don’t you agree? My husband will be most displeased if I am late for my luncheon.
DOCTOR: You’re right to prioritize, Marija. And I apologize if I’m taking up too much time. I just want to get a clear picture of everything, so we can make sure you're feeling as comfortable as possible and address your husband’s concerns about the Advance Directive and POLST form. Just to clarify, is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Mostly with the dampness, as I said. And after too much gardening. I enjoy my roses, you see. But it is not…debilitating. I can manage. Truly. Now, if we could simply get on with these…forms? What exactly is an Advance Directive? And this POLST thing? Is it a long document? My husband mentioned something about…preferences. I find the whole thing dreadfully morbid.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Marija. It can feel morbid, but it’s really about empowerment – making sure your wishes are honored. An Advance Directive is a legal document that allows you to name someone to make healthcare decisions for you if you’re unable to. It also lets you outline your preferences for things like life-sustaining treatment. The POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a bit more specific. It’s a medical order that tells healthcare professionals what kind of care you want if you're seriously ill or injured. It’s typically for people with serious health conditions, but anyone can have one. We don't have to complete either one today if you’re not comfortable. We can just talk about it and see if it feels right for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it sounds…complicated. And rather undignified, to be discussing such things with a stranger. My husband insisted I come to you specifically, of course. He said you were…thorough. But I fail to see the necessity. I am a healthy woman, as I have repeatedly stated. And frankly, I haven’t the patience for lengthy legal documents. Couldn’t we simply…skip it? I assure you, my husband will be most relieved. And I have a perfectly good luncheon reservation. A very important luncheon, with the ladies of the garden club.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Marija. It sounds like you’ve already given this a lot of thought, and you’re very clear about what you want. And honestly, if you’re not comfortable with it, we absolutely don’t have to proceed. Sometimes, it helps just to have the conversation, even if you decide not to fill out the forms. Would you mind if we briefly discussed what your husband’s concerns are?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Perhaps a brief discussion will suffice. My husband, you see, he worries. He always worries. About everything. He’s…a retired accountant. A very meticulous man. And he’s read something…in the newspaper, I believe…about the importance of these documents. He said something about…peace of mind. Honestly, the man fusses over every detail. But he means well. He simply wants to be…prepared. Though I fail to see why I should be burdened with such anxieties.
DOCTOR: It sounds like he's a very caring man, just trying to look out for you in his own way. And it's perfectly reasonable for him to want that peace of mind. Sometimes, these documents just make things easier for everyone down the line. Just out of curiosity, has he specifically mentioned what he’s most concerned about?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, he mumbles. He always mumbles. Something about…being able to express my wishes if I were…incapacitated. And something about…avoiding arguments amongst the family. He’s worried my sister, Fatima, would…intervene. She’s rather…opinionated, you see. And quite fond of medical dramas. She thinks she knows everything. Honestly, it’s a dreadful mess. The man simply wants to avoid conflict. He’s a creature of habit, my husband. And a dreadful worrier. It’s exhausting, frankly. But I suppose I indulge him. To a point.
DOCTOR: It sounds like your husband is trying to anticipate every possible scenario. And it’s understandable that he’d want to make sure your wishes are respected, especially with a sister who’s…involved. So, if we were to talk about this Advance Directive, it would be mostly about clarifying who you’d want to make decisions for you, and what kind of care you’d want in different situations. Would you be open to just discussing a few scenarios?
PATIENT: Scenarios? Honestly, Doctor, the very thought is…distressing. I prefer not to dwell on such morbid possibilities. But…if it will appease my husband, and allow me to return to my luncheon promptly…very well. A few scenarios. But I warn you, I am a woman of strong convictions. And I dislike complications. Do not expect lengthy deliberations. I have a garden club meeting to attend this afternoon, you see. And the hydrangeas are rather demanding.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. Absolutely no pressure, and we’ll keep it as brief and straightforward as possible. And hydrangeas are demanding, I understand completely. Let’s start with a simple one. If you were seriously ill and unable to speak for yourself, and the doctors determined there was no reasonable chance of recovery, would you want them to do everything possible to prolong your life, even if it meant being on machines and experiencing a lot of discomfort?
PATIENT: Machines? Discomfort? Absolutely not! I have lived a perfectly respectable life, thank you very much. I do not wish to be…propped up like a porcelain doll. Prolonging life for the sake of prolonging life is…absurd. I prefer dignity. A quiet passing, in my own time. No tubes, no machines, no…fuss. I have made my wishes perfectly clear to my husband. He understands. Though he tends to overcomplicate things. Now, if we may proceed? I have a luncheon reservation, you see. And I do not intend to keep the ladies waiting.
DOCTOR: That’s very clear, Marija. And it’s good to know you’ve already discussed this with your husband. So, just to clarify… if you were in a situation where you could potentially recover, but might have a permanent disability, would you want treatment to help you regain as much function as possible, even if it meant a long and challenging rehabilitation?
PATIENT: Rehabilitation? Challenging? Honestly, Doctor, the very idea sounds…exhausting. I prefer my routines. I enjoy my garden. I do not wish to be…burdened with physical therapy and…uncertainties. If there is no reasonable chance of a full recovery…I prefer to…let nature take its course. I am a firm believer in acceptance. And I do not wish to impose upon others. My husband is…capable, of course, but he’s not exactly…athletic. Now, if we may conclude this…discussion? I have a luncheon with the garden club, you see. And the topic is…roses. A far more pleasant subject, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. That's perfectly clear. So, to summarize, you would prefer comfort care if there's no reasonable chance of recovery, and you want to avoid prolonged life-sustaining treatment or a lengthy rehabilitation. Now, just one more quick question, if you don’t mind. If you were to become incapacitated, who would you want to make healthcare decisions for you?
PATIENT: My husband, naturally. Though, honestly, he’ll likely consult with my sister, Fatima, regardless. She’s…persuasive. But legally…my husband. He understands my wishes, to a point. Though he tends to overthink everything. And he’ll probably want a second opinion. He always wants a second opinion. Honestly, it's exhausting. But legally…my husband. Now, may I be excused? I really must be going. The garden club is expecting me. And the roses…well, they simply must be discussed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. We’ve covered everything. I'll have these documents prepared for you to review and sign at your convenience. It was a pleasure meeting you. And I hope you enjoy your garden club meeting – and the roses! If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call. And thank you for being so clear about your wishes. It’s a gift to your loved ones. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Though I confess, I remain unconvinced of the necessity of all this paperwork. But my husband will be pleased. And that, ultimately, is what matters. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you for your…attention. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going. The roses are waiting. .
