DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these forms… I need them signed and… verified, I guess. For my health. It’s a bit of a hassle, honestly. I just want to get it over with, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. The forms. Yes, well, bureaucracy, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Tell me about it! I don't even know what half of this stuff is asking. And I don’t have anyone to help me with it anymore. It’s just… a lot. Can you just tell me what needs my signature?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, with all due respect, simply signing forms without understanding them isn’t…ideal. These are important documents regarding your medical history and consent for treatment. But, alright. Let’s start with the basics. This first section is confirming your demographic information - name, date of birth, address. Do you see that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that part’s easy enough. Tippens, Melvenia… August 12th, 1949. And my address is still 14 Oak Street. Is that all there is to it? Just checking it’s right?
DOCTOR: Not quite. Below that is a section on your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis?
PATIENT: Well… I had a bit of trouble with my knees for a while, but it's not so bad now. And my eyesight's not what it used to be, that's why I have these glasses. Does that count? I don't really have anything serious, if that makes sense. I haven't been to the doctor much in the last few years.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knee trouble, and declining eyesight. And you haven’t been to a doctor recently. Do you take any medications currently, Ms. Tippens?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never have. I try to stay away from those if I can. I believe in letting my body do its own healing, mostly. Is this going to take much longer? I have a… a commitment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications. Good for you, attempting to manage without. Now, allergies?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. Not that I know of. Never been allergic to anything, not that I’ve ever noticed. Dust bothers me a little sometimes, but everyone gets a bit sneezy with dust, don’t they? Is that something I need to put down?
DOCTOR: No, likely not the dust. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a one. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. I haven’t had much need for them. My mother always said strong genes. Is this about the form, or are you just… checking up on me? No offense, Doctor. It’s just… a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Standard procedure, Ms. Tippens. Just gathering a complete medical history. Now, family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history... That’s a tough one. My mother lived to be ninety, but I don’t really know how she did it. She didn’t talk much about illnesses. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. But that was a long time ago. And honestly, I’m not very good at remembering details like that. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Tippens. A family history of heart problems is relevant. Alright. Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother would have had a fit! And I don’t drink much either… maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Can we just get to the signing part now, please? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Very well. Before we get to signing, I do need to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few minutes. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… no. No, I didn’t realize there would be an exam. I just came to get these forms signed. I’m not really dressed for an exam… and I… I don’t really like doctors poking around. I thought this would be simple. I really just want to get this over with. Can’t we just sign the forms? I feel a little faint.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I understand your reluctance, but a basic exam is crucial for ensuring I have accurate information. It's a matter of responsible care. However, if you are feeling faint, we can certainly pause. But refusing a basic assessment makes completing these forms difficult from a legal standpoint, and I need to protect myself as well as you. Perhaps we can start with your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. This is all very stressful. Alright, alright. Fine. Blood pressure first. But just blood pressure. No poking, no prodding, just blood pressure. And then can we please sign the forms? I really need to be going. This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please extend your arm. 140/90. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 78, regular. Breathing sounds clear, though slightly labored. I note a mild murmur. It’s nothing to be overly concerned about at this stage, but I recommend following up for a more comprehensive cardiac evaluation. Now, about these forms…
PATIENT: Oh. Cardiac evaluation? See? This is what I was afraid of. This is exactly why I don’t like doctors. Look, I just need these forms signed so I can get this done. I'm not going to get a cardiac evaluation. I'm perfectly healthy, thank you very much. Can we please just skip to the signing? I'm feeling very unwell now. I really need to go home.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I understand your anxiety, but I cannot ethically sign these forms without documenting my concerns and recommending appropriate follow-up. Your blood pressure is elevated, and I detected a murmur. Ignoring these findings could have serious consequences. I am willing to sign the forms with a clear note indicating my recommendation for a cardiac evaluation, but I also strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with a cardiologist. Otherwise, I am afraid I cannot proceed. This is for your own well-being. And legally, I need to protect myself. What is your decision?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness gracious. Fine. Fine, you can write whatever you want. Just… just sign the forms. And I’ll… I’ll think about the cardiologist. Please, just get it over with. I really, really need to go now. This has been… awful.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here are your signed forms. I strongly urge you to schedule a cardiac evaluation within the next two weeks. I have included a list of local cardiologists. And, please, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, seek immediate medical attention. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
