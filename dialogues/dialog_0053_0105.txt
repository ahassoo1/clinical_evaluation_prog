DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it’s about getting surgery... for my weight. I think my wife set this up. It’s a… bariatric surgery, she called it. I don’t really remember all the details, to be honest. I just know I’ve been… bigger for a while now, and she thinks this could help.
DOCTOR: Right. Bariatric surgery. Okay. Well, we’ll certainly discuss that. It's good your wife is supportive, that makes a difference. First, let’s get a better understanding of things. When did you start noticing the weight gain, and has it been a gradual process or more sudden?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It feels like… a long time. Maybe ten years? Gradual, I think. Not like I woke up one day and was suddenly a lot bigger, but… slowly, over time. Things just kept adding up, you know? I used to be able to… well, I don’t really remember what I used to be able to do, actually. It's just been getting harder to do things lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual weight gain over roughly ten years. And you've noticed increasing difficulty with daily activities. Can you be a bit more specific about those activities?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Walking is… harder. Not like I can’t do it, but I get tired faster. And bending over… forget about it. It’s a whole operation just to tie my shoes. Things just feel… heavy, you know? Even just getting up from a chair takes effort sometimes. And… I used to play with my kids more, but I don’t have the energy for that anymore. It makes me feel bad.
DOCTOR: I see. So, difficulty with mobility, bending, and reduced energy levels impacting your ability to play with your children. That's… significant. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. I get out of breath pretty easily. Even just walking up the stairs. And… I sweat a lot. Like, a lot. More than I used to, definitely. I also… I don’t sleep well. I wake up a lot during the night. I don’t know if that’s related, though. Maybe it’s just getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s document this properly. We’ll do a quick review of systems. It helps me get a complete picture. I'm going to ask you about a few different body systems, just to rule things out. It’ll be a series of yes or no questions. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Yes, sure. Whatever helps. Just let me know if it's something complicated, 'cause I don't really remember much about… well, anything, lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, have you experienced any chest pain, palpitations, or irregular heartbeats?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. Sometimes a little discomfort, but not like a sharp pain. Palpitations… I don’t know what that means. Does that mean my heart racing? If so, maybe sometimes? Not often, though. It doesn’t happen regularly. I just feel… tired a lot, if that makes sense. It's hard to tell what’s going on with my heart, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Discomfort, not sharp pain, and occasional feeling of a racing heart. We'll note that. Next question: any shortness of breath, even at rest, besides what you’ve already mentioned with exertion?
PATIENT: Hmm… at rest… not usually. But sometimes when I lie down flat, I feel like I can't get a good breath. I usually have to prop myself up with pillows. It’s not constant, but it happens. A few times a week, maybe? It's just easier to sleep sitting up a little bit. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, shortness of breath when lying flat, relieved by propping up with pillows. Alright. Moving on. Any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah! Actually, yes. My wife keeps telling me to get some different shoes. She says my feet are always swollen at the end of the day. I didn't really pay much attention to it, but yeah, they do swell up. Especially if it’s hot out. It's uncomfortable, but I just figured it was from being on my feet all day at work.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ankle and feet swelling, especially with heat or prolonged standing. Good. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits…? You mean… going to the bathroom? I don't know. I go… regularly, I guess. Nothing really changed, as far as I know. Sometimes it's a little harder to go, but I just drink more water. It's… it's not something I really think about, to be honest. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Kochubey. That's perfectly alright. We're just trying to get a complete picture. Okay. Last few questions. Any problems with urinating – frequency, urgency, pain?
PATIENT: Urination… No, not really. Everything seems normal there. I go… when I need to go, you know? No pain, no urgency, nothing like that. I don't have to get up a lot in the night to go, either. No problems there, thankfully. Is that all the questions? My head is starting to spin a little.
DOCTOR: Yes, that was the last of them. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Kochubey. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… I think… I had high blood pressure, a few years ago. The doctor put me on some pills, but I stopped taking them after a while. My wife got mad at me, but… they made me feel weird. I don't remember what else. Maybe… nothing else? I haven’t been to the doctor in a long time. It’s hard to keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Okay. History of hypertension, previously medicated but discontinued. And haven't been to the doctor in a long time. Do you know why you were diagnosed with high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not really. The doctor just told me my numbers were too high. He said it was probably because of my weight, but… I don't remember any specific tests or anything. He just gave me the pills and told me to come back in a few months. I think I went once, then… I just stopped going. I’m not good with this kind of thing, Doctor. I just want to feel better. Is surgery the only way?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kochubey, surgery isn’t necessarily the only way, but given your weight and history of hypertension, it may be the most effective way to improve your overall health. However, it’s not something we take lightly. Before we even consider surgery, we need to get a thorough workup done. We'll need blood tests to check your kidney function, liver function, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. We'll also need an EKG to assess your heart health, given your history of high blood pressure. And potentially, some imaging studies. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds like a lot. But… yeah, alright. If it’s going to help me, I’ll do it. Blood tests, EKG, imaging… whatever you need. I just… I want to be able to play with my kids again, you know? And I don't want my wife to worry about me all the time. So, yeah. Let’s do it. When do we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Kochubey. We'll start with the blood work today. I'll have my nurse draw some samples. We'll schedule the EKG for tomorrow morning. As for the imaging, we'll discuss the best options after we get the results of the blood work. It might be a chest X-ray, or potentially a CT scan. The nurse will give you instructions on how to prepare. Now, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I don’t take any medications currently, besides… sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. Never had any problems with that. I think I’m okay. Nothing comes to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, currently not on any medications. One last thing before we get started with the blood work. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And… I used to drink a little bit, on the weekends, with my friends. But I stopped a few years ago. My wife didn't like it, and I figured it wasn't helping anything. So, no. I don’t drink either. I'm trying to be good, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. That's very good. It sounds like you’re making positive steps already. Let’s get you over to the lab, and we’ll get the blood work done. My nurse, Sarah, will be right with you. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything pretty well, Doctor. I’m just… nervous, I guess. It’s a lot to take in. But I’m ready to get this over with and hopefully feel better. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. And… thank you, Doctor. For everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It’s my job to help. And don’t worry, we’ll take things one step at a time. Sarah will guide you through everything. Just remember, you're not alone in this. Now, let’s get started. She's just around the corner. I'll be here if you need anything.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. .
