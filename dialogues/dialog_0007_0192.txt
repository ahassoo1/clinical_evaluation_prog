DOCTOR: Hi Delron, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. It’s… the army thing. The exam. Gotta get this done, you know? They want me to take it before… well, before they decide if I’m worth anything. It's August 2nd, by the way. Just so you know the date.
DOCTOR: Right, the army physical. Good you reminded me of the date – keeps things organized! Okay, so this is for a service evaluation, essentially?
PATIENT: Service… evaluation? Look, I just need a paper that says I'm not falling apart. That’s all. They said I gotta come here, you gotta check me over, and then you write something down. Is that it? Don’t need fancy words, just… a good report. I’m a strong guy, always been. Worked with engines my whole life. Builds character, you know? Not like these… city folks.
DOCTOR: I understand. You need a physical assessment for your service evaluation, and a report confirming you’re fit for duty. No problem at all. To get started, can you tell me a little bit about why they’re requesting this exam now?
PATIENT: Why now? Honestly, I have no idea. They just… called. Said it was time. Been thinking about it for a while, you know? Always wanted to serve, but… life happened. Engines needed fixing, bills needed paying. Now, they want to know if I’m still able. Seems a bit late, doesn’t it? I’m 51. Not a spring chicken, but still got plenty of life in me. And strength. Like I said. Don't ask me about any fancy reasons, I didn't ask them why now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it was a surprise request, and you weren't given a specific reason for the timing. That's perfectly alright. Let’s focus on you right now. Have you been feeling generally healthy?
PATIENT: Generally healthy? Yeah, mostly. I mean, I work with engines all day. Gets hot, greasy, loud. Back gets a little stiff sometimes, but what can you do? It's not like I'm sitting in an office chair all day, getting soft. I get tired at the end of the day, but that's just… work. Nothing to worry about. No illnesses, no aches, no pains that won't go away. Just… normal work stuff. I eat okay, I guess. Meat and potatoes, mostly. Don't need all those fancy salads and… fruits. A man needs substance, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, a physically demanding job. And you generally feel well despite the physical strain. Okay. When you say your back gets stiff, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It's… a dull ache, mostly. Starts in the lower back, after a long day bending over engines. Feels like it needs a good stretch, but it doesn’t really hurt, hurt. More… uncomfortable. Sometimes it goes up my spine a little. I usually just… ignore it. Rub it a bit. It goes away after I rest. Been happening for years, you know? Just part of the job. I can still lift things, still move around fine. It doesn’t stop me. I just… don’t bend over as much as I used to, if I can avoid it. Is that clear enough? I’m not one for complaining about a little stiffness. Weak folks complain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very clear. A dull ache in the lower back, radiating slightly up the spine, worse after physical work, relieved with rest. Doesn’t significantly impact function. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? No. Not really. Sometimes my feet get a little cold, but that’s just the workshop. It’s cold in there, you know? Concrete floor, drafts everywhere. I wear thick socks. It’s not like… pins and needles or anything. Just cold feet. Happens to everyone. I don’t think that’s important. Is that what you're asking about? 'Cause if so, no. Just cold feet. Like I said, thick socks solve it. Don’t need to worry about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so cold feet, easily addressed with socks, no numbness or tingling. Have you had any issues with your vision, hearing, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Vision's fine. Always been good. Maybe a little blurry up close now, you know, getting older. But I can still see fine for what I need to do. Hearing’s good too. Loud engines all day – kinda hard not to hear, if you get my drift. No ringing in my ears or anything. And dizziness? No. Never been dizzy. Steady as a rock. Always been. I don’t get motion sickness or anything like that. Pretty sure I’m fine there. This is all just… routine, right? They’re just checking boxes?
DOCTOR: Okay, vision slightly blurry up close, hearing good despite noise exposure, no dizziness. Let’s move on. Have you had any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Weight's about the same, I think. Maybe put on a few pounds over the winter, but that's just… comfort food, you know? Appetite's fine. Always hungry after a long day working. Eat like a horse. And sleep… well, sleep's okay. Sometimes I toss and turn a bit, thinking about things. But I usually get enough. Not like I'm staying up all night or anything. Maybe six, seven hours. Nothing to worry about. I’m a practical man, I don’t need eight hours in bed. Gets things done. That's more important. Is this… taking long? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight weight gain, normal appetite, six to seven hours of sleep with occasional tossing and turning. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. Not a single thing. Always been healthy, like I said. I don't go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. Waste of time, if you ask me. I take care of myself, eat decent food, work hard. That's all you need. High blood pressure? Diabetes? Heart problems? No. Never been told any of that. I'm a strong man, remember? I fix engines all day, that takes strength. I'd know if something was wrong with my heart. It’s still pumping, last I checked. This is getting ridiculous. Just tell me if I pass the exam, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses, reports good health. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I just want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your back. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Just… don't take too long. I got things to do, you know? Engines don't fix themselves. And don't tell me I need to start eating salads. I can feel my blood pressure rising just thinking about it. Just listen to your heart and lungs and get it done. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Another deep breath… Good. Sounds clear. No murmurs, no wheezing. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t hurt.
PATIENT: Fine. Get on with it. I've had worse. Just don't swing that thing too hard. I need these legs to stand on, you know? Engines aren't going to fix themselves if I’m laying in bed. Tap, tap, tap. Is that all? This is taking forever. I swear, I could have fixed three carburetors by now. Don't need a fancy report, just tell me if I pass. Simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I just want to quickly examine your back. Can you bend forward for me, and then stand back up?
PATIENT: Bends forward with a groan, then slowly straightens up. There. Happy now? It's stiff, like I said. Feels better after I move it a bit. Don't need a detailed report about a little stiffness. It’s not like I’m crippled or something. Just… normal work stuff. Can we be done now? I’m wasting daylight. Adjusts his posture, visibly uncomfortable. And don’t tell me I need a chiropractor. I don’t need anyone poking my back. I know my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some mild tenderness in your lower back, but no signs of anything serious. You have good range of motion despite the stiffness. Alright, Delron, I think that's everything. Based on my examination, you appear to be in generally good health. I don’t see any contraindications to service. I will write up a report stating my findings. I’ll note the stiffness in your back as something to monitor. It might be helpful to stretch regularly, but a chiropractor isn’t necessarily indicated. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Finally. Good. That’s all I wanted to hear. No fancy stuff, no expensive treatments. Just a paper that says I’m okay. Stretching… I guess. If I have time. But engines come first. I don’t need a detailed report, just something that says “pass.” And make it quick, okay? I got things to do. Don’t need to worry about monitoring stiffness, I’ve lived with it for years. Just… write the report and let me get out of here. Thank you. Now, where do I pick it up?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. It states my findings – generally good health, mild lower back tenderness, and no contraindications to service. I’ll also have the receptionist make a copy for your records. You can pick it up at the front desk. And if you do decide to stretch, there are some good resources online. But as you said, engines first! Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. That’s it. Just… thank you. Don’t waste my time. .
