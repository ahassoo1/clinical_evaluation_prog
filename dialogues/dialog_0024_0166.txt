DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kinjerski. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, for the past… oh, let me think, about a week now, I’ve been having some numbness in my leg. It’s mostly in my left one, though it sometimes feels a bit strange in my right too. It's not constant, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: A week, you say. And “strange” is not a particularly helpful descriptor, Mr. Kinjerski. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: My apologies, Doctor. You are right to ask for clarification. It’s not painful, exactly. More like… a pins-and-needles sensation, but without the sharp prickling. And sometimes it just feels… absent. Like it’s not quite there. It’s difficult to explain, and I haven’t experienced anything like it before. Is that any clearer?
DOCTOR: Somewhat. And is this numbness isolated to the leg itself, or does it radiate anywhere else – your foot, your back, perhaps?
PATIENT: It mostly stays in the leg, Doctor. Though, now that you mention it, sometimes I feel a… a dull ache in my lower back. Not all the time, and it’s not severe, but it is on the same side as the leg that’s been numb. It's hard to say if it’s related, honestly. I do a lot of work sitting, so I often have a bit of back discomfort anyway.
DOCTOR: Sitting, you say. And what sort of work necessitates prolonged sitting?
PATIENT: I'm a special effects artist and animator, Doctor. A good deal of it is done at a computer. I also do some motion capture work, which involves… well, a lot of standing and moving, but mostly it’s hours at a workstation. I freelance, so my setup isn’t always ideal. Sometimes I’m at my own desk, sometimes at a client’s studio.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed anything that seems to trigger this numbness?
PATIENT: That's a good question. It's hard to pinpoint. Sometimes it happens after I've been sitting for a very long stretch, without getting up. Other times, it seems to come on randomly. I did notice it was a little worse yesterday, after I spent the afternoon adjusting some rigging for a new character. Lots of bending and reaching… though, again, that's not uncommon for my work. I haven't changed anything in my routine recently, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: And is this a new issue, or has this been occurring intermittently for some time now, and simply worsened recently?
PATIENT: It is new, Doctor. Completely new. I've had the usual aches and pains from work, but nothing like this numbness. That's why I decided to come in. It started about a week ago, as I said, and hasn’t gone away on its own. It hasn't been severe, but it's definitely concerning enough to warrant a check-up. I'm usually quite healthy, and this is… unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us proceed with a basic neurological examination, then. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your reflexes.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to adjust my position at all. I'm a bit long-limbed, sometimes it makes these things a little awkward.
DOCTOR: Right leg first. Relax. … And now the left. Both reflexes appear normal. Strength testing now. Can you resist my pressure as I ask you to push against my hand?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Yes, I understand. Please let me know when you’d like me to push. I’ll do my best to maintain consistent pressure. I haven't been lifting anything particularly heavy lately, if that's relevant. Mostly just… moving a mouse and drawing.
DOCTOR: Strength is adequate in both legs, although slightly diminished on the left. Now, let’s assess sensation. Close your eyes. Tell me when I touch your leg.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, I’m ready. Just let me know when you’re touching my leg. I’ll try to be as precise as possible. It’s a bit difficult when my eyes are closed, I tend to be very visually oriented.
DOCTOR: Diminished sensation on the lateral aspect of the left leg. Not a complete loss, but certainly reduced. And now, a quick check of your gait. Please stand and walk a few steps.
PATIENT: Is this pace alright, Doctor? I’m trying to walk normally, but I don’t want to overcompensate if I feel something unusual. Just let me know if you’d like me to speed up or slow down.
DOCTOR: Gait appears normal. However, these subjective observations are hardly conclusive. I’d like to order a basic MRI of your lumbar spine to rule out any nerve compression. Do you have any metal implants or pacemakers?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. No metal implants or pacemakers, or anything of that nature. Just the usual wear and tear from a bit of an active life, I suppose. An MRI sounds… thorough. Is that something that requires a contrast dye, or is it just a standard scan? I’ve never had one before, so I’m not entirely sure what to expect.
DOCTOR: We'll begin with a standard scan, Mr. Kinjerski. If the preliminary findings are inconclusive, then we may consider contrast dye. I'll have my assistant schedule you for an appointment at the imaging center. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and maintaining proper posture. Do you have any questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Avoiding strenuous activity shouldn’t be a problem. Proper posture, I'll certainly try my best. Actually, yes. One question. Is there anything specific I should be looking out for in the meantime? Any particular symptoms that would warrant a more immediate visit? I don’t want to worry unnecessarily, but I’d like to be prepared. And could you perhaps provide a brief summary of your initial thoughts on what might be causing this numbness? Just so I have a bit of an idea before the MRI results come back.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kinjerski, you are asking for a diagnosis based on a limited examination, before any imaging has been performed. That is not sound medical practice. However… given your occupation and the localized numbness, a pinched nerve in the lumbar spine is a possibility. Should you experience significant weakness in your leg, loss of bowel or bladder control, or severe, unrelenting pain, seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, we await the MRI results. My assistant will provide you with the necessary paperwork. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. I apologize for pressing the matter, and I appreciate you clarifying the possible causes and warning signs. I will be sure to monitor my symptoms closely and contact you immediately if anything changes. Thank you for your time. Have a good day to you as well.
