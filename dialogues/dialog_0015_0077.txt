DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Bigger is the name, yes. They sent me here… something about the dust at the mine. Not feeling anything wrong, mind you. Just… they want me checked, after all these years. Waste of a good morning, if you ask me. But the union… they insisted.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, preventative care is always a good idea, Mr. Bigger, even if you feel perfectly fine. Though I do understand your frustration with unnecessary appointments. "The dust at the mine," you say. And how long have you been working at the mine?
PATIENT: Long time. Too long, maybe. Started when I was a young man, fresh off the boat, you could say. Almost… almost fifty years now. Fifty years breathing that… that rock. Never bothered me before, though. Strong lungs, I always had. Not that I’m bragging, you understand. Just… built different, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Fifty years is… a significant amount of time, Mr. Bigger. And what type of work did you do at the mine for those fifty years?
PATIENT: Loading and moving, mostly. Big machines. Digging the stuff out, putting it on the trucks. Underground work, you know? Dark, dusty… always noisy. Not a fancy job, but it put food on the table. Been doing that same work for all these years, Doctor. Same machines, same dust… same everything. What do you need to know exactly? You’re asking a lot of questions about my job.
DOCTOR: It's important to understand exactly what you were exposed to, Mr. Bigger. Different types of rock contain different minerals, and exposure to those minerals can cause various… issues. Were you ever involved in the drilling or blasting of the rock?
PATIENT: Drilling? Blasting? No, no. I wasn't one of those fellas. Too dangerous. I moved the rock after they got it loose. Loaded it onto the trucks, that was my job. I stayed away from the explosions, believe me. Didn’t need that trouble. Just… the dust. Always the dust. Thick dust. You get any of that in your eyes, you’d be coughing for a week. Not that it bothered me, mind you. But the young ones… they were always complaining.
DOCTOR: And what about respirators, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Respirators? What for? You think I was going to wear one of those things underground? No. Too hot. Too stuffy. Couldn't breathe properly. And honestly, nobody wore them. Not back then, not now. Just… a bandana, maybe, if the dust was really bad. But a proper respirator? No, Doctor. Never. What good would that even do? Just a waste of time, if you ask me. A man needs to breathe!
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, with all due respect, that is… concerning. Prolonged exposure to respirable dust without proper protection can lead to very serious health problems. We need to assess the potential damage. Now, let's talk about your current health. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, even with mild exertion?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. Never. I walk to the shops every day. Climb the stairs. Do a bit of gardening. Everything is normal. Perfectly normal. Look, are you saying this dust has done something to me? Because I feel fine. They’re just sending old men to the doctor now, wasting everyone’s time. I’m a strong man, Doctor. Always have been. I don’t need you to tell me what’s wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your frustration, and I am not attempting to tell you that you are unwell. However, simply feeling fine does not necessarily mean that there is no underlying damage. Some conditions develop gradually, without noticeable symptoms until they become quite advanced. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen saturation. It's a simple procedure, and it will help us establish a baseline. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Baseline? What’s that? Sounds like something they use for fancy machines. Look, I don't like being poked and prodded. Never did. And I’ve already told you, I feel fine. But… alright. Fine. Do what you need to do, I suppose. But don’t expect to find anything. Just get it over with quickly, will you? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Hmm. And again… deeper breath. Your oxygen saturation is slightly lower than optimal, Mr. Bigger, at 93%. And I am detecting some crackling sounds in your lungs. This could indicate the presence of fluid or inflammation. Now, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any respiratory conditions, such as bronchitis or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Bronchitis? Pneumonia? No. Never. Never been sick a day in my life, except for the occasional cold. My mother always said I was built like a brick house. Strong immune system. Always ate good food, worked hard, you know? Never sat around complaining. That little crackling sound… that’s probably just old age, Doctor. Things wear out, you know? Like machines. Always breaking down eventually. Don’t go making a big fuss over nothing. Are we done now? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, while I appreciate your resilience, attributing these findings solely to age is… insufficient. Given your lengthy exposure to dust at the mine, we need to rule out more serious conditions. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. The X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and identify any abnormalities. The pulmonary function test will assess your lung capacity and airflow. These tests are essential to determine the extent of any potential damage. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? What's that? No, I don’t think so. Never had anything injected into me before. Just… medicines when I was a little boy, for the fever. My wife… she used to go to the hospital for her knees, but I never paid attention to what they gave her. She just… went. Look, are these tests going to take long? I don't want to be stuck here all day. And I don’t like needles. Never did. This is all a waste of time, you know. I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: The X-ray itself is quick, Mr. Bigger, and doesn't require any injections. The pulmonary function test involves breathing into a mouthpiece for several minutes. It may be a bit tiring, but it's not painful. Given your age and exposure history, I also recommend a low-dose CT scan of the chest to get a more detailed look at your lungs. It's more sensitive than an X-ray and can detect smaller abnormalities. Do you understand?
PATIENT: CT scan? Low-dose? You're using too many fancy words, Doctor. It’s all sounding very serious now. Are you trying to scare an old man? Just tell me straight, is something wrong? Because if you’re going to tell me I’m dying, just say it. I’ve lived a good life, you know? But I don’t need all these… scans and tests. Fine. Do what you have to do. But I’m telling you now, it’s a waste of time and money. I feel fine. Just fine. But if you insist… then go ahead. But don't expect any miracles.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I am not trying to scare you. My intention is simply to gather as much information as possible to ensure your health and wellbeing. Given your long-term exposure to dust, it’s essential to rule out any potential complications. The tests will help us determine if there is any underlying damage to your lungs. If everything is normal, then you can rest assured. If we do find something, we can discuss appropriate treatment options. I’ll have the nurse schedule you for a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. We can discuss the CT scan later, after we review the results of the initial tests. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Not really. Just… when will I get the results? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks. I've got things to do. And… will this cost me a lot of money? My insurance… it's not very good these days. My wife… she passed away last year. I'm on a fixed income now. It's just me. Just tell me when the tests are, and how much they'll cost. That's all I want to know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. We'll get the scheduling arranged quickly. The nurse will contact you with the specific dates and times for the X-ray and pulmonary function test. As for the costs, we'll submit the claims to your insurance company. Our billing department will contact you if there are any out-of-pocket expenses. They can also discuss payment options if needed. I will personally review the results as soon as they are available, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you. We can address any concerns you may have at that time. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a persistent cough, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude today's consultation?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that's all. Just get it over with, Doctor. Get the tests done, and tell me what they say. Thank you… I suppose. It's just… a lot to take in. You're a nice woman, Doctor. But I still think it's a waste of time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. The nurse will be in shortly to assist with scheduling. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. .
