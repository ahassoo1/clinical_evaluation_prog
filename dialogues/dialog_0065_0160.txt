DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s this tiredness. It’s just… getting worse. And this… habit. It’s embarrassing to even say, but I keep wanting to eat dirt. Real dirt. Not like… garden dirt with fertilizer, but just… earth. I don't know why. It’s ridiculous, I know. I just… feel like I need it sometimes. And it doesn’t make me feel good, but I can’t stop. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Well, that is… unusual. Let's try to unpack this a bit. You say the tiredness is getting worse. Can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It's just… heavy. Like someone’s put weights on my eyelids. I used to be able to get everything done, you know? Housework, errands, even a little bit of volunteering. Now… I just want to sit. And it's not like a relaxing kind of tired. It's… draining. It started a few months ago, I guess. Slowly. I just thought I was getting old. But it’s… more than that now. And this dirt thing started around the same time. It's like... something's missing. Does that make any sense? I don't even know why I'm telling you this. It's so silly.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound silly at all, Ms. Hardenburgh. It's important to tell me everything, even if it feels strange. You mentioned it started a few months ago, both the tiredness and… the urge to eat dirt. Has anything else changed during that time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I mean, the grocery store prices went up, which is annoying. And my nephew moved away, which was sad. But nothing… medical, if that's what you mean. No new aches or pains. Same old arthritis in my hands, but that’s been there for years. I haven’t been traveling, haven’t changed my diet… honestly, it’s just been… boring. Which is probably why I started this whole dirt thing, now that I think about it. It's the only excitement I've had! But it's not helping the tiredness, that's for sure. I'm just… worn out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said this craving is for… plain earth?
PATIENT: Yes! Not like, potting soil or anything fancy. Just… dirt. From the ground. I usually… well, I go out back, there's a patch near the shed, and I… scoop some up. I try not to eat too much, because I know it can’t be good for me. But it just… feels right, I guess. It's hard to explain. Like something my body needs. It doesn't taste good, mind you. It's just… earthy. And gritty. I feel a little ashamed just admitting this to you. People would think I’ve lost my mind.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, this is… highly unusual. And frankly, concerning. The craving for dirt – this is known as pica. It can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency, specifically iron deficiency anemia, but it can also be related to other underlying medical conditions. We need to rule out some possibilities. First, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to start? Well, I had the flu really bad when I was 60, but everyone gets the flu. And my arthritis, like I said. The doctor gave me some pills for it, years ago, but they didn't do much. Oh! And I broke my wrist when I was younger, fell off a horse. But that healed fine. I’ve never had anything… serious. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothing like that. I used to go to the doctor regularly, but it just… felt like a waste of time. He always said I was perfectly healthy. Just getting old, he said. And now… now I’m eating dirt. It’s ridiculous. Honestly, I think I’m just a fussy old woman.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… only my tonsils when I was a little girl. And… a hysterectomy when I was thirty-two. That was a long time ago. Everything went fine, as far as I know. I don’t really remember much about it, except it hurt for a while. But that was decades ago. It shouldn’t be causing this, should it? I mean, it was a long time ago. And I’ve been perfectly fine all these years. Until now, of course. This dirt thing… it’s just so embarrassing. I feel like I’m wasting your time with this nonsense.
DOCTOR: It’s not nonsense, Ms. Hardenburgh. It's important to investigate. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family who has a history of anemia, or any unusual cravings?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she was always tired. Said she just didn’t have energy. But she didn’t eat dirt! And my father… he was a strong, healthy man. Worked on a farm his whole life. Never sick a day in his life. My sister… she had high blood pressure, I think. But that’s about it. No one I can think of who had anything like… this. We weren’t really a family that talked about illnesses much. Just… toughed it out, you know? And now I’m here, eating dirt like some kind of… animal. It’s just awful. I hope you can help me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your current medications, Ms. Hardenburgh?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not much. Just… a little something for my arthritis when it really flares up. It's Ibuprofen, I think. The over-the-counter kind. I don't take it very often, maybe once or twice a month. And… occasionally, a Tums if I have heartburn. That’s it. I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible. They never seem to do much good anyway. I really don’t like being dependent on medication. It just feels… wrong. So, really, just ibuprofen and Tums. That's it. I promise. Not a complicated case, I assure you. Just a tired old woman with a strange habit.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I'm going to ask you about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I was raised better than that. My mother would turn over in her grave! Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life, and I certainly don’t smoke. Drugs? Heavens to Betsy, no. I live a very quiet, simple life. I used to go to church every Sunday, but it’s hard to get around now. Mostly, I just stay home and read. And… eat dirt, apparently. I’m a perfectly respectable woman, Dr. Duplichan. I assure you. This whole conversation is rather… undignified. I feel like I’m being interrogated!
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels that way, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’m just trying to get a complete picture of your health. It’s important to rule out all possibilities. Now, have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Well, my appetite’s been… off. Not much hunger, to be honest. Everything just tastes… bland. Like cardboard. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, but I haven’t weighed myself recently. My clothes feel a bit looser, maybe. I don’t really pay much attention to things like that. It’s not like I’m trying to lose weight. I just… don’t feel hungry. And when I do eat, it doesn’t seem to make much difference. I still feel tired. And… I still want dirt. It’s a vicious cycle, I tell you. A perfectly ridiculous, embarrassing, vicious cycle. I feel like a fool even talking about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ms. Hardenburgh, before we proceed, I need to ask you about any allergies you may have. Specifically, any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s easy. No allergies. Not a one. I can eat anything, touch anything, go anywhere. I’ve always been a very robust person. Never had a problem with hives, or sneezing, or anything like that. In fact, I always bragged about having an iron stomach. And now… now I’m craving dirt! It’s just… ironic, isn’t it? All these years, perfectly healthy, and now this. It’s almost like my body is trying to tell me something is wrong. But what? I just don’t understand it. I wish I could just go back to being a normal, healthy old woman. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hardenburgh, that’s not too much to ask. Alright, I think I have enough information for now. I’d like to perform a physical examination. We'll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. It's important to rule out any underlying physical causes for your symptoms. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Dr. Duplichan. Just… try not to stare when you check my tongue. I haven’t been brushing as much lately. I just haven’t had the energy. It’s probably covered in dirt particles, now that I think about it. Honestly, I’m a mess. But do what you need to do. I just want to feel better. And maybe… stop craving dirt. Is that possible? Please tell me it’s possible.
DOCTOR: We'll do our best, Ms. Hardenburgh. First, I'm going to take your vital signs. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Okay, blood pressure is 130/80. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, but with slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Now, I'm going to examine your abdomen. Please lie back and relax. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the lower quadrants. No masses palpated. Your spleen feels slightly enlarged. That could be a sign of several things, including anemia or infection. We need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Enlarged spleen? Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. I knew it wasn’t just a silly habit! I told my nephew I was feeling tired, but he just said I was getting old and needed to rest. He doesn’t understand. What does an enlarged spleen mean, Dr. Duplichan? Is it… cancer? Don't tell me it's cancer. I’ve lived a good life, but I’m not ready to go yet. And… does it have anything to do with the dirt? I mean, surely eating dirt isn’t causing my spleen to enlarge? This is all so frightening. I just wanted to feel better, not… discover I’m seriously ill. What happens now? Do I need… tests? Are they going to poke and prod me? Oh, dear. I think I'm going to faint.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, please try to remain calm. An enlarged spleen, or splenomegaly, can be caused by many things, and it doesn’t automatically mean cancer. It could be caused by an infection, liver disease, blood disorders, or, as we suspect, potentially a nutritional deficiency like severe iron deficiency anemia. We need to run some tests to determine the exact cause. Yes, we'll need to draw some blood for a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your liver and kidney function, and an iron study to assess your iron levels. We may also need to order a CT scan of your abdomen to get a better look at your spleen and other organs. I understand this is frightening, and I apologize for the anxiety this is causing you. We will take things one step at a time and explain everything thoroughly. The tests will help us determine the best course of action. I assure you, we will do everything we can to help you feel better. Let's start with the blood work. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, alright. Anything to figure out what’s wrong. Just… please don’t make me lie on one of those cold paper tables. My bones ache enough as it is. And… will it hurt? I bruise easily, you know. A tiny pinprick turns into a purple map on my arm. And… what if the results are bad? What if it is cancer? I don’t want to know if I’m dying. Just… tell me what I need to do. And try to be gentle, please. And… maybe have a chair nearby, just in case I feel faint again. This is all so overwhelming. I just… I just want to go home and take a nap. But I know I can't. Not until we figure out what's wrong. Do I need to fast for the blood work? I had a biscuit with my tea this morning. Will that mess up the results? Oh dear. This is a disaster.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Hardenburgh. We will do everything possible to make this as comfortable as possible for you. You won’t have to lie on a cold paper table. We have comfortable chairs, and you can recline in one of those. I will be very gentle when drawing the blood, and I will use a small needle to minimize discomfort. Regarding the biscuit, yes, you should have fasted for at least 8 hours before the blood work for the most accurate results. However, it's not a complete disaster. We can still proceed, and we'll make a note of it in your chart. We may need to repeat some of the tests on an empty stomach later. I’m going to have my nurse, Sarah, come in and draw your blood. She's very skilled and gentle, and she will explain everything to you. She’ll also take your vitals again. I will be right here, overseeing everything. I assure you, you are in good hands. Please try to relax, Ms. Hardenburgh. We’ll take things one step at a time. Sarah will be in shortly. Is there anything I can do for you in the meantime?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… tell Sarah to be quick. And gentle, like you said. My arm is already aching just thinking about it. And… maybe a glass of water afterwards? I always get lightheaded when they draw blood. And… thank you, Dr. Duplichan. For being patient with me. I know I'm being a bit of a fussbudget, but I'm just… scared. I haven't been sick in years, and now… now this. It's all so much to take in. I just hope it's not something serious. And… please, please, let it not be the dirt. That would be just… humiliating. I'll just sit here and try to breathe, I guess. And wait for Sarah. This is a terrible day.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hardenburgh. I understand completely. It's perfectly alright to be scared. We will get through this together. Sarah, could you please come in and draw blood from Ms. Hardenburgh?
