DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just…fevers. Keep comin’ back. It's been a nuisance, really. I’d like to get it figured out, if that’s alright. Don’t have the insurance for a lot of back and forth, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this efficiently. Fevers coming back…can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, they started…let me think… about three weeks ago, maybe a little more. Started with just feelin’ kinda warm, achy, you know? Like a bad flu. Then it goes away for a day, maybe two, and then bam, it’s back. Same thing. No cough, no sniffles, just…warm and tired. It usually gets pretty high, I think. I haven’t really taken my temperature, honestly. My wife does when she’s worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three weeks of recurring fevers, accompanied by aches and fatigue. No respiratory symptoms. And the fever gets high, though you haven't been measuring it yourself. Do you have any other symptoms at all when the fever comes back?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my muscles ache more than others. My legs, mostly. And…I get a little sweaty, even when it's not hot. Not like drenched, just…clammy. Oh! And I haven’t been hungry. Not really. Just pickin’ at stuff. My wife keeps offerin’ me soup. It’s nice, but…doesn't really stay down sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle aches—specifically in your legs—sweating, and a loss of appetite with some nausea. Have you noticed any rash, any joint pain, any headaches, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No rash. Joints are okay, maybe a little stiff in the mornin’, like always. Headaches are…normal for me, to be honest. Been gettin’ those for years. And, uh…bowels are…regular. Nothing different there. Just the usual. Look, is this gonna take long, Doctor? I got a lunch appointment. Nothin' fancy, just with some old friends.
DOCTOR: Okay, no rash, stable joints, usual headaches, and regular bowel habits. I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Brege. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. To help me narrow things down, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical… hmm. I had the flu really bad when I was a kid. Pneumonia once, way back when I was in the army. And arthritis, like my mother. Just the normal wear and tear kind, the doctor said. Nothing major, really. No surgeries, no serious illnesses. I take a little somethin’ for the arthritis, but that's it. Just a little pill every mornin’. Don’t remember the name. I let my wife handle all that. She’s good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia in the past, arthritis, and you're currently taking medication for the arthritis. Any family history of any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had the arthritis, like I said. And her mother too, actually. My father... he had high blood pressure. And diabetes, late in life. My brother… he had heart trouble, but he didn’t take care of himself. Smoked too much, drank too much. Sad story. That’s about it, I think. I mean, everyone gets somethin’ eventually, right?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. And just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that even mean? You askin’ if I like to drink or somethin’? I have a beer with dinner sometimes, that’s it. Never been much of a smoker. I’m retired now, used to be a chiropractor. Spent my whole life fixin’ people’s backs. Now my back is complainin’. Married for forty years, two kids, both grown up and gone. That about cover it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that covers it nicely. Just trying to understand your lifestyle. You mentioned you're married and retired, no smoking, occasional alcohol use. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy to anything. Nothing. My wife’s the allergic one. Pollen, dust, cats… you name it. Me? I can eat anything, touch anything. Lucky, I guess. This is gettin' kinda long, Doctor. I hope you're gettin' somewhere with this? Lunch is comin' up fast.
DOCTOR: Yes, we're getting there, Mr. Brege. No known allergies, that’s good. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your temperature. Then we'll see what the next steps should be. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… quick, please. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Now, let’s take your temperature. Your temperature is 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit. I’m also noting some mild fatigue and slight muscle aches. Based on what you've told me and this quick exam, it sounds like you may have an infection causing a fever. It could be a viral illness, or something else. Given your history, we need to rule out a few things. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to start. And a urinalysis, just to be safe. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Alright, fine. Whatever you think is necessary. But can we do it quickly? I really need to get goin’. My friends are gonna think I forgot about ‘em. And I promised to bring the dominoes. They're countin' on me.
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll get it done as quickly as possible. The lab is right down the hall, and it shouldn't take long. I'll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and drinking fluids. If your fever gets much higher, or you develop any new symptoms like a severe headache, difficulty breathing, or a rash, please go to the emergency room immediately. I will have the lab technician draw your blood and then send you to the front desk to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound good, Mr. Brege?
