DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s rather difficult to put into words precisely. I’ve been… going to the bathroom quite a lot, more than usual, I suppose. It's been going on for a little while now, but it’s become… noticeable. I wouldn't say it's painful, exactly, just… frequent. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Verbos, thank you for sharing that. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, quite disruptive, actually. Let me see… I suppose it’s… throughout the day and night, really. I wouldn’t say it’s a massive amount each time, but I find myself needing to go… often. I don't recall when it started exactly… perhaps a few weeks ago? It’s all a bit… hazy, if I’m honest. Do you… would you like me to try and be more specific? I can try, but I’m not sure how much detail I can provide.
DOCTOR: No, that’s a good start, Mr. Verbos. Don't worry about being perfectly precise; we can work through it together. You mentioned a few weeks ago. Has anything changed around that time—any new medications, changes in your diet, or increased fluid intake, perhaps?
PATIENT: New medications… hmm. I don’t believe so. I take… well, I have Medicare, so the usual things, I suppose. Nothing new, no. Diet… not really. I try to eat reasonably healthily. Perhaps a few more sweets than I ought to, but nothing drastic. Fluid intake… that’s a good question. I haven't consciously increased it, but… now that you mention it, it has been rather warm lately, hasn't it? I may have been drinking more water to stay cool. I don't… I don’t typically track these things, you see. It’s all a bit… loose. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is very helpful, Mr. Verbos. Knowing you haven’t changed medications and may have increased fluid intake due to the heat is useful information. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the frequent urination?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No… not that I’m aware of. I haven't noticed any pain, no fever… no unusual thirst, I don't think. I sleep alright, generally. I haven't felt particularly tired, either. Although… now that I think about it, I have been getting up once or twice during the night to use the bathroom, which is… unusual for me. But I just assumed that was… well, part of the frequent urination, I suppose. Is there anything specific I should be looking for? I worry I might miss something.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright to ask, Mr. Verbos. Getting up at night to urinate – nocturia – is good to know. We're building a clearer picture. Have you noticed any change in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color or smell… hmm. That’s a… a good question. I suppose I haven't paid particular attention. It looks… normal, I think. Pale yellow, perhaps? I don’t recall noticing any unusual odor. No, I don’t believe so. It’s all rather… unremarkable, to be honest. I apologize if I'm not being very helpful. I’m not one for noticing these details, you see.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Mr. Verbos. It's perfectly fine if you don't routinely observe these details; that’s what I’m here for. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Let me see. I believe I have… well, I’ve had high blood pressure for a little while, yes. It’s… managed with medication, I think. The doctor keeps it under control, thankfully. No… no diabetes, not that I’m aware of. And I don’t think I’ve ever had any kidney problems. I had a rather thorough check-up last year, and they didn’t mention anything. Although… my memory isn't what it once was, so it’s possible I’m forgetting something. Is there a record of it somewhere? Perhaps you could check? I wouldn’t want to mislead you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verbos. … Alright, I see here you’ve been diagnosed with hypertension, as you mentioned, and are currently taking lisinopril 20mg daily. No history of diabetes, kidney disease, or other significant medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Lisinopril, yes. Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I had my appendix removed when I was a young man. A very long time ago. And… I believe I had a hernia operation a few years back. It was… relatively minor, thankfully. Nothing major. No other surgeries that I can recall. Though, again, my memory is… unreliable. It’s possible I'm forgetting something small. I hope that's helpful? It's all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: It is very helpful, Mr. Verbos. Knowing about the appendectomy and hernia repair is good. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family—diabetes, kidney disease, heart problems, or prostate issues, perhaps?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a difficult one. My father… he had heart problems, I believe. Yes, he passed away from a heart attack when he was quite young. And my mother… she suffered from high blood pressure, similar to myself. I don’t recall any instances of diabetes or kidney disease in my immediate family. My brother… he’s still alive, thankfully, and seems to be in good health. Though, we don’t speak very often. It's all a bit fragmented, you see. I’m afraid my family history isn’t particularly… clear. I apologize for the lack of specifics. Is that… sufficient?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verbos. Knowing about the heart problems in your father and the hypertension in your mother is useful information. Finally, could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. Well, I’m retired now, so I don’t have the stresses of work anymore, which is a blessing. I live alone, and I spend most of my time… reading, mostly. I enjoy classical music. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I try to eat a balanced diet, though I do have a sweet tooth, as I mentioned before. I don’t get a great deal of exercise, I’m afraid. I walk a little, but nothing strenuous. It's… a rather quiet life, to be honest. Is there anything specific you'd like to know? I’m not very exciting, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Verbos. That gives me a good understanding of your lifestyle. Now, to get a better picture of what’s going on, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Please, proceed. I hope it won’t be too… intrusive? I do try to be… cooperative.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 142/88, pulse is 78, respiration is 16, and temperature is 98.6°F – all within acceptable ranges, though your blood pressure is a little elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Next, I’ll gently palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Finally, I’ll perform a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes and sensation. Reflexes are normal, sensation intact. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. However, your slightly elevated blood pressure warrants attention. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings, I suspect you may have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is common in men your age. It can cause frequent urination, especially at night. However, to confirm this, we'll need to run a few tests. Would you be willing to provide a urine sample?
PATIENT: BPH… yes, I’ve heard of that. It's… not terribly surprising, I suppose. A urine sample? Yes, of course. Whatever is necessary. I'd like to get to the bottom of this, you see. Is there anything specific I need to do? I haven't… provided one in a long time. I hope I remember correctly.
DOCTOR: Certainly. You’ll find a sterile collection cup in the restroom. Please try to provide a midstream sample – that means starting to urinate, then collecting the sample mid-flow. I’ll also order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to assess your overall health and kidney function. We'll also need a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood test to help evaluate your prostate. While we wait for the results, I recommend limiting fluids before bedtime and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Once we have the test results, we can discuss a treatment plan, which may include medication or lifestyle changes. Do you have any questions about the tests or the recommendations?
PATIENT: A midstream sample… yes, I remember something about that. And the blood tests… yes, that sounds… thorough. Limiting fluids before bed… that's sensible, I suppose. I do enjoy a little chamomile tea before bed, but I can certainly cut back. Medication… I'm not terribly fond of taking pills, if I'm honest. Are there… alternatives? Lifestyle changes? What sort of things would that involve? And what exactly does this PSA test tell us? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor, but I like to understand things, you see. I worry about side effects, as well.
DOCTOR: You’re not at all troublesome with your questions, Mr. Verbos – it’s excellent that you’re actively involved in your care. Let’s address your concerns. Regarding medication, there are indeed alternatives, and we’ll explore those if necessary. Lifestyle changes can be very effective, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding bladder irritants like caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods. We can also discuss pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegels, which can strengthen the muscles that support the bladder. The PSA test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. Elevated levels can indicate prostate enlargement, inflammation, or, in some cases, prostate cancer. It's important to remember that an elevated PSA doesn't automatically mean you have cancer, but it warrants further investigation. If the level is elevated, we may recommend a digital rectal exam or, in some cases, a prostate biopsy. Regarding side effects, the side effects of medications for BPH vary depending on the specific medication. Common side effects can include dizziness, lightheadedness, and sexual dysfunction. We'll discuss these risks in detail if medication becomes necessary. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. Once we have the results, we can have a more informed discussion about your treatment options. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. A reasonable plan, indeed. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. Knowing the potential side effects is… comforting, in a way. It's better to be prepared, you see. So, the urine sample and the blood tests… yes. And then we wait for the results. I suppose there’s nothing else for me to do at this point. I'll go and… collect the sample, then. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel… less anxious now, which is a relief. I shall see you when the results are available?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verbos. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your anxiety. Yes, the urine sample and blood tests are the next step. Once the results are back, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, pain, or difficulty urinating, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Take your time, and please let me know if you have any questions before you go. I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss the results.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall do that. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I appreciate your thoroughness. I believe that is all for now. I will see you… when the results are available. .
