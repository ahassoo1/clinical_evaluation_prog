DOCTOR: Good morning, Manuel. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? My wife… she wants… babies. We want babies, yes. But… we old. I think we need… help to make babies? I forget things, you see. It is… planning, yes? For babies.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. You and your wife are thinking about trying for a baby, but you're a little unsure given your ages and you’re wanting to discuss planning and maybe some assistance?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! Assistance is good word. My wife, she say… maybe not so easy now. She is good, very good. But… I am old man. And I forget… important things. Like… names sometimes! Is okay, yes? We just want to make sure… everything is good before… trying. She worry about… everything being healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very sensible of both of you. It's good you're thinking about this carefully and wanting to make sure everything is healthy. We can definitely talk through things. Just to get a clearer picture, how old are you, Manuel?
PATIENT: Hmm… how old am I? That is… a good question! I think… seventy? Maybe sixty-nine? I forget the number… my wife knows. She remembers everything. But… around seventy, yes. I work with… little things, you see. Metal and plastic. Makes my head busy sometimes.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Manuel. It's perfectly normal to forget things. Around seventy is fine. And what about your wife?
PATIENT: My wife… She is… younger than me, of course! Maybe… sixty? Sixty-two? She is very strong woman. Works very hard. Always taking care of everyone. She remembers the numbers better than me, definitely. She say… it is good to check, just in case. For healthy baby.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. It's great she's so proactive about this. And you're right, it's always best to check things over, especially when planning something important like this. Now, have either of you seen a doctor regularly in the past few years?
PATIENT: Doctor… Hmm… regularly? I go when something hurts! Old man things, you see. I have… Medicare, yes? They help with the doctors. I think… I saw a doctor last year for my… back. But… not regularly. My wife… she goes more often than me. She is good at that. She keeps everything… organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've seen a doctor for your back last year, but not regularly otherwise. And your wife is more consistent with check-ups?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. She keeps me going! She say… "Manuel, you need to see doctor!" And I say… "Okay, okay!" She is very… persuasive. Always thinking about… health. I mostly just work with my hands. Little things, you see. Metal and plastic. Not much thinking needed, mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. It’s good to have someone looking out for you. And that's perfectly fine. Now, just to get a complete picture, have either of you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… major illnesses… I think… when I was young, I had… a fever? A bad fever. But that was long ago! And… maybe a small thing on my leg, the doctor cut it off. Small thing, really. My wife… she had something with her… stomach, I think. A long time ago, too. She remembers more details. It was… serious, but she is strong! She recovered very well.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fever when you were young, and a small growth removed from your leg. Your wife had a stomach issue some time ago, but has recovered well. That’s good to know. Now, do either of you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… I don't think so. I eat everything my wife cooks! She makes very good food. No allergies for me, I don't believe. My wife… maybe a little sensitive to… some flowers? Makes her sneeze, but not… serious. No big allergies, no. We are mostly healthy people, I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… I take… a little pill for my water. My doctor gave it to me. For my water, yes. And… sometimes, when my back hurts, I take… a white pill. But not always. Mostly just when it’s bad. My wife… she takes something for her… bones? I think. She remembers the names better. But not much, really. Just those few things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a pill for your water and a white pill occasionally for your back. Your wife takes something for her bones. Do you happen to know the names of those medications, or can you bring them in next time?
PATIENT: Names… No, I don’t remember the names. Too many names! But my wife… she will remember. She can bring them next time, yes? She keeps everything organized. She is very good. I mostly just… take them when I need to. I don’t worry about the names.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Manuel. We can ask your wife next time. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never. Bad for the lungs, you see. Alcohol… sometimes, a little glass of wine with my wife. On special occasions. Very little, though. And… recreational drugs? No, no. Old man things, you see. I mostly just work with my hands. Metal and plastic. Quiet life, yes. Very quiet life.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, finally, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your work?
PATIENT: Ah, my work! I make little things. Model makers, they call it. Metal and plastic. I build… things. Small buildings, little cars, sometimes even… people! Very detailed, you see. I use my hands, lots of patience. I have been doing it for… a long time. A very long time! It keeps my hands busy, my mind… not so busy. It is a good job, yes. A quiet job. Not much thinking needed. Mostly just… making.
DOCTOR: That sounds like very skillful work, Manuel. It's good to have a hobby you enjoy. Alright, well, that gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, before we talk about planning for a baby, I'd like to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. Physical exam… I am an old man, you see. Lots of things broken! But… yes, do what you need to do. My wife will want to know everything is good. She is very… thorough. Just tell me if it will be uncomfortable. My back… sometimes it hurts.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take it slow and I’ll explain everything as we go. And we’ll definitely be careful with your back. If you feel any discomfort at all, just let me know immediately. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Blood pressure… pulse… It is all very important, yes? My wife always tells me… important numbers. I hope they are good numbers.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/90. Your pulse is 78, which is normal. Breathing sounds clear. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart again… Sounds good, no murmurs. Next, I'll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Open wide for me, please. Hmm, throat looks clear. Ears look fine as well. Now, let’s check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Oh! That is… surprising! Old man reflexes, you see. Not so good. My wife… she has much stronger reflexes. Is everything alright? Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly normal, Manuel. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is very common at your age. It doesn’t indicate anything concerning. Now, I'm just going to feel your abdomen. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Ooh, there… that is a little tender. Sometimes my stomach… it is not happy. My wife says it is because I eat too much sugar. She is probably right. But… it is usually okay. Just sometimes a little… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel a little tenderness there as well. It could be related to your diet, as your wife suspects, or something else. We can discuss some dietary changes later. Now, I'm just going to listen to your lungs again, front and back. Take a deep breath for me. Sounds clear, no wheezing or crackles. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems generally okay, though your blood pressure is a little elevated, and there’s some tenderness in your abdomen. Now, before we discuss planning for a baby, do you have any questions about the exam?
PATIENT: Questions… Hmm. Is my blood pressure… bad? Will it stop us from having a baby? And… what about my stomach? Is it serious? My wife… she will want to know everything. Is everything going to be alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, those are excellent questions. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but it’s not drastically high. We can manage it with some lifestyle changes – diet, exercise, reducing stress. It shouldn’t prevent you and your wife from trying for a baby, but it’s important to get it under control. As for your stomach, the tenderness is likely due to indigestion or something dietary. It doesn’t seem serious at this point, but we can discuss some ways to improve your digestion and see if that helps. Now, let's talk about planning for a baby. Given your ages, it’s important to be realistic and understand that it may take longer to conceive. I recommend you and your wife both see your primary care doctors for a general health check-up. And I'd also recommend a consultation with a fertility specialist. They can offer further guidance and perform some tests to assess your fertility. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: Realistic… yes, my wife says that too. Tests… yes, that is good. To make sure everything is alright. A referral… yes, please. That would be very helpful. My wife… she is very good at organizing things. She will make the appointment. She always does. Thank you, Doctor. You have made me feel much better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Manuel. I’m glad I could help. Here’s the referral to a fertility specialist. They are excellent doctors, and they’ll be able to provide you and your wife with personalized guidance. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Hmm… Just one thing… my wife… she worries a lot. Will the baby… be healthy? Will everything be alright with the pregnancy? She is very concerned about that. I just want to make sure she is not too worried. Is there anything I can tell her to reassure her?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Manuel. It's natural for your wife to be worried. You can reassure her that we'll do everything we can to ensure a healthy pregnancy. The fertility specialist will perform some pre-conception testing to assess any potential risks and develop a plan to minimize them. It's also important to maintain a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy – a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding harmful substances. And remember, there are many resources available to support you both throughout the pregnancy. We can provide you with information on prenatal care, childbirth classes, and support groups. It's important to be open and honest with the fertility specialist about any concerns she has. They are the best resource for providing personalized guidance and support. Do you want me to write down some information about prenatal care resources for her as well?
PATIENT: Yes, please. She would really appreciate that. She is very… thorough, you see. Always wanting information. I just want to make sure she is not too worried. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I feel much better now. Knowing we are doing everything we can… that is good.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Manuel. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease. Here’s the information about prenatal care resources. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any further questions or concerns. And best of luck to you and your wife!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. We will. Bye bye.
