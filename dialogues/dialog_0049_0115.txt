DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s about my coloring, I suppose. I’ve been looking rather… yellow. Not a good shade of yellow, mind you. It's been troubling me, and a friend suggested I come see someone. I believe it has something to do with my liver. Or perhaps hepatitis? It’s all a bit hazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Liver, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Something about the liver… or a sickness with the liver. I had some tests done a while back, I think. Though where… and when… that escapes me. It was quite some time ago. Is yellowing a bad sign, Doctor? I just want to get this sorted, if you don’t mind. I haven't much time today.
DOCTOR: Well, yellowing – what you’re describing sounds like jaundice, and that can be indicative of a liver issue. It's not something to ignore, certainly. Let's try to piece this together. You mentioned tests…do you recall who ordered them, or perhaps the name of the lab?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. I really don’t recall. Everything is so jumbled these days. A doctor, of course. A local doctor, I presume? Perhaps one in town? I’ve seen quite a few over the years. I'm afraid my memory isn't what it used to be. Is there a way to find out? Would my records be somewhere? I truly wish I could be of more help.
DOCTOR: Records…yes, there should be records. We can certainly try to locate them. It might take some time, as you said, with local doctors…and it sounds like you've seen several. Before we embark on a records search, let's go over some questions, if you don’t mind. It might help us narrow things down. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh, symptoms… let me think. I’ve been rather tired, yes. More tired than usual, I suppose. And my appetite hasn't been very good. Not much of an appetite at all, really. And…oh, sometimes I feel a bit uncomfortable in my tummy. Not pain, exactly, but… unsettled. Is that helpful, Doctor? I do apologize for being so vague. It's all rather…blurring together.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, loss of appetite, and some abdominal discomfort. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: Changes… Now that you ask… yes, I believe so. My urine has been… darker than usual. A sort of tea color, I think. And my… waste, it was… paler. Very pale, almost like clay. Does that… mean anything? I do hope this isn’t too unpleasant a conversation. I just want to know what’s going on, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Dark urine and pale stools…yes, that is pertinent information. We're starting to get a clearer picture. Now, let’s move on to your medical history, if you're able. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s another tricky one. I’ve had… the usual things, I suppose. The aches and pains of getting older. High blood pressure, I think, at some point. And…something about my gallbladder, years ago. It might have needed…attention. A procedure, perhaps? Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a fog. I’ve been to so many doctors…and I’m not always the best at remembering details. Is it alright if we focus on finding these records? That might be the most helpful thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig. We can certainly attempt to locate your records. However, while we’re doing that – and it will take some time – let me just do a quick physical examination. It’s a standard procedure, and may give us some additional clues. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical examination. Well, I suppose so. If it's necessary. But please be gentle, Doctor. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And please don't take too long. I do have other… commitments this afternoon. But yes, go ahead. Do what you need to do. Just… quickly, if you wouldn’t mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie back, if you please. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen, then feel it gently. …Your abdomen is…soft, but there's a slight tenderness in the upper right quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. I'll check your sclera now. As you can see, there is definite jaundice present. Your sclera are quite yellow. We’ll need to run some blood tests to determine the cause of this. I'll order a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a bilirubin level.
PATIENT: Oh dear. More tests. Well, alright. If that’s what you think is necessary. I suppose I should have expected it. Is there…anything I need to do? Anything special? Or should I just… wait? I truly do wish this weren’t such a drawn-out affair. My time is… precious. But yes, please, do whatever tests you deem fit. Just… let me know when they’re finished. And hopefully, we can get to the bottom of this quickly.
DOCTOR: You don't need to do anything special, Ms. Durig. Just refrain from eating or drinking anything after midnight tonight, as some of the tests require fasting. I’ll have the lab draw your blood first thing tomorrow morning. After the results are in, we'll discuss them and determine the next course of action. I’m going to refer you to a gastroenterologist for a more thorough evaluation. They are specialists in digestive health and will be able to provide a more definitive diagnosis. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist… Another specialist… Oh dear. Is it… is it serious, Doctor? Is it something…grave? I'm rather frail, you see. I don’t handle things easily. I just want to know what's going on. And if it's something that… well, that needs immediate attention. Please, be honest with me. I prefer to know the truth, however unpleasant it may be. And as many specialists as it takes, I suppose. But please, try to be swift. Time is… of the essence. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, your symptoms and initial findings are concerning, and warrant further investigation. While I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without the blood test results and the gastroenterologist's evaluation, your jaundice, dark urine, and pale stools could indicate a liver or gallbladder issue. It could be something relatively minor, or it could be more serious. That's why I'm referring you to a specialist. I understand your concern, and I assure you we are taking this seriously. I'll expedite the referral, and the gastroenterologist's office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or confusion – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
