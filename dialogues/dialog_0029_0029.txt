DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I'm Dr. Chora. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… feeling full really fast, see? I don't even get to finish a proper plate of food before I feel like I’ve had enough. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. Not sure exactly when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling full quickly, even after only a small amount of food, for about a month now. Can you tell me a little more about that feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it's not pain, exactly. More like… uncomfortable. Like my stomach’s just deciding it’s done, even when it hasn’t really started. It's weird. And it happens with most foods, doesn't matter what I'm eating. Soup, fish, bannock… everything. It's just… not enjoyable anymore, trying to eat. It takes all the pleasure out of it, you know? My wife makes a lovely salmon chowder, and I can barely get through a bowl.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. So, it’s not pain, but a feeling of discomfort and fullness occurring even before you’ve eaten much. And it’s happening with all types of food, making it difficult to enjoy meals. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – like nausea, vomiting, bloating, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nausea, no, not really. Vomiting, definitely not. Bloating… sometimes, maybe a little, but not always. And my… well, my bathroom habits haven’t changed much. Regular as always, if you get my meaning. It’s mostly just this feeling of being full too quickly. It's frustrating, that's what it is. I used to enjoy a good meal, and now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay. No nausea or vomiting, bowel habits are regular, and the main issue is this early fullness and discomfort. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Weight loss… that’s a good question. My wife says I’ve lost a bit, but she’s always saying that! I haven't been weighing myself, to be honest. I feel okay, energy-wise. I still get around and do my usual things, but maybe I’m not as strong as I used to be. It's hard to say. Could be just getting old, eh?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's hard to notice changes yourself. Any changes in your appetite besides feeling full quickly?
PATIENT: Well, I don't really crave things like I used to. Used to look forward to a good piece of salmon, or a plate of roast potatoes. Now… it just doesn't seem as appealing. I eat because I know I should, not because I’m particularly hungry. That’s probably the best way to put it. It's like the enjoyment is gone, and with that, so is the appetite.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, decreased appetite and decreased enjoyment of food, along with the early fullness. Have you been experiencing any heartburn or indigestion?
PATIENT: Heartburn… not really. A little bit of burping sometimes, but nothing major. Indigestion, not that I've noticed. It’s not like a burning feeling, or anything like that. It's more… a feeling of being stuffed, even when I haven't eaten much. Like my stomach is shrinking, or something. Does that make sense? I’m not good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Obarr. You’re explaining it perfectly well. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My doctor back in the village – old Dr. Williams, bless his soul – he said my blood pressure was a little high a few years back. Put me on some pills for it, but I stopped taking them after a while. Didn't like the way they made me feel. Besides that… nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I guess. Never been told I had anything serious. I’ve always been a pretty healthy fella, until recently, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that was previously treated with medication, but you stopped taking it due to side effects. And generally good health otherwise. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Nothing like that. Always avoided them if I could. My mother used to say hospitals were full of bad spirits. Probably just an old wives' tale, but I always took it to heart. So, no, nothing ever needed cutting open or anything like that. Just the usual scrapes and bruises over the years.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And you mentioned your mother. Is there any family history of stomach problems, cancer, or any other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother… she died when I was young, from a fever. Don’t know much about her side of the family, to be honest. My father… he lived to be a good old age, but I think he had some trouble with his heart towards the end. And my sister… she had some sort of trouble with her bowels when she was younger, but I don't remember the details. It was a long time ago. We weren't close, so we didn't talk about things like that much. Mostly, I don’t know much about family medical history, sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history available. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life. My wife doesn't approve, and frankly, neither do I. Always thought it was a silly habit. As for alcohol… I used to have a beer or two with dinner sometimes, back in the day. But I haven't had a drink in years. Not really a drinker, never was. And drugs? Oh no, never touched those. Not my cup of tea at all. I prefer a good cup of tea, actually. Proper tea, with a little milk. That's about as exciting as I get.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol use in the past, and no drug use. And finally, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I've taken some pills for headaches and colds over the years, but nothing ever bothered me. My wife always checks, though. She's very careful about things like that. But no, I don't think I have any allergies. As far as I know, anyway. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that department.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Mr. Obarr, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and maybe check your reflexes. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I've got nothing to hide. Always been a pretty open book, me. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, eh? I’m not as young as I used to be, so go easy on me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart rate is a little slow, but that’s not necessarily concerning given your age. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Just relax for me. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little… firm, maybe? But not painful. It's always been a bit firm, to be honest. I think it's just my build. I used to do a lot of physical work when I was younger, so maybe it's just muscle. It's not a sharp pain, or anything like that. Just… solid. It feels normal, I think. For me, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, I do feel some firmness. No significant masses or tenderness to palpation. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. Overall, the physical exam is within normal limits for your age, although the abdominal firmness is something we’ll keep in mind. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I suspect this could be something related to your stomach emptying slowly, or perhaps a mild motility issue. However, to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a few blood tests, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and a test to check for celiac disease. I also think it might be helpful to get an upper endoscopy to visualize your stomach and esophagus. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute, Doctor. Blood tests, I can handle. But an… what was that? An upper endo-… scope? Sounds… invasive. What exactly is that? And what are we looking for, specifically? I'm not keen on having things poked and prodded if it's not absolutely necessary. Are there other options? Maybe just see if things improve with some changes to my diet first? I'm a bit old for fancy procedures, if you get my meaning.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask questions, Mr. Obarr. An upper endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining. It allows us to look for any abnormalities, like inflammation, ulcers, or tumors. It is an invasive procedure, and we wouldn’t do it lightly. The blood tests can help rule out some common causes of your symptoms, like anemia or electrolyte imbalances. But they won't give us a clear picture of what's going on in your stomach. Before we jump to the endoscopy, we could certainly try some dietary changes. Avoiding large meals, eating slowly, and staying upright after eating can sometimes help. We could also try a medication to help with stomach emptying. However, given your age and the fact that you've been experiencing these symptoms for a month now, I want to be thorough and rule out anything serious. We could start with the blood tests and dietary changes, and if your symptoms don’t improve, we can discuss the endoscopy further. What do you think?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Blood tests and dietary changes first. I can definitely try eating smaller meals, and I’ll make sure to sit up straight after eating. My wife will be happy to hear that – she’s always telling me to slow down! And if those don’t work… well, we can talk about that scope thing then. But let’s not rush into anything. Just getting to the bottom of it is what I want, really. Not necessarily having things poked around inside! So, how do we go about getting these blood tests done? And is there anything specific I should do to prepare?
DOCTOR: Excellent. That sounds like a good plan, Mr. Obarr. I’ll write you a lab requisition for the blood tests. You can go to the lab at the clinic anytime tomorrow morning. You don’t need to fast, but try to drink plenty of water beforehand. I'll also give you a handout with some dietary recommendations. It includes information on portion sizes, foods to avoid, and eating habits. Here you are. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks so we can discuss the results. Do you have any questions about the tests or the handout before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and not rushing into anything. I’ll get those blood tests done tomorrow, and follow the dietary recommendations as best I can. Two weeks sounds good for a follow-up. I’ll call the clinic to schedule it. Thank you again, Doctor Chora. I think I’ll be on my way.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get some rest, and I’ll see you in two weeks. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
