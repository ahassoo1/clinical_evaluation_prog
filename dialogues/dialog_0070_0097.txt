DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Abady. It is a pleasure, though I confess I find these sorts of visits… unnecessary, usually. My husband insisted. He’s become quite preoccupied with… planning for the inevitable, as he puts it. I simply want the form he keeps mentioning. The… advance directive, is it? Or POLST? He said something about needing to have it all written down, just in case. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about, but here I am.
DOCTOR: I see. Your husband is being proactive, which is certainly commendable, even if it feels a bit… premature to you. An advance directive, or POLST form as he mentioned, is a legal document that outlines your wishes for medical care should you become unable to communicate them yourself. It's a very important part of healthcare planning. Before we proceed with completing the form, however, I do like to understand a bit about your overall health. It helps me to ask relevant questions later, should they arise. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, perfectly alright. Though I assure you, my health is excellent. I maintain a very strict lifestyle, you see. I eat very well, mostly Mediterranean cuisine, and I take regular walks. I've always been… robust. But yes, ask away. I suppose it can’t hurt. Just please, try not to dwell on unpleasant possibilities. It's rather… morbid, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Certainly. And I apologize if my questions seem… unsettling. We're simply gathering information as a matter of routine. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? Goodness, no. A bout of the flu, perhaps, decades ago. And I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, a very common procedure, I understand. Nothing… dramatic. I've never been one for hospitals, you see. I much prefer preventative measures. That's why I keep so active and eat so well. Honestly, I think my husband worries far too much. He reads things online, you know. Dreadful things. It’s best to ignore such… sensationalism.
DOCTOR: I understand. A childhood tonsillectomy is good to know. And you’ve been generally healthy since then, avoiding significant illness or hospitalization. That’s excellent. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – perhaps heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, family. That’s… complicated. My mother’s side, they were mostly farmers in Morocco. Very hardy people, but they didn’t have much access to proper healthcare, you understand. So, ailments went… untreated. My father’s side, they were a bit more… city folk, shall we say. He had high blood pressure, I believe. And his sister, my aunt, she had some sort of… stomach trouble. But beyond that, nothing terribly concerning. Though, my cousin, on my mother’s side, he did smoke. A dreadful habit. Died young, I’m afraid. But that was his own doing, wasn’t it? Not something that runs in the family, per se.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. So, a history of high blood pressure on your father’s side, and unfortunately, your cousin smoked. We’ll keep those in mind. Now, to get a fuller picture, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Heavens, no. I pride myself on avoiding such things. I believe in letting the body heal itself, with proper diet and exercise, of course. I might take a little vitamin C during the winter months, to ward off a cold, but that’s hardly a medication. My husband, however… he's always popping pills for this and that. Says his doctor recommends them. I find it rather alarming, frankly. All those chemicals… I prefer a cup of mint tea if I’m feeling unwell. Much more sensible.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. It sounds like you prioritize a very natural approach to health, which is admirable. Just to confirm, no regular prescription medications or daily supplements beyond the occasional vitamin C?
PATIENT: Precisely. No prescriptions. No daily anything. Just a healthy lifestyle, and a good dose of common sense. Honestly, Doctor, I think my husband is making a mountain out of a molehill with this whole… planning business. It’s not as if I’m frail! I could walk for hours. And I do. Every day. He just worries too much. It’s a character flaw, really. A rather tiresome one, at times. Now, shall we get this form done so I can return to my book? I’m quite engrossed, you see. A lovely French novel.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It sounds like you’re in excellent health, and very proactive about maintaining it. And I respect your preference for a natural approach. Before we move on to the advance directive itself, just a quick question about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, good heavens, no. I eat everything! Moroccan cuisine is quite diverse, you see. Spices, fruits, vegetables… everything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My husband, however, he’s rather sensitive to pollen. Terrible sneezing fits, every spring. But I, thankfully, am immune to such… weaknesses. No, no allergies whatsoever. I’m quite robust, as I’ve mentioned. Now, about this form… are we getting closer to finishing? I really must get back to my novel. The plot is thickening, you see. It’s quite scandalous.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No allergies to note, which is wonderful. And you’re very fortunate to have such good health. So, it sounds like we've covered the important basics: your past medical history, family history, medications, and allergies. Before we begin completing the advance directive, I’d like to do a very brief physical exam, just to get a baseline reading of your current health status. It will only take a few moments. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Now you want to poke and prod? Honestly, Doctor, I find this quite unnecessary. I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. I don’t require a… thorough examination. My husband will be thrilled to hear I’ve been subjected to this ordeal. He thrives on such things, you see. He likes to be… involved. But I, frankly, find it rather intrusive. I came for a form, not a medical assessment. Are you certain this is absolutely necessary? I’m starting to regret agreeing to this entire visit. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, and I apologize if I’m causing you any discomfort. You are absolutely right – you came for a form, and I respect that. The brief exam is simply a standard part of our practice, even for patients who feel perfectly healthy. It’s just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, a check of your blood pressure, and a brief look in your ears and throat. It will provide me with a baseline reading, should any questions arise in the future, and it doesn’t take long at all. If you truly prefer to skip it, we can proceed with the form. It is entirely your decision. I simply wanted to ensure I had a complete picture of your health status.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But make it quick, please. I have no desire to spend the entire afternoon in a doctor's office. And please be gentle. I have a rather delicate constitution, despite my best efforts. And do try not to make too much noise with those… instruments. Honestly, the entire experience is rather… unsettling. Get it over with, quickly. I’m trusting you not to… disturb my equilibrium.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. It will be very brief, I promise. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: There. Be careful, please. My skin is rather sensitive. Honestly, the indignity of it all. A blood pressure cuff… I haven’t had one of these on in decades. I prefer to keep my circulation undisturbed, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm for me. I’ll just take a quick reading. Your blood pressure is 128 over 76. That’s within a normal range. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, let me just listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? Honestly, Doctor, I feel rather like a specimen under a microscope. Are you searching for some hidden ailment? Because I assure you, there isn't one. I maintain a very strict lifestyle, you know. Diet, exercise… everything is meticulously planned.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are regular and strong, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles to note. Everything sounds perfectly healthy. Your ears also look clear. No signs of infection or wax build-up. Alright, that's all. As I suspected, everything sounds excellent. It only took a moment. Now, we can proceed with completing the advance directive form. It outlines your wishes for medical care should you become unable to communicate them yourself. Are you ready to begin?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, let’s get this over with. The sooner I have that form in my hands, the sooner I can return to my novel. Honestly, this entire ordeal has been quite… disruptive. Where do I sign? And please, make it quick. I haven't a great deal of patience for paperwork.
DOCTOR: Certainly. This form has several sections. It asks you to designate a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. It also allows you to specify your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment, such as ventilation and feeding tubes. Let’s start with the healthcare proxy. Who would you like to designate as your representative?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be my husband, naturally. Reginald. He’s… quite insistent on being involved in everything, as you’ve probably gathered. And he fancies himself a bit of a medical expert, after reading so many articles online. Honestly, it's rather exhausting. But yes, Reginald. Put him down for everything. He’ll know what to do. Or, at least, he thinks he will.
DOCTOR: Very good. Reginald. Now, the next section asks about your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment. Do you have any specific preferences regarding ventilation, feeding tubes, or resuscitation?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather morbid. I haven’t given any of this much thought. I expect Reginald will know what’s best. He reads all those medical journals, you see. But… if I were to be… gravely ill, and there was absolutely no hope of recovery, I suppose I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially. It seems rather… undignified. No tubes, no machines. Just… let nature take its course. Is that what you want me to write? “Do not resuscitate”? And “no life support”?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. We can certainly write “Do Not Resuscitate” and “No Life Support.” It’s important to document your wishes clearly, so your healthcare proxy knows what to do in the event of an emergency. Now, there is a section regarding pain management. Do you have any preferences regarding how your pain should be treated?
PATIENT: Honestly, I simply want to be comfortable. If I'm in pain, I want it alleviated. I don’t want to suffer needlessly. Just… keep me comfortable. I trust your judgment on that matter. I don’t want to specify dosages or anything. Simply… ensure I’m not in pain. Is that sufficient? I’m starting to find this entire process rather… draining.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly sufficient. We can simply write "Comfort care as needed." That gives your healthcare proxy the flexibility to ensure you're as comfortable as possible. Now, we've covered the main sections. Just read through the document to make sure everything is accurate and reflects your wishes. Do you have any questions before you sign?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, it all seems… adequate. Reginald will probably scrutinize every word, but I suppose it’s good enough for now. No, I don’t have any questions. Just… get it over with. I want to return to my book.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I have a copy for your records, and I’ll ensure this document is added to your medical chart. Now that we've completed the advance directive, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, thank you. That is all. I believe this entire ordeal has taken quite enough of my time. I simply wanted to get the form and be done with it. Honestly, I find these medical visits rather… unsettling. Thank you for your assistance, Doctor. I trust this document will suffice. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Of course. It was a pleasure meeting you, Marija. I’m glad we were able to complete the advance directive. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your novel.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Though I doubt I shall be returning anytime soon. These visits are… unnecessary, usually.
