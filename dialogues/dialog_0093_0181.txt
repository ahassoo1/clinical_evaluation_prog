DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I requested a general wellness check, if you will. Just wanted to get a look at how things are holding up, you know? I’m seventy-four years young now, and I like to keep tabs on everything. Preventative maintenance, as they say.
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent idea, Mr. Mombrun. Preventative care is incredibly important, and I commend you for taking such a proactive approach to your health. Seventy-four years young is certainly something to celebrate! To get a thorough understanding of your current health status, I’d like to ask you a few questions. We'll cover a bit of your medical history, any current symptoms you might be experiencing, and then perform a physical examination. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Ask away. I have no secrets from a good doctor, and I’m happy to share whatever information you need. I believe in being thorough, you see. It’s no good keeping things hidden.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, yes. Years ago, perhaps fifteen years now. The doctor put me on medication, and it’s been well-controlled ever since. I take it religiously, every morning. Aside from that… no, nothing else that I can recall being diagnosed with. I’ve had the usual aches and pains that come with age, of course, but nothing a good night’s rest and a bit of liniment couldn't handle.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Mombrun. And it's good to hear your blood pressure has been well-controlled with medication. Do you recall the name of the medication you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ah, let me think… It’s a small, white pill… starts with an “A”, I believe. Amlodipine, yes! That’s it. Amlodipine. Five milligrams, taken every morning with my breakfast. I get the refill automatically from the pharmacy, so I haven’t had to worry about remembering the name for quite some time, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Amlodipine 5mg daily. That’s very helpful. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Quite a few, actually. When I was a younger man, working construction, I had a rather unfortunate incident with a falling beam. Broke my left leg, needed a plate and screws. That was… oh, goodness, nearly fifty years ago now. And then, more recently – perhaps ten years ago – I had a cataract removed from my right eye. That was a much simpler procedure, thankfully. A quick in-and-out. Everything healed very well, and my vision is excellent now, thanks to that. Anything else you need to know about those?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Mombrun. Both the leg fracture and the cataract surgery are important to note. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always jokes that my stomach is made of iron! Perhaps it’s all the arepas I eat.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent news, Mr. Mombrun. A robust digestive system is certainly a blessing! Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the Amlodipine?
PATIENT: Let me see… aside from the Amlodipine, just a daily multivitamin. Nothing fancy, just a standard one from the drugstore. And occasionally, when my arthritis flares up – which isn’t often, thankfully – I take some ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you know? Just a couple of tablets when needed. That's it, I believe. Very straightforward. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely, Mr. Mombrun. Simplicity is often best. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Ah, that’s a good question. My father… he had heart trouble later in life. He was a smoker, you see, and it eventually caught up with him. He had a stroke, I believe, maybe ten years before he passed. And my mother, she had diabetes. Type 2, I think. She managed it for years with diet and medication, but it eventually took its toll. On my wife’s side… her brother had cancer, lung cancer. Very unfortunate. He didn’t… he didn’t fare well. I believe that’s the most significant, yes. A bit worrying, of course, but what can one do? One can only do their best to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Mombrun. It's helpful to have that information. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, I’m retired now, thankfully. Used to be a construction laborer, very physically demanding work, as you can imagine. These days, I enjoy a much more relaxed pace. I spend a lot of time with my wife, we enjoy gardening. I like to read, mostly historical novels. And I take a daily walk, if the weather permits. Not a long walk, mind you, but enough to keep me moving. I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fruits and vegetables. My wife is a very good cook, she makes sure we eat well. I don't smoke, never have. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s about it. I believe I lead a fairly healthy life, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very good lifestyle, Mr. Mombrun. Very sensible. Now, before we move on to the physical examination, is there anything else you would like to share with me, any concerns you may have, or anything that’s been bothering you recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little more tired lately. Not terribly tired, mind you, just… a bit more sluggish than usual. And my knees have been aching a bit more, even with the occasional ibuprofen. I suppose that’s to be expected at my age, but it’s still a bit bothersome. Nothing debilitating, just… a general feeling of being a bit worn down, if you understand. That’s really all, I think. I'm not one to complain, you see. I’ve had a good life, and I’m grateful for it. But I thought I'd mention it, just in case.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Mombrun. It’s good you mentioned the fatigue and increased knee pain. Those are certainly things we should investigate further. Now, if you’re comfortable, let’s proceed with a physical examination. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse, and then listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, I’ll take a look at your knees, and we can discuss any further tests that might be necessary. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgment completely. Let’s get this done, shall we? I’m a patient man, and I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun. Just relax your arm for me. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. And your pulse is 76 and regular. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Could you please bend them for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: There we are. A little creaky, as you might expect. They’ve seen a lot of work over the years. They feel a little stiff, and there’s some tenderness on the inner side of the left knee, I believe. Nothing excruciating, but definitely noticeable. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Mombrun. I do feel some crepitus with movement, and there’s definite tenderness to palpation along the medial joint line of the left knee. Range of motion is slightly limited, but no significant swelling or warmth. And could you walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: There we go. I try to avoid putting too much weight on the left knee, if that’s noticeable. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a discomfort. A nagging ache, really. I’ve learned to compensate over the years, I suppose. Is that alright? Anything particularly alarming you’ve noticed?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Mombrun. I do notice a slight limp and a tendency to favor your right leg. Based on the examination findings – the elevated blood pressure, fatigue, and findings in your left knee – I’d like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’d like to order a Complete Blood Count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and an X-ray of your left knee to evaluate for osteoarthritis. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. A few tests can’t hurt, and I’d rather be thorough than leave anything unchecked. When can I expect the results? And where will I need to go to have these tests done? Perhaps you have a preferred laboratory?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the orders sent electronically to Lakeside Diagnostics. They are a reputable laboratory just a few blocks from here. You can go at your convenience, no appointment necessary. They’ll contact you directly to schedule any necessary follow-up. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back, and my office will contact you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your Amlodipine as prescribed, and I suggest you try to avoid activities that aggravate your knee pain. Over-the-counter ibuprofen can help with the discomfort, but be mindful of the dosage and potential side effects. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything quite nicely. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience and attention. I’ll head over to Lakeside Diagnostics tomorrow and get those tests done. Thank you again for your time and care. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Mr. Mombrun. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Goodbye.
