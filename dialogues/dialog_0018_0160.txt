DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you are a new patient to our clinic. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about this… tiredness. It’s just gotten worse, and it’s really bothersome. And… well, this is embarrassing, but I’ve been eating dirt. Not a lot, mind you, but enough that I figured I should probably get it checked out. It’s just… a craving, I suppose. Don’t look at me like that, dear. It’s not like I want to.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Hardenburgh. It takes courage to discuss things that feel unusual or embarrassing, and I appreciate your honesty. The tiredness is certainly something we can explore, and we will address the dirt consumption as well. To start with the tiredness, could you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can just sleep it off. I get plenty of rest, I do. But I wake up feeling… drained. Like I haven't slept at all. And it’s not just in the mornings, it’s all the time. I used to be able to do things, you know? Get around, keep busy. Now… now I just want to sit. It's interfering with everything, frankly. I haven't been to church in weeks.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very frustrating, Ms. Hardenburgh, to feel drained even with adequate rest and to have it impact your daily life and activities you enjoy. It's good you’re able to articulate that. When did you first start noticing this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe six months ago? Around the time the weather really started warming up, I believe. It was gradual at first, just feeling a little more sluggish than usual. But it’s been getting worse steadily since then. Honestly, I thought it was just old age catching up with me, but then I started… with the dirt.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, coinciding with warmer weather... that’s helpful information. And you mentioned the dirt consumption began around the same time?
PATIENT: Yes, it did. I don’t know why I started. It’s not like I grew up eating dirt, you understand. It just… a taste popped into my head. And then I found myself… looking for it. The garden, mostly. That reddish clay, you know? It’s silly, really. I feel perfectly foolish saying it out loud. It’s not like I’m hungry for it. It’s just… a compulsion.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Ms. Hardenburgh. Compulsions can be very difficult to understand and explain, and it’s brave of you to share this with me. We will work together to understand what might be causing this. Now, let’s delve a bit deeper into the tiredness. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. Well, I’ve been feeling… a little weak, I suppose. Not like I’m going to fall over, but just… a general lack of strength. And I’ve been more irritable than usual, snapping at people over nothing. My neighbor, bless her heart, keeps offering to bring me groceries and I nearly told her to mind her own business! I don’t usually act that way.
DOCTOR: Weakness and irritability, in addition to the tiredness… Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s important that we explore all of these symptoms. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: My appetite… well, it’s been off and on. Some days I don’t feel hungry at all, and other days I could eat a horse. I haven’t really been trying to eat much, to be honest. I just haven’t been interested. And I’ve probably lost a little weight. My clothes feel looser, but I haven’t stepped on a scale in ages. I don't care for scales, always upsetting.
DOCTOR: Fluctuating appetite and unintentional weight loss… Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, I had a touch of arthritis in my knees years ago, but it’s mostly managed with… well, with ignoring it, mostly. And high blood pressure, the doctor told me once, but I haven’t taken pills for it in ages. They made me feel awful. Honestly, I don’t really believe in all those medications. I prefer to let nature take its course.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for a natural approach, Ms. Hardenburgh. However, it's important we have a complete picture of your health. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not any surgeries. Never had the need. I had all my children at home with a midwife, perfectly natural. No need for doctors cutting you open! My mother always said, “Let the body heal itself,” and she lived to be 95, so she must have been onto something.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear about your mother, Ms. Hardenburgh. Now, regarding your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had a weak heart, I believe. She didn’t take care of herself, always working too hard. And my brother, bless his soul, he had… something with his stomach, years ago. Cancer, I think. It took him quickly. But other than that, not really. A lot of strong people in my family, mostly. Hard workers.
DOCTOR: Weak heart in your mother and stomach cancer in your brother… I appreciate you sharing that information with me. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you live alone, Ms. Hardenburgh?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I’ve been on my own since my husband passed away, oh, nearly thirty years ago now. It feels like a lifetime. I have a few friends in the neighborhood, but they’re all getting on in years themselves, you know? We mostly just wave to each other. I keep myself busy enough, though. Garden, church when I can, reading…
DOCTOR: I’m sorry for your loss, Ms. Hardenburgh. It sounds like you have a good support system with your friends and you keep yourself active, which is wonderful. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol… well, I had a little sherry with my husband on special occasions, but I haven't had a drop in decades. Not my cup of tea, you know? Makes me feel awful. Always preferred a nice cup of herbal tea.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little vitamin D in the winter, when it’s gloomy. And sometimes, if my arthritis is really acting up, I’ll take a little ibuprofen. But that's about it. I don’t like taking pills, as I said. I believe in letting nature take its course. Honestly, I think all this fussing about is just a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Hardenburgh. I understand your preference for a natural approach, and I respect that. However, it's important to rule out any underlying medical causes for your tiredness and the unusual compulsion you're experiencing. Now, I would like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A physical exam… I suppose so. But don't go poking and prodding too much, dear. I’m a delicate flower, you know. And don’t expect much. I haven’t been to a doctor in ages, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hardenburgh. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with checking your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature—and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Let’s begin with your blood pressure. It's a little elevated at 150/90. That is something we should discuss. Now, let me listen to your heart… I detect a slightly irregular rhythm. It's subtle, but worth noting. And your lungs sound clear. Now, let’s check your thyroid. Hmm, it feels slightly enlarged. Finally, let’s take a look at your abdomen. It’s soft, but I do feel some tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Do you experience any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, that’s a little tender. Not excruciating, but… noticeable. It's been a bit achy lately, come to think of it. I thought it was just old age, or maybe a bit of indigestion. Honestly, I haven't paid it much attention. But it does feel a bit uncomfortable. And my appetite has been off and on, you know? Sometimes I can eat a horse, other times I just can’t stomach anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. That tenderness, along with the irregular heart rhythm, enlarged thyroid and fluctuating appetite is concerning. It's good that you told me. I’m going to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. These will check your thyroid function, liver function, kidney function, complete blood count, and vitamin levels. We’ll also check your iron levels, as fatigue can be a sign of anemia. I also want to order a stool sample to rule out any underlying infection. I'll also order a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs and heart. It’s important to rule out any structural abnormalities. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a lot of tests. A stool sample? Really? I suppose it's necessary, but it's rather… unpleasant to think about. All this poking and prodding and analyzing… I just want to feel normal again, dear. It’s all rather overwhelming. I don’t suppose you can just tell me what’s wrong with me right now? Skip all the fussing, maybe? I don't understand all this talk of thyroids and livers and whatnots.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh. It is a lot, and I wish I could just tell you exactly what’s going on right now. However, these tests are essential to rule out various possibilities and get an accurate diagnosis. It’s like putting together a puzzle, and each test provides a piece of information. The tests will help me understand if there's a problem with your thyroid, which can cause fatigue and weight changes. The liver function tests will check if your liver is functioning properly. The stool sample will rule out any underlying infection that might be causing your symptoms. Regarding the dirt consumption, that is unusual and we need to rule out any nutritional deficiencies or underlying medical conditions that might be causing that compulsion. I want to assure you that I’m here to help you feel better, and we’ll take things one step at a time. Do you have any questions about how to collect the stool sample, or any concerns about the other tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The stool sample… where does one even begin with that? And what if I can’t… produce? I haven't had regular bowel movements lately, as I mentioned. It’s just… embarrassing to talk about. And all these tests… will they hurt? I don’t like needles. I faint easily. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. It’s all rather frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about these tests, and I want to assure you that we’ll take things at your pace. Regarding the stool sample, the lab will provide you with a collection kit and detailed instructions. You’ll simply collect a small sample of stool in the container provided. If you’re having trouble with bowel movements, we can discuss some gentle stool softeners or dietary changes to help. As for the blood tests, we’ll use the smallest needle possible, and I’ll be as gentle as I can. We’ll have you lie down for the blood draw, and I’ll have a nurse assist me to make sure you’re comfortable. If you’re prone to fainting, we’ll take extra precautions to prevent that. We'll take it very slowly and stop if you feel uncomfortable. I will also have a cool cloth ready. The nurse will also get your height and weight. I'll be honest with you, Ms. Hardenburgh. Given your symptoms—the tiredness, weakness, irritability, irregular heart rhythm, enlarged thyroid, tenderness in your abdomen, dirt consumption, and fluctuating appetite—I'm concerned about several possibilities. We need to rule out hyperthyroidism, liver disease, anemia, nutritional deficiencies, and underlying infections. It's also important to investigate the cause of the dirt consumption. I will give you a requisition form for the blood tests and stool sample. The lab is located just down the street. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any further questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a lot to take in. Hyper… what was that? And liver… all these complicated words! It’s all rather overwhelming, dear. I suppose I’ll go to the lab, but I don't promise I won’t faint. And what if the results are… bad? I don’t want to know if I’m dying, you understand. I’ve lived a good life, and I don’t want to spend my remaining days worrying about illnesses. Honestly, I think I just want to go home and have a nice cup of tea. Is there anything you can tell me right now to ease my mind? Maybe just a simple explanation of what might be going on? Just something to hold onto while I wait for all these tests?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s natural to feel overwhelmed when faced with uncertainty. Let me try to explain things in a simple way. Hyperthyroidism means your thyroid gland is overactive, producing too much thyroid hormone. This can cause fatigue, weight loss, irritability, and an irregular heartbeat. Liver disease means your liver isn’t functioning properly, which can cause fatigue, abdominal tenderness, and changes in appetite. It's important to remember that these are just possibilities, and we haven’t confirmed anything yet. The tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. Regarding the dirt consumption, that is unusual and can be a sign of an iron deficiency or an underlying nutritional imbalance. It can also be a compulsive behavior caused by stress or anxiety. It’s unlikely the results are going to indicate something dire. We are going to be methodical about this. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, try to rest and avoid stress. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I will also make a note to have the nurse call you tomorrow to check in. Here are the requisitions. Please let me know if you have any trouble scheduling the tests. And again, please don't hesitate to call if you're feeling overwhelmed. I am here to help you. Do you think you'll be able to get these tests done today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I suppose I can try. But I don't promise anything, dear. I get easily flustered, and I don’t drive anymore, so I’ll have to rely on my neighbor, bless her heart, to take me. I just hope these tests don’t take too long. I have a roast in the oven, and I don’t want it to burn. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. It’s all rather… disruptive. And what if the tests show something… serious? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don’t want to die in a hospital bed, you understand. I want to spend my remaining days at home, surrounded by my garden and my friends. Alright, I’ll take these requisitions. But please, don’t expect miracles, dear. I’m an old woman, and I’m not very good with all this medical fussing. And if you don’t mind, I think I’ll just leave now. I need to get home and check on my roast. Thank you for your time, but honestly, I’m still feeling very anxious.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s alright to feel anxious, and it’s perfectly acceptable to leave when you need to. We will take everything one step at a time. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to make you comfortable, and we will only recommend further treatment if it is absolutely necessary. If the tests show something serious, we will discuss all your options and ensure you have the support you need. And don’t worry about your roast! It's good to have things to look forward to. Here’s my card with the clinic number. Please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small. Thank you for coming in today. I wish you all the best and hope you’re able to get some rest. And I hope your roast turns out perfectly. .
