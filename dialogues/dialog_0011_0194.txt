DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well... it's a bit hard to explain, to be honest. It’s this hearing, you see. It comes and goes. And makes me feel... off balance. It’s been happening on and off for a little while now. My daughter, she told me I really ought to get it checked. She’s a good girl, that one.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite bothersome to have fluctuating hearing and associated balance issues. It’s wise of your daughter to encourage you to seek medical attention. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s been going on. To start, when you say “a little while,” could you estimate how long this has been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… time gets away from you, doesn't it? Let me think... It must be… at least six months, maybe longer. It’s hard to say exactly. It started slowly, I think. Just a little muffled sound now and then. Then it started to… come and go more noticeably. I really can't put a solid date on it, I’m afraid. And my memory… well, it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhugh. It's common for these things to develop gradually, and an exact timeline isn't always crucial. Six months is a helpful starting point. You mentioned the sound being muffled. Does this happen in both ears, or is it primarily one ear?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think it’s more often in my right ear, yes. Though sometimes it feels… all fuzzy, like when you’ve got cotton in both ears. It’s hard to tell, really. It comes and goes so quickly. And like I said, my memory… sometimes I can't be sure which ear it was.
DOCTOR: I understand your difficulty recalling specifics with the fluctuating nature of the symptoms and memory concerns. Focusing on the most frequent experience is helpful. So, generally, you’d say the muffled hearing is more prominent in your right ear?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Usually the right one. And it feels… like something’s blocked. Not painful, just… full. And then it goes away, and I don’t notice it for a while. It’s just… unsettling when it happens. Makes me a bit dizzy too, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh. So, fluctuating muffled hearing primarily in your right ear, with a sensation of fullness, and occasional dizziness. When you experience the dizziness, can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not a spinning kind of dizzy, Doctor. More like… unsteady. Like I might fall. Not bad enough to actually fall, mind you. Just… wobbly. And a little bit nauseous sometimes, but not often. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few minutes. It's very strange, very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Mayhugh. Unsteady with a sensation of fullness in the right ear and occasional brief nausea. That's very helpful. Now, have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or other noises in your ears alongside the muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now you mention it… yes, I think I have. A faint ringing, like a high-pitched tone. But it comes and goes so quickly, I often dismiss it. It’s not constant, not like some people I’ve heard about. Just… a little tinkle, every now and then. Do you think that matters?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does matter, Ms. Mayhugh. The intermittent ringing, even if faint, is a relevant piece of the puzzle. It’s called tinnitus, and it often accompanies hearing changes. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or any neurological issues?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think. Well, the doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high, and he put me on a little pill for it. I take that every day. And… I had a bad bout of the flu a couple of years back, but that's about it, I think. Nothing else serious that I can recall. My memory, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you are currently being treated for high blood pressure. That is important information. And you had the flu a couple of years ago. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Years and years ago, when I was a young woman, I had my tonsils taken out. That was a long time ago, though. And… oh, when my hip went bad, I had a replacement. That was about ten years ago now. Aside from those two things, I haven't had any major surgery or been in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Mayhugh. Tonsillectomy as a young woman and a hip replacement ten years ago. I appreciate you sharing that. Now, can you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had terrible headaches all her life. Migraines, the doctor called them. And my brother… he had problems with his balance when he got older. Kept falling, poor man. And… my daughter tells me my grandfather, on my father’s side, had some sort of… ear trouble, but I don’t know the details. It’s all very vague, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Vague details are still helpful. So, a history of migraines in your mother, balance issues in your brother, and possible ear trouble in your grandfather. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband… he used to smoke a little, but he gave it up years ago. No, I’ve never smoked.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Do you drink alcohol, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that’s all. Nothing excessive, I assure you. Just a small glass.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I don’t think so. I've never had any bad reactions to any medications that I recall. My daughter always checks when they give me something new, just in case. But no, I don't think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Mayhugh. That provides a very good overview. Now, with your permission, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, focusing on your ears, nose, and throat, and a quick balance assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. If you think it's necessary. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, if you could. My ears are a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. I will be as gentle as possible. I see a slight cerumen impaction, but nothing significant. Your tympanic membrane appears intact, though it's slightly dull. Now, let's check your balance. Please stand with your feet together and close your eyes. You exhibit a mild sway, particularly to your right. You demonstrate some instability. Based on the examination, your balance is mildly affected, consistent with your reported symptoms. The mild cerumen impaction may contribute to the dull appearance of your tympanic membranes, but doesn’t fully explain the symptoms. The examination does not immediately suggest any other acute issues.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? What does all that mean, Doctor? Am I terribly ill? I just want to know what’s going on with my hearing and this dizziness.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Mayhugh, but please don’t jump to conclusions. These findings are not necessarily indicative of a serious illness. It's more likely we are dealing with a combination of factors. Based on your history and the examination, the most probable explanation is a condition called Meniere’s Disease. It affects the inner ear and can cause fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus , vertigo or dizziness, and a feeling of fullness in the ear. The cerumen impaction may be exacerbating the hearing symptoms. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, such as vestibular neuritis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo , or even a less common neurological cause. To do that, I recommend we schedule an audiogram – a hearing test – to assess the extent of your hearing loss and identify any specific frequencies that are affected. I also want to order a complete blood count to rule out any underlying medical conditions and assess your overall health. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Meniere’s Disease… that sounds dreadful. Is it… serious? Will I go deaf? An audiogram… and blood tests… yes, I suppose so. If it will help figure out what’s wrong. My daughter always says I need to get things checked out. She’s probably right. It’s all a bit overwhelming, Doctor. But thank you for explaining it to me. I just hope we can find out what’s going on and get it fixed.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be overwhelmed, Ms. Mayhugh. Meniere’s Disease can be concerning, but it’s not always a severe condition. The severity varies greatly from person to person. While it can lead to hearing loss in some cases, it's not a foregone conclusion, and there are treatments available to manage the symptoms and slow its progression. We will start with the audiogram and blood tests to get a clearer picture of your condition. I’ll also write a prescription for cerumenolytic drops to soften the earwax, which may provide some temporary relief. I will schedule you for the audiogram with our audiologist, Mr. Henderson, and the blood work can be done at the lab just across the street. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action, which may include medication, lifestyle modifications, or referral to an otolaryngologist if needed. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your dizziness, severe headache, or vision changes, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a bit of a relief to hear it’s not always severe. Sudden worsening… vision changes… I’ll remember that. No, I don’t think so. Not at the moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… when can I get the audiogram done? And how long will the results take? I just want to get this sorted out as soon as possible. It’s just unsettling not knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. I understand your desire to get this resolved quickly. Mr. Henderson has availability next Tuesday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday… yes, that should be fine. 2:00 PM. All right. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. I suppose I'll see you again after the audiogram then?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve scheduled your audiogram for Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Mr. Henderson’s office is just down the hall, room 203. They will contact you to confirm the appointment. Yes, I’d like to see you again after you've had the audiogram to discuss the results and create a treatment plan. We can schedule that appointment when you come in next Tuesday, or we can do it over the phone. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease, a little bit. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I'll see you next Tuesday, then. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s my pleasure. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Remember to take things one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday.
