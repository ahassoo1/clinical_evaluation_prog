DOCTOR: Right. Chanz Redfern, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Though honestly, names… they all kinda blur together these days. Don't hold me to it if I get yours wrong, alright? It’s Bethanie, right? Something like that? Look, I’m here 'cause… well, sleeping’s become a bit of a hassle. And I used to be fit. Used to.
DOCTOR: Bethanie Nooruddin, actually. And it’s… good to know you’re aware of your name, despite the blur. Though I expect a patient to remember my name. Sleeping trouble, you say?
PATIENT: Look, no offense, but I fix fiddles and flutes, not memorize faces and names. It's a different skillset, alright? And yeah, sleeping. It's not that I can't sleep, it’s just… not good sleep. Restless, you know? And I wake up feeling like I haven’t slept a wink. It's probably just getting old, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "Getting old" at 29?
PATIENT: Well, relatively old. Look, it’s been a rough couple of years, alright? Lost my wife… changed things. Not that I expect you to understand. People just… don’t get it. It feels like I’ve been running on fumes for ages, and even when I do lie down, my mind just won’t shut off. It’s exhausting, frankly.
DOCTOR: Right. Loss is… difficult. But "exhaustion" can have many causes. And frankly, attributing it solely to grief after two years… isn’t particularly helpful. Let's try and be a little more specific. When did you first notice this trouble sleeping becoming a problem—not just a bad night here and there—but a consistent issue?
PATIENT: Consistent… hmm. Honestly? It’s all a bit of a blur. Probably… six months ago? Maybe a little longer? It started with just waking up a few times a night, but now it's… well, it feels like I'm lucky to get four hours straight. And I’m constantly tired, even after a full night – or what should be a full night. It’s not like I’m doing anything strenuous, you know? Just fixing instruments.
DOCTOR: "Just fixing instruments." And how many hours a day would you say you spend doing that?
PATIENT: Oh, not too bad. Usually… six, seven hours? Sometimes a little more if I have a rush order. It's not physical labor, mostly just… delicate work. Fine tuning, you know? It requires concentration. Which is probably why I'm so wiped afterward. Look, I used to be able to pull all-nighters without even thinking about it. Now? Forget about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you find yourself thinking about… anything specific when you're trying to sleep?
PATIENT: Specific? Like what? Look, it’s not like I’m actively trying to think about things. It just… happens. Bits and pieces, mostly. Memories, I guess. Things I need to fix. Arguments I should've won. Honestly, it's a jumbled mess. It’s not like I can give you a neat little list, alright? My brain's not exactly organized these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's try to be a bit more systematic. Do you have any difficulty falling asleep, or is it staying asleep that’s the problem?
PATIENT: Staying asleep, definitely. Falling asleep isn't usually an issue. I'm usually out pretty quick, once I finally lie down. It's the waking up that's the killer. Sometimes once, sometimes five, six times a night. And then I'm just… there. Staring at the ceiling, mind racing. It's infuriating, frankly. It’s not like I’m tossing and turning, just… awake.
DOCTOR: And when you wake up, what’s the first thing you do?
PATIENT: Ugh. Check the time, usually. Then, inevitably, start thinking. About work, mostly. Bills. Just… things I should have done, things I need to do. It's a vicious cycle, alright? I try to clear my head, but it never works. And then I end up just getting more stressed, which makes it even harder to fall back asleep. Honestly, it’s a miracle I function at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you consume any caffeine or alcohol, particularly in the evenings?
PATIENT: Caffeine? Just a bit of coffee in the morning, to get me going. Nothing fancy. And no, no alcohol. Never really been my thing. Too… messy. Honestly, I'm pretty boring, alright? Just work, a bit of telly, and trying to avoid thinking about everything.
DOCTOR: And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Aside from the usual over-the-counter stuff for headaches? Nothing. I'm not one for popping pills, alright? I prefer to deal with things myself. Honestly, I don't trust those things. Too many side effects, too much fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Could you lie down on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But don't expect anything exciting, alright? I'm not exactly in peak condition these days. Mostly just… tired.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat, and I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is slightly elevated, 82 beats per minute. Lungs sound clear bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles noted. Blood pressure is 130/80. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses detected. Everything seems physically unremarkable. However, your heart rate is a little fast, which could be related to stress or lack of sleep.
PATIENT: Stress, you think? Shocking. Honestly, it’s a wonder I’m not completely falling apart. So, what now? Are you gonna give me a sleeping pill? Because frankly, if that’s the plan, I’m not interested.
DOCTOR: No, I wasn’t planning on immediately prescribing a sedative. While a short-term sleep aid could be considered, it doesn’t address the underlying issue. Based on your history, it sounds like you're dealing with significant stress and anxiety impacting your sleep. I suspect this is likely related to the grief you experienced. However, before we jump to any conclusions, I’d like to order some basic blood work—just to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue and sleep disturbance. We'll also want to check your thyroid function. And, I’m going to recommend a referral to a therapist specializing in grief counseling. Honestly, that seems like the most productive course of action.
PATIENT: Therapy? Seriously? Look, I appreciate the… concern, but I'm not one for talking about my feelings. Never really been my thing. And blood work? Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. Honestly, I’ve got instruments to fix, alright? I can't be spending all day running tests and talking to strangers.
DOCTOR: Right. As you wish. I’ll order the blood work. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll give you the requisition form. I still strongly recommend the therapy referral, but I can't force you to accept it. However, understand that without addressing the underlying psychological factors, this issue is likely to persist. I’ll also send you home with a list of sleep hygiene tips—basic things like establishing a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine before bed, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine. Honestly, even small changes can make a difference. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Sleep hygiene tips… Look, I appreciate the… effort, alright? But honestly, I'm a practical man. I fix things. I don't do routines. And if some sleep schedule is gonna magically fix everything, then I'm surprised more of my customers aren't recommending it. No, I don't think I have any questions. Just… where do I get this blood work done? And can we be quick about it?
DOCTOR: The lab is right through that door, second window on the left. Tell them Dr. Nooruddin sent you. It shouldn't take more than fifteen minutes. The results will take a few days. I’ll have my nurse contact you when they’re ready. Honestly, I’ve said all I can say for today. I trust you’ll consider my recommendations. If you don’t see any improvement, or if your symptoms worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions for me now?
PATIENT: No. Honestly, I think I've heard enough for one day. Just… the lab, right? Thank you, I guess. .
