DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. I’m Dr. Galena. It's… good to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doc. It's… just this cough. It won't quit. Been hacking up stuff for… I don’t even know how long now. And I’m just tired all the time. Gets me pretty worn out, and these sinus things keep coming back. Feels like my head's gonna split open sometimes.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. A cough, fatigue, and recurring sinus issues… sounds unpleasant. Let's try to get a little more detail here. When did this cough start?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s hard to say exactly. It started… gradual-like. Maybe… last fall? Or was it the winter before? I get sick a lot in the colder months, you know? It usually just goes away on its own, but this one… it just kept hanging on. I figured it would clear up eventually. It hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been… several months at least. And it didn't really go away, just… lingered?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. Lingered is a good word for it. Comes and goes, but it always comes back. Worse when it’s cold, or when the wind’s blowing dust around. And like I said, the sinuses… they flare up with it, usually. Feels like pressure behind my eyes, and… stuffy, you know? Just miserable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And would you describe the cough itself?
PATIENT: Well… it's a wet cough. Lots of… phlegm. Sometimes it’s clear, sometimes it’s… yellowish. Not a lot of blood or anything, thankfully. It’s worst in the mornings, usually. Gotta cough a good bit just to get my lungs clear enough to breathe. And it makes my chest… ache a little. Not bad ache, just… uncomfortable. You know?
DOCTOR: A wet cough with changing color phlegm, worse in the mornings, and some chest discomfort… Okay. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats with this cough?
PATIENT: Fever? Not really. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but nothing I’ve bothered to take a temperature for. No chills, no night sweats. I get cold easily, being thin and all, but that’s just… me. Never had anything with a fever, just this cough and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any shortness of breath, or pain when you take a deep breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. Gets a little winded walking uphill, but I’m not a young man anymore, you know? And the chest discomfort isn't pain, exactly. Just… feels tight. Like there’s something… stuck. Especially when I cough a lot. It doesn’t hurt to breathe deep, unless I’m really hacking, then it’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My grandmother… she smoked, but I always hated the smell of it. Stayed away from it, always. And no, I don’t drink much either. A beer now and then, that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you around anyone who smokes regularly?
PATIENT: Nope. Not anymore. Used to work with a fella who smoked, but he retired a few years back. Now, I mostly keep to myself. I don’t go out much. Mostly just me and the TV these days. So no, I haven't been around smoke in a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well… I’ve got high blood pressure, Doc. Been on medicine for it for… oh, maybe ten years now? Keeps it under control, mostly. Other than that… not much. Had pneumonia once, a long time ago. And my knees… they bother me when it rains. But nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart problems… just the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yeah, I take Lisinopril. One pill every morning. And sometimes, when my knees are really acting up, I take some ibuprofen. That's about it. Nothing else. I try not to take too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and ibuprofen as needed… And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental things?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't have any allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much whatever I want. Dust bothers me sometimes, but that's just… dust. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. Just dust.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listening to your lungs and checking your sinuses, things like that. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, go ahead. I figured you'd want to listen to my chest, anyway. Been coughing up a storm for months, you know? Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me… Okay… I do hear some… wheezing in your lungs, especially on the lower lobes. Not alarming, but it explains the cough. And your sinuses are… tender to the touch, on both sides. Some swelling as well. Temperature is… 98.8. No fever. Pulse is… 72, regular. Okay. I’m also noticing you are slightly underweight, Mr. Pithan. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Yeah, the wheezing… that sounds about right. Always felt like something was rattling around in there. And the weight… well, I have lost a bit. Not much, but maybe ten, fifteen pounds over the last year or so. I haven’t been eating as much, I guess. Just haven’t had much of an appetite lately. It’s hard to get excited about food when you're feeling sick all the time. I figured it was just from not eating much, but… maybe it's something else?
DOCTOR: Alright. Unintentional weight loss, along with the cough, fatigue, and sinus issues… We should run a few tests to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to rule out anything serious, and a complete blood count, just to check your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Sounds good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s making me feel so rotten. X-ray and blood work… go ahead. When do you want me to get those done? And where? I don’t drive much anymore, so I need to know if it's somewhere I can get a ride to.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll send the orders to the lab across the street. They take walk-ins, so you shouldn't need an appointment. I'll have the nurse print out the paperwork for you. And I’ll also order a flu and COVID test, just to rule those out as well. It's a quick nasal swab. It’s best to get those done today, if possible. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and figure out a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… thorough. Flu and COVID, too… good idea. I’d rather just get it all over with, you know? Across the street is good. I can walk there. Alright, paperwork and swab… I’ll head over there after I talk to the nurse. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate you looking into this. I’ve been feeling pretty miserable for a long time, so I'm glad you're taking it seriously. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pithan. It's my job. The nurse will be in shortly to get you set up. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this.
