DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in my… body odor. It’s not like I usually smell bad, you know? But lately, it’s just… different. And not in a good way. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Different how, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not just… sweatier, if that makes sense. It’s like… almost a little bit sour? And it seems to be stronger than usual, even after I shower. I usually use the same soap and deodorant, and it hasn't been enough lately. I've even tried using extra, and it still… persists. Does that make any sense at all? I feel silly talking about this.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Purtee, I understand. It is…uncommon for a woman of your age to present with this complaint, but not unheard of. Now, has this change been gradual, or did it appear suddenly?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I think it was gradual. It wasn’t like one day it was different. It started maybe a month or so ago, just… a little bit stronger smell. Then, over the past couple of weeks, it’s become more noticeable, and that sort of sour thing started. So, not sudden, definitely gradual. I’ve been trying to ignore it, hoping it would go away, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you experiencing any other changes, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Other changes? Let me think… not that I’ve noticed, really. No fever, no weight loss… I've been eating normally, sleeping okay, same as always. My energy levels are fine. Oh! Actually… now that you mention it, I have been sweating a little more generally, even when it's not hot. But nothing major, just… a little warmer than usual, you know? And I’ve been a bit more thirsty, but I figured that was just the summer heat.
DOCTOR: Summer heat is quite plausible. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for a long time. I take lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily. And… hmm… I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Other than that, nothing major, Doctor. I've always been pretty healthy, honestly. That's why this whole body odor thing is so strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I take a multivitamin every morning, just a standard one. And sometimes, if my knees are bothering me, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s not regular, just when I need it. I also take Vitamin D in the winter, but it's summer now so I stopped taking that a few months ago. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Purtee, that seems to cover it. Now, allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, really. No food allergies, no environmental allergies, nothing like that. I can eat anything, breathe anything, no problems. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. I suppose that's why this is so confusing!
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, family history. Are there any instances of… unusual body odor or… persistent infections in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. I don't recall anyone in my family having unusual body odor specifically. My mother and grandmother both had pretty good hygiene, so it wasn't something we talked about. My father had diabetes, and he did have some foot problems… infections, I think. But I don’t think it was related to body odor. And my brother… he's perfectly healthy, as far as I know. So, no, not that I'm aware of. It's a bit of a sensitive topic, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, sensitive. Now, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. Never have. My mother was very strict about that. And it just… never appealed to me. I drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe three or four times a week, but that's it. Nothing excessive, Doctor. And I don’t use any recreational drugs. Never have, never will.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's proceed to a physical examination. Please step onto the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and… yes, I'll need to examine you.
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I suppose you'll have to… smell me? I feel a bit silly, honestly. But if it helps figure out what’s going on, I'm happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Heart and lungs sound clear. No obvious signs of infection. Your vital signs are within normal limits… though your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not significantly. It is…difficult to determine the source without further investigation. It could be a benign issue, Ms. Purtee, but we must rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a TSH to check your thyroid function. We’ll also do a urinalysis.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Blood work, urinalysis… yes, that makes sense. Should I be worried, Doctor? I mean, you said “rule out other possibilities,” and that sounds a bit scary. Is it something serious? I’m a little nervous now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Purtee, it is rarely advisable to jump to conclusions. The differential diagnosis includes hyperhidrosis, bromhidrosis, and, less likely, underlying metabolic disturbances. The blood work will help us determine if there is an underlying cause. I will also send you to a dermatologist for evaluation. They are better equipped to assess skin conditions and potential odor sources. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Avoid using heavily scented deodorants or antiperspirants until after your evaluation. And please, try not to worry unnecessarily. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay… hyperhidrosis, bromhidrosis… I'll have to look those up. And a dermatologist… yes, that sounds good. Avoiding scented products, got it. No, I don’t think so. Just… when can I expect the blood work results? And what if it is something serious? Will you call me with the results, or do I need to schedule another appointment?
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 3-5 business days. My office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results, if they are abnormal. If you haven’t heard anything within a week, assume the results were within normal limits. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. 3-5 business days… follow-up if abnormal, otherwise assume normal. That makes sense, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It’s just… unsettling, you know? To suddenly have this… change. I’ll schedule the appointment with the dermatologist right away. Thank you again. .
