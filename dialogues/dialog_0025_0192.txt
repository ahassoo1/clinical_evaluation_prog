DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Hartness, good afternoon. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon. Yeah, good to meet you. It’s about this… exam. For the military. They want me to get checked out first, you know? Seems silly, but rules are rules. It’s just a pre-check, right? Not a big deal.
DOCTOR: A pre-check, yes. Though all medical evaluations are important, regardless of the reason. Just to be clear, you're attempting to enlist, or are you currently serving and this is a routine check?
PATIENT: Enlist. Definitely enlist. I ain’t been in the military. Not yet, anyway. I’m 51, but I keep myself in shape. I work with engines all day, keeps my hands strong. It's a good job, but… well, it's not serving your country, is it? Seems like a good thing to do, at my age. Still got plenty left in me.
DOCTOR: Right. 51…engines… Alright. Well, let’s get some information down. It's good you’re in good shape, but age does introduce certain considerations. We need to make sure you’re medically fit for service. First, let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all – over the course of your life?
PATIENT: Conditions? Hmm. Not really. I mean, I’ve had the usual colds, you know? And a bad back once, lifting a really heavy engine block. But that was years ago. Nothing a good rub didn't fix. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Honestly. My wife, Ingrid, she handles all that. She says I'm too stubborn to go.
DOCTOR: Stubbornness isn't a medical diagnosis, Mr. Hartness. And avoiding medical care isn’t advisable, regardless of how “good” you feel. We need a complete history. “A bad back once” could be significant. Was there any nerve involvement?
PATIENT: Nerve involvement? I… I don't know what that means. It just hurt. Really hurt. Like someone was stabbing me in the lower back. Ingrid gave me some… pills. Yellow ones. And I laid in bed for a week. That’s all. It went away. Hasn’t bothered me since. Look, I’m a practical man. I fix things. I don’t go around looking for problems that ain’t there.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll need to document that as a prior injury. Yellow pills...do you know the name of those pills?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Ingrid gets them from the pharmacy. She knows all that stuff. I just take 'em when she tells me to. She’s very organized, my wife. Honestly, I'm starting to think this whole thing is a waste of time. I feel fine. I am fine. What are they expecting, a broken leg?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, with all due respect, "feeling fine" isn’t a medical assessment. The military has standards, and we need to meet them. And it’s crucial we have accurate information. Besides a back injury, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never. I haven’t even broken a bone. Ingrid always says I’m too careful. Too sensible. She worries, you know? About me climbing around on those engines all day. But I'm careful! I've got good balance. And I always wear steel-toed boots. It's common sense. Look, is this going to take long? I’ve got a lot to do today.
DOCTOR: Common sense and a military physical are two very different things, Mr. Hartness. Alright. Let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. Maybe… dust sometimes. Makes me sneeze. But everyone sneezes in the dust, right? It's hardly an allergy. Ingrid says it's just a sensitive nose. She worries about everything. Honestly. Like I'm made of glass.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no known allergies. Let’s try this. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Just… Ingrid gives me a multivitamin every morning. With breakfast. She says it's good for me. Keeps me healthy. Nothing else. I don't believe in taking a lot of pills. Makes you weak.
DOCTOR: A multivitamin. Noted. Alright, Mr. Hartness. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No. Both gone. Dad went first. Heart trouble. Mom followed a few years later. She… well, she just got old, I guess. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I see. Did either of your parents have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Dad, like I said, heart trouble. Bad heart. Mom… she had high blood pressure, I think. Ingrid told me. She always remembers all that stuff. She's got a good memory for details. I just remember they got old, you know? It happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Ingrid would kill me. She’s very health-conscious. Always reminding me to eat my vegetables. I'm a sensible man, remember?
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little. Sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe. On a Saturday. Nothing fancy. Ingrid doesn’t mind, as long as I don't overdo it. A sensible amount.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Hartness, I’m going to need to perform a physical exam. It’s standard procedure. I'll need you to remove your shirt and shoes. We'll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic musculoskeletal assessment. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Objections? No. But… I haven't really… taken my shirt off in front of a doctor before. Ingrid always does my check-ups. She's a practical woman, my wife. But I suppose it's necessary, right? If you say so. Just… try to be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Please, get changed in there. And yes, it is necessary. We need to assess your overall physical condition to determine your suitability for service. I’ll be right back with my equipment.
PATIENT: Suitability… Ingrid always said I was suitable for anything. Alright, I’m ready, I suppose. Just… try not to poke too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Another one. Good. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, Mr. Hartness. And I’m detecting a slight heart murmur. Have you ever been told you had a heart murmur before?
PATIENT: A murmur? No. Never. Ingrid… she would have told me. She always tells me if something's wrong. She’s very observant, my wife. Is that bad? A murmur?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Mr. Hartness. It requires further investigation. And your reflexes are a little sluggish, particularly in your legs. Now, can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Walk? Yes, I can walk. No problem. See? Perfectly fine. Maybe I’m a little stiff, it’s the cold in here. But I can walk.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Please sit back down. We need to order some tests. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG to evaluate your heart, and an MRI of your lower back to investigate the source of your back pain and decreased reflexes.
PATIENT: Tests? An MRI? That sounds… serious. Ingrid always said I should have gone to see a specialist years ago. But I never wanted to bother… Is there something really wrong? What do these tests even mean? And how long is all this going to take? I need to know if I’m going to be able to enlist.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without the results of these tests. However, your elevated blood pressure, heart murmur, decreased reflexes, and history of back pain warrant further investigation. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could disqualify you from service. As for how long it will take… the tests themselves should be scheduled within the next week. The results may take a few days to process. Frankly, based on these preliminary findings, I advise you to temper your expectations regarding enlistment. But we'll see what the tests reveal. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Temper my expectations… Ingrid warned me this might happen. She always said I was being unrealistic. So… you're saying there's a good chance I won't be able to enlist? After all this? What about the rest of my life? I thought I could still do something. I thought I was still… useful.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your disappointment. However, it is my professional responsibility to ensure your health and safety. Rushing into military service without addressing these potential medical issues would be irresponsible. We'll get the results of these tests, and then we can discuss your options. Until then, I recommend you schedule an appointment with a cardiologist and an orthopedic specialist as soon as possible. Here are the referrals. .
