DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Reisig, was it? Yes, yes… it’s a bit of a blur, honestly. Something about… a check-up? For… performing, I think. They said I needed clearance. It’s all a bit fast, you see. I mostly just… show people to their seats. Or sell them tickets. It's been a long time, a long time doing that work.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you have a request for a performance clearance examination. That’s perfectly alright, it can be a bit confusing navigating these things. To clarify, Mr. Krahn, are you currently involved in a performance – perhaps as a stagehand, or in a ticket-selling role – that requires medical clearance?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. See, that's the part I can't quite recall. It feels like... yes. There was a theater. A small one, downtown, I think. And a manager. A very… insistent manager. He kept talking about insurance forms and… liability. I mostly just want to get this over with, if you don't mind. My memory… isn’t what it used to be. Is there a form I need to sign? Or… something?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krahn. We can absolutely take things at your pace. It's not uncommon for details to be a bit fuzzy, especially after some time. We will get through this. Let's start with a general overview of your health. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: No, no, go ahead. Just… try to keep it simple, please. It’s been a while since anyone asked about my health. Mostly, I just try to avoid bumping into things. That’s my biggest health concern, really. I’m a tall man, you see. Very tall.
DOCTOR: Avoiding bumps is a very sensible concern, Mr. Krahn, especially at your height! We’ll certainly keep that in mind. Let’s start with any past medical conditions you might be aware of. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or any other significant illness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking things I really don’t remember. I think… maybe some aches and pains? Old age, mostly. I had a doctor a long, long time ago… but I don’t recall what he said. I think he poked me a lot. And asked me to breathe. No, nothing serious, I don’t think. I’ve never been in the hospital. Is that… good?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, never being hospitalized is generally a good thing. It sounds like you haven’t had any major medical issues, which is wonderful. Let’s move on to past surgeries. Have you ever had any operations or procedures done?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Definitely not. I… I don’t like hospitals, you see. Or doctors, really. But the manager… he was very insistent. Said it was mandatory. Something about protecting the theater. And the audience. A very anxious man.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. That's good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, that’s… difficult. I haven’t seen my family in a very long time. Not since… well, a very long time ago. My mother… she was a small woman. Very quiet. I think she… had a cough? But it was a long time ago. And my father… I barely remember him. He worked very hard, I think. But no, I don’t recall any… serious illnesses in the family. Not that I know of. It's all very hazy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s common for family medical history to be difficult to recall. We can certainly proceed without it for now. Let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… I used to smoke, a very long time ago. When I was younger. But I stopped, years ago. Doctor’s orders, I think. Or maybe it was just… too expensive. And no, I don't drink. Never really liked it. And… recreational drugs? Oh, no, absolutely not. I’m a very… simple man, you see. I just like to go to work, show people to their seats. That's all.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Krahn. And now, regarding any allergies you might have – are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. Maybe a little bit of dust sometimes? But that’s everyone, isn’t it? No, I’m pretty sure I don’t have any serious allergies. Is that important? Should I be worried about something?
DOCTOR: It’s good to rule those out, Mr. Krahn. We're just covering all the bases. And no, you shouldn't be worried. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills, you see. Makes me feel… strange. Just a bit of tea sometimes, when I’m cold. And maybe some vitamins, but my neighbor gave them to me and I’ve mostly forgotten about them. They’re probably expired anyway. Don’t worry about the vitamins. They’re probably useless.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications or supplements. That's good. Now, Mr. Krahn, to get a better understanding of your current health status, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. This will involve checking your blood pressure, heart rate, listening to your lungs, and a quick look at your reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… I suppose so. But please be gentle. I’m a bit… fragile, you see. And I don’t like surprises. And don’t poke me too much. Is it going to hurt? Perhaps we could just skip it? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Krahn. It's perfectly alright to feel anxious about a physical exam. I promise to be as gentle as possible, and I’ll explain everything before I do it. It won’t be painful, just a few quick checks to get a baseline assessment of your health. I'll explain each step as I go. It's important for the performance clearance, but we can certainly take it slow and stop at any time if you're uncomfortable. Shall we start with your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. But slowly, please. And explain everything. I don’t like being surprised. What does blood pressure even mean? Is it bad if it’s high? Just… be careful, okay? I’m a bit of a worrier, you see. And I don’t like the feeling of… things being squeezed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. We'll take it very slowly. Blood pressure measures the force of your blood against your artery walls. It's a vital sign that helps us understand how well your heart is working. A slightly elevated blood pressure can be a sign of something to monitor, but it doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem. We just need a baseline reading to start. I'm going to wrap this cuff around your arm, and it will inflate briefly to take the measurement. It will feel a bit tight, like a squeeze, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just relax your arm, and try to breathe normally. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright… but please hurry. The squeezing… it makes me nervous. And tell me what you’re doing as you go, okay? I need to know what’s happening. What does “normal” even feel like? Is it supposed to feel tight? Just… be quick about it, please. This is very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn, I’m just placing this cuff around your arm now. It’s inflating with air. You'll feel pressure around your arm, and it will feel like a squeeze – that’s perfectly normal. It will only last for about 30 seconds. “Normal” blood pressure is around 120 over 80, but everyone is a little different. We just need to see what your baseline is. Okay, all done. Your blood pressure is 145 over 90. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll want to monitor that. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Is that alright?
PATIENT: 145 over 90…? Is that bad? Monitoring…? What does that even mean? Will I need more squeezing? And now you want to listen to my insides? Oh dear. This is all very unsettling. I don’t think I like this very much. Can’t we just skip the listening part? Perhaps the manager will understand if my blood pressure is a bit high. I mostly just show people to their seats, you see. It's not a strenuous job.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Krahn. It’s perfectly alright to feel uneasy. 145 over 90 is a bit higher than we’d like, but it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. It could be due to temporary stress or anxiety, and we’ll need to confirm it with another reading later. Listening to your heart and lungs is a very quick and painless procedure. It helps us detect any unusual sounds that could indicate a problem. It doesn’t involve anything invasive, and it will only take a minute or two. We'll just place the stethoscope on your chest. However, if you're truly uncomfortable, we can skip that part for now. It's your decision. But it's important to know that having a complete assessment gives us the most accurate picture of your health. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment for another blood pressure reading and a more thorough examination if you prefer. What would you feel most comfortable with?
PATIENT: Oh… a follow-up appointment… Another squeezing incident? And more poking and listening? This is becoming quite stressful. Honestly, I think… I think I'd just like to skip it all. The manager said something about a waiver. Perhaps I can sign a waiver saying I'm mostly just a seat-usher and not responsible for anything strenuous. Is that possible? A waiver? Can we just fill out a waiver and be done with it? I'm a simple man, Doctor. I just want to go back to showing people to their seats.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, your comfort is my priority. If you're truly feeling overwhelmed and prefer to skip the physical exam, that is absolutely your right. I understand your desire to avoid further stress and your thought about a waiver. While I cannot provide a legal document like a waiver, I can certainly document your stated preference for declining the exam and your role as a seat-usher in your medical record. However, I must advise you that without a complete assessment, I cannot provide a full medical clearance. It would be your responsibility to inform the manager of this limitation and obtain any necessary information from him regarding the specific requirements for the performance clearance. Would you like me to document your decision and discuss a plan for communicating this to the manager?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Document it. Please document it. And… thank you. Thank you for understanding. A note saying I declined the exam and that I'm mostly a seat-usher… that sounds perfect. And… perhaps a note saying I'm a bit frail? Just in case the manager tries to make me lift heavy things. Yes. A note about the frailty would be wonderful. And… is there anything I need to sign? Just to say I understand I'm declining the exam? I’m happy to sign anything, just to be done with it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. I’m happy to document everything. I’ll note your declined physical exam, your role as a seat-usher, and your statement regarding your frailty. I’ll also include a statement confirming you understand the limitations of not having a complete medical assessment. Here is a form simply stating you declined the physical exam and understand the limitations. Please sign at the bottom to acknowledge your decision. Once you’ve signed that, we'll be finished. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh… thank goodness. “Decline of Physical Exam…” Yes, that sounds right. There. Done. No, thank you. I think… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you for being so understanding, Doctor. And for not making me squeeze too much. I think I’ll just go back to showing people to their seats now. That sounds much safer.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krahn. I’m glad we could come to a comfortable solution. Please remember to inform the manager about the limitations of this assessment, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you experience any changes in your health. I wish you all the best in your role, and I hope you enjoy showing people to their seats. If you ever need a medical consultation in the future, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Krahn.
