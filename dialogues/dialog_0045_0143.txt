DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. Yes, thank you. Well, it's a bit... complicated. I think I need to talk about... starting a family. Maybe. It's a long story, and I don’t remember everything so well these days. I just want to make sure things are… okay, you know? Before anything happens.
DOCTOR: Starting a family… at 66?
PATIENT: Yes. Well, I… it’s with someone new. A very nice lady. And we’ve been… talking. About it. It's just... I want to be sure I’m… healthy enough. And that everything would be alright for… the baby. If there is a baby. I don't have insurance, so I thought it's best to ask a doctor beforehand. It's probably a silly thing to worry about at my age, but…
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's get some information down. You said no insurance, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. No insurance. Never really needed it before. I suppose I should have gotten some, but… it always seemed so complicated. Now it feels important, maybe too late.
DOCTOR: Okay. Height and weight on file say 168 centimeters and 141 pounds. Is that current?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, I think so. Maybe a little bit less now, actually. I haven't been eating as much lately. But yes, around that, I suppose. It's been a while since I weighed myself properly. It’s hard to keep track of these things, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me about any medical conditions you have been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s… a good question. Let me think. I had something with my… blood pressure, a long time ago. But it was nothing serious, I think. And maybe some trouble with my back. Old age, you know? I don’t really go to the doctor much. I usually just… try to feel better on my own. I'm not sure what they told me, honestly. It was years ago.
DOCTOR: "Old age" isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Verrall. We need specifics. Do you recall when you were diagnosed with high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I truly don't. It was… a long, long time ago. Maybe… in my fifties? Or even earlier? It was before I retired, I think. I saw a doctor… locally. A small practice. I don't remember the name, or anything they said. They gave me some pills, I took them for a while, and then… I just stopped. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had… something on my knee, a long time ago. Just a small thing, really. Arthroscopy, I think they called it. To clean up some cartilage. And… maybe something with my eyes, when I was younger? A cataract, perhaps? It's all very hazy. I’m really not good at remembering these things. It feels like a lifetime ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's move on. Family history. Any significant medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. Well, my father… he had problems with his heart. A very bad heart. He died quite young, actually. And my mother… she had diabetes, I think. But it was a long time ago. And there were some cousins… with… something with their lungs? I don't remember exactly. We didn't talk about these things much in my family, you know? It wasn't really… encouraged.
DOCTOR: Right. So, heart disease, diabetes… anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... I believe my aunt on my mother’s side had... arthritis, very bad arthritis in her hands. She couldn't do much with them. And… I think a cousin had some kind of cancer, but I don't know what kind. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t speak often. I’m really sorry I can’t give you more details. My family is… spread out. And we don’t keep in touch much anymore. It’s hard to remember everything, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? Like… my hobbies? I used to enjoy gardening, but I don’t do that much anymore. It’s hard on my back. And… I like to read. I used to travel a lot, but… that was before. Is that what you mean? Do you want to know if I drink or smoke? Because I don’t, not anymore. I used to, a long time ago, but I quit. It wasn't good for me.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Verrall. I need to know if you are sexually active. And if so, what kind of precautions you take. It's relevant to the situation. Don't look at me like that. It's my job.
PATIENT: Oh… well. Yes. I am… seeing someone. And… yes, we are… intimate. Precautions? Well, we… try to be careful. We… talk about it. It's… new, you see. We haven't been together for very long. And… I haven't thought much about it, to be honest. It's been a long time since… I had to worry about these things. I suppose we should be using… something. But we haven't… gotten around to it yet. It all happened so quickly. Is that… okay? Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no current protection. Given your age, and your lack of recent medical history, this is… concerning. We’re going to need to do some blood work. A full panel. STD screening is absolutely necessary. And I’m going to recommend a consultation with an infectious disease specialist. It’s standard protocol. We need to rule out anything before proceeding. I will also need to order a lipid panel, a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. It's just to get a baseline. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… like a lot. Blood work? An infectious disease specialist? STD screening? I… I understand you're saying it's important. But… it sounds very serious. And expensive. I don't have insurance, you see. And… I'm not sure I even can afford all of that. Is it… absolutely necessary? Can't we just… talk about it some more? Perhaps there’s something else we can do? I feel a bit faint, to be honest. All of this is… a bit much to take in at once.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, you’re considering starting a family at 66. Without a comprehensive medical workup, you’re putting yourself and a potential child at risk. This isn’t optional. I can write a letter to the lab explaining your financial situation; perhaps they have a sliding scale. As for the specialist, I'll see if I can recommend someone who offers pro bono services. But the blood work is non-negotiable. It's a basic safety precaution. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood work… I suppose. If it's really necessary. And I appreciate you looking into financial assistance. Thank you. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to be allergic to pollen, I think, when I was younger. But that was a long time ago. I haven't had any problems with allergies in years. And… I'm a bit sensitive to… strong smells. But that's not really an allergy, is it? More of a… discomfort. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. I’m going to order the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall. They'll draw several vials. I’ll need you to fast for 12 hours beforehand. No food or drink, except water. And I'll write a referral for the infectious disease specialist. I’ll also print out a list of questions you should ask them. After the blood work results come back – and that will take a few days – we’ll discuss the next steps. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. Fast for 12 hours. Blood work. Specialist. Questions. It’s a lot to remember. Can I… can I get a copy of these instructions? Just so I don’t forget anything? And… can you tell me again the name of the lab? It's hard to keep track of everything when you're… my age. I'm sorry to be such a bother.
DOCTOR: Here. The lab is called Coastal Diagnostics, just down the hall, Room 203. The instructions are on this sheet. Coastal Diagnostics, Room 203. I’ll also have my nurse print out a list of the blood tests we’re ordering, and the questions for the specialist. Don’t worry about being a bother, Mr. Verrall. It's my job to make sure you're informed. Now, do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Well… actually, yes. One question. It’s a bit… personal. If… if everything is alright with the blood work, and the specialist says it's okay… what are the chances… at my age… that we could even… have a baby? I mean… is it even possible? It’s just… a little reassurance would be nice.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, the chances are… extremely low. The decline in sperm quality and quantity with age is significant. And the risks associated with pregnancy at your partner’s age, and the potential complications for the child, are substantially increased. It's not impossible, but it's highly improbable. And frankly, given your lack of recent medical history and your current health status, it's a significant undertaking with a very low likelihood of success. I will be honest with you, it would be far more prudent to consider other options. But, if you are determined to proceed, we will do what we can. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Other options… No. No, I think that’s all the questions I have. Thank you, Doctor. For your… honesty. I think I’ll… go get the blood work done now. .
