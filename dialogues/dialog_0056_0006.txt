DOCTOR: Hi Jeannemarie, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… well, I coughed up some blood. It scared me, so I thought it best to come get checked. It happened just yesterday.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is concerning, and you’re right to get it checked out. Just yesterday, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, yesterday. In the morning. It wasn’t… a lot, but enough to worry me. It was bright red. I hope that makes sense. I don’t know much about… these things.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Bright red blood is definitely something we need to investigate. Okay, let’s start with a bit more detail. Can you describe the cough itself?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It was… a normal cough at first, you know? Like when you have a little cold. Then… then the blood came with it. Not a lot of coughing before the blood, if that makes sense. Just… a few coughs, and then it was there. It didn't hurt, exactly. More… surprising.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it wasn’t preceded by a lot of forceful coughing. And no pain with the cough itself, just the shock of seeing the blood. Have you had any other symptoms – fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, weight loss, night sweats?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no chills. I haven’t felt short of breath. No chest pain either. I… I think I have lost a little weight, but I haven't been very hungry lately. It’s been… a difficult year. And no, no night sweats. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. Difficult year… okay. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, anything like that?
PATIENT: I… no, not really. When I was a little girl, I had a bad cold sometimes, but nothing… serious. My husband… he had high blood pressure, but that was all. I haven’t been sick for a very long time. Not until this, of course. He passed away last year. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to… to bring that up. It just feels… recent.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Jeannemarie. That must be incredibly difficult. No, it's good to share that. Okay, so no prior medical conditions for you. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. I… I don't like hospitals, if that makes sense. Only to visit my husband, when he… needed things checked. I’ve always been healthy, until now. I’m hoping it’s nothing serious. Is it… is it bad? I apologize for asking. I am a little anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to be anxious, and you're right to ask. I can't tell you definitively whether it's serious just yet – that's why we need to do a thorough check-up. No surgeries is good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything. Not even vitamins. My husband… he took pills for his blood pressure, but I never needed any medicine. I try to eat healthy, and… and get enough rest. I drink a lot of water. Is that… helpful? I’m not sure what information is useful. I apologize again.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and drinking plenty of water is helpful. You're not apologizing for anything! You're doing great. Okay, last few questions about your history. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten… everything. My husband always teased me about it. I've never had a reaction to anything. I don't have any trouble with pollen or animals, either. I've always been lucky, I think. Until now, of course. I hope… I hope it's not something terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No known allergies. Alright, Jeannemarie, it sounds like we have a good basic history. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs, check your heart, and feel your neck. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That is… alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Please, just… be gentle. My chest feels a little… sensitive. I’m a little worried it will hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. I need you to take a few deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Okay… your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some slight crackling in the lower part of your left lung. It's subtle, but it's there. Now, I'm just going to feel your neck for any swollen lymph nodes. No swelling that I can detect at this moment. And finally, let’s check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. Your oxygen level is 98%, which is good. But the crackling in your lung is what's concerning me. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes, that is… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I’ve never had one before. Will it… hurt? And will it take long? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I’m just… nervous. The crackling sounds… bad. Is it… pneumonia? Or something worse?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask questions, Jeannemarie. You're not bothering me at all. The X-ray itself doesn’t hurt at all. You’ll just stand or sit in front of a machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture of your chest. It won’t take long – maybe five to ten minutes total. As for what's causing the crackling… it could be pneumonia, yes, but it could also be a number of other things – bronchitis, a lingering cold, or even something less serious. The X-ray will help us see what’s going on inside your lungs and give us a better idea of what’s causing it. We need to rule things out before we jump to any conclusions. I'm going to get the order for the X-ray sent to the radiology department. They’re just down the hall. Once it’s done, they'll call us with the results. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild cough suppressant to help manage the cough. It won’t fix the underlying problem, but it should make you more comfortable. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A cough suppressant would be good. I’ve been coughing a little bit more this morning. And the X-ray… I understand. It’s best to know. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. I appreciate it. Is there anything… anything I should do before the X-ray? Or anything I should expect? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jeannemarie. And you're not a bother at all. As for the X-ray, there isn't much you need to do. Just remove any jewelry or metal objects around your neck or chest. You’ll likely be asked to change into a gown, but you don’t need to undress completely if you're not comfortable. The technician will explain everything to you before the scan. They’ll position you so you’re comfortable. They may ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds during the scan. It's really quick and simple. And no, you don't need to do anything special before or after. Just try to relax. I'll write that prescription for you now, and I'll also give you some written instructions about when and where to go for the X-ray. It’s important to get it done as soon as possible so we can figure out what’s going on. While I'm doing that, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that is… everything. You've answered all my questions, Doctor. Thank you so much for your kindness and patience. I feel a little bit better knowing what to expect. I will go for the X-ray as soon as possible. And I will let you know the results as soon as I have them. I appreciate everything you’ve done for me today.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jeannemarie. That’s good to hear. Here are the instructions and the prescription. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns at all. And please do let us know the results as soon as you have them. I'm going to make a note to follow up with you next week to discuss the X-ray results and decide on the next steps. Get well soon, Jeannemarie. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
