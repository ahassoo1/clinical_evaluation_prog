DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Kalinski. The pleasure is all mine. Oh, my… well, it’s this pain. Down low, in my abdomen. It’s been… troublesome. It comes and goes, you see, but when it is here, it’s quite severe. I believe my… condition makes it a bit more difficult to pinpoint. I have… something called SLE, you understand? It affects things. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, so details… escape me.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here in your chart that you have Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, or SLE. It’s quite common for abdominal pain to be a symptom, and as you mentioned, it can certainly make things more complex. Thank you for letting me know about the memory difficulties – we’ll take our time, and I’ll do my best to be thorough. Could you describe this pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Lupus. That’s right. It… feels like a deep ache, mostly. Not a sharp pain, usually. Though sometimes… sometimes it is sharp. It comes in waves, you see? And it’s hard to say what makes it worse, or better. I’ve noticed it’s… more frequent lately, perhaps. It keeps me up at night sometimes. It's just… unsettling. And I worry, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Glymph. Increased frequency of pain is certainly something we need to investigate. A deep ache with occasional sharp pains, coming in waves… That gives me a starting point. Now, when you say it's “more frequent lately,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a rough estimate… Let me see. It used to be… perhaps once a month, or even less. Just a brief discomfort. Now… now it's almost every other day. Sometimes even twice in one day. It’s… disruptive, to say the least. I don’t remember the last time I had a full night's sleep, truthfully. And I apologize, Doctor, if I ramble. It's just… difficult to keep track of everything these days.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize at all, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly understandable, and you're not rambling. The important thing is you're telling me what's going on. Almost every other day, with occasional occurrences twice in a day… That’s a significant change. Now, besides the change in frequency, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, my… other symptoms. Let me think… I do get rather tired, more so than usual. And I've been… losing my appetite, I suppose. Nothing dramatic, just… not feeling hungry. And… is it normal to feel a bit… bloated? Sometimes my stomach feels quite full, even when I haven't eaten much. I can’t recall if this happened before. Honestly, Doctor, it's all a bit of a blur. I just know I don't feel quite right.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, loss of appetite, and a feeling of bloating… Those are all symptoms we should consider. It’s helpful you’re describing these things, even if it’s difficult to recall specifics. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Oh… bowel habits. Goodness. Well… let me see. I… haven't been as regular, I suppose. Not… as predictable. Sometimes I feel a bit… constipated, and other times… well, the opposite. It’s rather embarrassing to talk about, truthfully. And I truly don’t remember if this is new, or simply part of… everything. My apologies, Doctor. It's a sensitive topic.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize, Ms. Glymph. These are important questions, and it’s crucial to have a complete picture. Changes in bowel habits are relevant, and you’re not at all embarrassing me. It's my job to ask these questions, and your honesty is very much appreciated. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my… fever, chills… I haven't been taking my temperature regularly, I’m afraid. But I do feel rather warm sometimes, especially at night. It could simply be the weather, of course. And as for weight loss… I haven't stepped on the scales in quite some time. My clothes feel a bit looser, perhaps, but I assumed that was just… aging. I really couldn’t say for certain, Doctor. Everything feels so… vague these days. It's rather frustrating, truthfully. I wish I had a better memory.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly reasonable to feel this way. The combination of feeling warm, potentially looser clothing, and the difficulty with recall… we’ll take all of this into consideration. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Besides your SLE, are you currently being treated for any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, my… medical history. Well, I have… arthritis, I believe. It’s in my hands, mostly. It’s been… manageable, with medication. And I had a… a heart issue, years ago. A minor thing, really. They gave me some pills, and I’ve been taking them ever since. I apologize, Doctor, if I'm rambling. I have a tendency to forget things. Perhaps I should have brought a list? I truly wish I were more organized. And my SLE… I see a rheumatologist, of course, but I haven't been there in a few months. It’s all a bit… overwhelming, truthfully.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. You’re not rambling at all. It’s helpful to have this information, even if it’s a bit fragmented. Arthritis in your hands, a past cardiac issue, and ongoing management with a rheumatologist for your SLE… That gives us a good starting point. Now, can you recall the names of the medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The names… they escape me, truthfully. I have a pill organizer, of course, but I don’t know what each pill is for. I simply take them as prescribed. There’s a… a small white one, and a larger blue one. And something for my arthritis… I think it’s pink, perhaps? I apologize, Doctor. I really should be more organized. It’s just… difficult to keep track of everything. I’m afraid I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. We can certainly review your medication list in your electronic health record. It’s not a problem at all. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see… I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a… a reaction to anything, that I recall. Though… I do get a bit itchy sometimes, after eating shellfish. But I assumed that was just… a sensitivity, not a true allergy. I truly don’t remember having a severe reaction to anything. It’s all a bit vague, Doctor. I apologize for being so unhelpful. It's just… difficult to recall everything accurately.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. It’s helpful to know that you haven’t experienced any severe allergic reactions, and the occasional itchiness after eating shellfish is good to note. Now, let's talk a bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, my… social history. Well, I used to smoke, years ago. But I gave it up, decades ago. A very long time ago. As for alcohol… I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Perhaps once or twice a week. And recreational drugs? Oh, goodness, no. Never. I'm a very… a very simple woman, Doctor. I prefer a quiet evening at home, with a good book.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Glymph. Past smoking, occasional wine with dinner, and no recreational drug use. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my… family history. Let me see… My mother had… arthritis, I believe. And my father… he had heart trouble, I think. It was a long time ago. He passed away when I was quite young. And… my sister had something… autoimmune, perhaps? I don't remember the details. It’s all rather hazy, Doctor. My family wasn’t very forthcoming about medical things, truthfully. We didn’t discuss it much. It’s all a bit vague. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. Arthritis, heart trouble, and potentially an autoimmune condition in your family… that’s helpful information. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. This will help me assess your condition further. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. A physical exam. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed. I'm ready when you are. Just… please be gentle. My arthritis can be… rather painful sometimes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Glymph. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, 88 beats per minute, and I can hear some normal heart sounds. Your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. I'm noticing some tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on your left side. It’s mild, but present. There are no masses that I can feel. Now, I’ll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I’ll take your temperature, blood pressure, and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your temperature is 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Okay, Ms. Glymph, that concludes the physical exam. Based on your history and the exam findings, the tenderness in your lower abdomen, combined with your report of increased pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, and bowel changes, warrants further investigation. I’d like to order some blood tests and a urine analysis to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Blood tests and a urine analysis. Whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed. I understand the need for further investigation. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. Is it possible this is simply a flare-up of the Lupus? Or something related to my arthritis? I worry, you understand. It’s just… difficult to feel certain about anything these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Glymph. It's certainly possible this is related to your Lupus or arthritis, and that's what we're trying to determine. The blood tests will help us assess your inflammation levels, kidney function, and rule out other potential causes. The urine analysis will help us look for any signs of infection or kidney problems. The tests I’m ordering include a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , an erythrocyte sedimentation rate , a C-reactive protein , a urinalysis, and a lupus serology panel. We'll also check your rheumatoid factor to assess for potential arthritis activity. I’ll send the orders to the lab now, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment for blood draw. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So many tests. CBC, CMP, ESR… It’s all rather overwhelming. Lupus serology panel… I remember my rheumatologist mentioning something similar. Rheumatoid factor… Yes, that sounds right. No, Doctor, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. I trust your expertise. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I simply… hope the results aren’t too alarming. And I appreciate your patience with my… forgetfulness. It's just… difficult to keep track of everything these days.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. It’s my pleasure to help. It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed – there’s a lot of information to take in. We’ll review the results together as soon as they become available, and I'll explain everything in detail. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or if you develop a fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any specific concerns or questions about your daily routine, like diet or activity, while we wait for the test results?
PATIENT: Oh, diet and activity… Well, I haven’t been eating much, as I mentioned. Perhaps I should try to force myself to eat something, even if I don’t feel hungry? And as for activity… I’ve been trying to take short walks, but I tire easily. I suppose I should avoid strenuous activity, then? And drink plenty of fluids? It's just… difficult to motivate myself sometimes. I feel so… fatigued. Is there anything specific I should avoid eating or drinking? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Ms. Glymph. While we wait for the test results, it's a good idea to focus on gentle self-care. Try to eat small, frequent meals, even if you don’t have a large appetite. Focus on easily digestible foods, like soups, broths, and fruits. Avoiding overly processed foods, sugary drinks, and caffeine is a good idea. Staying hydrated is very important, so aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. As for activity, listen to your body. Short, gentle walks are good, but don't push yourself. Rest when you need to, and avoid any strenuous activity that aggravates your pain or fatigue. It’s also important to avoid any foods that you know trigger inflammation, like red meat or excessive dairy. I will also provide you with a list of recommended foods and a guide to managing fatigue. We'll also discuss your current medications at our next appointment. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Small meals, gentle walks, staying hydrated… I can manage that. Avoiding red meat and dairy… I suppose I can do that as well. It’s just… difficult to change my habits, sometimes. But I will try. I appreciate your guidance. You’ve been very patient and understanding. I truly appreciate it. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect. When should I expect to hear back about the test results?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Glymph. Small steps can make a big difference. It's perfectly alright to take things at your own pace. The lab typically takes 2-3 business days to process the results. I will have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available, to schedule a follow-up appointment. We can then review the results together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or if you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude our consultation today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and patient. I truly appreciate your kindness and understanding. It’s difficult to feel certain about anything these days, but I feel a little more hopeful now, knowing that we’re taking steps to address the issue. Thank you again for your time and guidance. I look forward to hearing back about the test results. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns. It means a great deal to me. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. It was my pleasure to meet you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Have a good day.
