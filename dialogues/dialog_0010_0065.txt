DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Selbitschka. I'm Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s…well, it’s the weight. I’ve gained a considerable amount recently, and I haven't changed anything about my diet or exercise. It’s rather perplexing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Perplexing is a good word for it. And how long has this weight gain been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think precisely… It began, I believe, approximately six months ago. It was gradual at first, but now…well, it’s quite noticeable, even to me, and I notice everything. It’s been about three months of more rapid gain, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Alright. Six months overall, with a noticeable increase in the last three. And can you give me a rough estimate of how much weight you've gained during that entire six-month period?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let's see… I weighed myself in February, before it really started, and it was 70 kilograms. Now… now it’s 83. So, thirteen kilograms, give or take. It’s a bit embarrassing, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Thirteen kilograms, okay. That is a significant change. And besides the weight gain itself, have you noticed any other changes in your body or how you feel?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I have been feeling…more tired, generally. And colder, even when others are comfortable. Not sick-cold, just… a persistent chill. And I seem to be a bit more forgetful than usual, though I always had a good memory. It’s not drastic, but enough that my husband has mentioned it a couple of times.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue, feeling colder, and some increased forgetfulness. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing formally diagnosed, no. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. Just the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I haven't been hospitalized for anything, and I don't take any regular medications. My husband keeps urging me to take vitamins, but I never have. I always thought a good diet was sufficient.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior medical conditions, no hospitalizations, and no current medications. What about any surgeries or serious injuries you’ve had?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. And no serious injuries, thankfully. I had a sprained ankle once, many years ago, but that healed completely. Nothing requiring significant medical intervention. I’m usually very careful. I don’t like doctors’ offices, if I’m being honest. Which is, I suppose, why I waited so long to come in about this weight.
DOCTOR: Okay. No surgeries or major injuries. And I understand not liking doctor's offices; we appreciate you coming in today. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, thyroid problems, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, there are a few things. My mother had a thyroid problem, hypothyroidism, I believe. She took medication for it for many years. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had diabetes. Type 2, I think. He lost a foot to it, unfortunately. It’s a bit concerning, now that I think about it. I never really connected it to my own situation before.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypothyroidism in your mother and Type 2 diabetes in your grandfather. That’s helpful information. Now, briefly, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m married, and my husband and I live on a small farm. We grow most of our own vegetables. I do a fair amount of work outside – gardening, tending to the chickens, light chores. It's not strenuous, but it keeps me moving. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I don’t have any particularly stressful hobbies, if that's what you mean. Mostly reading and knitting.
DOCTOR: Alright, a generally active lifestyle, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no significant stressors. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. Not to any medications, foods, or anything environmental. I can eat anything, thankfully. My husband jokes I have a cast-iron stomach. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. Is that everything, Doctor? I do have an appointment this afternoon, and I'd like to be finished if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. No allergies. Good. That’s a fairly complete picture. Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. Given your symptoms – the unexplained weight gain, fatigue, feeling cold, forgetfulness – and your family history of hypothyroidism and diabetes, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. I trust your judgment. Blood tests and an exam… certainly. Whatever you deem necessary. Please, proceed. I want to get to the bottom of this, and quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with a quick check of your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick palpation of your thyroid. After that, we’ll get the bloodwork ordered. It’ll just be a standard panel, looking at your thyroid function, glucose levels, and a few other things.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. Lead the way. I am ready whenever you are. I do hope it doesn't take too long, but I understand you must be thorough.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/85. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 97.8 Fahrenheit. A bit on the lower side, but not concerning. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules. It's also a little tender to the touch. That, along with your symptoms, strengthens my suspicion of a thyroid issue. I'm going to order a TSH, Free T4, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. I'd also like to add a lipid panel, just to get a full picture. Do you have any concerns about the blood draw?
PATIENT: No concerns about the blood draw, Doctor. I dislike needles, naturally, but I manage. I am simply grateful we are getting closer to an answer. I hope it is something manageable, whatever it may be. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the test? Fasting, perhaps? Or are there any restrictions I need to be aware of? I prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Good question. Yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours prior to the blood draw. That means no food or drinks, except for water. That will ensure accurate results for the metabolic panel and lipid panel. The lab will likely schedule you for first thing tomorrow morning. I will send the requisition to the lab, and they will contact you directly to confirm the appointment time. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, try not to worry. We'll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all very clear. Fasting for twelve hours. The lab will contact me. I truly appreciate your thoroughness and your…compassionate manner. It makes a great deal of difference. I believe that will be everything for today. Thank you again for seeing me, and for expediting the process. I shall await the lab’s call.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Selbitschka. You're very welcome. It was my pleasure. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. We’re here to help. Have a good afternoon, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Annesley. You as well. Goodbye.
