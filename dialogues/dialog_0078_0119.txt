DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Solero. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. But I suppose that’s what doctors are for. It’s about… a problem my son is having. He’s not with me today, mind you. He’s a bit ashamed. But he asked me to come and inquire on his behalf. It’s… a discharge. A rather unpleasant one, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright, Jinnie. These things can be uncomfortable to discuss, and I appreciate you coming in for him. It's good he has you to advocate for him. So, this discharge… can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… not normal, naturally. It’s… yellowish, I believe. And there’s a bit of… odor. Not terribly strong, but noticeable. He noticed it a few days ago. He’s a respectable young man, you understand. Works hard. Doesn’t go gallivanting about, if you catch my drift. It’s just… worrying. He’s never had anything like this before. And he’s terribly concerned it might be… something awful. I tried to explain to him it’s probably nothing, but he insisted I come. He's a bit of a hypochondriac, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good he's taking it seriously. It's always best to get things checked out, even if it turns out to be nothing serious. “Something awful” is often not the case, but we want to rule things out. To help me understand, could you tell me a little bit more about where he's experiencing this discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, Doctor, it’s… rather delicate, isn’t it? It’s… coming from down there. From his… private parts. Honestly, it’s quite distressing to even think about. He’s a modest boy, and I’m not one to pry. But I suppose you need to know, don’t you? It’s… from the end of his… well, you understand. I’m not very good at this sort of thing. Is it terribly obvious what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, Jinnie, I understand perfectly. Thank you for being so open with me; it helps me to help him. So, it's a discharge from the urethra – that’s the opening where he urinates. And you mentioned it's yellowish with a bit of odor. Has he noticed any pain or burning when he urinates?
PATIENT: Urethra, you say? Yes, that sounds right. Oh, let me think… pain, you ask? He didn’t specifically mention pain. He did say it stung a little when he went to the bathroom, especially at first. But he’s not one to complain, you see. He’s a stoic young man. He gritted his teeth and carried on. It wasn’t a terrible stinging, he assured me. More of an… inconvenience, really. And he seemed a bit… embarrassed to even mention it, if I’m being honest. He kept saying it was probably just something he ate. Young people and their diets these days...
DOCTOR: Alright, stinging, especially at the beginning of urination. And he thought it might be diet-related. Has he had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. Fever… no, not that I’m aware of. He’s been himself, thankfully. No chills, either. And lower abdominal pain… I haven’t asked him about that specifically. He hasn't complained of any pain, if that's what you mean. He’s quite active, always busy with something. He's a carpenter, you see. So he’s always using his body. A bit sore at the end of the day, naturally, but nothing unusual. I suppose if it was terribly painful, he would have mentioned it, wouldn’t he? He’s a sensible boy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know. No fever, chills, or abdominal pain. Now, has he had any recent changes in sexual activity?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, Doctor… that’s a rather… personal question, isn’t it? I… I hardly think that’s relevant. He’s a respectable young man! I assure you, he wouldn’t be… gallivanting about. He’s saving himself for the right woman. I don’t think it’s appropriate to inquire about such things. Really, I do not approve of such impertinent questions. It’s… shocking, frankly.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Jinnie. I apologize. That was inappropriate of me to ask, and I shouldn’t have. Please disregard that question. My apologies for making you uncomfortable. Let’s go back to his medical history, then. Has he had any urinary tract infections or sexually transmitted infections in the past?
PATIENT: Well, no. Not that I’m aware of. He's always been a healthy boy, thankfully. He’s never been one for… doctors, if you catch my drift. He avoids them whenever possible. So I don’t believe he’s ever had anything like that. He’s always been very careful. He keeps himself clean, you know. And he’s not one to… indulge in risky behavior, if you understand. He's a good boy, I keep telling you. I’d know, wouldn’t I? I raised him myself. Though, he does work with a lot of… rough sorts, being a carpenter. But I’m sure they all behave themselves. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior history of UTIs or STIs. He’s generally healthy and avoids doctors. And he works with a lot of people in his trade. Now, could you tell me about any medications he’s currently taking, or has taken recently?
PATIENT: Well, no. He doesn't take any regular medications. He's a strong, healthy young man, you see. He believes in hard work and fresh air, not pills and potions. He might take something for a headache now and then – a bit of aspirin, perhaps – but nothing regularly. And he hasn’t taken anything recently, not that I know of. He’s very independent, you see. He doesn't bother me with every little ache and pain. He just grins and bears it. Really, he's a remarkable young man. I’m very proud of him. Though, he does occasionally use some sort of liniment for his muscles, being a carpenter and all. But it’s just a herbal remedy, nothing fancy. From Old Man Hemlock down the road. He swears by it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, occasional aspirin for headaches, and a herbal liniment from Old Man Hemlock. Now, does he have any allergies to any medications or anything else – food, plants, insect stings, anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. He doesn’t seem to have any major allergies. He’s never had a reaction to anything that I’m aware of. He occasionally gets a bit of a rash when he’s been out in the garden, but that’s probably just poison ivy or something. He doesn’t seem particularly sensitive to food, either. He eats whatever I put in front of him, thankfully. He’s not a fussy eater. Though, he did have a bit of a reaction to a bee sting when he was a boy. His arm swelled up a bit, but it went away on its own. Old Man Hemlock gave him some poultice, and it cleared right up. He's a practical boy, you see. Doesn't bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. Really, he's very resilient. I can’t think of anything else, honestly. He's a very healthy young man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jinnie, thank you for providing all of that information. It's very helpful. Based on what you've told me—the yellowish discharge, the stinging sensation, and the lack of fever, chills, or other significant symptoms—it could be a number of things. It's possible it's a simple urinary tract infection, but without a sample, it's difficult to say for sure. Given his occupation and the possibility of exposure, we also need to consider the possibility of a sexually transmitted infection, although you've assured me of his responsible behavior. To get a clearer picture, I recommend we collect a urine sample to test for infection and other potential causes. Would he be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I suppose if you insist. He's not going to be thrilled, I can tell you that much. He hates going to the doctor, as I’ve mentioned. But if it’s necessary… I suppose he’ll cooperate. He doesn’t want to be unwell, naturally. Though, he'll likely grumble about it for days. He’s a bit of a drama queen, if I’m being honest. But he’s a good boy at heart. So he’ll do what needs to be done. How… how does one go about collecting this sample? Is it terribly difficult? I’ve never had to do anything like this before. And I’m sure he’ll want to know what exactly you’re looking for. He’s a practical boy, you see. He likes to understand things.
DOCTOR: It's not difficult at all, Jinnie. I’ll have the nurse explain the process. Essentially, he’ll need to clean the area and then provide a mid-stream urine sample – that just means he starts urinating, then collects the sample mid-way through. We’ll give him instructions on how to do it properly to ensure an accurate result. The lab will test for bacteria, inflammation, and other indicators of infection, as well as screen for common sexually transmitted infections. I'll also want to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything else. It’ll be a simple examination of his abdomen and a check of his vital signs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Oh, goodness. Well, Doctor, I… I hadn't expected that. He's a modest young man, you see. Very private. I don’t know if he’d be comfortable with that. Perhaps… perhaps the urine sample is sufficient? He’s a healthy boy, as I’ve said repeatedly. I’m sure it’s nothing serious. Really, I think you’re going a bit overboard. He’s just having a bit of… discomfort. Perhaps a bit of rest and a healthy diet is all he needs. I don’t want him to be… embarrassed. Or… or feel as though he’s being… scrutinized. He’s a good boy, Doctor. A very good boy. I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. Perhaps we can skip the… the examination? Just the urine sample, please?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jinnie, and I respect his privacy. We can certainly proceed with just the urine sample, if that’s what you and he prefer. However, it's important to know that a physical exam can sometimes provide valuable information that a urine sample alone cannot. It allows me to check for any tenderness or abnormalities that might indicate a more serious issue. Without the exam, it will be more difficult to make an accurate diagnosis and ensure he receives the appropriate treatment. But ultimately, the decision is yours. If you both prefer to start with just the urine sample, we can do that. However, I would strongly recommend that he consider coming back for a follow-up exam if the symptoms don’t improve. I'll have the nurse bring in the collection cup and instructions. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… please be gentle with him, Doctor. He’s a bit… sensitive. And try not to make him feel embarrassed. He's a good boy, and he’s only doing this because I asked him to. Honestly, I feel terrible putting him through this. But I worry, you see. A mother worries. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your understanding. And please, just… the urine sample. For now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. We will absolutely be gentle and respectful. His comfort is our top priority. I'll ensure the nurse is aware of your concerns. Alright. I'll have her bring in everything she needs. If you have any questions after the sample collection, please don’t hesitate to ask. Thank you for coming in today. I hope he feels better soon. .
