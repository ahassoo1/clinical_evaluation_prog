DOCTOR: Hi Lawton, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time for this. It's… my stomach. It's been puffy. Bloated. It’s annoying, alright? Just… feels full all the time. Honestly, I don't know why I'm even here. My wife used to handle all this doctor stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's perfectly alright if you're not used to explaining things in detail – we'll get through this together. “Puffy and bloated” and feeling full all the time… that definitely sounds annoying. Just to get a better idea, when did you first start noticing this bloating?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? No idea. Weeks, maybe? Months? It all kinda blends together, you know? It’s not like it came on suddenly. It just… is. I eat, I feel full. I don't eat, I still feel kinda full. It's ridiculous. Look, is this going to take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no sudden onset, just a gradual feeling of fullness… that’s helpful to know. And I appreciate you letting me know you’re short on time, I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. To help me narrow things down, can you tell me a little about what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: What do I eat? What don't I eat? I work construction, alright? Pile driving. It’s not exactly a health food buffet. Burgers, sandwiches, whatever's quick. Sometimes my brother brings me leftovers, Somali food, but… honestly, I don’t even remember what. Rice, meat, spices… I dunno. It’s food. I eat it. Does it really matter?
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, and I appreciate you being honest with me. Knowing what a typical day looks like helps me get a clearer picture. It sounds like a pretty varied diet. Okay, and have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I’m tired, obviously. I’m a pile driver operator. It’s a tiring job. I get aches and pains, that’s for sure. But… is that what you mean? I haven’t been… throwing up or anything. No… problems down there, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… generally uncomfortable. And the puffiness. That’s the main thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no vomiting, no changes in bowel habits, just general discomfort and the bloating. Tiredness and aches and pains, understandable with your line of work. Alright. Have you experienced any weight loss recently, or have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I’m probably carrying a bit extra. Look, I eat when I can. Sometimes I don't have much of an appetite, alright? But that’s usually when it’s sweltering hot out there. It’s hard to eat when you’re sweating buckets. But I haven’t been… deliberately losing weight. Just… normal stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, no intentional weight loss. That’s good to know. Alright, Lawton, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. I really don't have all day. And don't poke too hard, alright? This back isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm just checking for tenderness or anything that feels off. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds. There's a little bit of tenderness when I press here on your lower left side, but nothing major. It doesn’t seem particularly distended. Do you normally feel pain in that area?
PATIENT: Sometimes. It’s… hard to explain. It’s just a dull ache. I figured it was my back acting up again. Or maybe it’s from lifting things all day. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to it unless it gets really bad. It comes and goes. Is this going to require tests or something? Because I really don't have the time for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that comes and goes. I understand you're concerned about time, and I'll definitely keep that in mind. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it could be a few things. Sometimes bloating and discomfort like this can be caused by something as simple as dietary habits or even stress. But because you’ve had some tenderness in your lower left side, I do think it’s worth doing a couple of basic tests just to rule out anything more serious. Would you be okay with getting a blood test and a stool sample?
PATIENT: A blood test and a stool sample? Seriously? Look, I barely have time to sleep, let alone go collecting… things. Can't you just… give me something for the puffiness? Something to make it stop? I don't need a whole investigation.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lawton. I really do. And I wish I could just give you something to make it go away immediately. But it's important to be thorough, especially when we're talking about abdominal discomfort. We want to make sure we're not missing anything. The blood test will help us look for signs of inflammation or infection. The stool sample can help us rule out any issues with your digestive system. I'm not trying to make things difficult for you. I just want to make sure you're healthy and get to the bottom of this. It will only take a few minutes to collect the sample, and the blood test is fairly straightforward. If everything comes back normal, then we can explore other options like dietary changes. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, alright. Just… get it over with. But if it's a long process, I'm warning you now, I’m not coming back. And I want a clear explanation of everything. No medical jargon, alright? Just… plain English.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Plain English, I promise. And I’ll make sure we keep things as quick and efficient as possible. Okay, I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood. She’ll also give you the instructions and the kit for the stool sample. It’s pretty straightforward, and you can do it at home. In the meantime, let’s talk a little bit about what might be causing your discomfort. Have you noticed any specific foods that seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Specific foods? No. Like I said, I eat whatever’s around. Burgers, rice, leftovers… sometimes it feels bad after, sometimes it doesn’t. It's random. Honestly, I don't pay that much attention to it. I'm a pile driver, alright? I need to eat to get through the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, random, no specific triggers. I understand. It sounds like it's been difficult to pinpoint anything. Well, let’s start with the tests. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. I’ll also give you some general advice on diet and lifestyle, just in case it helps. Is there anything else you want to tell me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No. Just… hurry up. I got things to do. And like I said, plain English. I don't want to be here all day trying to understand what you're talking about.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Plain English, and as quick as possible. Okay. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. Thanks for coming in, Lawton. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
