DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here about getting surgery, I think? For… losing weight. My wife helped me set this up. Honestly, I don’t remember all the details. It’s… bariatric surgery, right? Something like that. I just know I need to get healthier.
DOCTOR: Okay, bariatric surgery. That's perfectly alright. It’s common to feel a little overwhelmed with information. No need to worry about remembering everything at once. We can go through it together. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your weight history?
PATIENT: My weight history… That's a tough one. I’ve… always been bigger, I guess. As a kid, maybe? And then… it’s just kind of gone up over the years. I really don't have exact numbers. It’s been a slow thing, not like a sudden change. I used to be able to… well, I don’t even remember what I used to weigh. Sorry. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It's very common for patients to not have exact numbers. It sounds like this has been a gradual process. Knowing it's been a long-term issue is helpful. Do you have any idea what your current weight is, or approximately when you noticed it becoming a concern for your health?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think my wife said around 260? Maybe 270. I weighed myself a while back, but I really don't keep track. It started being a concern… honestly, probably the last couple of years. Just getting tired easier, and my knees started hurting. My wife really pushed me to do something about it. She's worried about me.
DOCTOR: Okay, around 260-270 pounds. And the fatigue and knee pain started a couple of years ago. It’s good that your wife is supporting you in this. That makes a big difference. Before we discuss surgery options, I’d like to get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Let's see… High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me a couple of years ago. I take… a pill for it. A little white one. I can't remember the name, though. And… I think cholesterol was a little high last time I had bloodwork, but I don’t really remember. My wife handles most of that stuff. I go to the appointments, but… I’m not the best at remembering details.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and slightly elevated cholesterol in the past. That's good information. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure, or perhaps where you usually get your prescriptions filled?
PATIENT: Um… No, I really don't. I go to the pharmacy down the street, near the grocery store. The one on Elm Street. They know me there, so they probably have it on file. I just tell them my name and they give me the pills. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. We can certainly get that information from the pharmacy. No need to apologize at all. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or obesity?
PATIENT: My dad… he had heart problems. I think he had a heart attack when he was older. And… my mom, she was bigger too, I guess. Not like seriously sick, but… overweight. And my brother, he struggles with his weight as well. That’s about all I can remember. It’s… not a very healthy family, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture, Mr. Kochubey. A family history of heart disease and a tendency towards weight gain. It’s good to be aware of those factors. Before we move on, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pill, I think. Oh! Wait. Sometimes I take something for… heartburn. When I eat spicy food. It’s just an over-the-counter thing, though. Like, Tums or something like that. I don’t take it very often. And… sometimes ibuprofen for my knees, when they really bother me. But that’s only when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication, occasional Tums for heartburn, and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. That’s helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Nothing I’m aware of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. My wife sometimes jokes I have a cast iron stomach. But… no, I don't have any known allergies. Unless… cats? I sneeze a little when I’m around cats. But that’s just a mild sneeze, not like a serious allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug or food allergies, and a mild sensitivity to cats. That's good information. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a beer every few months with my wife. Just… on special occasions. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested in that sort of thing. I used to be more active, but… not so much anymore. Mostly just sitting around, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drug use. You used to be more active, but currently lead a less active lifestyle. Before we discuss surgical options, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll start with your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which is not surprising given your history. Your pulse is within the normal range. Your temperature is normal. Now, if you don’t mind, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Your heart sounds are normal. Your lungs sound a little quiet, but I don’t hear any concerning noises. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Your abdomen is soft and doesn’t appear to be tender. Overall, your physical exam is relatively normal, but your slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished breath sounds warrant further investigation. We may need to run some bloodwork and possibly a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your health.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… thorough. Diminished breath sounds? Is that bad? And more tests… I guess that’s okay, if it helps. I just… I’m not a fan of needles. But I want to get this weight off, so I’ll do what I need to do. Is the weight loss surgery… a good option for me, Doctor? Do you think it will work?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Kochubey. Diminished breath sounds simply mean the air flow in your lungs is a little quieter than expected, which can sometimes be related to weight, but it’s important to rule out other causes with a chest X-ray. As for whether weight loss surgery is a good option for you… that’s a complex question. Based on your current weight, your history of high blood pressure, and your family history, you may be a candidate. However, it's not a decision to be taken lightly. It requires a significant lifestyle change, commitment to a specific diet, and potential risks associated with any surgery. Before we proceed, I want to discuss the different types of bariatric surgery available, the potential benefits and risks of each, and what you can expect before, during, and after the procedure. We'll also need to evaluate your overall health with the bloodwork and chest X-ray to ensure you're a suitable candidate. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… a lot. But yes, that sounds good. I mean, I want to understand everything. The different types… the risks… I just… I'm a little scared, to be honest. I've never had surgery before. But I really want to be healthier. For my wife, and… for myself. So, let's talk about the types, I guess. Which one is… the least risky? And what would I have to do differently after the surgery?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel scared, Mr. Kochubey. Surgery is a big decision, and it's good that you're asking questions. We’ll go through everything at your pace. There are a few main types of bariatric surgery. The most common is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This involves creating a smaller stomach pouch and rerouting a portion of your small intestine. It’s very effective for weight loss, but it’s also more complex and has a higher risk of complications. Another option is sleeve gastrectomy, where we remove a large portion of your stomach, leaving a smaller, tube-shaped stomach. It’s less complex than gastric bypass, but it’s still a significant surgery. Finally, there’s adjustable gastric banding, which involves placing a band around the upper part of your stomach to restrict food intake. It’s the least invasive option, but it’s also the least effective for long-term weight loss and requires frequent adjustments. Generally, adjustable gastric banding is considered the least risky in terms of immediate surgical complications. However, it has a higher rate of long-term complications and requires a lifelong commitment to adjustments and dietary restrictions. Sleeve gastrectomy is a good middle ground, offering good weight loss with a reasonable risk profile. After any type of bariatric surgery, you’ll need to make significant changes to your diet and lifestyle. This includes eating smaller, more frequent meals, avoiding sugary drinks and processed foods, and getting regular exercise. You’ll also need to take vitamin and mineral supplements for the rest of your life. We have a dedicated dietitian who will work with you to develop a personalized plan. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Smaller meals… no sugar… vitamins… It sounds… hard. Adjustable gastric banding sounds… easier, maybe? Because it's less risky? But you said it doesn’t work as well? I just… I don’t want to go through all this and then not lose the weight. That would be… defeating. What happens if… if I can’t stick to the diet? Or if I get sick? Will the surgery be reversed?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Kochubey. It's important to consider all the possibilities. You're right to ask about the diet and potential complications. Adjustable gastric banding is less risky surgically, but it does have a lower success rate and requires more frequent follow-up appointments for adjustments. Many patients don't achieve significant long-term weight loss with banding alone. It’s also more prone to complications like band slippage or erosion. Regarding sticking to the diet, it is challenging. We have a support group and a dedicated team to help you with meal planning, exercise, and emotional support. But ultimately, success depends on your commitment. As for what happens if you can’t stick to the diet, the weight loss will likely plateau or even reverse. And if you get sick, it’s important to follow our post-operative instructions carefully and seek medical attention promptly. Regarding reversal… gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy are generally not easily reversible. While it's technically possible in some cases, it's a complex procedure with a high risk of complications. Adjustable gastric banding can be removed if necessary, but it won’t necessarily restore your stomach to its original size. Before we make any decisions, I’d like to order some bloodwork and a chest X-ray. This will help us assess your overall health and determine if you’re a suitable candidate for surgery. We'll also need to schedule a consultation with our dietitian to discuss the dietary changes in more detail. Does that sound like a good next step?
PATIENT: Okay… bloodwork and a chest X-ray. And the dietitian. Yes, that sounds… okay. I guess I don’t have a choice, if I want to even be considered. I just… I’m still nervous. But I want to do this. For my wife, and for me. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. It’s… a lot to take in, but I appreciate you being patient with me. So, where do we start with the bloodwork? And… is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It is a lot to take in, and you're doing a great job asking questions and expressing your concerns. Let’s start with the bloodwork. I’ll give you a lab requisition form. You can go to any lab that accepts our insurance – or, since you mentioned not being insured, you can ask for a self-pay price. The lab will draw a sample of your blood to check your overall health, including your blood sugar, cholesterol, kidney function, and liver function. For the chest X-ray, you can schedule an appointment at the imaging center across the street. They’ll take a picture of your lungs to rule out any underlying conditions. As for preparation, for the bloodwork, it’s best to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. For the chest X-ray, you don't need any special preparation. Just wear comfortable clothing. I’ll also have my nurse give you some informational pamphlets about bariatric surgery and dietary changes. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine if you’re a suitable candidate for surgery. We'll also schedule that appointment with our dietitian. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Fast for 8-12 hours for the bloodwork. No preparation for the X-ray. And pamphlets. I guess I’ll go get the bloodwork done tomorrow then. And schedule the X-ray. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel… a little less overwhelmed now. I’ll see you when we have the results.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Kochubey. That’s a great plan. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. My nurse and I are here to help. We’ll look forward to seeing you again soon. Take care, and have a good day.
