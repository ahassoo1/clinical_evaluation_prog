DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… my eyes are dry. Real dry. Been that way a while now, I guess. Don't feel much when I blink.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Dry eyes that don’t feel relieved with blinking. That can be quite uncomfortable. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when this dryness started?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it start… that's a tough one. Maybe… six months ago? No, longer. A year maybe? I mostly work outside, you see. Cement work. Lots of dust. Could be that. I don't really remember when it started, just that it got worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been gradually worsening over the past year, and you suspect it might be related to your work with cement and dust. That’s very helpful information. Besides the dryness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes… blurry vision. Not all the time. Mostly when I’m tired. And… it feels gritty. Like sand in my eyes, sometimes. It makes me want to rub ‘em, but I know I shouldn't.
DOCTOR: Yes, blurry vision and a gritty sensation – those are common symptoms with dry eyes. And you're right to avoid rubbing them. Now, have you noticed any redness, discharge, or pain in your eyes?
PATIENT: Redness… not really. No discharge that I've noticed. And no pain, no. Just… uncomfortable. Real uncomfortable when I’m workin’. Makes it hard to see straight sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no redness, discharge, or pain, just discomfort that’s worse with work. That helps narrow things down. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Old age is about all I got. Never been to the doctor much, to be honest. Just aches and pains, you know? Normal stuff for a man my age. Never had anything… serious.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, generally good health aside from the typical aches and pains of aging. Have you ever had any eye injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never had any trouble with my eyes 'til this started. No injuries, no surgeries. I always figured my eyes were okay. Used to see pretty good, even.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Don’t take nothin'. Just… water when I’m thirsty. And maybe a little coffee in the mornings, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. Do you have any allergies to anything that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Sometimes I get a little sniffly in the spring, but I figured that was just the flowers. Never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, can you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… my mother, she had… well, she had old age problems. My father, he worked in the fishing boats, got some bad arthritis in his hands. Nobody had trouble with their eyes, not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no significant family history of eye problems. Let's talk a little bit about your work environment. You mentioned cement work. Could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Well, I’m out in the dust all day. Mixin’ cement, pourin’ concrete, smoothin’ it out. Lots of wind, lots of sun. I try to wear sunglasses, but sometimes I forget. It’s hot work. And dusty. Real dusty.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail. The dust and sun exposure are certainly contributing factors. Now, I’d like to do a quick eye exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your vision, look at the surface of your eyes, and assess your tear production. It won’t be painful, just a few simple tests. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Alright, sounds… alright. Just get it over with, eh? I got things to do. Not lookin' forward to it, but if you gotta, you gotta.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's start with your vision. Could you read the smallest line you can on this chart?
PATIENT: Umm… E… F… P… Z… That one’s blurry… H… K… Uh… looks like a C… I can’t make out the rest. They're awful small. My eyes aren't what they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That's helpful. Now, let me take a look at the surface of your eyes with this instrument. I'm just going to shine a light in your eyes. Please look straight ahead. I notice some mild dryness and a little bit of superficial punctate staining on both corneas. That’s consistent with dry eye disease. Now, let's check your tear production. I’ll put a small strip of paper under your lower eyelid and measure how much it gets wet. Just relax and blink normally for a few minutes. The tear production is a little low, which supports the diagnosis of dry eye disease.
PATIENT: So, what does that mean? Is it serious? I need to get back to work, you know. Can't be sittin' around all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pipolo. It means you have dry eye disease, which is very common, especially with age and exposure to dust and wind like you experience with your work. It's generally not serious in the sense that it won’t cause blindness, but it can be very uncomfortable and affect your daily life. Essentially, your eyes aren’t producing enough tears, or the tears aren’t the right quality to keep your eyes properly lubricated. Fortunately, there are several things we can do to manage it. The goal is to relieve your symptoms and prevent further irritation. Would you like me to explain the different treatment options?
PATIENT: Alright… treatment options. Sounds good. Better than sittin’ around doin’ nothin’. Just… keep it quick, eh? And no fancy words, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no fancy words. The main treatment options are artificial tears – these are eye drops you use throughout the day to lubricate your eyes. There are many different brands available, some are thicker than others. We can start with a basic one and see how that works. Another option is an ointment you use at night to keep your eyes lubricated while you sleep. If those aren't enough, we can talk about prescription eye drops that help your eyes produce more tears. Finally, it's really important to protect your eyes from the dust and wind. Wearing wraparound sunglasses, even on cloudy days, can make a big difference. And taking breaks throughout the day to rest your eyes can also help. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Eye drops… ointment… sunglasses… I can do that. The drops sound easiest. What kind should I get? And… how often do I use ‘em? I don’t wanna be wastin’ time all day puttin’ drops in my eyes.
DOCTOR: I recommend starting with a preservative-free artificial tear, like Systane Ultra or Refresh Relieva. The preservative-free ones are generally gentler on the eyes, especially if you need to use them frequently. As for how often, start with one to two drops in each eye four times a day. If your eyes still feel dry, you can increase that to as often as every hour. It really depends on how uncomfortable you are feeling. There's no need to worry about using them "too much" - the goal is to keep your eyes comfortable. We can start with that, and if it’s not enough, we can explore other options. Would you like me to write you a prescription for one, or would you prefer to try an over-the-counter brand first?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter first, I think. Don't wanna bother with prescriptions if I don’t need ‘em. Easier that way. And… is there anything else I should be doin’? Anything I can rub on my eyes or something? I used to put a little warm water on ‘em sometimes, helped a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, over-the-counter is perfectly fine. A good starting point. As for other things, warm compresses can be very helpful. A warm, damp washcloth placed over your closed eyes for 5-10 minutes can help stimulate tear production and relieve discomfort. You were right to try the warm water - that's a good instinct. Avoid rubbing your eyes vigorously, as that can worsen irritation. There are also some eyelid wipes available that can help clean the eyelids and remove debris. However, please avoid any herbal remedies or “eye drops” that aren’t specifically approved for dry eye disease, as they may contain ingredients that can worsen your condition. I'm going to give you a handout with information about dry eye disease and some of the treatment options we discussed. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Handout sounds good. No, I think that's it. Just gettin' old, I guess. Thanks for your help, Doctor. I'll try the drops and the warm water. Hopefully, that’ll do the trick.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pipolo. It's not just about getting old – your work environment is definitely a contributing factor, and we can manage that. I'll have the nurse give you the handout and a sample of Systane Ultra to try. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week or two, or if they worsen at any time, please schedule a follow-up appointment. We can then discuss other options, such as prescription eye drops. Take care of yourself, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day.
