DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta Hatchard, 73 years old. Good. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. Like, really black. And I take those pills, you know, for my aches and pains. The red ones. Been taking ‘em for years. Doctor said it was fine, but now this is happening. It's probably those pills, right? It has to be. Don't tell me I need some fancy test.
DOCTOR: Black stool… yes, alright. You’re taking red pills for aches and pains… years, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, years! Since… oh, goodness, since before my granddaughter got married the first time. A long time. They help with my back, mostly. And my knees. Don't get me started on my knees. But now this… it's unsettling. Is it serious? Because I don't have time for serious. I've got canning to do.
DOCTOR: Canning is important, yes. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Just to be clear, the stool is consistently black?
PATIENT: Consistently? Well, it started a couple of days ago. I noticed it after my Tuesday bridge game. I thought it was maybe something I ate, you know? Beet juice or something. But then it was black again this morning. Not just a little dark, black. Like… tar. Is that bad? Don’t beat around the bush, Doctor. Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: "Tar-like" is… concerning. It could be the medication, of course. Many things can cause changes in stool color. But black, tarry stool is often a sign of bleeding in the upper digestive tract. Now, don't panic. It doesn't necessarily mean anything drastic, but we need to investigate. Have you noticed any weakness, fatigue, or dizziness lately?
PATIENT: Weakness? Oh, I’m always a little weak, Doctor. I’m 73! Fatigue, certainly. Canning is hard work, you know. Dizzy? Sometimes, when I stand up too fast. But that’s just my blood pressure, probably. Honestly, I just want to know if I need to stop taking those pills. They’re the only thing that lets me keep up with everything. And if it’s something else… well, I just don't want a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: I see your blood pressure has been a little elevated at times. Those pills... let me check the medication list. [pause, typing] Ah, yes. Ibuprofen 800mg, three times a day. That is a high dose, Dawnetta. Long-term use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen can certainly cause gastrointestinal bleeding, even without obvious symptoms at first. We need to rule out other causes, though. I’m going to need to examine you. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Examine me? Oh, for goodness sake. I knew it. Always something with doctors. Fine, fine. But make it quick, alright? I've got tomatoes ripening, and I don't have all day. And be gentle, my back isn’t what it used to be. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Let me just feel your abdomen… Any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little… creaky, maybe. Like an old door. But no pain. Honestly, Doctor, I think you're making a fuss over nothing. It's probably just those pills. Everyone takes pills these days. And my bridge club would never forgive me if I missed Tuesday's game. They're ruthless.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, no masses. Bowel sounds are… present. Not particularly remarkable. However, we still need to investigate the stool. I'm going to order a fecal occult blood test, and a complete blood count to check for anemia. And while we're waiting for those results, I want you to stop taking the ibuprofen immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Stop the ibuprofen? Immediately? But… my back! What am I supposed to do for my back? I can barely get out of bed without it. And what if it takes days to get the results? I'll be a wreck. Look, is there anything else I can take? Something milder? A cream, maybe? I just don't want a lot of trouble.
DOCTOR: A cream won’t address potential internal bleeding, Dawnetta. We need to identify the cause of the black stool. For now, you can try acetaminophen for pain relief, but it’s not as effective for inflammation. We'll get those test results back quickly, I assure you. If you experience any dizziness, weakness, or if the stool continues to be black or tarry, or if you see any blood, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room?! Oh, goodness no. I haven't been to the emergency room since… well, since forever. I just want to get back to my canning. Alright, alright, acetaminophen. I'll try it. But if my back flares up, I'm calling you. And I expect a quick turnaround on these tests. Don’t leave me hanging. I've got a reputation to uphold at the bridge club, you know. And tomatoes won't can themselves.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m ordering the tests now. The lab is just down the hall; they’ll take good care of you. I’ll call you as soon as the results are in, Dawnetta. And please, take it seriously. Ignoring internal bleeding can have… serious consequences. Here’s the requisition form. And remember, acetaminophen for now. Schedule a follow-up appointment with my nurse in one week to review the results. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. I’ve got things to do. Acetaminophen, stop ibuprofen, follow-up with the nurse… I think I’ve got it. Honestly, you doctors make such a fuss. But thank you, I suppose. And tell your nurse to be quick, alright? Don’t want to waste my time. .
