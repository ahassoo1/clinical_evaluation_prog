DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. It’s this… patch of skin. It’s just… off. Not painful, thankfully, just… noticeable. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Around the beginning of July, maybe? It’s on my left forearm. I noticed it after gardening, but I doubt that’s what caused it. I always wear gloves, you know. Proper gardening gloves.
DOCTOR: Gloves, yes, good. People don't always think of protecting their skin. Well, let's take a look. “Around the beginning of July…” So, roughly a month now. And you said it’s not painful, no itching, burning, or any other changes besides just being… noticeable?
PATIENT: Precisely. No itching, no burning, no blistering, nothing like that. It’s… a discoloration, really. Sort of… brownish? It’s not a deep brown, more like… faded coffee with too much milk. And it’s flat. Completely flat. Not raised or bumpy or anything. Honestly, it’s rather unsightly, which is why I’m here. One doesn’t want to look… unwell. Do you need me to show you exactly where?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Showing me is always more helpful than describing. It's good you’re being proactive about this, Ms. Bartock. Some people ignore things until they become much more serious. Please, roll up your sleeve. Let's have a look at your left forearm.
PATIENT: There it is. Do you see? It's not terribly obvious, I suppose, unless you're looking for it. And the light isn’t very good in here, is it? It makes everything look rather… washed out. I do try to stay out of the sun, you know. Very important, protecting your skin.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see it. It is subtle. And you're right, the lighting isn't ideal. It's roughly circular, about… two centimeters in diameter, I'd say. Flat, as you mentioned. No scaling or crusting. The color... it's an uneven brownish tone, bordering on hyperpigmentation, but not quite. Tell me, Ms. Bartock, have you noticed any other changes on your skin recently?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens, no. Just this. Honestly, I keep a very close eye on my skin. One must, you know. It's the first thing people notice. I haven’t been unwell, haven’t had any new moles pop up, no unusual rashes, nothing like that. I do get a bit of dry skin in the winter, but that's easily managed with a good lotion. And I haven't been traveling anywhere exotic. Just the usual trip to visit my sister in Philadelphia. Perfectly normal, safe trip.
DOCTOR: Philadelphia is... reasonable. Dry skin, lotion… All very sensible. Let me just pull up your records here… Hmm. No history of skin cancer, no previous biopsies… Standard annual checkups, all normal. And no family history of unusual skin conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none at all. My mother always had lovely skin, very fair, but nothing… problematic. My grandmother had a few freckles, but that's it. Perfectly normal freckles, you understand. Not those… unsightly, large ones. My father… well, he wasn’t terribly concerned with appearances, to be honest. He was an engineer, very practical. Didn’t spend much time worrying about skin discolorations. So, no, no family history that I'm aware of. Really, it's probably nothing. But one does like to be certain, doesn't one?
DOCTOR: Yes, “certainty” is preferable. Well, Ms. Bartock, based on what you've told me, and my initial examination, it could be a number of things. A post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, perhaps, even with glove use, or simply an atypical mole. It's difficult to say definitively without a closer look. To be absolutely safe, I'd recommend a skin biopsy. It's a very quick procedure, minimally invasive, and will give us a definitive answer. It's simply… prudent.
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh, dear. Is that really necessary? It sounds… rather drastic for a small discoloration. I mean, I understand being cautious, of course, but it seems like a bit of overkill, doesn't it? I was hoping for a simple diagnosis, perhaps a cream or lotion. A biopsy… will it leave a scar? I have a rather important luncheon next month and I wouldn't want anything unsightly. I'm not terribly fond of needles, either, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, I understand your concerns. However, "overkill," as you put it, is far preferable to a missed diagnosis. We are dealing with skin, and skin can be… unpredictable. A small discoloration could be nothing, but it could be something more serious. A biopsy is a very small procedure – a tiny sample of skin is removed and sent to the lab. The resulting scar is typically minimal, especially with proper aftercare. We can schedule it for a time that minimizes disruption to your… luncheon. And honestly, the discomfort is negligible. I would strongly advise against delaying this further. It’s the responsible course of action.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. I still think it’s rather excessive, but… I suppose I trust your professional judgment. Though I must say, the thought of a scar… it’s rather disheartening. Can it be done… discreetly? And what sort of aftercare are we talking about? I have a very sensitive complexion, you see. And will it interfere with my skincare routine? I use a very specific cleanser, you understand. From Paris.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Bartock, we can certainly do it discreetly. The procedure itself is quite small. We'll use a local anesthetic, so you won’t feel any pain. As for aftercare, it’s relatively simple: keep the area clean and covered with a bandage for a few days, apply an antibiotic ointment, and avoid direct sunlight. And I assure you, a properly performed biopsy and appropriate aftercare will minimize any scarring. As for your cleanser from Paris… you may need to temporarily discontinue use for a few days, to avoid irritation. We can discuss specific products that are suitable for sensitive skin. Shall we schedule the biopsy for next week?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Next week, I suppose. As long as it doesn't interfere with my bridge game on Wednesday. And are you certain about the cleanser? It’s quite expensive, you know. Perhaps a small test patch first? I wouldn’t want to exacerbate any… discoloration. And I do hope you use a very small needle. Honestly, I’ve always been rather squeamish. Perhaps Friday would be better? Gives me a few extra days to… mentally prepare.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Bartock. Friday it is. We will, of course, use the smallest gauge needle available. And we can discuss a test patch, though I assure you, it’s unlikely to be necessary. I have scheduled you for a skin biopsy on Friday at 2:00 PM. Please arrive 15 minutes early to complete any necessary paperwork. A nurse will explain the procedure in detail and address any further concerns you may have. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… try to be quick, please. And gentle. I truly do hope it doesn’t leave a noticeable mark. And make absolutely certain that nurse is properly trained. I have… sensitive skin, you understand. Very sensitive. Alright then. Friday at two. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Friday at two. .
