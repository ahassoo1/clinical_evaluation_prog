DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just… this fever keeps coming back. It’s been a few weeks now, on and off. It's annoying, honestly. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: A recurring fever… alright. “On and off” is rather vague, Mr. Brege. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Okay, let me think. It usually starts with chills, then I get warm, maybe 101, 102. Lasts a day, sometimes two. Then it’s gone for, oh, three, four days, then BAM, it’s back. Like clockwork, almost. It happened July 18th, then again July 25th. I wrote it down, see? My wife gets worried.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you been experiencing any other symptoms with these fevers?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, I get a little tired. Not like, can't-get-out-of-bed tired, just… more tired than usual. And maybe a little achy, you know, like after a long day of work. No cough, no sore throat, nothing like that. Just the chills, fever, and a bit of fatigue. Nothing else really stands out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any changes in your bowel habits, appetite, or any skin rashes?
PATIENT: Skin rashes? No, nothing like that. Appetite’s been normal, maybe a little less when I got the fever, but nothing major. And, uh… bowel habits… look, Doc, I don't usually talk about that with doctors. Everything's… regular, if you want to know. Sorry. Is that important?
DOCTOR: While it’s not always relevant, changes can be indicative of certain underlying issues. However, we can move on. Have you traveled anywhere recently, Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: Traveled? Not really. Just around town. The supermarket, the pharmacy… maybe a trip to see my daughter in Orlando back in May, but that was months ago. Nothing exciting. Definitely haven't been out of the country. It’s just this fever. It’s driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Just the usual stuff. A little ibuprofen for the aches when the fever hits, but that's it. I try to avoid pills if I can, honestly. And… oh, my wife gives me something for my blood pressure sometimes, but I don't take it every day. I think it's Lisinopril. I don’t keep track of all that stuff, she handles the medications. It's not much, I promise.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Been getting stung by mosquitoes my whole life, never had a reaction. No food allergies, no trouble with any pills I've ever taken. My wife always asks, but I always tell her the same thing. I'm pretty durable, Doc. Puerto Rican blood, you know. We're tough.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been under control for years now, thanks to the wife, mostly. And I had a bad back a few years ago, that’s why I see a chiropractor. Other than that… I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. No diabetes, no heart problems, no cancer, nothing like that. Knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries in the past, Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: Nope, never had surgery. Not even for the bad back. I prefer the chiropractor, keeps things natural. My wife wanted me to get it fixed properly, but I didn't want to go under the knife. No surgeries, no complications, just the occasional ache.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… okay. My mother had arthritis when she got older, pretty bad. My father… he died of a heart attack, I think. A long time ago. And my sister has diabetes, but other than that, we're a pretty healthy bunch. Lots of longevity on both sides, if that counts for anything. It's not like I can change my genes, right?
DOCTOR: Right. Now, tell me about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, none of that. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner every now and then, but that’s about it. And definitely no drugs. I'm a pretty simple man, Doc. I work hard, come home to my wife, and relax. That's it. I don't need any of that stuff to have a good time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then we can discuss this further. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine. Let’s get this over with. The quicker we figure this out, the better.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 148/92. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pulse is regular at 88. No murmurs or rubs auscultated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Everything seems relatively normal, within acceptable parameters. It's likely a viral infection, or possibly a mild bacterial illness. However, given the recurring nature of the fever...
PATIENT: So… what does that mean, Doc? Viral, bacterial… is it serious? I just want to know if I need a bunch of tests, or pills, or… something. I got things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. Given your age and the fact that it’s recurring, I recommend a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to rule out any underlying causes. We should also check your inflammatory markers, just to be safe. I’ll order those tests for you now. In the meantime, continue to monitor your temperature and any other symptoms that may develop. If you experience a high fever, chills, or shortness of breath, go to the emergency room immediately.
PATIENT: Emergency room? Now you're scaring me! I just got a little fever, Doc. A recurring fever, yeah, but… Look, can't we just try some antibiotics? Or something to lower my temperature? I don't want to end up in the hospital over this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brege, I understand your concerns. However, prescribing antibiotics without a confirmed bacterial infection is irresponsible and contributes to antibiotic resistance. We need to determine the cause of your fever before initiating treatment. I will also need to review the results of the bloodwork before determining a course of action. I will call you with the results as soon as they are available. If you have concerns before then, I recommend contacting your primary care physician. Now, is there anything else?
