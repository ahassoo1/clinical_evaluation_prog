DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Uh, Kalinski, right? Yes. Well, it's this… shaking. My hand, mostly. It’s been bothering me, and… honestly, I don’t remember exactly when it started. A while, though. Definitely a while. I just want it to… stop, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. We'll do our best to figure out what’s causing the shaking and how to manage it. You mentioned it’s been going on for a while and primarily affects your hand. Can you describe the shaking to me?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. It’s not… constant. Comes and goes. Mostly when I try to do something, like… hold a cup. Or write. It's a little embarrassing, really. It’s like a… tremor. A little shaky. Not big movements, just… a fine wobble. Does that make any sense? I'm not very good at explaining things, I always forget the right words.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Jezik. A fine wobble that occurs with movement is a very helpful description. And don’t worry about explaining things – we’ll take our time and get to the bottom of this. Now, does anything seem to trigger the shaking, besides holding a cup or writing?
PATIENT: Trigger… well, sometimes if I get… upset. Not angry, exactly. More like… stressed. Or tired. Really tired. And… I think it's worse when I haven’t had enough… what do you call it… sleep? Yes, sleep. But, honestly, I can't always tell. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It's all a bit… fuzzy. Is that helpful? I'm not sure I'm being very useful here.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Mr. Jezik. It's completely normal for memory to change as we age, and it's good you’re aware of that. Knowing it's potentially worse with stress, fatigue, and possibly lack of sleep is valuable information. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed the shaking in other parts of your body besides your hand?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... I think maybe my leg sometimes. Not always. Just a little… twitch. Very subtle. It’s hard to say for sure. I mostly notice it when I’m trying to sit still. It’s probably nothing, though. Old age, you know? Things just… start to go wrong. Is that what you mean? I haven’t paid much attention, to be honest. It’s this hand that bothers me the most.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. It’s perfectly reasonable to focus on the most bothersome symptom. The occasional twitch in your leg is good to note, though. Now, thinking back, have you had any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… good heavens, what doesn't ache these days? No… not that I can recall. I get a little dizzy sometimes, but that’s probably just getting up too fast. And… well, I’m always a bit tired, but that's just… life. I don’t think so. Nothing really stands out. I had a bit of a cough a few months back, but that’s gone now. Really, just the shaking. And this forgetfulness, I suppose. But that’s… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so thorough, Mr. Jezik. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with a few common ailments, and it's helpful to have a full picture. To help me understand things a bit better, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me see… No, I don’t think so. Not regularly, anyway. The doctor gave me some pills for my blood pressure a while back, but I stopped taking them. They made me feel… funny. And… oh, sometimes I take something for my knees, when they’re really bad. But that’s just an over-the-counter thing, you know? Nothing prescribed. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, honestly. They never seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Jezik. It's good to know you’re generally avoiding regular medication. Do you have any allergies to medications, or to anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. I’ve never had a really bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, if I eat shellfish. But it’s not serious. I can eat shrimp, usually. I just get a little… uncomfortable. Nothing more. I don’t think I have any serious allergies. Honestly, I’ve never paid much attention to it. My wife used to keep track of all that, but… well, that was a long time ago. Is that helpful? I'm just trying to remember everything. It's so hard.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Jezik. A mild reaction to shellfish is good to note. Now, I'd like to ask a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history... Let me think. The doctor said my blood pressure was high, like I mentioned before. And… I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. When I was younger. And… my knees, of course. Arthritis, they said. But that's just old age, isn't it? I don't think anything serious. Nothing that required a lot of… fuss. My wife used to keep all the records. It was all very organized. But, you know... it's been a while. I’m probably forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. It sounds like you've dealt with a few common ailments, and it's perfectly normal to have trouble remembering everything over time. Now, thinking about your family, has anyone else in your family experienced shaking or tremors, or had any neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease?
PATIENT: Parkinson's… Hmm. That name rings a bell. My mother's brother, I think… he had some trouble walking when he got older. But I don’t know what it was. Just… wobbly. And… my aunt, on my father’s side, she had some memory problems. But that could have been anything, really. Old age, you know? I'm not sure. Nobody really talked about it much. It was a long time ago, and we didn't see them very often. I’m afraid I don’t have much information. Sorry to be unhelpful.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Jezik. Any information, even limited, is helpful. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. Not me. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife hated smoking. And… a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Very rarely. And… well, no, nothing else. I'm a simple man. Just tea and… the occasional biscuit. I don't go in for any of that. A quiet life, you know? Very quiet. Always have been. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Jezik, that’s very helpful. Thank you for being so open. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a bit about what your daily life is like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Daily life… Well, it’s… quiet. Very quiet. I live alone now, you see. My wife… she passed away a few years ago. I spend most of my time at home. I like to read. When my eyes are up to it. And… I try to keep the garden tidy. But it's hard work these days. And I watch the television, of course. Mostly the news. But it’s all rather depressing. I try to get out for a walk sometimes, but… honestly, I don’t get out much. A very simple life. A quiet life. Is that helpful? I don't really do much, you see. It's just… existing, mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Jezik. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and I appreciate you being so honest with me. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. This will involve checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and a neurological assessment, which will help me evaluate your reflexes, coordination, and balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Yes, alright. I suppose so. It's just… I don't like being poked and prodded, you know? I'm a bit frail these days. But if you think it's necessary… go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. And don't take too long. I get tired easily. It's probably nothing, anyway. Old age, you know. But alright. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. I’ll be as gentle as possible and take my time. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 145 over 88, which is a little elevated. Your pulse is 72, which is normal. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’ll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, which is common at your age. Now, I'd like to observe your hand movements and coordination. Could you please extend your arms in front of you and touch your nose with your index finger, alternating hands?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s… not as easy as it used to be. See? This shaking… it makes everything so difficult. I keep missing. Is it very bad? I’m afraid I’m not very good at this. It’s like my hand has a mind of its own. And… I think I’m getting a little tired now. Is this… is this a sign of something serious? I really don't want to end up in a hospital.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Jezik. Don’t worry, you’re doing just fine. It’s perfectly normal for coordination to be affected with age, and the tremor does make it more challenging. I’m just observing the pattern of the tremor, and it seems to be a resting tremor, which is common in certain conditions. Now, I'll just check your gait and balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is… a bit scary, to be honest. I don’t walk very well these days. My legs just don’t seem to cooperate. I used to be so active, you know? But now… it’s just a struggle. See? I’m walking very slowly. And… I think I’m swaying a little. I really don’t want to fall. Is this… is this what happens when you get old? I just want to sit down now. My legs are starting to ache.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Jezik. You did very well. It's perfectly normal to experience changes in gait and balance with age, and I appreciate you being willing to try. It’s good that you recognize these changes, and we'll work together to address them. Now, based on the physical exam and your history, I have a few initial thoughts. The resting tremor, the diminished reflexes, and the changes in gait suggest a possible neurological condition. However, it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical causes, and I would also like to refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A neurologist? Blood tests? That sounds… serious. I really didn't want to hear that. Is it… is it something bad? Parkinson's, you said? I've heard about that. It's… awful. I just want to know what's wrong. I can't stand this uncertainty. But… alright. If you think it's necessary, do the tests. And… see the neurologist. But please… tell me what’s going on. I need to know. I just want to be prepared. And… what will happen if it is something bad? Will I… will I end up in a hospital? I just want to live out my days in peace. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your concerns, and it’s perfectly natural to feel anxious when faced with uncertainty. I want to assure you that we're taking a proactive approach to figure out what's going on, and we'll do everything we can to provide you with the best possible care. The tests and referral are to help us get a more accurate diagnosis, and it's important to remember that we don't have a definitive answer yet. It could be a number of things, and not all of them are serious. The neurologist will perform a more detailed neurological assessment and may order additional tests, such as an MRI or a DaTscan, to help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms. If it turns out to be Parkinson's disease, there are effective treatments available to manage the symptoms and help you maintain a good quality of life. We'll discuss all your options thoroughly if that's the case. We'll work closely with you to ensure you're comfortable and informed every step of the way, and we'll address any concerns you may have. Right now, let’s focus on getting those tests done and seeing the neurologist. I'll write you a referral order and provide you with instructions on where to go. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Tests… and the neurologist. I suppose so. Just… please, don't keep me waiting. I need to know what's going on. And… thank you. For being patient with me. And for explaining everything. I really appreciate it. I just want to be prepared. That’s all. And… will I need someone to take me to these appointments? I don’t really have anyone… My wife… she used to drive me everywhere. But she’s gone now. I don’t want to be a burden. I just… I just don’t want to be alone. Will someone be there to help me? If I need it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, you are absolutely not a burden, and you won't be alone. We have resources available to help you with transportation, and we can connect you with social services that can provide support and assistance. I will have my nurse, Sarah, contact you tomorrow to schedule the tests and discuss transportation options. She can also provide you with information about support groups and other helpful resources. We also have a patient navigator who can accompany you to your appointments if you'd like. They can help you understand the information you receive and answer any questions you may have. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you need anything at all. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Now, let me write you this referral order and go over the instructions with you. Sarah will be in touch tomorrow, and we’ll get everything arranged as quickly as possible. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that sounds very good. Thank you. Thank you so much. It’s a weight off my shoulders, knowing I won’t have to go through this alone. Sarah, you said? I’ll remember that name. Alright. Let’s get this over with. The tests… and the neurologist. I’m ready. As ready as I’ll ever be, I suppose. Just… tell me what I need to do. And… thank you again. For everything. You’ve been very kind. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I'm glad I could help. Now, the referral order has the neurologist's contact information and the instructions for scheduling an appointment. You'll need to call their office and tell them you were referred by Dr. Kalinski. They’ll ask for your insurance information, but we can work around that if you are uninsured. Before the appointment, try to make a list of any questions you have for the neurologist. It can be helpful to bring a family member or friend with you, but that’s entirely up to you. The blood tests are relatively straightforward. You'll need to fast for 12 hours beforehand, which means no food or drinks except water. Sarah will provide you with specific instructions when she calls. Don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. We're here to support you every step of the way. Now, I’ll have Sarah contact you tomorrow. In the meantime, try to relax and take care of yourself. You've been very brave coming in today, and I'm confident we'll get to the bottom of this. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Jezik. Take care.
