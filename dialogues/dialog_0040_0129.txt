DOCTOR: Right, yes. Dawnetta Hatchard, 73. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s my stool. It’s… dark. Black, mostly. And I take those pills, you know, for the arthritis. The red ones. Been taking ‘em for years. It’s probably that, isn’t it? Don't tell me it's something serious. I haven't got time for serious.
DOCTOR: Black stool, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, black! Like… coal. Not just a little dark, black. And it’s been going on… oh, a week, maybe? I don't keep a diary of my… movements, if that’s what you’re asking. Really, doctor, I just want to know if I need to stop the pills or what. It’s not like I’m enjoying this visit.
DOCTOR: A week, alright. And you’re taking… what were those pills again?
PATIENT: The red ones! Honestly, are you even listening? For the arthritis. Ibuprofen, I think? Or naproxen? One of those… -ens. My Harold gets them for me. He handles all that. I just take them. And they help, usually. But this… black stool… it’s unsettling. It can’t be good, can it?
DOCTOR: Let’s just pull up your medication list… Harold, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Harold. My husband. He’s very good with… details. Unlike me, apparently. Though I remember perfectly well when Mrs. Gable next door got that awful perm in ‘87, but remembering pill names? Forget about it. Just… look it up. Is it serious? Don't waste my time with questions I can't answer, just tell me what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Naproxen, 500mg twice daily. Okay. And you've noticed this black stool coinciding with taking the naproxen?
PATIENT: Yes! Finally, getting somewhere. Coinciding… yes, that’s a good word. It started around the same time, I think. Look, I'm not a scientist. I take a pill, my stool changes color. Seems pretty straightforward to me. Is it the pill? Will I be okay? I have a garden club meeting on Thursday!
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Black stool can be caused by a number of things, and yes, naproxen can sometimes cause gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to dark stools. But it's not the only possibility. We need to rule out other issues. Have you had any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fatigue recently?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re getting technical. Abdominal… a little bit of a rumble sometimes, but I’m 73, doctor, things rumble! Nausea? No. Vomiting? Definitely not. Fatigue? Well, I am getting older. Does getting tired count? Look, I take these pills to feel better, not to get interrogated about my insides. Is it a major problem? Am I looking at surgery? Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: No, you're not looking at surgery. But we need to do a quick exam, and I'm going to order a stool test to check for blood. It's standard procedure. And just to be thorough, I want to check your blood pressure and listen to your abdomen. Can we do that now?
PATIENT: A stool test? Honestly! Are you serious? I’m not bringing a sample with me. This is ridiculous. Fine, fine, do your… listening. But make it quick. And no poking and prodding, understand? I have better things to do. Just get this over with. Blood pressure is probably fine, I eat my vegetables. Mostly. Don't tell me I need to change my diet too. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get this over with. Blood pressure first. 130/80. Not bad. Now, if you could just lie down on the examination table... and try to relax. A few normal bowel sounds. Any pain when I press here?
