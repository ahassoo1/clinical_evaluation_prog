DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… something about a check-up? For… work, I think. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. They just told me to come in for a physical. A performance physical, was it? Yes, that sounds right. I usher at the theatre, you see. Or… I did. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: A performance physical, right. Well, we can certainly do a full physical. It’s good to be thorough. Though, usually those are requested by an employer with specific requirements… Do you happen to know what they're looking for, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, not really. They just… sent the paperwork. A young man, very efficient. He didn’t say much beyond “physical” and “August 2nd”. I just filled out the forms as best I could. I’m not very good with details, you see. It’s… always been that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’ll proceed with a standard physical then. We can cover everything and see if anything specific comes to light. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Hmm… not so much. It’s been… years, I suppose. A little check-up here and there when something really bothered me, but nothing consistent. My ex-wife used to handle all that. She was very organized. I… I don’t even remember the last time I had a proper check-up.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any significant past medical problems that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Significant? Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had a bad fall when I was younger, broke my wrist. That healed up fine, though. And… I had the flu a few times, like everyone else. Nothing major. I don’t think so. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I apologize if I’m being difficult.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Krahn. We’ll get through it. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. No, I don’t believe so. Not that I recall. Nothing on my… uh, body, anyway. I mean, no scars or anything like that. I think. It’s… possible, I suppose. But I’m pretty sure I haven’t had any surgeries.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh boy. That’s a tough one. My parents… they were both… gone a long time ago. I didn’t stay in close contact with any relatives, I’m afraid. I was always… focused on my work. I know my mother had… something with her heart, maybe? But I don’t remember the details. And my father… he was a strong man, always healthy, as far as I knew. It's… really hazy, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. So, limited family history available. Let's move on to social history then. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. Never smoked a day in my life. A little wine with dinner sometimes, but very rarely. And definitely no drugs. I’m a very… simple man, Doctor. I prefer a quiet evening to… all that. It never appealed to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. I don't really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I try to stay healthy through… well, just by being careful, I suppose. And… getting enough rest. Though, sleep hasn’t been the easiest lately. But no pills, no, thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a physical exam then. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Scale, you say? Right this way. I hope I’m not too heavy. I haven’t been eating as well lately, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Hmm. 118 pounds. And your height is listed as 199… centimeters. That’s… quite thin, Mr. Krahn. Now, if you’ll just follow me over to the examination table, we’ll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Oh, is that thin? I hadn’t really noticed. I suppose I have lost some weight. Alright, blood pressure, you say? Sounds… important. I’ll just… lie down here, shall I?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 110 over 70. Pulse is 72 and regular. Breathing sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, but no wheezes or crackles noted. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Alright, Mr. Krahn. Everything seems… within normal limits, although your weight is concerningly low. Do you have any noticeable fatigue, weakness, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear, "normal limits", you say? Fatigue… yes, actually. I’ve been rather tired lately. And… my appetite hasn’t been the best. I just haven’t been hungry, you see? It’s… hard to explain. I just don’t enjoy food as much as I used to. And… everything seems a little… tasteless, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite and a change in taste… Hmm. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I have lost weight, I think. I haven’t really been keeping track, but my clothes… they feel a bit looser, you see? And my ex-wife… she always commented on my weight. She’d say, “Brando, you’re looking thinner!” But that was… a long time ago. I haven't weighed myself in… goodness, I don’t even remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Given your recent weight loss, loss of appetite, and changes in taste, I’d like to order some blood work. We need to check for any underlying medical conditions that could be causing these symptoms. It could be something simple, or it could be something more serious. We'll check a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. Would you be willing to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work, you say? More tests… Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I just… don’t like needles, if I’m being honest. But if it’s for my health… yes, alright. Let’s get it done. Just… please be quick, if you could.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll have the nurse draw the samples. She’ll explain the procedure to you. And Mr. Krahn, I also recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. We need to get to the bottom of this. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, severe fatigue, or unexplained bleeding – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, one week? Yes, alright. I'll try to remember. Fever… bleeding… goodness. No, I don’t think so. Not at the moment. Just… the tiredness, and the lack of appetite. And the tasteless food. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. I just want to go home now, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly. And Mr. Krahn, it’s important you follow up. We need to rule out anything serious. .
PATIENT: .
