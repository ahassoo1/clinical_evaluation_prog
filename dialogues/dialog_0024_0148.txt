DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepbro. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having some… discomfort. Down there. In my… groin, I suppose. It’s…painful. I’m not quite sure why it’s painful, just that it is. It’s been going on for a little while now, but it’s gotten…noticeable recently.
DOCTOR: "Noticeable," is a rather vague description, Ms. Stepbro. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, my apologies, Doctor. Vague is… a habit, I’m afraid. It's not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache. And sometimes… a heaviness. It comes and goes, and I haven’t been able to figure out what makes it worse or better. Honestly, I’ve been trying to ignore it, hoping it would just… go away. But it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Ignoring medical issues rarely resolves them, Ms. Stepbro. When did you first notice this "dull ache" and "heaviness"?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Let me think… It feels like… a few weeks, perhaps? Maybe a month? It’s hard to say exactly. I do remember it starting very subtly. At first, I just thought I’d slept in a funny position. But it didn’t go away after a few days, like it usually would.
DOCTOR: A month. Right. And has this discomfort been associated with any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Oh dear. Let me see… I haven’t noticed any fever, or…changes in my bathroom habits, if you don’t mind me saying. No nausea. I suppose… I have been a little more tired lately, but I always chalk that up to working with the wood. It’s physically demanding, you know?
DOCTOR: "Working with the wood?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m a woodworker. I make furniture, mostly. It's a good trade, but it can be hard on the body. Lots of lifting and bending. I’ve been doing it for… well, a long time now. It's possible it’s just a muscle strain, but… I thought it best to get it checked, just in case.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any pain radiating to your legs, or any numbness or tingling?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, thankfully not. No pain in my legs. And no numbness or tingling… I do get a little ache in my lower back sometimes, but that's…usual for me. I've always had a weak back. But no, nothing specifically connected to this pain. It’s really just…down there.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepbro, I need to ask a potentially uncomfortable question. Have you noticed any changes in your vaginal discharge?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, goodness. That is… a personal question. Well… I suppose… No, Doctor. Nothing unusual. At least, nothing that I’ve noticed. I… I don’t typically pay very close attention to those things, if you understand what I mean. It's… not something I’ve been actively monitoring.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, let's proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I will need to palpate your abdomen and perform a pelvic exam. It will be…brief.
PATIENT: Oh… a pelvic exam? I… wasn’t expecting that. Is that… necessary, Doctor? I mean, I thought this was… testicular pain? I’m a bit confused. But… alright. If you think it’s best.
DOCTOR: Please undress from the waist down and put on a gown. I need to rule out other potential causes, Ms. Stepbro. It's prudent medical practice. Now, if you'll excuse me for a moment.
PATIENT: Oh. Prudent… yes. Of course. It's just… a little embarrassing, that's all. I suppose I should just… lie down and wait?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepbro. Deep breaths. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. A little. There. Just a bit sensitive, but… it’s not a sharp pain. More like… a dull ache, like I described. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: This may be uncomfortable. Please relax as much as possible. Now, I'm going to take a look inside. Breathe normally. Hmm.
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. That is uncomfortable. It’s… it’s over now? Hmm? Is something… wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The examination revealed some mild tenderness, Ms. Stepbro. No obvious masses or lesions. However, I note some slight redness and inflammation. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a urine analysis to rule out any infection. We will also need to consider the possibility of musculoskeletal strain, given your occupation. I want you to avoid any heavy lifting for the next week.
PATIENT: Oh… well. That doesn’t sound… terrible, I suppose. An infection? Musculoskeletal… that’s what I thought it might be. So… no surgery? No… anything drastic? And avoiding lifting… that will be difficult, but I can try. When will I get the results, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepbro, I am not clairvoyant. We are ruling out possibilities. The lab results should be back within 48 hours. I will have my nurse contact you with the findings. In the meantime, over-the-counter ibuprofen can help with the pain and inflammation. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh… right, of course. Sorry, Doctor. I just… get anxious. No, no allergies. I can take ibuprofen, yes. That’s good. Thank you. Will the nurse… explain everything to me? I sometimes have trouble remembering things, you see.
DOCTOR: The nurse will relay the results. If anything requires further attention, I will contact you directly. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright then. No, I… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For your time. I’ll… wait to hear from the nurse.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please dress and have a good day, Ms. Stepbro. .
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Good day to you too, Doctor. .
