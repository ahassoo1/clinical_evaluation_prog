DOCTOR: Good morning, Chanz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, it's…sleep, mostly. Not getting much of it, you see. And I used to be…fit. Proper fit. Not this…this state. It's just…gone downhill since…well, never mind. It’s a long story. I just want to feel normal again, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sleep disturbances can be really disruptive, and it's frustrating when your physical condition changes. Let's focus on the sleep for now, and we can touch on the fitness aspect later if you're comfortable. Could you tell me a bit more about how your sleep has been affected?
PATIENT: Affected? Right. Well, it’s not like I fall asleep easily. I toss and turn for ages. Then I wake up…a lot. Two, three times a night, easy. And then…can’t get back to sleep. Just…lying there. Thinking. It’s…annoying. Honestly, it’s more annoying than anything. I used to be able to…well, it doesn't matter. I just feel tired all the time. And grumpy. My wife…used to say I was grumpy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings during the night, and trouble getting back to sleep. That certainly sounds disruptive. And it's understandable it's making you feel tired and affecting your mood. About how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, ages. Honestly, I can't put a precise date on it. It started…around the time of…everything. It’s been at least a year, probably longer. Everything kind of…blurs together after a while, doesn’t it? I wouldn't even know where to begin with a specific timeline. It's just been…gradual. Worse and worse, over time.
DOCTOR: I understand it's hard to pinpoint. Let’s try this: Has it been consistently this bad for the entire year, or have there been periods where it was better or worse?
PATIENT: Worse, definitely worse recently. Last few months, it’s really taken a dive. Before that…it was bad, but manageable. I could still…function. Get by. Now? Not so much. I find myself…just sitting, staring at the wall. Not doing anything. It’s…pathetic, really. I used to be a…productive member of society. Now I just fiddle with instruments all day. Keeps my hands busy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like things have been progressively declining, which is concerning. You mentioned you’ve been “fiddling with instruments.” Is that a new hobby, or something you’ve always done?
PATIENT: Always done it. Since I was a boy, really. My father was a…well, he was a musician. A proper one. I took it up after him, naturally. Then I opened my own shop. Repairs, tuning…all that. It's…solitary work, I suppose. Always has been. Used to be…relaxing. Now it just feels…empty. It doesn’t…fill the void, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. Solitary work can be… isolating, as you say. Have there been any other significant changes or stressful events in your life recently, perhaps around the time you noticed things starting to get worse?
PATIENT: Stressful events… Look, everything changed. Everything. My wife…she passed away. About eighteen months ago, I think. It’s all a bit…fuzzy, to be honest. Before that, things were…fine. Not perfect, but fine. After…after that, everything just…fell apart. Shop's still running, barely. I just…exist now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I am so incredibly sorry to hear that, Chanz. Losing your wife must have been devastating. It's completely understandable that you're struggling, and it's not surprising that your sleep and overall well-being have been affected. It takes an immense amount of strength to cope with such a loss. Before we dive further into the sleep issues, would you be open to talking about how you’ve been coping with your grief?
PATIENT: Coping? What coping? I…I don't know. I just…keep busy. Work. Fiddle with instruments. Try not to think about it. It doesn't really work, but…what else is there to do? I don't talk about it. Never really been one for…sharing feelings. It's all a bit…pathetic, really. I’m not one for…drama.
DOCTOR: I understand you prefer to keep busy and avoid dwelling on things. That's a common way to cope, but sometimes it can be helpful to acknowledge and process difficult emotions, even if it's uncomfortable. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest, how would you rate your overall mood these past few months?
PATIENT: A scale? Honestly, I don't…I don't do scales. I fix instruments, not…feelings. But…if I had to… I suppose…a 3? Maybe a 4. It’s…grey. Just…grey. Not actively bad, but…not good either. Just…existing.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That gives me a better understanding. Sometimes, when people are going through a difficult time, they experience other symptoms along with feeling down. I’m just going to ask you a few quick questions, if that’s alright. Have you noticed a significant loss of interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Enjoy? I suppose not. Used to enjoy…playing music. Now it just feels…empty. Like I'm going through the motions. The shop…it's just work. It pays the bills. Doesn't enjoy it, no. Haven’t really felt…enthusiasm about anything for a long time, to be honest. It’s just…gone.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Have you been experiencing any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat. When I remember. Mostly just…simple things. Sandwiches. Soup. Don’t really have the energy to…cook anything fancy. Weight…probably lost some. Clothes feel a bit…loose. But I haven’t actually weighed myself, to be honest. It doesn’t really…matter.
DOCTOR: Thank you. One last question for now. You mentioned trouble sleeping earlier. Have you noticed any feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness?
PATIENT: Hopelessness… yes. I suppose so. What’s the point, really? Everything’s just…grey. And…worthlessness… yes. What’s the point of fixing instruments when…when everything’s just falling apart? I’m just…existing. A useless old man. It’s…pathetic, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Chanz, it sounds like you’re going through a tremendously difficult time, and it takes a lot of courage to share what you’re feeling. It’s not pathetic at all. Losing your wife, and feeling this way afterwards… it’s a completely normal response to immense grief. What you're describing – the loss of interest in things you enjoy, changes in appetite, trouble sleeping, feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness – these are all signs of depression. It's a medical condition, just like any other, and it is treatable. There are several options that can help, and I want to assure you that you're not alone in this. We could explore medication, therapy, or a combination of both. Would you be open to discussing these options further?
PATIENT: Medication? Therapy? I…I don’t know. Never been one for…talking about feelings. And pills? I…I don’t like the sound of that. I just want to feel…normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all, Chanz. And I understand your hesitation. Many people feel the same way. Therapy doesn’t have to be about “talking about feelings” in a dramatic way. It can be about learning coping strategies, finding ways to manage difficult emotions, and rediscovering things that bring you joy. And medication isn't about masking your feelings, it's about rebalancing the chemicals in your brain that can become disrupted during periods of grief and depression, allowing you to function more effectively. We can start slowly. Perhaps we could try a few sessions of therapy first, and see how you feel. If that doesn’t help, or you’d like to explore other options, we can discuss medication. It's entirely up to you, and we'll work together to find what's best for you. There's also a local support group for bereavement. It’s a safe space to connect with others who are going through similar experiences. Would you be interested in learning more about that?
PATIENT: A support group… I don’t know. Sounds… awkward. Being around people… I’m not good with people. But…therapy…maybe. Just…a few sessions. See how it goes. No promises, though. I’m not one for…getting my hopes up.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Chanz. We can definitely start with a few sessions of therapy and see how it goes. There’s no pressure at all. I have a list of therapists in the area who specialize in grief counseling. I can give you their contact information, and you can choose someone you feel comfortable with. I’m also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, so we can discuss your progress and address any questions or concerns you may have. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Two weeks…yes, that’s fine. I suppose. Just…don't expect miracles, alright? I’m an old man, set in my ways. It’s going to take more than a few sessions to…fix me.
DOCTOR: I don’t expect miracles, Chanz. And you’re not “broken” and needing “fixed.” It takes courage to reach out for help, and you’ve already taken the first step. We'll work at your pace, and together, we'll explore what feels right for you. I'm going to have my nurse provide you with a list of therapists and information about the bereavement support group. She will also schedule your follow-up appointment for two weeks from today. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you… doctor. For…listening. It’s been…a long time since someone actually listened.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chanz. It was my pleasure. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and we're here to support you every step of the way. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. I… I appreciate it. .
