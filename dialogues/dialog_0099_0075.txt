DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske, welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Overgaard. It’s this…sleepiness. Even with the machine, you see. I’m still awfully tired during the day. It’s just…wearing me down.
DOCTOR: The machine…you’re referring to CPAP for sleep apnea, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. CPAP. My…ex-wife insisted I get tested, bless her heart. Said I snored like a freight train. And they said it was sleep apnea. I’ve been using it, faithfully, for…oh, goodness, almost five years now, I think. But it doesn’t seem to be doing the whole job.
DOCTOR: Five years is a good stretch. And you say the tiredness persists despite consistent use?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Consistent is the word. Every night. Though…sometimes I feel a little…claustrophobic with it on, if I'm honest. But I push through. Still tired, though. Not like a major exhaustion, but…a constant drag, you know? Like I'm wading through molasses. It makes it hard to…focus, especially in the afternoons when I’m grading papers.
DOCTOR: Right. And you are a…teacher, then?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. At the community college. Area, Ethnic, and Cultural Studies. It's rewarding work, but it requires a lot of concentration, reading, and…well, staying awake during those meetings! <chuckles softly> It’s getting harder, honestly. And my students…they deserve better than a half-asleep professor.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the tiredness and the occasional feeling of claustrophobia, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really changes, no. But my mouth does get awfully dry. And sometimes, my nose feels a little…irritated. Not a full-blown cold, just…dry and uncomfortable. I’ve been using a humidifier, which helps a little. And I wake up to use the bathroom quite a bit, if that matters. More than I used to, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And before we delve deeper, let’s get a bit of background. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I had my gallbladder out years ago, when I was maybe forty, but that was decades ago and no problems since. I’ve got a little bit of high blood pressure, but it’s managed with a small pill every day. Otherwise…pretty healthy, for an old guy. <chuckles> My doctor always tells me I’m remarkably robust for my age. I try to walk every morning, too. Keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Robust, you say. And the high blood pressure…what medication are you taking for that, if you recall?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s a small white pill… <pauses, taps chin> Oh, yes! Lisinopril. That’s it. Ten milligrams, every morning. Been on it for…well, I'd say about seven years now. No side effects, thankfully. Just take it with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I eat pretty much everything. My ex-wife always complained I had the appetite of a horse. <chuckles softly> Never had a reaction to any medication, not even as a kid. I used to get all sorts of shots for school, traveling…nothing. Perfectly fine. I think I'm pretty lucky, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Paske. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, stroke, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. My father had heart disease, I believe. He had a heart attack when he was in his early seventies, I think. And my mother…she had some kind of arthritis, I think it was rheumatoid arthritis. She was in a lot of pain towards the end. As far as I know, that's about it. No diabetes, no stroke… mostly just…the usual aches and pains of getting old. My siblings are both still alive, thankfully, and they seem to be doing alright. A little bit creaky, maybe, but alright. <chuckles softly>
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My ex-wife smoked, which was…difficult. But I always steered clear. As for alcohol…I might have a glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing heavy. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Never even been tempted. I’m a professor, Doctor. <chuckles softly> I need my wits about me. And I have a very strong moral compass. So, no, none of that. Just a quiet life, really. Books, my students, the occasional walk… that’s me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. Thank you for that thorough information. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your throat and nose. Sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I'm happy to help in any way I can. I trust your judgement. Let's get to it. I’ve got papers to grade, but I can spare a few minutes. <chuckles softly>
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please, have a seat here. We'll start with your blood pressure. 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not surprising given your recent report. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but there is some slight diminished airflow in the bases. Your throat looks clear, no signs of infection. Your nasal passages are a little dry and irritated, some mild congestion, but nothing significant. Alright. Those are my initial findings. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve just observed, it sounds like your sleep apnea is likely not being fully controlled, and the dryness in your nose may be contributing to some of your discomfort. The elevated blood pressure is also something we need to monitor. Let's discuss some potential next steps.
PATIENT: That all sounds…reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and examine me so carefully. What sort of “next steps” are we talking about? Is it possible the machine needs adjusting? Or a different mask? Perhaps a different setting? I'm willing to try anything to get a good night’s sleep. It’s just… draining, this constant tiredness.
DOCTOR: Those are all valid considerations, Mr. Paske. Adjusting the machine is a good first step. It's possible the pressure settings aren't optimal anymore, or the mask isn't providing a proper seal. However, given your age and your reported symptoms, I also want to rule out other potential causes of your fatigue. I'd like to order a sleep study to reassess your sleep apnea and evaluate for any changes in your breathing patterns. Additionally, I'm going to order a complete blood count to check for anemia or any other underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your tiredness. And just to be on the safe side, I’m going to order a thyroid stimulating hormone test to rule out hypothyroidism. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds…thorough. And reassuring, frankly. I'm happy to undergo any tests you deem necessary. I trust your professional judgement. A sleep study…will that be in a lab again? I remember it being…a little uncomfortable the first time around. But if it’s what’s needed, I’m willing. And the blood tests…no problem at all. Just let me know where to go and when. I appreciate you taking this so seriously. It’s just…nice to feel like someone is listening and trying to help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. It’s my job. And yes, the sleep study will be at the same sleep center you used previously. I’ll have my nurse schedule that for you, and she can provide you with instructions on how to prepare. It’s possible they’ve updated their equipment since your last visit, which may make it more comfortable. I’ll also write you a prescription for a saline nasal spray to help with the dryness. Use that a few times a day, as needed. And I recommend continuing to use your humidifier. In the meantime, if your tiredness worsens or you experience any new symptoms, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. The nasal spray sounds good, and I’ll be sure to contact the office if anything changes. Thank you again for taking the time to listen and for ordering the tests. I feel much more hopeful now, knowing we're taking steps to figure this out. I appreciate your kindness and patience. <smiles weakly> I’m an old man, and I tend to worry.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. It’s my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. My nurse will be in touch shortly to schedule the sleep study and answer any questions you may have. And try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, Mr. Paske.
