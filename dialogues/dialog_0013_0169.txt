DOCTOR: Hi Derick, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s… my face and legs, mostly. They’re kinda puffy, you see? Been that way a bit now, though I can’t rightly say how long. Time just… slips away, doesn’t it? It’s not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. And looks a bit silly, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy face and legs, and it’s been going on for a bit. Not painful, just uncomfortable and noticeable. I understand. Let's try to get a better idea of what’s going on. First, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the puffiness?
PATIENT: Honestly? I… I’m not sure. A few weeks, maybe? It’s hard to say. Things just… build up, you know? My wife, bless her soul, she always kept track of these things. Now… it’s all a bit of a blur. I just noticed it one morning when I was shaving. Looked a bit like a… a balloon, almost. And the legs… same sort of thing. Not suddenly, just… gradually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradually over a few weeks. And it started with noticing it on your face, then you noticed it in your legs as well. Has anything changed recently that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… not that I can recall. I’ve been… well, I’ve been pretty much the same. Same routine, same meals, same… everything. I haven’t been traveling or anything fancy. I do spend a lot of time at the shop, welding, you know. Been doing that for… well, a long time. But that hasn’t changed either. Perhaps it's the weather? It's been a bit muggy lately, hasn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent changes in routine, diet, or travel. You’ve been welding consistently, and you’re wondering if the humidity could be a factor. Has the puffiness been getting worse over those few weeks, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: I’d say… maybe a little worse. Not a huge amount, mind you. Just… noticeable. Like, I used to be able to get my rings on without any trouble, and now I have to… wiggle them a bit. And my ankles… I can feel them when I walk. Not a sharp pain, just… a heaviness. It’s not crippling or anything, but it’s… bothersome. It’s just annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so rings are a bit tighter, and you're feeling some heaviness in your ankles when you walk. That helps. Let’s talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in how much you’re urinating – more or less often than usual?
PATIENT: Urinating? Hmm… now that’s a question. I suppose… about the same, really. I haven’t been running to the toilet any more or less than usual. Old man things, you know? Gotta go when you gotta go. I don’t spend much time thinking about it, if you catch my drift. Never been a big drinker, so that’s not it. Just… regular, I suppose. Though now that you mention it...maybe a bit paler color than usual? But I’m not one to keep track of that, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, urination about the same, possibly a bit paler color, but you don't actively monitor that. And you don't drink alcohol much. Any shortness of breath or difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, not really. I get a bit winded sometimes when I'm… well, when I'm climbing the stairs, you know? But that's just… old age catching up with me. I haven't been struggling to breathe or anything like that. I can still yell at the TV during hockey games, if that's any indication. I do get a bit of a cough now and then, but I’ve always had a bit of a tickle in my throat. Nothing to write home about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some mild shortness of breath with stairs, but no trouble breathing. A bit of a cough that you've always had. Now, have you had any chest pain, or any palpitations – like your heart racing or skipping a beat?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, thankfully not. Heart racing… hmm. Sometimes I feel a bit… fluttery, I suppose. Not a real strong racing, just a sort of… skip. Happens now and then, but it doesn't last long. I always figured it was just… nerves. I get a bit worked up watching the hockey games, you know? Especially when they’re losing. Happens mostly when I'm sitting and relaxing, I think. Nothing that keeps me up at night or anything. Just a little… skip. Wouldn't worry a body, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional fluttering in your chest, usually when relaxing, and associated with excitement like watching hockey. That's helpful. Now, thinking about your legs - is there any pain with walking, or just the heaviness?
PATIENT: No real pain, Doctor. Just the heaviness, like I said. It’s more noticeable at the end of the day, after I’ve been on my feet at the shop. Not a sharp pain, just… tired. Like they’re carrying too much weight, you know? And sometimes… sometimes they feel a bit… tight. Not cramping, just… a bit constricted. I used to be able to walk all day without thinking about it, but now I have to… take a few breaks. It’s just… an inconvenience, really. Old man problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, heaviness and tightness in legs, especially at the end of the day, and more breaks needed. Let's move on to your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, kidney issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I saw a doctor years ago, when my wife was still… around. He said something about my blood pressure being a little high, I think. But he just told me to watch my salt intake and… that was that. Never took any pills or anything. As for anything else… not that I recall. I’ve always been a pretty healthy fella, to be honest. Kept busy, worked hard. Didn’t really spend much time at the doctor’s office. Just the yearly check-up, and that was mostly to keep my wife happy. Can’t rightly remember what he said, though. It’s all a bit… foggy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, advised to watch salt intake, but no other known medical conditions or medications. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not that I recall. Had my tonsils out when I was a boy, I suppose. But that was a long time ago, before they had all the fancy equipment. And… no hospital stays, not that I remember. Maybe a broken arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that was a quick trip to the emergency room and then home with a cast. Nothing serious, thankfully. I’ve always been lucky, I guess. Never been one for accidents or illnesses. Just a few aches and pains here and there, as you get older. Nothing to write home about.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, and a broken arm, but no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family – are your parents or siblings still living?
PATIENT: My parents… they’re both gone now, bless their souls. Passed away years ago. My sister… she’s still around, living up in the city. We don’t see each other much, though. She’s always been a bit of a… city slicker, and I’m more of a country fella. We talk on the phone now and then, mostly around Christmas. As for medical problems… she’s always been pretty healthy, as far as I know. No major illnesses or anything like that. A bit of arthritis, maybe, but nothing serious. She’s a tough old bird, that sister of mine. Always has been.
DOCTOR: Okay, both parents deceased, sister alive and healthy with some arthritis. Now, I’m going to ask about some lifestyle questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life, Doctor. My wife… she used to smoke a bit, back in the day. But I always hated the smell. Just couldn’t stand it. Told her it was bad for her health, and she eventually quit. So, no, never smoked. And I don’t drink much either. A beer with dinner now and then, but that’s about it. Mostly just water, to be honest. I try to stay healthy, you know? Even if I am getting a bit old.
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked, drinks very little alcohol. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. No hives, no trouble breathing, no nothing. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a problem with any medications. My wife… she was allergic to pollen, I think. But I never had any allergies myself. Just a bit sensitive to the cold, maybe. Gets my nose running a bit, but that’s about it. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your legs and feet. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’ve always been a bit of an open book, so to speak. Just let me know if you see anything… concerning. And try not to poke too hard, alright? Old man skin is a bit… delicate, you know? But yes, go ahead. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breath in… and out… again… good. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit of a murmur there, not particularly concerning at this point. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, 148/92. Not alarmingly high, but definitely something we need to keep an eye on. Okay, some mild swelling in both ankles and feet, and a little bit of tightness to the touch. I'm also noticing some slight discoloration of the skin on your lower legs. Not a rash, just a bit… brownish. Do you notice any pain or itching in your legs?
PATIENT: Brownish, you say? Hmm… I hadn’t really noticed. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, you know. No pain or itching, no. Just… tired, like I said. And sometimes a bit heavy. But no, no pain or itching. Is that… bad? Is that what the swelling is from? I’ve been meaning to put my feet up more, I suppose. Always getting distracted with the hockey… or something. But yes, tired and heavy. That’s about it. Is there anything I should be doing about it, Doctor? Lotion? Elevating my legs? What do you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain or itching with the swelling or discoloration. The brownish discoloration could be from a few things, including venous insufficiency – which is basically when the veins in your legs aren't returning blood to your heart as efficiently. That can cause swelling and changes in skin color. The elevation and lotion are good ideas, but given your blood pressure and the swelling, I think we need to do a bit more investigating. I’d like to order a few blood tests – just a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a CBC to check your blood counts. Also, let's do a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a BNP to check for any signs of heart failure. And just to be safe, I'm going to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… well, I suppose so. I’m not a fan of needles, if you don’t mind. But if you think it’s necessary… go ahead. Heart failure? That sounds… serious. Is that what you think it is? The puffiness? I just thought it was… old age catching up with me. And the hockey, of course. Gets my blood pumping, you know. But heart failure… that’s a bit frightening. What about my legs? Is there anything I can do for the swelling besides putting my feet up? Some sort of cream? Or… I don’t know. Anything? And how long will these tests take? And how will I get the results? I don't have a computer, you see. I'm not very good with all that modern stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take a deep breath. I don’t want to alarm you. We're not diagnosing heart failure right now. The BNP test is just to help us rule things out. It's a simple blood test that can give us some information about how your heart is functioning. As for your legs, elevating them and putting your feet up is a good first step. You can also try wearing compression socks – they help improve circulation and reduce swelling. I can write you a prescription for those. And yes, a topical cream could help with the skin discoloration, but I'd like to see the results of the blood tests before recommending anything specifically. The blood tests should only take about 15-20 minutes. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll take care of you. As for getting the results, since you don’t have a computer, I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available, usually within a couple of days. She can explain everything to you over the phone. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A phone call… yes, that would be much better. I appreciate that. Compression socks… alright, I can try those. Anything to help. And heart failure… well, I suppose we’ll see what the tests say. I just hope it’s not something serious. I don’t want to be stuck in a hospital bed. I have hockey to watch, you know. So, blood tests, compression socks, and a phone call. And my nurse will call. Alright. Is there anything else I need to do? Should I stop drinking beer? Should I watch less hockey? Just tell me what I need to do, Doctor. I’m an old man, I don’t need fancy advice. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, no need to stop drinking beer entirely, but moderate your intake. And definitely don't stop watching hockey! That sounds terrible. For now, focus on elevating your legs whenever you can, try to get some gentle exercise – even just a short walk each day can help – and we’ll see what the blood tests tell us. We may need to adjust your diet or medications down the line, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. I'm writing you a prescription for the compression socks, and I'll have the nurse schedule the blood tests for you right away. She’ll also explain the process over the phone. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I’m not very good with all this medical stuff. But yes, the socks and the tests and the phone call. And try not to worry too much, you said. That’s good advice. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I suppose I’ll just go sit in the waiting room and wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Derick. It was my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before the nurse calls. Take care, and try to relax. The nurse will be with you shortly.
