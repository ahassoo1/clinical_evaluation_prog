DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Parascondola. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my foot’s been botherin’ me. It’s really swollen, mostly just one of ‘em. Been that way for… oh, maybe three, four days now? It hurts to walk on it, especially in the mornin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your foot has been swollen and painful for three or four days, and it’s worse in the morning. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about how it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don't really remember doin’ anything to it. I was workin’ yesterday, mostly sittin’ at my desk, doin’ paperwork. The day before, same thing. I walk to work, it’s not a long walk, maybe ten, fifteen minutes each way. Didn't trip or nothin', just… woke up one mornin’ and it was puffy. I thought maybe I slept funny, but it hasn't gone down.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it came on gradually, without any specific injury that you recall, and it hasn’t improved with rest. Do you feel any pain when you don’t put weight on it?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit. Not as bad as when I’m walkin’ on it, but it’s… a dull ache, even when I’m just sittin’ here. It’s mostly in the… top of my foot, I guess? And around the ankle bone on that side. It feels kinda warm too, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Warmth can be an important sign. And the pain being on top of the foot and around the ankle is helpful. Now, have you noticed any redness or changes in the skin color on your foot or ankle?
PATIENT: Let me see… … Yeah, actually, now that you mention it, it’s a little red around the ankle, on the inside. Not bright red, but… kinda flushed. And the skin feels a little… tight, if I press on it. Not like it’s cut or anything, just… different than the other foot.
DOCTOR: Okay, redness and tightness are good things to note. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms along with the foot pain, like fatigue or body aches?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. I felt a little tired yesterday, but I always feel a little tired after work, you know? Workin’ with those loan applications… it can drain you. No body aches or nothin' like that. Just the foot, really. And it’s makin’ it hard to concentrate, ‘cause it hurts all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you had any previous injuries to that foot or ankle?
PATIENT: No, not that I remember. I sprained my wrist once, years ago, when I was younger, playin’ basketball. But never anything wrong with my feet. I’ve always been pretty careful, walkin’ steady. I don’t do much runnin’ or jumpin’ these days, anyway!
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Sometimes I have a sweet tooth, but I try not to overdo it. The doctor always said my blood pressure was a little high once, a long time ago, but it went back down when I lost a little weight. Other than that… pretty healthy, I think. No regular medications, nothin’ like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve taken antibiotics before, when I had a bad cold, and never had a reaction. Same with over-the-counter stuff, like pain relievers. I can take aspirin, ibuprofen… no problems. I don’t take ‘em often, but when I do, I’m fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, before we do a quick examination of your foot, can you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Sure. I work at the credit union, down on Elm Street. I'm a loan interviewer, mostly. People come in, want to borrow money for cars or somethin', and I talk to ‘em, look at their paperwork, see if they can pay it back. It’s a lot of sittin', like I said. And a lot of lookin’ at numbers. Not very exciting, but it pays the bills.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. A lot of sitting can sometimes contribute to swelling. Now, would you mind if I took a look at your foot?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go ahead. It's just… it's a little tender, so be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to gently feel around your ankle and foot. Let me know if anything is particularly painful. …Okay, I do notice some swelling around the ankle, and it is tender to the touch here and here… There’s also some redness in that area. Your range of motion seems mostly intact, but it’s a little uncomfortable when I move it this way… … I also want to check your pulses in your foot. Your pulses are present, but they’re a little weak on this foot compared to the other. I’m also going to check the skin temperature. … It’s slightly warmer than your other foot.
PATIENT: Okay… that doesn’t sound good, does it? Weak pulses… warmer skin… I don’t like the sound of that. What does all that mean, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascondola. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it sounds like you may have a blood clot in your leg, specifically deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, which is affecting the circulation in your foot. The swelling, pain, redness, warmth, and the weak pulse are all consistent with that diagnosis. However, I need to be clear: this is a potential diagnosis, and we need to confirm it with some imaging. I would like to order a Doppler ultrasound of your leg to visualize the blood flow and see if there is a clot present. A DVT can be serious, as the clot could potentially travel to your lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, it’s important we get this checked out quickly. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A blood clot?! Oh, goodness… goin’ to my lungs… that sounds… scary. … I… I didn’t even know that was possible. So, this ultrasound… will that tell us for sure? And if it is a clot… what do they do about it? Are you sayin’ I need… surgery?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Parascondola, and it's natural to be worried. A Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive test, meaning it doesn't involve any needles or incisions. It uses sound waves to create an image of the blood vessels in your leg, and it’s very accurate in detecting blood clots. If the ultrasound confirms a DVT, the good news is that it’s often treatable with medication. Typically, we use blood thinners, also called anticoagulants, to prevent the clot from growing larger and to reduce the risk of it traveling to your lungs. In most cases, surgery is not required. We would likely start you on a blood thinner right away, and you would need to take it for several months, or possibly longer, depending on the severity of the clot and your individual risk factors. We would monitor your blood regularly to ensure the medication is working correctly. I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to manage this and keep you safe. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… medication… that sounds better than surgery, for sure. … Regular blood tests… alright. Now… what caused this? Is it somethin’ I did? Like, all that sittin’ at work? Or is it just… somethin’ that happens? And is it contagious? Could I give this to somebody else?
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Mr. Parascondola. The cause of a DVT isn’t always clear. Several factors can increase your risk, including prolonged immobility – so yes, sitting for long periods can be a contributing factor – age, obesity, a history of blood clots, and certain medical conditions. Sometimes, it can happen for no apparent reason. As for whether it’s contagious, no, a DVT is not contagious. You cannot “give” a blood clot to someone else. Given your work situation, prolonged sitting is a plausible contributor. We’ll also want to rule out any other underlying factors with some blood work. I'll order a complete blood count and a D-dimer test, which can help confirm the presence of a blood clot and rule out other conditions. We'll also discuss some preventative measures you can take to reduce your risk of future clots, such as getting up and moving around frequently throughout the day, staying hydrated, and wearing compression stockings. Does that help to address your concerns?
PATIENT: Okay… that makes sense. Compression stockings… I’ve heard of those. Gettin’ up and movin’ around… I can definitely do that. So… what happens now? Do I need to go to the hospital for this ultrasound? And how long will it take to get the results? I got work tomorrow… and I don’t want to worry my boss unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: We can schedule the ultrasound at the imaging center here in town. You don’t need to go to the hospital. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes, and it’s a painless procedure. I’ll write you a referral order now. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, while we're waiting for the results, I'm going to recommend that you avoid prolonged sitting as much as possible. If you do need to sit for extended periods, try to get up and walk around every hour. Also, elevate your leg whenever possible, and drink plenty of fluids. Regarding your work, I understand your concern about worrying your boss. You don't need to disclose any medical details if you're not comfortable doing so. You can simply let them know that you have a medical appointment and may need to take some time off if the ultrasound confirms a clot. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results, and we’ll discuss the next steps at that time. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful… and you’ve definitely put my mind a little bit at ease. … I’ll go schedule that ultrasound right away.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Parascondola. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this, and I'm here to support you. Have a good day, and I’ll speak to you soon.
