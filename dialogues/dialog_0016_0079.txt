DOCTOR: Hi Courtnye, welcome! I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, to get started, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Maskal, nice to meet you too. Um, it's this bruising. It's been getting worse, and I'm on a blood thinner, so... it's a little worrying. I just want to figure out what’s going on, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out, especially being on a blood thinner. Can you tell me a little more about the bruising?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, it started, I think, maybe a week ago? Small bruises, like from bumping into things, normal stuff. But they're bigger now, and I don’t even remember hitting myself. I noticed one on my arm yesterday that I definitely didn’t do anything to. And my legs feel a little tender, like… underneath the skin. Does that make sense? I'm not usually this clumsy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely makes sense. Bruising that happens easily and without a clear injury, and tenderness in your legs, is something we want to look into. Just to get a full picture, can you describe where exactly on your legs you're feeling the tenderness?
PATIENT: Okay. It's… mostly in my calves, I think? Like, the back of my legs. Not a sharp pain, just… achy. And a little bit around my shins too, if I press on them. It's not awful, but it's definitely new. I haven't been doing anything different, honestly. No new exercise or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, calves and shins, achy and new… good to know. Now, thinking a bit broader, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bruising and tenderness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, I don't think. I've been a little tired, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days? No bleeding gums or anything like that. And no dizziness. Just… the bruising and the achey legs. Oh! And maybe a little bit of shortness of breath, but that could just be the heat, it's been so hot here. I haven’t really paid much attention to it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, bleeding, or dizziness. Fatigue and possible shortness of breath, but potentially heat-related. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that's it. No diabetes, no heart problems… nothing. I'm pretty healthy, usually. And like I said, that's why this is worrying me! It’s just… not normal for me. I don’t take any other medications besides the blood thinner.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, otherwise healthy, just the blood thinner. And what blood thinner are you currently taking, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: It's… Warfarin. My doctor prescribed it after I had a blood clot in my leg a few years ago. I have to get my levels checked regularly, and they usually seem okay. I think they were okay at my last appointment, but it was a couple of months ago. I can give you the exact number if you need it? I have the paperwork at home.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Warfarin after a blood clot. Yes, if you have that paperwork with your most recent INR, that would be great. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing at all. I can eat anything, take any medicine... that's another reason why this is so weird. I haven't changed anything in my life! Okay, hold on a sec… I think this is it… yeah, here we go. My INR was 2.3 at my last check-up, on June 15th. It says “therapeutic range.” Does that mean anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, 2.3 is within the therapeutic range for Warfarin, so that's reassuring. Okay, and just to round things out, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… okay. My mom had high blood pressure, and my grandpa had some heart problems, I think. But nothing major. Nobody else that I know of had blood clots or anything like that. Mostly just… normal old age stuff, you know? Nothing really relevant, I don’t think. I'm Tongan, if that makes a difference? I don't know if there are any specific things we're prone to.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And thank you for mentioning your heritage, sometimes that can be helpful. Okay, one last area. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, I work as an Information Security Analyst, so I sit at a desk most of the day. Not a lot of physical activity, unfortunately. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. I don’t drink or smoke. I live alone, so… pretty quiet life, really. I'm single, and not really doing much socializing these days. I mostly just want to get this bruising figured out and get back to work. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a look at your legs where you're experiencing the tenderness and bruising. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I'm ready. Let's just get it over with, please. I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound good. Now, let's take a look at your legs. I do notice some tenderness in your calves, especially on the left side, and a little bit of swelling. The bruising does appear widespread. I don't feel any warmth or redness, which is good, but the swelling is something to note. I'm going to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It’ll include a complete blood count, a coagulation panel to check your Warfarin levels again, and a D-dimer to rule out any recent blood clot. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… thorough. Blood work is fine. Just tell me when I can get it done. And hopefully it’s not too long, I really need to get back to work. I appreciate you looking into it.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand you need to get back to work. I'm going to write you a lab order now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of it right away. It typically takes a few hours for the results to come back. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity, and if you notice any new or worsening symptoms, like significant swelling, pain, or shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah. No strenuous activity, watch for new symptoms, go to the ER if needed… got it. Hopefully it’s nothing serious. Okay, thanks Dr. Maskal. I appreciate it. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Yes, you can go ahead. I'll be in touch as soon as we have the lab results. If you have any questions or concerns before then, don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
