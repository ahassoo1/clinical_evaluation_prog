DOCTOR: Hi Liza, welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s lovely to meet you, Doctor. Please, call me Liza. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’m interested in learning about mindfulness or meditation. I keep hearing good things, and honestly, life feels a little… much sometimes. I thought maybe you could point me in the right direction, or tell me if it’s even something that would help me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Liza, that's perfectly reasonable. A lot of people are exploring mindfulness these days. It can be really helpful for managing stress, anxiety… just generally feeling overwhelmed. Hmm. To get a better sense of if it’s a good fit, and to rule out anything else contributing to how you’re feeling, could you tell me a little more about what “much” feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear it’s not… strange! Well, it’s not like I’m constantly stressed, Doctor. It’s more… scattered thoughts, I suppose. I work with the railway, fixing signals and switches – very precise work! – and sometimes, even when I’m not at work, my mind is still running through checklists, worrying about things that could go wrong. It makes it hard to… switch off, you know? And I find myself getting easily distracted. Not hugely, but enough to be irritating. I sleep fine, though. And I eat reasonably well. It's just...a feeling of being a bit uncentered, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, scattered thoughts, running through work checklists even when you're off the clock, feeling distracted… and generally uncentered. That paints a good picture, Liza. And good that your sleep and diet are solid. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, Doctor. No big changes. My work is pretty consistent, the same sort of problems mostly. I haven’t been feeling sadder or anything, just… frazzled, I suppose. I do get a little lonely sometimes, being single and all, but that’s been the case for a while. It’s not new. Oh! Actually… my neighbor’s dog has been barking a lot lately. It's probably a silly thing, but it's quite disruptive when I'm trying to relax in the garden. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, that absolutely counts, Liza. Constant noise can be incredibly irritating and contribute to feeling uncentered. We need to consider everything. So, no sadness, no major life changes… just the work thoughts, the feeling of being scattered, and the neighbor’s dog. Okay. I'm going to ask a few questions, just to get a broader picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing at all, Doctor. I’m generally quite healthy, actually. I’ve always been lucky that way. Just the usual colds and flu now and then, but nothing serious. Medicare covers my check-ups, and they always say everything looks good. I had my blood pressure checked just last month – perfectly normal, they said. I don’t take any medications regularly, either. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if needed.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. No prior diagnoses, generally healthy, normal blood pressure… not on any regular medications. And no allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Not to anything food-related, anyway. And I don't react to pollen or animals, or anything like that. I used to help my grandmother in her garden, and she had lots of flowers, so I'd know if I was allergic! No, no allergies at all, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Liza. Based on what you’ve told me, and your generally good health, it sounds like what you're experiencing is likely stress and a bit of mental fatigue, exacerbated perhaps by the constant demands of your job and… the neighbor’s dog. Mindfulness and meditation are definitely worth exploring. Before we dive into resources, I’d like to do a quick, basic exam just to rule out anything else contributing to your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. I’d rather be sure. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just hop up on the table for me. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then just do a quick neurological check – reflexes, balance… nothing to worry about. Heart sounds are regular, normal rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes… Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s easy enough. I do a lot of precise work, so I'm quite good at focusing my eyes. I hope I'm not making it too difficult for you!
DOCTOR: Not at all, Liza. You're doing perfectly. Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There you go. Is that alright? I try to keep my hands strong for my work, so I don't have any trouble with that either!
DOCTOR: Good strength in both hands. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes in your knees and ankles. This might feel a little strange, just a quick tap with this little hammer. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Balance seems good as well. Everything looks good, Liza. Neurologically, you're perfectly fine. Physical exam doesn’t reveal anything contributing to your symptoms. It sounds like this is likely a combination of stress and mental fatigue, as we discussed.
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you for being so thorough. So, what do you suggest now? What about these mindfulness and meditation techniques? Do you have any recommendations for where to start? Perhaps an app, or a class? I'm not sure where to begin.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. Glad we could rule out anything else. As for mindfulness and meditation, there are lots of excellent resources. For an app, Headspace and Calm are both very popular and beginner-friendly. They offer guided meditations of varying lengths, tailored to different needs. There are also a lot of free resources online, like guided meditations on YouTube. And if you prefer a more structured approach, I can give you a list of local meditation classes. I have a pamphlet here with information on some reputable centers in the area. Ultimately, the best approach is to experiment and find what works for you. Start small – maybe just 5-10 minutes a day – and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable. The key is consistency. Do any of those options sound appealing to you?
PATIENT: That’s wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much. The apps sound like a good place to start, actually. Something I can do at home, when I have a few quiet moments. Headspace and Calm, you said? I’ll definitely look into both of them. And it’s good to know about the classes, in case I want to try something more structured later on. You’ve been very helpful. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any particular breathing exercises, or anything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Liza. Glad I could help. As for breathing exercises, diaphragmatic breathing – also known as belly breathing – can be very effective for reducing stress and anxiety. It involves focusing on breathing deeply from your diaphragm, rather than shallowly from your chest. There are lots of tutorials online, or I can demonstrate it quickly if you’d like. Essentially, you place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly, and focus on making your belly rise and fall with each breath, while keeping your chest relatively still. Also, making time for regular physical activity – even just a 30-minute walk each day – can do wonders for your mental wellbeing. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds manageable, actually. I do enjoy walking, so I can definitely incorporate that into my routine. And the belly breathing… I think I’ve heard of that before. I'll look up a tutorial online, and give it a try. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at the moment, Doctor. You’ve covered everything beautifully. Thank you again for your time and patience. I feel much more optimistic now, knowing where to start.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Liza. I'm glad to hear that. Remember, it takes time and practice to develop these skills, so be patient with yourself. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you're not seeing the results you’re hoping for, or if you have any concerns. Here’s my card with the clinic’s contact information. I’m happy to see you again in a few weeks to check in on your progress, if you’d like. Otherwise, have a wonderful day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Polczynski. I will definitely keep your card, and I might take you up on that offer in a few weeks. You’ve been a tremendous help. Have a lovely day to you too. .
