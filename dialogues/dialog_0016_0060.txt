DOCTOR: Hi Blain, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thanks. It’s… nice to meet you too, I guess. Look, my family… we have a history. A bad history, really. Lots of, you know, things going wrong. My grandmother, my aunt… it’s always something. And honestly, I’m starting to worry about myself. I just want to be sure I’m okay. I want some reassurance, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Blain. It's very responsible of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history you're concerned about. We can definitely talk through everything and try to get you that reassurance. Okay, so I see you're 24 years old. Can you tell me a little more about what specific "things going wrong" in your family history you’re referring to?
PATIENT: Right, 24. Divorced, actually. People always skip that part. Anyway. Um… my grandmother died of… something with her heart, I think? My mom never really talked about it much. And my aunt… she had cancer. Lung cancer, I believe. Smoked a lot, which is a whole other story. There’s been diabetes too, on my father’s side. A lot of it, honestly. It feels like a ticking time bomb, if I’m being frank. I don't want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Blain. It sounds like there’s a significant history of cardiac issues, cancer, and diabetes in your family. That’s good information to have. Knowing the specifics helps us focus our attention. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about your own health?
PATIENT: Sure. I… I think I’m pretty healthy, actually. I mean, I don’t really feel sick. I try to eat okay, mostly. I don’t smoke, thank goodness. I used to be more active, but… well, things happen. I work long hours. Engineering teacher, you know? It’s demanding. I guess I get tired a lot, but who doesn’t? No major problems, though. No chronic illnesses or anything like that. At least, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Blain. It’s positive that you don’t smoke and you feel generally healthy. Working long hours as a teacher is definitely a factor. Fatigue can be caused by a lot of things, so we'll explore that a bit. Let's do a quick review of systems, just to cover all the bases. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Weight… no, not really. Maybe a couple of pounds, but nothing drastic. Appetite’s been okay. I skip breakfast sometimes, but that's just because I’m busy. Sleep… that’s the one thing. I don’t sleep well. I toss and turn a lot. It takes me ages to fall asleep, and then I wake up a few times during the night. It’s probably just stress. Honestly, I think it's just the job. But it's been going on for months now, so... I guess it's not just stress.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Consistent difficulty with sleep for months is definitely something we should look into further. It's good you recognize it's not solely stress, even if that’s a large part of it. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I mean, sometimes my heart feels a little fast when I’m really stressed, but that’s about it. Not like… a constant thing, or painful. I do get headaches sometimes, though. Tension headaches, mostly. Again, probably the job. I spend all day staring at a computer screen. It's awful. I've been meaning to get my eyes checked too, actually. Everything just feels… strained. But no chest pain or breathing problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain or breathing difficulties, that's good. Tension headaches and eye strain are common with your work, and getting your eyes checked is a good idea. Any issues with your digestive system?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything's… regular, if you want to put it that way. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, if I eat something spicy. But nothing serious. No stomach problems, no bowel issues, nothing like that. I'm not one of those people who has to worry about that. Honestly, I feel like I'm wasting your time with all this "nothing." I just… I worry. A lot.
DOCTOR: You’re not wasting my time at all, Blain. It’s important to rule things out, especially with your family history and your concerns. It's better to be thorough. Okay, let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general health. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. I guess that makes sense. I mean, if you think it’s necessary. I just… I hope it’s nothing. I have a lot going on, you know? School starts soon, and I really don’t have time to be sick. But yeah, go ahead. Just try not to take too long, okay? I have a lot to prepare.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. I'll be as efficient as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 128/76, which is normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular and lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Everything seems normal on the physical exam, which is good. But given your family history of cardiac issues, diabetes and cancer, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a hemoglobin A1c to check your blood sugar levels. Also, a TSH to check your thyroid function, and a basic urinalysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests. Look, I appreciate you being thorough, but honestly, I was hoping to just… get reassurance. I feel like all you’re doing is looking for problems. But fine. If you think it’s necessary. Yes, go ahead and order the tests. But if everything comes back normal, I want you to tell me that. I want you to tell me I’m okay. I just… I need to know. And please, can you just write a referral for a sleep study? I can't keep functioning like this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Blain. It’s not my intention to make you feel like I’m looking for problems, but rather being proactive in ruling things out based on your family history. The tests will give us a clearer picture and help me provide you with the reassurance you’re seeking. Okay, I’ve ordered the blood tests. The results should be back in a few days. I'm also writing a referral for a sleep study now. It's good you're addressing the sleep issue. Once we have the blood test results, we can discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the emergency room. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just… please call me as soon as you have the results. I’m really anxious about this. And thank you, I guess. For… listening.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Blain. I completely understand your anxiety, and I will personally make sure to contact you as soon as the results are available. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. .
