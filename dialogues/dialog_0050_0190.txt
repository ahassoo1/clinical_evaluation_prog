DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, I’ve been… feeling a bit unsteady on my feet. It’s hard to explain, exactly. Like I might fall, sometimes. It's been… worrying me. Honestly, I don’t recall when it started, precisely. Just that it’s been happening.
DOCTOR: I see. “Feeling unsteady” is rather broad, Ms. Snerling. Let’s attempt to narrow that down, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I apologize. It is broad. It’s not… constant. Some days are better than others. And it doesn't feel like weakness, exactly. More like… everything is tilting, perhaps? Or… shifting? I'm having trouble putting it into words. It’s quite frustrating, actually. I feel… off-balance.
DOCTOR: "Off-balance," alright. And has this feeling been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… Not that I recall, specifically. Perhaps a bit of… dizziness, on occasion? Though I've always been prone to feeling a little lightheaded, so it’s hard to say if that’s new. And… oh! There was that one instance where things seemed a little blurry, but that was only once, after a particularly long shift at work. I don't know if that's related, though.
DOCTOR: A single instance of blurry vision following a long work shift. Noted. And what sort of work do you do, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: I operate a rotary drill, Doctor. It's... oil and gas work. Quite physical, to be honest. Lots of vibration, and I'm on my feet for extended periods. It’s demanding. And, well, my husband… he used to say I pushed myself too hard.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Oil and gas work, involving substantial vibration and prolonged standing… That’s pertinent information. Are you experiencing any pain associated with this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: No, not pain, Doctor. That's one thing I can say for certain. It’s not a painful sensation at all. It's more… disconcerting. Like my inner ear is… off. Or something isn’t quite right with my equilibrium, perhaps? But no ache, no sharpness, nothing like that. It's just... unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any ringing in your ears – tinnitus – or any changes in your hearing recently?
PATIENT: Ringing… You know, I hadn't really thought about it. There's a lot of noise at work, of course. Constant machinery. It's… difficult to discern much beyond that, if that makes sense? I wouldn't say there's a constant ringing, no. But I haven't specifically listened for it, either. I suppose it's possible. It wouldn't be unusual, given the environment.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s discuss your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: Um… That’s… a difficult question. My husband handled most of the medical appointments. I recall a… a touch of high blood pressure, perhaps? Several years ago. But it wasn’t severe, and I believe it was managed with diet and exercise. And… after my husband passed, everything became a bit… hazy. I truly apologize, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be. I’m sure there was something, but I can’t readily recall.
DOCTOR: It’s quite alright, Ms. Snerling. Grief can certainly affect one’s recall. I’ll make a note to check your electronic health record. In the meantime, have you undergone any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? No, I don't believe so. Not that I recall. Nothing major, certainly. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, but that was… quite a long time ago. And nothing since then. I distinctly remember my husband saying he disliked hospitals, so he always encouraged me to avoid them if possible.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Aversion to hospitals. Noted. Let's move on to family history. Are your parents, siblings, or other close relatives prone to any specific medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family… That's another area where my memory fails me. My parents both passed away when I was quite young. And I don’t have any siblings. I was an only child. As for extended family… I haven’t been in contact with them for many years. I… I truly wish I could be more helpful, Doctor, but I simply don’t recall. I know it’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Indeed. We shall proceed. Now, do you take any medications currently, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not currently. I haven't required any medication since… well, not for quite some time. Just a multivitamin occasionally. I try to eat a healthy diet, but it's difficult with the long shifts at work. I haven't had much reason to visit a doctor, thankfully, until now.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are you allergic to any medications or substances, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I've never experienced an allergic reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. No food allergies, no reactions to insect bites, nothing of that nature. I suppose I could be allergic to something I haven't encountered yet, but I haven't had any issues in the past.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's proceed with a physical examination. If you would please be so kind as to lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your neurological assessment.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. As you wish. Please let me know if you need anything. I… I hope you discover what’s causing this unsteadiness. It's quite unsettling to feel so… off-balance.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Snerling, please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Good. Now, I am going to test your reflexes. This may be slightly uncomfortable. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Please sit up slowly. Now, close your eyes and extend both arms forward. Slight pronator drift noted in the left arm. Now, stand up slowly. Mild sway noted with eyes closed. No Romberg sign. Finally, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your heart and lungs sound normal. The neurological exam shows slight pronator drift on the left side and mild sway with eyes closed. These findings are subtle, but warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation…? What does that entail, Doctor? Is it… serious? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I confess I'm rather worried. This is all rather… unsettling. What could be causing this pronator drift and sway? Is it something from the work? I do spend a great deal of time on my feet, and it’s quite physical, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned, Ms. Snerling, and I appreciate you voicing your concerns. The pronator drift and mild sway are not immediately alarming, but they do indicate a possible issue with your neurological system. It's too early to definitively say whether it's related to your work, but it certainly warrants consideration. Prolonged physical exertion and vibration can sometimes contribute to neurological symptoms. To investigate further, I recommend a few tests. First, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Secondly, I believe an MRI of the brain would be prudent to assess for any structural abnormalities. Finally, I'd like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you have any objections to these tests, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: An MRI… and a neurologist… That sounds… quite extensive. But… if it will determine what's causing this, then I suppose I have no objections. Though, to be honest, I’m a little apprehensive. I've never had an MRI before. Is it… unpleasant? And a neurologist… is it something serious? I apologize for being so… anxious, Doctor, but this is all rather overwhelming. I just want to know what’s wrong, and I want to feel… stable again.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Snerling, and it’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed. An MRI is a non-invasive procedure – you lie inside a large magnet, and it takes images of your brain. It can be a little noisy and you’ll need to lie very still, but it’s not painful. The technician will explain the process thoroughly before the scan. As for the neurologist, it doesn't necessarily mean something serious. A neurologist is a specialist in the nervous system, and they are best equipped to diagnose and treat conditions affecting the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. We are simply gathering information at this stage. To summarize, I will order the blood tests today. I will also provide you with a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly regarded neurologist in the area. She will contact you to schedule an appointment. While awaiting your neurology appointment, please refrain from any strenuous activity and monitor your symptoms. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as weakness, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma… I'll write that down. No strenuous activity… I suppose that’s for the best, though it may complicate things at work. I’ll have to discuss that with my supervisor. And I will certainly monitor my symptoms, and seek immediate attention if anything changes. No, I believe that covers everything for now, Doctor. Thank you for your thoroughness, and for explaining everything so patiently. I… I appreciate your kindness. I feel a little less anxious, knowing we have a plan in place. .
