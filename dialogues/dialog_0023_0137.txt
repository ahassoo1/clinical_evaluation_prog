DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is okay if I call you Doctor? My… my son, he make appointment. I need paper for… for the old people place. He say I need check-up first.
DOCTOR: Yes, “Doctor” is perfectly acceptable. And your son is quite right to have you come in for a check-up before applying to assisted living. It’s standard procedure, and allows us to get a baseline of your health. So, tell me – and please, don’t hesitate to interrupt if I’m going too fast – what specifically are you hoping we accomplish today?
PATIENT: Hmm… baseline? Is like… start? I just need the paper. My son, he say they need know if I… strong enough. I feel okay, mostly. Little tired sometimes, but who no tired? I don’t know what they need to know exactly. Is that what the paper is for? To tell them what I need?
DOCTOR: Yes, “baseline” is a good way to put it. It’s a starting point. We need to assess your overall health – your strength, your cognitive function, any underlying medical issues – to determine the appropriate level of care. The assisted living facility needs this information to ensure they can meet your needs. It’s not simply what you need, but also what limitations you might have. Let’s start with this: Have you been experiencing any new or worsening symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… symptoms? Let me think. My knee, it hurts sometimes, when it rain. Always happen. And I forget things… but I always forget things! Is just old age, I think. Nothing new. Maybe… maybe I sleep more now than before. But is hot, you know? Very hot this summer. Makes you tired.
DOCTOR: Okay. Knee pain with the weather, increased sleepiness… both reasonable for your age, as you say. But we still need to document everything. Let’s go through a few things systematically. First, regarding your knee pain – on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate it on a typical day?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmm. Is hard. When it not rain, maybe… two? Three? When it rain, maybe… six? Seven? Sometimes I can’t walk good. But I take little pills, the white ones. They help.
DOCTOR: White pills… alright, we’ll get to your medications in a moment. Six or seven during rain is significant. And you mentioned difficulty walking. Is that difficulty constant, or only when the pain is severe?
PATIENT: No, not constant. Just when it rain, or if I walk too much. Like… if I go shopping. My daughter, she take me sometimes. But I like walk. I used to walk everywhere. Now… not so much. Is sad.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s frustrating when physical limitations change your routine. We’ll want to address that pain. Now, you mentioned increased sleepiness. Is this just feeling more tired, or are you actually sleeping longer hours than usual?
PATIENT: I think… longer. I used to wake up early, make coffee, read the paper. Now… I sleep, and I wake up, and I want to sleep more. Sometimes I nap in the afternoon. My husband, he say I sleep too much. He worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Increased sleep duration, especially with daytime napping… We need to rule out other potential causes for that. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she have the sugar. But not me. I think. Doctor check me sometimes. For… for everything. He give me pills for my water, he say it high. And… and my heart, he listen to it. He say is okay, but I get… dizzy sometimes. Not often, but when I stand up too fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of being treated for high blood pressure and… what did the doctor say about the dizziness?
PATIENT: He say… is old age. He say sometimes when you get old, your head… it spin. He tell me to drink more water. And… and stand up slow. That’s what he say. He no give me pills for the dizzy. Just water.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, treated hypertension, occasional dizziness upon standing… and no medication for the dizziness. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Let me think… long time ago, when my daughter was born. Is… is very long time ago. And… and when I break my arm, when I was young. Fall from the tree. But that was a long, long time ago. Nothing since.
DOCTOR: Okay, previous hospitalization for childbirth and a broken arm. No recent hospitalizations. Now, let's talk about medications. You mentioned white pills for your blood pressure. Can you tell me the name of those pills, or perhaps bring a list of all the medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: White pills… I no know the name. My son, he get them for me. He go to the store. I just take them. He tell me how many. Every morning. I have… I have other pills too. For my… for my bones. They are little and yellow. And sometimes I take a pain pill when my knee hurt bad. But I no know the names. I sorry.
DOCTOR: It’s important for me to know exactly what medications you’re taking, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s a matter of safety. Do you have a medication list anywhere?
PATIENT: No. I no have. My son, he keep it maybe? He always have everything. But he no here. I just take what he give me. He good son. He take care of me. But I no know the names. Is hard to remember. I sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to obtain a complete medication list from your son. In the meantime, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No… I don’t think so. I eat everything. Sometimes my stomach hurt, but I think is because I eat too much. I no know of anything I can’t eat. And no… no allergies to pills. I take so many pills, if I was allergic, I think I would know.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Now, let's briefly discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she have the sugar, like I say. And… and my father, he have… I don’t know what he have. He die when I was young. And my sister, she have… something with her heart, I think. She take pills too. But I no know much. Is long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history of diabetes, potential heart condition. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Oh no. I no smoke. Never smoke. My husband, he used to smoke, but he stop long time ago. And no… no alcohol. Is bad for you. And… and no… no nothing else. I good woman.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, let me just recap. You’re here for a check-up required by the assisted living facility. You report increased sleepiness, occasional knee pain exacerbated by weather, treated hypertension, dizziness upon standing, and a family history of diabetes and potential heart condition. You’re currently taking multiple medications, the names of which we need to confirm. And you deny any allergies, smoking, or alcohol use. Now, I’m going to perform a brief physical exam. This will include checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and assessing your reflexes and strength. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That okay. The exam is okay. I… I hope everything is okay. I just want to get paper so I can go to the old people place. My son, he say it nice there.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 85. Slightly elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, but slightly distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Some mild discomfort noted with range of motion in the right knee. No swelling or redness observed. Alright. Everything appears reasonably stable, but we need to address your blood pressure and the discomfort in your knee. And, again, we absolutely need a complete medication list. I will need to order some routine blood work to get a better baseline. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that okay. The blood work is okay. And the… the pills. I will ask my son when he come. He always know. I hope the blood work no take too long. I want to go to the old people place soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll order the blood work now. You'll receive a call to schedule an appointment at the lab. Once the results are back, we'll discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I’ll write a preliminary note for the assisted living facility outlining your current condition. Ms. Abdollahi, it’s crucial that you provide me with a complete medication list as soon as possible. It is a matter of patient safety. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes. I understand. I will ask my son. He… he will tell me. I promise. I don't want… I don't want any trouble. Just want to go to the old people place.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll make a note of that. I'll see you again once the blood work results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please contact the office immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. Thank you… thank you very much. I hope you have good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. You too, Ms. Abdollahi. Honestly, the lack of information…
