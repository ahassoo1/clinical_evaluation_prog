DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I received the results from the test… the one the specialist did, looking inside… my stomach, was it? And it seems there was something… not quite right. They sent the report to your office, I believe. I’m a bit anxious, if I may be frank. It’s just… unsettling, not knowing.
DOCTOR: Yes, I received a report from Dr. Ramirez regarding your endoscopy. “Something not quite right” is… vague, unfortunately. I understand your anxiety, Ms. Minatra, but we need to be specific. Do you recall what Dr. Ramirez said was concerning?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You’re right, of course. My memory is usually quite good, but the details… they rushed me through it all, honestly. I do remember him mentioning… inflammation, perhaps? And something about the lining not looking smooth. He used a word… like a little sore, but technical. It wasn't a pleasant word. He said I needed to see you for further discussion and probably… more tests? It was a bit of a blur, honestly. He was very busy. Do you have the report there? Perhaps that would be clearer.
DOCTOR: Yes, here we are. “Gastric mucosa demonstrates moderate inflammation with areas of erosions noted in the antrum and body.” Erosions, Ms. Minatra, are essentially small sores or breaks in the lining of your stomach. Moderate inflammation means there’s some irritation present. It is good you came in to discuss this. Now, are you experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh… “erosions.” That sounds… unpleasant. Thank you for explaining. Yes, well, I have been having some discomfort. Mostly in my upper abdomen, a sort of… burning sensation. It comes and goes, really. Worse when I’ve eaten, I think. And occasionally… a bit of nausea. Not vomiting, thankfully, just… feeling queasy. It’s been going on for… oh, several weeks, at least. I just assumed it was something I ate, or maybe indigestion. Is that… what this could be?
DOCTOR: Burning sensation and nausea… that certainly fits with what we’re seeing on the report. Indigestion is possible, Ms. Minatra, but given the erosions, we need to investigate further. Before we jump to conclusions, let's go through some basics. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Oh my. Black, tarry stools… no, thankfully not. I haven’t seen any blood at all, actually. Just… the discomfort, as I mentioned. And occasionally feeling rather tired, but I put that down to my age, honestly. I’m 67 now, and one does feel… a bit more weary as the years go by. But no, no blood. And my appetite is… fairly normal, I suppose. Although I’ve been eating less red meat lately, just because it hasn’t been appealing. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Reduced appetite for red meat… it's unlikely to be directly related, Ms. Minatra, but good to know. We're looking for signs of bleeding, which could indicate a more serious issue. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor, none that I’m aware of. I’ve been fortunate in that regard. And I haven’t been taking any medications regularly, aside from a small dose of ibuprofen now and then for arthritis in my hands. Nothing prescribed, just over-the-counter. I try to avoid pills if I can, honestly. I prefer natural remedies when possible, though I haven't found anything that really helps with the arthritis, unfortunately. Is ibuprofen… a problem with this? Should I stop taking it?
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen… yes, that is a concern. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen, can irritate the stomach lining and actually cause erosions. It's quite common. Ideally, we’d stop that immediately. Now, have you ever had any previous medical procedures or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… discouraging to hear. I’ll stop taking it right away, of course. I hadn’t realized it could cause this. As for procedures… let me think. Nothing major, really. I had my tonsils removed as a child, a very long time ago. And I’ve had the usual vaccinations, as one does. Oh, and I had a small skin tag removed from my back a few years ago, but that was a simple procedure, done in a dermatologist’s office. Nothing… internal, if that makes sense. No colonoscopies or anything like that. I always avoided those, frankly. Seemed rather intrusive.
DOCTOR: No colonoscopies… alright. Ms. Minatra, while I respect your preferences, it's important to understand that given your symptoms and the findings on the endoscopy, we need to get a clearer picture of what's going on. The endoscopy only allows us to see the stomach, not the entire digestive tract. Now, tell me about your family history. Are there any instances of stomach cancer, ulcers, or inflammatory bowel disease in your family?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. I suppose I understand. A clearer picture… yes, that makes sense. Family history… that’s a good question. Let me think. My mother… she had terrible indigestion all her life, always complaining of heartburn. But I don’t believe she ever had any tests done. She just… suffered through it. My father… he was a very healthy man, actually. Lived to be 85. No known stomach problems that I’m aware of. My sister… she had some issues with her gallbladder a few years ago, but that’s it. No cancer, no ulcers… not that I know of. We weren’t very close, so I don’t know much about her medical history, to be honest. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Not entirely conclusive, Ms. Minatra, but it’s good to know. We can't rule anything out at this stage. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I've never smoked. Never had the inclination. My husband… he smoked for a few years when he was younger, but he quit a long time ago, thankfully. I always discouraged it. And I don't drink alcohol very often, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but nothing excessive. I prefer tea, honestly. Herbal tea, mostly. Does that matter? I try to lead a healthy life, all things considered. I enjoy gardening, keeps me active.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Minatra. Gardening is excellent. Now, let’s talk about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat a balanced diet. For breakfast, usually oatmeal with some fruit. Sometimes toast. For lunch, a salad with chicken or fish, or a sandwich. Nothing too heavy. And for dinner… it varies. I enjoy cooking, so I try different things. Chicken or fish again, often with vegetables. Pasta sometimes, but not too much. I avoid fried foods, mostly. I try to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and I drink a lot of water. I'm not a fan of fast food or sugary drinks. Does that sound… reasonable? I'm trying to be mindful of what I eat, especially as I get older. I’ve been reading about healthy eating habits, trying to incorporate them into my routine.
DOCTOR: That sounds… quite reasonable, yes. Very conscientious. Now, Ms. Minatra, based on your symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle, I suspect we’re dealing with gastritis – inflammation of the stomach lining. The erosions on the endoscopy support that. However, to rule out other possibilities, such as Helicobacter pylori infection or, less likely given your family history, early stages of stomach cancer, I would like to order some further tests. I'd like to order a stool test to check for H. pylori and a blood test to check for anemia. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Gastritis… that doesn't sound pleasant. But… less frightening than cancer, certainly. And yes, of course, Doctor, whatever you think is best. A stool test and a blood test… absolutely. I trust your judgment. The sooner we know what’s going on, the better. I just want to feel… better, honestly. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Besides stopping the ibuprofen, of course? Should I change my diet further? Anything I should avoid entirely?
DOCTOR: Yes. While we await the test results, I recommend a bland diet. Avoid spicy foods, acidic foods like citrus fruits and tomatoes, caffeine, alcohol, and fatty foods. Small, frequent meals are better than large ones. And absolutely no ibuprofen. I also recommend avoiding stress as much as possible. I know, easier said than done. But stress can exacerbate gastritis symptoms. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That rather eliminates a lot of my favorite foods! But… I understand. Bland diet… small, frequent meals… no ibuprofen… and avoid stress. I’ll do my best. It’s just… my sister is visiting next week, and she can be… a bit of a handful. But I’ll try to remain calm. No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. How long will it take to get the results of the tests? And… will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: The tests should take approximately three to five business days. The lab will contact you directly with the results. Yes, you will need to come back for a follow-up appointment once the results are available. We will discuss them then and formulate a treatment plan. I will have the receptionist schedule that for you now. Is there anything else I can address before you leave, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel… slightly less anxious now, knowing what we’re looking at. And thank you for scheduling the follow-up appointment. I appreciate your help. I’ll be sure to avoid the ibuprofen and try my best with the bland diet. And… hopefully, my sister won't be too stressful. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. See to it that you do. And try to manage your stress levels. Goodbye, Ms. Minatra. .
