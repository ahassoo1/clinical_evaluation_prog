DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… nice to meet you too. Um… my sinuses. They are… bothering me. A lot of pressure, you know? It’s been… a little while now. I don’t remember exactly how long, but… some time.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sinus pressure can be quite uncomfortable. When you say “a little while now,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh… rough… Hmm. Maybe… two, three weeks? It is hard to say, Doctor. Things… they blend together sometimes. I work… a lot. With the drills… the oil… It is noisy. Makes it hard to think straight, maybe.
DOCTOR: I see. Two or three weeks, alright. And is this pressure constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes. More comes, I think. Especially… when it is cold. Or… if I bend over. Then it feels… full. Like water in my head, almost. But no water comes out. Just… pressure. And a little bit of… ache. Not bad, but… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pressure that worsens with bending over and in cold weather, accompanied by a mild ache. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the pressure and ache?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Let me think. Sometimes… my nose feels… blocked. I have to… breathe from my mouth a little. And… maybe a little tired. But I always tired from the work, you know? It is hard work. Is… that a symptom? The tiredness?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. The tiredness could be related, or it could be from your work, as you said. Let's focus on the sinus symptoms for now. Have you had any fever, cough, or sore throat along with this?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don't think so. I haven’t… felt hot. Cough… not really. Maybe a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothing… bad. No sore throat. Just… the pressure. And the blocked nose. That is all I can remember, Doctor. I apologize if I am… not very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Boham. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember every detail. Now, have you tried anything to relieve the pressure?
PATIENT: Relieve… the pressure? Um… I tried… some warm water. With salt. My mother… she always said salt water helps. It… felt a little better for a moment, maybe. But then it came back. And… I tried… resting. But… the work… I need the work, you know? So… not much, really.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Alright, Ms. Boham, I’d like to take a quick look at your sinuses and ears, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve shining a light and listening with a stethoscope. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… please be gentle? It sometimes… hurts a little when things touch my face. From the work, you know? The dust… and the… things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Boham. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go. Okay, I'm looking now… Your nasal passages appear somewhat congested, with some mild redness. Your ears look clear. I can feel a little tenderness when I press on your sinuses. No fever currently. Your throat looks normal. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the examination, it sounds like you are likely experiencing sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses. It's probably a viral sinusitis given the lack of high fever. The congestion and tenderness are consistent with that.
PATIENT: Sinus… itis? Is that… bad, Doctor? Will I need… something? I have work tomorrow, you know. I cannot… miss work. It is… important.
DOCTOR: Sinusitis isn’t usually serious, Ms. Boham, especially if it’s viral. Most cases resolve on their own with supportive care. We'll focus on relieving your symptoms so you can continue working. Given your lack of fever and other concerning symptoms, I recommend a few things. First, continue with the warm saltwater nasal rinses – they help to clear congestion. Over-the-counter decongestants, like pseudoephedrine, can also help to open up your nasal passages, but be aware they can raise your blood pressure. If you have any heart problems or other medical conditions, you should not use them. And plenty of fluids. I also recommend I prescribe you a nasal steroid spray to reduce the inflammation in your sinuses. It takes a few days to reach full effect. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Nasal… steroid spray? Is that… safe, Doctor? I do not want… side effects. I have heard things about… medicines. And my blood pressure… it is sometimes a little high, yes. From the work. The stress, you know? The noise… everything. But I do not take anything for it. Just… try to rest when I can. Is the spray… strong? Will it make me… feel different?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ms. Boham. Nasal steroid sprays are generally very safe when used as directed. The amount of steroid absorbed into your body is minimal, so systemic side effects are rare. Common side effects, if any, are mild – like a little nosebleed or a dry nose. Regarding your blood pressure, it’s good you’ve mentioned that. Pseudoephedrine, which is found in some over-the-counter decongestants, can raise blood pressure. We won’t use that. The nasal steroid spray does not significantly affect blood pressure. It’s mainly used to reduce the inflammation in your sinuses. However, given your history of slightly elevated blood pressure, I think it's prudent to monitor it. Perhaps a visit to your primary care physician to check your blood pressure would be a good idea?
PATIENT: My… primary care… doctor? I do not have one. I haven’t… seen a doctor for a long time. Just… when I hurt myself at work. The company doctor. Is… that okay? And the spray… if it makes my nose… bleed, I will stop, yes? I do not want to… worry my husband. He worries enough as it is. He… takes care of everything. He is a good man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham, that’s perfectly alright. We can proceed without a primary care referral at this time. However, I strongly recommend finding one for routine check-ups and blood pressure monitoring. I can provide you with some resources for finding a physician in the area if you’d like. And yes, absolutely. If you experience any nosebleeds, or any other concerning side effects, discontinue the spray immediately and contact the clinic. It’s always best to err on the side of caution. So, to recap: We'll start with the nasal steroid spray. Continue the warm saltwater rinses. And I'll provide you with a list of resources for finding a primary care physician. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds good. The spray… and the saltwater. And… the list. My husband… he is good with… lists. He will… keep track of everything. Thank you, Doctor. You have… been very helpful. I feel… better now. Knowing what is… happening. Even if it is just… sinus itis. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Boham. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. I’m sending the prescription to your local pharmacy now. Here is that list for finding a doctor. Get some rest, Ms. Boham, and I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day.
