DOCTOR: Well, good afternoon, Zelina. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it's my breath. It smells bad. Really bad, apparently. My ex-husband definitely made it a point to mention it before he… well, never mind that. It just stinks. And I need it fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Right. “Stinks,” you say. And how long has this… unpleasantness been going on?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't really know. It's not like I go around sniffing myself all day. Probably a few weeks? Maybe longer. It just… got worse. I noticed it when I started dating again, and let’s just say it’s been… a deterrent. Look, is it going to be a long appointment? Because I have things to do.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. Well, we need to figure out why it smells bad before we can fix it. It could be a lot of things. Let's start with basics. Do you brush and floss regularly?
PATIENT: Do I look like someone who doesn't have basic hygiene? Of course I do. I'm not an animal. Although, some people I've dated… But yes, I brush twice a day and floss when I remember. It's not like I never floss, okay? Sometimes I just… forget. Is that a problem? Because honestly, I’m busy.
DOCTOR: It can be a problem, Zelina. Consistent oral hygiene is important. But let’s not dwell on that right now. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I don't have a fever or anything. My gums don't bleed, usually. My teeth hurt sometimes, but that's just because I grind them when I’m stressed, and believe me, I’m always stressed. Is that… does that count? Look, I just want you to fix the smell, not give me a whole dental exam.
DOCTOR: Grinding your teeth can contribute to oral health issues, and, frankly, it’s something we should address eventually. But let's focus on the breath for now. Any pain when you eat or drink something cold or hot?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I eat whatever I want, whenever I want. I'm not one of those people who's scared of ice cream or anything. It's just… the breath. It's embarrassing. Especially when… never mind. Just tell me if you can fix it. A lot of people don't notice it, probably, but the ones who do... it’s a problem. Is it something serious? Like, am I going to lose teeth or something?
DOCTOR: It's unlikely you're going to lose teeth immediately, but neglecting it could lead to problems down the line. We need to rule out some things first. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies. Let me think. I think I'm allergic to cats. Definitely cats. And pollen, maybe? I get a runny nose in the spring, but everyone does, right? And… I don’t know, lots of things probably. Look, I’m not a doctor, I don't keep a list of everything I’m allergic to. Can't we just give me a mouthwash or something? A really strong mouthwash?
DOCTOR: A mouthwash won't necessarily fix the underlying issue, Zelina. We need to understand why you have bad breath. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Okay, fine. I take… birth control pills. That’s it. And sometimes I take ibuprofen when my ex-husband… never mind. Just the pills. Look, is this going to take all day? Because I have a date tonight. And I really don't want to have to cancel it because of a bad breath interrogation.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other medications. And you said you’ve noticed it getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Yeah, like, a few weeks ago. It wasn't that noticeable before. But now… it’s like a whole cloud of stink. I went on a couple of dates, and… let’s just say I didn't get a second one. Is it possible it's, like, stress? Because I’m very stressed. And I drink a lot of coffee. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Stress and coffee can contribute, but we need to rule out other things. Let's do a quick exam. Open wide. I'm just going to take a look around. Don't worry, I'm not going to give you a lecture on flossing... yet. Hmm. Your gums are slightly inflamed, and I see some tartar buildup. Your tongue also has a coating on it. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is uncomfortable. Just get it over with. And no, it doesn’t hurt. It’s just… weird having someone poke around in my mouth. Look, is it something serious? Like, do I have gum disease or something? And do I need, like, expensive surgery or anything? Just tell me straight. I don’t have time for beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: It could be early gingivitis, but it’s not severe enough to warrant surgery at this point. The coating on your tongue suggests a build-up of bacteria, which is likely contributing to the odor. It appears you have moderate tartar buildup on your lower incisors and molars. Now, I'm going to recommend a professional cleaning to remove the tartar. It's a standard procedure. After that, we need to focus on improving your oral hygiene. I will also recommend a tongue scraper. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally, some actual direction. No, I don't smoke. Never have. I find it disgusting. Look, how much is this cleaning going to cost? And how long will it take? Because if it's going to take all afternoon, I’m going to have to reschedule it. And what about this… tongue scraper? Is that going to be expensive too? I have a date tonight, remember?
DOCTOR: The cleaning will be $150. It should take about 45 minutes. The tongue scraper is about $10, and you can get one at any pharmacy. It's important. We need to address the cause of the odor to prevent it from returning. Beyond the cleaning and scraper, I recommend brushing twice a day, flossing daily, and staying hydrated. Since you drink a lot of coffee, be sure to drink plenty of water. I'll give you a pamphlet with detailed instructions. Are you willing to commit to these changes?
PATIENT: Ugh, $150. Fine. Whatever. And a pamphlet? Seriously? Look, I’ll try to floss more. And I’ll drink more water. But no promises. I’m a busy woman, Dr. Fourney. Can we just schedule the cleaning now? And can you do it quickly, please? I have a life, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I have an opening tomorrow at 10:00 AM. Will that work?
PATIENT: Ugh, tomorrow? Fine. I guess. 10:00 AM it is. Just… don't keep me waiting. And try not to judge my teeth too much, okay? I’m very sensitive. I think that’s all. Are we done now?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are done. I'll see you tomorrow at 10:00 AM. And Zelina?
PATIENT: What? Make it quick, I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Just… try to relax. And brush your tongue. It makes a difference. .
