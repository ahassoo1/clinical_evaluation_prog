DOCTOR: Right, Claudene Wease. 66 years old. Look, I’m a bit behind schedule, so let's try to be concise, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor… Osga, is it? That’s right. Concise is good. I… I just keep getting these troubles with my waterworks, you see. It’s been… a while now. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s bothersome.
DOCTOR: "Waterworks," alright. And by that, you mean… urination?
PATIENT: Yes, urination. That’s… a polite way to put it. It burns, Doctor. And I have to go often. It's very inconvenient, especially when I’m… traveling. I do a lot of traveling for… well, it doesn't matter. It just happens often. And it’s painful.
DOCTOR: Burning… frequent urination. Right. And how much would you say “frequent” is?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… difficult to say. More than usual, certainly. I used to be able to… well, hold it for quite some time. Now… every couple of hours, perhaps? Maybe even less when I’m drinking a lot of… fluids. I’m not sure. It’s all a bit muddled, you see. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Muddled isn’t terribly precise, is it?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. I apologize. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Perhaps… five or six times a day? Or is it more? It feels like all the time when it's happening, if that makes any sense. And I get… a pressure, low down. A very uncomfortable pressure. Is that what you need to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Pressure… frequent urination… burning. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… now that you mention it… perhaps. A little. It’s not… a lot, and it’s not every time, but I think I’ve seen a tinge. A very faint pink. It could be my imagination, though. I get confused easily. It’s been happening with this… trouble, you see. Do you want me to try and be more specific? I’m not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: Possible hematuria. Right. And any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? Let me think… I haven’t felt ill, exactly. No chills, no shaking… I might have felt a little warm, sometimes, but I thought that was just the weather. It’s been quite hot, you know. It's difficult to say if it was a proper fever. I haven’t taken my temperature, if that's what you mean. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be. Any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Back… sometimes. A dull ache, low down in my back. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. And it comes and goes. It's difficult to pinpoint. It might be from lifting things in my… vehicle. I work on recreational vehicles, you see. It's… physical work. Is that relevant? I feel I’m rambling, Doctor. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Recreational vehicles… right. Look, let’s just get a quick exam. Lie down on the table, please. I need to listen to your abdomen and do a quick palpation. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. A quick exam… that sounds sensible. It might be a bit… awkward. My joints aren’t what they used to be, you know. But I’ll try my best. Is there a step? Or do I just… climb up?
DOCTOR: There’s a step. Just… be careful. I haven't got all day.
PATIENT: There. Is that alright, Doctor? A bit hard, but… I’ll manage. Do you need me to… move anything? Or just lie still? It's just… I'm not used to this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Not much to note there. And does this hurt?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. There. That’s… uncomfortable. Not excruciating, but… definitely a pain. A sharpish pain. Right… there. Does that tell you anything, Doctor? It’s probably just… old age. Everything hurts at my age, you know. But I appreciate you looking. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me—and this brief palpation—it sounds like a possible urinary tract infection, complicated by… well, your age and the fact that you haven't mentioned seeing a doctor in a while. We need to rule out other things, of course. I'm going to order a urine analysis, and a complete blood count. And frankly, given the potential for complications, I think we should consider a CT scan to rule out kidney stones or anything more serious.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh dear. That sounds… rather involved. And expensive, I imagine. I’m not… insured, Doctor. Is it really necessary? I mean, it's just my waterworks, isn't it? Perhaps… some pills? Or something? I really don't want to go through anything… complicated. It all sounds very frightening. Perhaps it’s just something I’ve eaten?
DOCTOR: Look, I understand your concerns about cost, but we have to rule out serious things first. Kidney infections can be very dangerous if left untreated. And kidney stones… well, they can cause a lot of pain and damage. The CT scan is the best way to get a clear picture. As for pills, antibiotics might help if it is a simple UTI, but we can’t just throw medication at it without knowing what we’re dealing with. I'll write you a referral to the lab for the urine analysis and blood work. The cost will be… less than a CT scan, I suppose. And I’ll see if we can arrange a payment plan for the scan if the results warrant it. Here. Take this to the lab. They’ll schedule you an appointment. Come back with the results as soon as possible.
PATIENT: A payment plan… that’s… kind of you, Doctor. But it all sounds very serious. And expensive. I don’t know if I can afford… all this. I suppose I should go to the lab, then. But it all feels very overwhelming. Thank you, Doctor. I think that’s… all for now, isn’t it? I hope it’s nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Go to the lab. And try to drink plenty of water. .
