DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My… husband, he find nice place. For old people. Senior… living? He want me go there. I need… paper say I okay? For the place.
DOCTOR: Right. A physical exam for placement in a senior living facility. I see. So, they need documentation of your current health status. Understandable. Let's start with a bit more detail. Are you having any specific health concerns right now that prompted this, or is this mostly just routine for the application process?
PATIENT: Routine, I think. No big trouble. Sometimes… my knees, they ache. When it rain. And… I forget things. But who no forget? Mostly okay. Husband worry too much, maybe.
DOCTOR: Knees aching with the rain… and some memory issues. Alright. It’s good your husband is attentive, even if you think he worries a bit much. We’ll document everything thoroughly. Now, when you say you forget things, can you give me an example?
PATIENT: Hmm… yesterday… I make coffee. For husband. But… I forget to give it to him! He find it cold. Little things. Not important. Sometimes name… of friend, maybe. But I remember my husband! And my grandbabies. Always them.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly minor memory lapses – forgetting recent events or names occasionally. Not consistently, and you remember important things – family, your husband. That's good. Has this been getting worse lately, or has it been about the same for a while?
PATIENT: I think… same. Maybe little more. But maybe just old age? I am seventy-two, Doctor. Things… slow down. Brain, too, maybe. Husband say I repeat myself. But he repeat himself too! He tell same story about fishing, every week.
DOCTOR: Right. It’s very common for memory to change as we get older. And husbands do have a tendency to tell the same stories! We'll assess it more objectively. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… yes. Doctor told me long time ago. I take pills. Every morning. And… sometimes my feet swell. When it hot. That all, I think. I don't like go to doctors too much. They poke and prod!
DOCTOR: Alright, well we'll try to keep the poking and prodding to a minimum. Do you remember what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… little white pill. Every morning. I… think it start with an “A”? My husband, he get it for me. I just take it. I not good with names of things. He know. Always him.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Abdollahi. Let me just check your records here… Ah, yes. You’re on amlodipine, 5 milligrams daily. That's the little white pill. Now, besides your blood pressure and the swollen feet, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Amlodipine… yes! That it. Thank you, Doctor. No… not really. Sometimes… tired. But who no tired at my age? I sleep okay. Eat okay. Husband cook good food. No pain, not much. Just knees when rain. And forget things. Like… what I was going to say! See? It happen again.
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, I understand you feel well overall, and that this is primarily for the facility's requirements. However, it’s important we take a thorough history. Repeatedly forgetting things, even if it seems minor, needs to be documented accurately. Now, let's try this: have you noticed any changes in your ability to think clearly or manage your daily routines?
PATIENT: Routines? I do same things, every day. Wake up, make coffee, eat breakfast, watch the news… Husband, he help me with garden. I not bend down so good now. I think… maybe it take me longer to remember… how to fix the rice cooker. Before, I do it easy. Now, I need look on the… the picture book. The one with the instructions. That all. Little things, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s helpful. Now, let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. My husband, he cook spicy food sometimes. Make me sweat! But no allergies. Never had. I think. Maybe… a little itchy when mosquito bite. But that not allergy. Just mosquito.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the amlodipine?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes. When my arthritis bad. Little red pill. Ibuprofen, I think? Husband give it to me. When my knees really ache. Not every day. Just when bad. He keep it in the kitchen cupboard.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… yes. Long time ago. When I have baby. Very long time ago. And… when I break my arm. When I was young. Fall from tree. That all. No other hospital. I mostly okay. Healthy. For my age.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No. Never. Too scared. My husband, he say I brave woman. But I no like surgeries. Never had. Just… teeth. When I was little. Not real surgery. Just teeth.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, a few questions about your family. Is there anyone in your family who has a history of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or other memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mama… she forget things when she very old. But she live long time. Very long time. And my uncle… he little bit… confused sometimes. But he drink too much coffee! Husband say maybe coffee make him confused. Not sure. Maybe. Old people… they forget. It happen.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never. My husband, he drink little beer sometimes. But me? No. Bad for health. I like my health. Mostly. Especially now. I need be strong. For the… the senior place.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Abdollahi. Thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a general sense of your health. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment – just some simple tests of your memory and balance. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. That okay. Quick, you say? I not want take long. Husband waiting. He make nice lunch. Quick is good.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod reassuringly, grabbing my stethoscope. “Very quick. Just a few things.” I begin by checking her blood pressure. “Your blood pressure is a little elevated today – 150/85. Not dangerously high, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it.” I listen to her heart and lungs. “Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear.” I then ask her to follow my finger with her eyes. “Can you follow my finger as I move it?
PATIENT: Yes. I see it. There. And there. Little… dizzy now.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's stop there for a moment. It’s alright. Just sit still. A little dizziness can happen sometimes. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions to check your memory. Can you tell me the current date?
PATIENT: Hmm… Today…? August… the second? Yes. August the second. Is that right? I think so.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Hmm… City? Is… is this… Suburbia? Husband drive me. I not remember… so many houses. Everything look same. Not good with names of places. Never was.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Abdollahi. Just a simple test. Can you count backwards from 100, subtracting 7 each time?
PATIENT: One hundred… ninety-three? No… ninety… sixty? I… I don't know. It’s… hard. Too many numbers. I used to be good with numbers. When I was young.
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, based on the exam and your history, I’m concerned about some mild cognitive impairment. This doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it does warrant further investigation. I recommend a more comprehensive neurological evaluation with a specialist. It's important we rule out anything that might be causing these difficulties. I’ll write a referral for you. We also need to address your slightly elevated blood pressure. I’m going to write you a prescription for a medication to help lower it. It’s important you take it as directed and follow up with your primary care physician regularly. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Cognitive… what? Is… is that bad? Is my brain… broken? Will I… will I remember my husband? And my grandbabies? Is there… anything I can do?
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, it’s understandable to be worried, but please, don't panic. "Cognitive impairment" simply means there are some changes in your thinking skills. It doesn't automatically mean your brain is broken. There are many possible causes, and we need to figure out what's going on. The referral to the specialist will help us do that. They’ll conduct some more thorough tests, and we can develop a plan to address your specific needs. We'll do everything we can to help you maintain your cognitive function and quality of life. And no, this doesn't mean you will forget your husband or your grandbabies. Mild cognitive impairment often affects recent memory first. Your long-term memories – the ones you cherish – are usually preserved. We'll take this one step at a time. The important thing is to get the right diagnosis and start the appropriate treatment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: One step at a time… yes. That… that sounds good. The specialist… will they… poke and prod too much? And the… the pills… will they make me sleepy? I want to be awake for my grandbabies. Husband… he will worry so much.
DOCTOR: The specialist will perform a neurological exam, which involves some simple tests of your memory, thinking skills, and reflexes. It shouldn’t be painful or uncomfortable. They may also order some imaging tests, like an MRI or CT scan, to get a better look at your brain. As for the pills, some medications for high blood pressure can cause drowsiness, but there are many different options available. We’ll start with a low dose and monitor you closely. If you experience any side effects, we can always adjust the dosage or switch to a different medication. It’s important to find something that works for you without causing unwanted side effects. And don’t worry about your husband. I’ll explain everything to him and answer any questions he may have. We’ll work together to ensure you both feel supported and informed. The important thing is to take care of your health, and we’ll do everything we can to help you do that. I’m writing the referral to Dr. Ramirez, a highly respected neurologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Here’s a copy of the order for your records, and here’s a prescription for the blood pressure medication. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Dr. Ramirez… okay. Husband… he knows a Ramirez. Maybe… distant cousin? No… I think… no more questions right now. Too much. Thank you, Doctor. For… not laughing at me. I guess… I will go home now. And tell husband. Is… is it okay to drive?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. And please, there’s absolutely no need to thank me. It’s my job to help you, and I’m here for you every step of the way. Regarding driving, given your recent memory lapses and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I would recommend against driving today. It’s best to have your husband drive you home, or perhaps take a taxi or ride-sharing service. Safety is our top priority. Please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll be here to support you. And remember, you’re not alone in this. Take care, Ms. Abdollahi. And please, give my best to your husband. .
