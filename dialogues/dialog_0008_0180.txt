DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day. Just… tired. Real tired. And I been… eating dirt. Don't look at me like that. It's just… happens sometimes. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay. “Real tired” and… consuming dirt. I understand this isn't a typical complaint, Ms. Cantoran. Can you tell me a bit more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to say? I'm tired! Like… all the time. Doesn't matter if I sleep eight hours, doesn’t matter if I don’t. Just… draggy. Been going on for… well, a while now. Months, I guess. Hard to keep track. And it’s not like it’s a normal tired. It's...heavy. Like my bones are full of lead. Satisfied?
DOCTOR: Okay, “heavy tiredness” lasting months, not relieved by sleep. And you mentioned consuming dirt… how much dirt are we talking about, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, don't go makin' a big deal out of it. It’s not like I'm eatin' buckets of the stuff! Just… a handful here, a little bit there. When I'm outside, mostly. Feels… good, okay? Don't ask me why it feels good. It just does. And it's not every day, alright? Just… when the feeling hits. You makin' notes on everything? Is this gonna take long?
DOCTOR: I am documenting everything, Ms. Cantoran, as is standard practice. It helps me understand what’s going on and ensure you receive the best possible care. A handful of dirt… several times a month?
PATIENT: Several… look, I told you, it’s not regular. Sometimes a week goes by. Sometimes a couple times in a week. Honestly, I don't keep a calendar of my dirt-eating habits! Why is this so important? And… is this covered by anything? I don't have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand you don't have insurance, Ms. Cantoran. We’ll discuss payment options later. It's important because… consuming non-food items, like dirt, can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency, or a condition called pica. To rule those things out, I need a bit more information. Let's start with your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, diet. Really? I eat. You know, food. What do you want me to say? Breakfast, sometimes. Coffee. Lunch, if I’m not too busy. Dinner, usually. I cook. Sometimes. Mostly things I always eat. Beans, tortillas, chicken… whatever's on sale. I don't know what you want to hear. It's not fancy. And don’t tell me I need to eat more vegetables, alright? I’ve heard it all before.
DOCTOR: Okay, beans, tortillas, chicken – fairly standard. Do you take any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? No. I don't go for all that stuff. Seems like a waste of money. Real food is what you need. Not pills and powders. What are you gettin' at here? Is this about the dirt? Just fix whatever's makin' me tired and leave me alone. Honestly. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. No vitamins. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and…dirt consumption?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I get kinda dizzy sometimes. Not fall-down dizzy, just… woozy. And my stomach… it bothers me sometimes. Hurts a little. And I’ve been more… irritable. My neighbor keeps complainin’ about my chickens, and I just… snap at him. That’s new. I usually ignore him. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, it feels like everything’s just… worse lately. But I’m old. Old people feel worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness, stomach pain, increased irritability… and these symptoms have developed alongside the tiredness and dirt eating. And you said the dirt eating is new?
PATIENT: New-ish. It wasn’t somethin' I did when I was younger, that's for sure. Started… maybe six months ago? Around the time things started feelin’ worse. The tiredness, the dizzy… everything. I don't know why I started doin' it. Just… a craving, I guess. A weird one. Look, are we almost done? This is very boring, and I'm really not feelin’ well.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, about six months of tiredness, dizziness, increased irritability, and dirt consumption. Before we proceed, Ms. Cantoran, do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I mean, I get bug bites like everybody else, but I don't break out in hives or nothin'. Never had a problem with pollen or food or anythin'. I’ve always been pretty sturdy. What are you lookin’ for? And can we please hurry this up? I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don't believe in all that stuff. Real food and a good night’s sleep is all you need. Honestly, this is ridiculous. You're askin' me all these questions I’ve already answered! Is this how you treat all your patients? Just… a bunch of questions? I'm starting to feel worse just sitting here. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your frustration. I'm asking these questions because they are important to help determine the cause of your symptoms. It's essential to rule out potential medical issues. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're willing. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a basic neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
