DOCTOR: Alright, Candis Hardenburgh, 79 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about this… weakness. And this strange thing I’ve been doing. It’s embarrassing to even say. I just… I feel tired all the time, even after sleeping. And I’ve been… eating dirt. Yes, dirt. Not a lot, but enough to know something is very wrong. Don’t look at me like that. It's not like I want to!
DOCTOR: Eating dirt?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt! Clay, mostly. Sometimes just… earth from the garden. I know it sounds ridiculous. My mother always said I had strange habits, but this is… different. It started a few months ago, just a little taste here and there, and now I… crave it. Like needing a glass of water. And it doesn’t help, you know? It just makes me feel worse, but I can’t stop. Is that… normal? I doubt it is, that’s why I’m here. Don't waste my time asking me to explain it again.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s certainly… unusual. We'll need to explore this further. This behavior, what you’re describing… it’s called pica. It can indicate a nutritional deficiency, but it can also be related to other things. Let’s start with a thorough review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… where do we even begin? Honestly, I've lived a long life. I’ve had the usual aches and pains, a bit of arthritis in my hands. Nothing serious. I had the flu a few years back, that's about it. I don’t go to doctors often. Waste of money, most of the time. And frankly, I don’t remember every little thing they told me. I’m 79, you know. My memory isn't what it used to be, though I remember perfectly well craving dirt. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Arthritis, you say. Okay. And no other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: No! Nothing significant. A few colds over the years, but I treated those myself with tea and rest. I was perfectly healthy until this… weakness started and then the dirt craving. It's a very specific craving, you know? Not just any dirt will do. It has to be a certain texture, a certain… smell. It's embarrassing to even talk about, and honestly, I don't want to relive it over and over. Are you going to do something about it, or just ask me questions?
DOCTOR: We are trying to determine why you are craving dirt, Mrs. Hardenburgh. It’s not a normal behavior, and we need to rule out any underlying medical causes. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Oh! Yes, I had my tonsils taken out when I was a child. Ages ago. And… I had a hysterectomy, oh, goodness, nearly fifty years ago. That’s it. Nothing else. Really, doctor, this is taking a long time. Are you going to ask me about my whole life now? I’m perfectly capable of telling you what’s wrong—I’m eating dirt because I feel weak and something is clearly off. Don't you think that's a good enough starting point?
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy, hysterectomy. Any family history of… unusual cravings, or anemia, or any digestive issues?
PATIENT: Anemia? Digestive issues? Goodness gracious. My mother had a sensitive stomach, always complaining about indigestion. And my aunt… she was a bit peculiar, always collecting things, but I don’t recall her eating dirt. As for anemia, I don’t think so. My brother was a strong man, worked construction his whole life. Healthy as a horse. Look, I don’t know about family medical histories! I’m 79 years old, not a medical encyclopedia. Can we please just get to the point? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications, Mrs. Hardenburgh?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I don’t believe in all those pills and potions the doctors try to push on you. Never have. I treat myself with natural remedies, tea, rest, a good diet. I’m perfectly capable of managing my own health. Though obviously, something isn't working right now. I'm eating dirt, remember? And it's making me tired! Are you even listening? Honestly, it feels like you’re just going through a checklist.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life. I grew up on a farm, you know. Dust, pollen, animals… I’ve been exposed to everything. I get a little sniffle sometimes, like anyone does. But a full-blown allergy? No. Are you going to ask me about my childhood now? This is ridiculous. I came here because I’m eating dirt and I’m tired, not to recount my life story. Just… help me, please. And quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Hardenburgh. We've established you're 79, no known allergies, no medications, and a history of eating dirt accompanied by weakness. Let me ask a few questions about your diet. What do you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Honestly, I eat what I can. I live alone, you see, and don't always have the energy to cook fancy meals. I have soup sometimes, toast, a bit of fruit when it’s in season. I used to garden, but I haven't been feeling up to it lately. Mostly simple things. Not a lot of meat. And I drink plenty of water. But it doesn't seem to be helping. I'm still tired, and I still… crave the dirt. It's like my body is missing something, and the dirt is the only thing that temporarily satisfies it. Are you going to test me for something? Because if so, let's just get it over with. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look. Pupils are normal, reactive to light. Breathing is a little shallow, but no wheezing. Soft, no significant tenderness. Your weight is… concerning. 107 pounds?
PATIENT: Concerning? Well, I've always been a small woman. But yes, I suppose I have lost a bit of weight recently. It’s hard to eat when you feel so tired all the time. Everything just seems… tasteless. I don't have much of an appetite these days. And frankly, the dirt doesn't exactly help with that! I'm not surprised you're finding something wrong. Now, are you going to give me something for the weakness, or just poke and prod at me all afternoon? I'm getting quite uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: We'll need to run some blood tests, Mrs. Hardenburgh. Specifically, a complete blood count, iron levels, and a basic metabolic panel. And… a lead level, given your… unusual dietary habit. These will help us determine the cause of your weakness and weight loss, and rule out any underlying deficiencies or toxicity. I'm going to order these tests now. The lab is just down the hall.
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, goodness. Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. But I expect results quickly. I haven't got time for a long wait. And don't bother explaining every little detail to me. Just tell me what's wrong and how to fix it. This whole thing is rather inconvenient, you know. I had a lovely afternoon planned. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Fasting, perhaps? Though honestly, I haven't got much to fast from these days. Just… tell me what I need to do. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: You'll need to fast for eight hours before the blood draw. No food or drink except water. The lab technician will give you instructions. I will also have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available. We will discuss them then. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Eight hours? Oh, that’s going to be difficult. Very difficult. Fine. I’ll try. But if I faint, don’t say I didn’t warn you. And don't expect me to be a pleasant patient. A follow-up appointment? Just tell me the results over the phone. I really don't want to come back here again. It's a waste of my time and energy. Very well. Let's just get this over with. Where is this lab, then? And is it air-conditioned? I get rather warm easily these days.
DOCTOR: Down the hall, second door on the right. Yes, it’s air-conditioned. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
