DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Pleasure’s all mine, I guess. Just… been gettin’ these fevers again. Happens on and off, ya know? Not fun. I’m Clide, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Clide. It's good to know. And thank you for letting me know about the fevers. “On and off” is helpful, but could you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they don't last long, see? Usually a day, maybe a day and a half. Feels like the flu, achy and cold, but mostly just hot. Happens maybe once a month now, for… oh, I dunno, three, four months? It used to be way less frequent. I remember back in… well, never mind. It just started comin' back more often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about once a month for the past three or four months, fevers lasting roughly a day or a day and a half, accompanied by aches and chills. You mentioned it used to be less frequent. That's important information. Besides the fever and aches, have you noticed any other symptoms that happen at the same time, or around the same time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I get a little tired, but I'm 65, Doc, I’m always a little tired. And… sometimes my stomach feels off. Nothin' major, just… queasy. No throwin' up or nothin'. Just a little unsettled. And maybe a headache, but honestly, I get headaches a lot too. It’s hard to say what’s with the fever and what’s just… me.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be difficult to pinpoint what's related and what's not. It's good you're keeping track, though. So, fatigue, occasional nausea, and headaches sometimes accompany the fever. Have you noticed any sweating, particularly at night?
PATIENT: Night sweats? Not really. I mean, I live in Puerto Rico, Doc. It’s hot here! I sweat a little, sure, but that’s just… normal. Nothing extra, nothin' like wakin' up soaked or somethin'. I sleep with the fan on, always have. So it’s hard to tell, ya know? It’s always kinda damp.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful to know, given the climate. No significant night sweats. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ major. Got a little arthritis in my knees, that’s why I see a chiropractor, keeps me movin’. He's a good fella. Other than that… I had the flu pretty bad when I was a kid, but that was… well, a long time ago. Blood pressure’s usually okay, the pharmacist tells me when I get my prescriptions. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothin’ like that. Honestly, I’m pretty healthy for my age.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. So, arthritis managed with a chiropractor, no history of diabetes or heart problems, and generally good health. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! When I was young, I broke my arm playin' baseball, had to get it set. That was… sixty years ago, maybe more? Other than that, no. No hospital stays, no surgeries. Just the usual bumps and bruises. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Mostly just keep movin’, ya know?
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No significant surgical history. Now, regarding your family – are there any health problems that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he died young, heart attack. But that was a long time ago, and he wasn’t really takin’ care of himself, ya know? Smokin’ and drinkin’ and… not the healthiest. My sister’s fine, as far as I know. No cancer or nothin' major that I'm aware of. It’s a big family, Doc, hard to keep track of everyone. Mostly, we just get old.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good starting point. High blood pressure in your mother and a father who died of a heart attack. And you mentioned you don't know of any cancer in the family. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I’m retired. I used to work construction, pretty physical job. Now I mostly just… relax. I walk a little, try to stay active. I eat pretty regular, my wife does most of the cookin’. Not a lot of fast food or nothin'. I don’t smoke, haven't for years, and I only drink a beer with dinner sometimes. Not a big drinker. Pretty boring, really.
DOCTOR: That doesn't sound boring at all, it sounds quite healthy, actually. And it’s good to hear you don't smoke and only drink in moderation. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’. The chiropractor gives me some stuff sometimes for my back, and I take a little somethin’ for my knees when they’re botherin’ me, but never had a problem. No food allergies, no bee stings, nothin’. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Now, is that all the questions, Doc? I got things to do, ya know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No known allergies. And yes, that's all the questions for now. Thank you for being so thorough, Mr. Brege. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your temperature, blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Quick is good. I ain’t got all day, ya know? Just get it over with. Hurry it up, Doc.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brege. We’ll be as quick as possible. First, let’s take your temperature. Okay, a little elevated. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated as well. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Finally, let me just take a quick look at your throat. Throat is slightly red, but no significant swelling or pus. Overall, everything sounds reasonably normal, but the elevated temperature and blood pressure are worth noting.
PATIENT: Well, what does that mean, Doc? I told ya I been feelin’ off. Is it somethin’ serious? I ain’t got time for somethin’ serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Brege. It's good that we've identified a slightly elevated temperature and blood pressure. It's not necessarily something serious at this moment, but it does warrant further investigation to understand what’s causing it. Given your recent fevers, fatigue, and slightly red throat, it could be a viral infection, like a common cold, or potentially something else. To be certain, I’d like to order some blood tests to check for inflammation, and to rule out other possibilities. I also recommend a complete blood count to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ugh. I hate needles. Is it gonna be a lot of blood? And how long do I gotta wait for the results? I got things to do, Doc, I can’t be sittin’ around waitin’ for tests. And how much is this gonna cost? I ain’t insured, ya know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the blood tests, Mr. Brege. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about needles. The amount of blood we need is relatively small, just a few vials. It shouldn’t take long at all, and we’ll have the results back within a few days, usually two to three business days. Regarding the cost, I understand you're uninsured. Let me check the pricing for you. The tests will cost approximately $150, but our clinic does offer a discount for uninsured patients, bringing the total down to $120. We can also discuss a payment plan if that would be helpful. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids, and taking over-the-counter acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the fever and aches, as long as you don’t have any contraindications. Do you have any allergies to either of those medications?
PATIENT: $120… alright, I guess that’s somethin’. No, no allergies to either one. I've taken both before. Just… hate feelin’ sick. Okay, fine. Let’s get the blood tests over with. Just… hurry it up, Doc.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brege. I'll have the nurse come in right away. We'll get this done quickly and efficiently. The nurse is very skilled, and she'll make sure you're comfortable. In the meantime, I'll write up the lab order and provide you with instructions for post-test care. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me while we wait for the nurse?
PATIENT: Nah, I think I covered everything. Just… get it over with. And Doc? Don’t keep me waitin’ too long for the results, alright? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Brege. We will prioritize getting your results back to you as quickly as possible. I'll make a note to have them sent to me immediately. The nurse should be in shortly. Thank you for your patience. .
