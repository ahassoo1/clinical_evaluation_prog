DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. I’m Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. I’m just…tired. Real tired. And I’ve been, well, eating dirt. Not on purpose, you understand. It just…happens. It's been getting worse, and my daughter keeps fussing at me. She thinks I'm losing it. Honestly, I just need something to make it stop.
DOCTOR: "Eating dirt," you say?
PATIENT: Well, not like…garden dirt. More like…clay. You know, the reddish stuff? I find it…appealing. Don't look at me like that. It's not like I want to eat it. It just…feels right, I guess? And then I feel a little better for a bit. A little. It doesn't last. Honestly, it's embarrassing. Is this going to be a long thing? I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And how long has this been going on, this… craving, and consuming of clay?
PATIENT: Ugh, how am I supposed to remember? A while. Months, maybe? Time just…blurs together, you know? Since…well, since my husband passed. It wasn't right after, but…around then, I think. Before that, I ate normal food. I always ate normal food. It's just…this started. And it’s getting…more frequent. Look, is this something serious? Will I have to get tests? Because I really don't like tests.
DOCTOR: Okay. Months, and it started around the time of your husband’s passing… I understand this is unsettling, Hedy. And yes, we need to figure out what's going on. It could be something serious, and we will likely need some blood work. It's important to rule things out. Have you noticed any other changes besides this… clay consumption?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I’m tired, like I said. Really, really tired. And…I get winded easily. Even walking to the mailbox is a struggle now. My daughter says I’m paler than usual, but I haven’t looked in a mirror in ages. Honestly, she worries too much. Is it…is it something I ate? Or…something not eating? Because I haven’t been a big fan of cooking lately. Too much work. And, honestly, what's the point? Just me and the TV now.
DOCTOR: Right. Tiredness, shortness of breath, paleness… and decreased appetite. Okay. It could be a number of things, Hedy. This craving for clay, what we call pica, is sometimes linked to nutritional deficiencies, particularly iron. But we need to check your blood counts to be sure. We'll do a full blood panel, check your iron levels, and some other basic things. And honestly, given your history, we should also do a thyroid panel. It's just standard procedure. Can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… nothing regular. The doctor gave me something for my blood pressure a while back, but I stopped taking it. Made me feel funny. Besides that… vitamins, sometimes. My daughter buys them. Big, horse-sized pills. Can’t even tell you what they’re for. Mostly, I just…deal with it. Look, is this going to cost a fortune? I don’t have insurance, and my daughter already complains enough about money. Can’t we just…give me something to stop the craving? Something easy?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Hedy, we can't simply "give you something" without knowing why this is happening. It's irresponsible, and potentially dangerous. We need to identify the cause. As for cost, I understand your concern, and we can discuss options for affordable lab work. There are some programs available. As for the blood tests… they are essential. They’ll help rule out a lot of possibilities – anemia, thyroid issues, other deficiencies. We need to know what we're dealing with before we can even think about treatment. And honestly, given your history of decreased appetite, we also need to rule out malnutrition. It’s the most sensible course of action. Now, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Allergic? Honestly, I haven’t had an allergy in…years. Maybe as a kid? I don’t even remember. Look, is this going to be a lot of blood? I hate needles. And I get dizzy easily. Can we just…skip the blood work? Maybe I’m just stressed. My husband…it’s been hard. Is there anything else I can tell you? Something that might make you think this is just…a phase? Because I’d really prefer that. This is all very…invasive. And frankly, I have a bingo game to get to.
DOCTOR: Hedy, with all due respect, dismissing this as “just a phase” based on stress alone is not appropriate medical care. You’re experiencing a very unusual symptom – pica – and it’s linked to serious underlying conditions. We need to investigate. Yes, it involves blood work. We'll take precautions to make you comfortable – you can lie down, we can use a smaller needle, and the phlebotomist is very experienced. It’s a few vials of blood. It’s not invasive, it’s investigative. Now, I need a complete medical history. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Ugh. Let me think… years ago, I had my tonsils out. When I was a little girl. And…I think I had my appendix taken out when I was older. Maybe. It was a long time ago. Honestly, it’s all a blur. My daughter has all my records, I think. She’s the organized one. Look, can't we just give me some iron pills? My daughter said something about iron being good for…that. If that's the problem, can we just skip the rest of it? I really don't want to spend all day here. I have a life, you know. Well, what's left of one. .
DOCTOR: Hedy, I understand your frustration, but self-treating with iron without knowing your iron levels is potentially dangerous. You could have iron overload, which is very harmful. And frankly, pica is rarely just about iron. Now, to be clear, given your history of decreased appetite and the clay consumption, and your husband's recent passing, we need to rule out other conditions, like malnutrition or even underlying mental health concerns. I'm going to order the blood panel, and I also want to do a basic thyroid test. It will take about an hour. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results, and we can revisit your concerns then. Do you understand?
