DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it's... something about a letter. For a pet, you see. My niece, she needs it for… something. Housing, I think? It’s all a bit much, really. People and their rules. I just need a piece of paper saying I… own him, is that right? I don’t really do paperwork.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. So, this is regarding documentation of pet ownership for housing purposes, as your niece has explained. And it’s for a specific animal?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's it. A dog. A big one. A… well, he's a rescue. A lovely boy, really, but a bit of a handful. Honestly, I don't remember how I ended up with him, exactly. My daughter brought him around, I think? She has a soft spot for strays, that one. But he’s mine now, and they need proof or something. It's all very silly.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, to clarify, you acquired the dog from your daughter, and now require documentation of ownership for housing. Do you recall approximately when you acquired him?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When? Hmm. Sometime last year, I suppose. Maybe spring? Or was it summer? Everything just… blurs together, you know? I really don't keep track of dates. It wasn't recent, definitely not this year. He was already grown when I got him, a good size, not a puppy. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, sometime last year. A grown dog. And do you happen to know the breed, or even a mix of breeds?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I am terrible with breeds. He’s…brown. And big. A fluffy kind of brown. One of those…rescue mixes, you know? They never really say, do they? Just “a lovely boy, needs a good home”. He is lovely, don't get me wrong, just not a pedigree or anything fancy. I wouldn’t know a pedigree if it bit me.
DOCTOR: Alright, a brown, fluffy, grown, mixed-breed dog. And to confirm, you have been the primary owner and caregiver since approximately last year?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. I feed him, walk him – well, sometimes my grandson walks him, when he’s visiting. He’s a good boy, mostly. A bit boisterous, but sweet. I certainly wouldn’t have anyone else taking care of him. I’ve been the one with the responsibility, yes. It's just... remembering the details is the hard part. It all feels like one long… blur, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to not recall every specific detail. Now, have you taken him to a veterinarian for any check-ups, vaccinations, or treatments since you’ve had him?
PATIENT: Oh, the vet! Yes, I think I took him once, when I first got him. Just a general check-up, you know? To make sure he wasn’t riddled with fleas or something. It was a bit of a… kerfuffle, actually. He doesn’t much like strangers. But I'm pretty sure he had his shots. The vet's office sent a card, I think? I probably stuck it on the fridge… somewhere. Honestly, the fridge is a bit of a mess. I wouldn’t rely on finding it. It was definitely a vet, though. Yes. I'm almost certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, a veterinary visit sometime after acquiring him, with confirmation of initial vaccinations. Do you recall the name of the veterinary clinic?
PATIENT: Oh dear. The name? No, absolutely not. It was… near my daughter’s place, I think? A small one. Not one of those big fancy animal hospitals, you know? Just a… local place. Red brick, maybe? Or was it blue? Everything looks the same after a while. Honestly, I'm terrible with names and places. It’s just…a blur, you see? It's not that I'm trying to be difficult, it's just... my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like recalling specific details is proving difficult. In order to provide official documentation of ownership, it would be ideal to have veterinary records confirming you are the owner and that he has received care under your name. Without those, it will be difficult to create a formal document. Do you have any other documentation related to the dog – perhaps adoption paperwork, even if it's not in your name?
PATIENT: Adoption paperwork? No, no. My daughter just… brought him around, said he needed a home. She’s always rescuing things. There wasn’t any official paperwork. It wasn't a shelter dog, just… a dog who needed a home. I suppose I could ask my daughter, but she’s always so busy. And she probably doesn’t have anything anyway. It’s all very… informal. This is a bit of a bother, isn’t it? I just wanted a simple letter. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wrye. Given the lack of veterinary or adoption records, creating official documentation of ownership will be challenging. However, I can write a letter stating you have been the primary caregiver for the dog since approximately last year, to the best of your recollection. Please be aware this may not be sufficient for all housing requirements. Would you like me to proceed with that?
