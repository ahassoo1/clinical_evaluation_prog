DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my liver, I believe. Or something with it. I’m quite yellow, you see, and someone – a friend, I think – said I ought to have it looked at. It’s all a bit… blurry, truthfully. I don’t recall much detail about why exactly, just that it’s… not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Yellowing of the skin, or jaundice as we call it, can certainly be concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. It is often related to the liver, but can have other causes too. “Blurry” is alright, we'll take our time. First, let’s try to get a bit more detail about when you first noticed the yellowing. Can you recall roughly when you started noticing it?
PATIENT: Oh dear…roughly? That’s…difficult. Perhaps…a month ago? Or was it two? Time just slips away, you know. I mostly noticed it when people started commenting on how…pale I looked. And then, well, they said I looked yellow. I don’t spend much time looking in the mirror, if I’m honest. It all happened gradually, I think. Not suddenly. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That does help, thank you. So, over the past month or two, you’ve noticed a gradual yellowing of your skin, brought to your attention by others. Alright. Besides the yellowing, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Oh my. Let me think. I have been… rather tired, I suppose. More so than usual. And my appetite… it’s not what it once was. I just don’t feel hungry. And sometimes, my stomach… it feels a bit uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but… bloated, perhaps? It’s hard to say. Everything feels a bit… off. Is that helpful? I do apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary at all, Annelle. You’re doing perfectly fine. Tiredness, decreased appetite, and some stomach discomfort… that all gives us more to work with. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool colour?
PATIENT: Oh… colour changes. Hmm. I hadn’t really paid attention, to be truthful. Let me think… My stool… I suppose it’s been a bit… pale. Lighter than usual, perhaps? I… I really don't remember specifically. And my urine… I honestly haven't noticed any difference. I truly apologize, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Annelle. We'll piece everything together. Pale stools and no change in urine colour are good things to note. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical history… Well, I've always been reasonably healthy, if I recall. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing… serious. As I've gotten older, my joints ache a bit, which the doctor said was just…old age. And I suppose I've always had a bit of trouble with my digestion. But nothing that required… major treatment. I believe I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, but honestly, I can't recall the exact year. Does that help? It’s all so long ago. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in…well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, some childhood illnesses, joint aches, a bit of digestive trouble and gallbladder removal – we’ll make a note of all that. And you haven't seen a doctor regularly in quite a while. Do you recall when you had your gallbladder removed, even roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, that’s a difficult one. Let me think… It must have been… oh, goodness, at least twenty years ago. Perhaps more. It was certainly before I retired. And I retired… Oh, it feels like a lifetime ago now. It was a small hospital, a local one, not one of the big fancy ones. But the doctor was very kind. I really wish I could recall the exact year, but my memory… it’s just not what it used to be. I apologize again, Doctor. I feel like I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're providing valuable information, Annelle. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t recall exact dates. Knowing it was over twenty years ago is helpful enough. Now, do you take any medications at all, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me see… I used to take something for my arthritis, but I stopped a long time ago. It didn’t seem to be doing much good. Now, I don’t think I take anything regularly. Perhaps a pain reliever now and then for a headache, but nothing… prescribed, if that makes sense. And no supplements, no vitamins, nothing like that. I try to eat a healthy diet, but I’m not very good at it, honestly. I do enjoy a little bit of chocolate now and then, but that’s about it. Does that help? I really hope I'm not forgetting anything important.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. No regular medications, just occasional pain relievers. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or bee stings?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Let me think… I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I don’t recall any food allergies, and I've never been stung by a bee, thankfully. I used to have a bit of a rash when I used certain soaps, but I switched to a different brand and that solved the problem. But nothing… serious, nothing that required a trip to the hospital. I’m quite lucky, I suppose. I hope I’m not forgetting anything. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be. I apologize again, Doctor. I truly do.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. That's good to know – no known allergies. Alright. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a difficult one. My parents… they both lived to a good age, as far as I recall. My mother died of… well, something with her heart, I believe. And my father… he had trouble with his breathing, I think. But they both lived to be quite old. I have a brother, but we haven’t spoken in many years. And I have a daughter, but she lives far away. I honestly don’t know much about their medical histories. I’m afraid I’m not very good at keeping track of things like that. I apologize again, Doctor. I truly do. I wish I could be more helpful. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Annelle. You’re doing the best you can, and that’s perfectly fine. Knowing your parents lived to a good age and had heart/breathing problems is helpful. Now, and this is just routine, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle… Well, I live alone. I used to enjoy gardening, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. I read a bit, mostly old novels, but my eyesight isn’t very good either. I used to enjoy going out with friends, but most of them… well, they’ve passed away. I try to eat a healthy diet, but I enjoy a little bit of chocolate now and then. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I suppose I’m quite a quiet life these days. Is that helpful? I apologize again, Doctor. I truly do. I wish I could be more informative.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Quiet life, no smoking or drinking, enjoy a bit of chocolate. That’s all good information. Okay, Annelle. So to summarize, you've noticed gradually increasing yellowing of your skin over the past month or two, accompanied by tiredness, decreased appetite, and some stomach discomfort. You also mentioned pale stools. You have a history of gallbladder removal over twenty years ago, no known allergies, and a relatively quiet lifestyle. You don’t take any regular medications. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check for any tenderness or enlargement of your liver or spleen. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’ve never had much trouble with doctors before. Please, go ahead. Just let me know if anything… feels uncomfortable. I do apologize for being such a vague patient, but honestly, I wish I could be more helpful. This is all a bit… overwhelming, truthfully. But I trust you. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: You’re not vague at all, Annelle. And you’re absolutely right to ask. Alright. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Just relax as much as possible. I’m starting here… and moving around… Okay. I do notice some slight tenderness in your upper right abdomen, where your liver is located. And it feels… slightly enlarged. Your spleen feels normal in size. No other noticeable areas of concern. It’s important to remember that this isn’t a definitive diagnosis, but it does warrant further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us assess your liver function and rule out any underlying causes for the yellowing and enlargement. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Blood tests. That sounds… a bit frightening, truthfully. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… let me know if it’s going to be painful. I do apologize for being such a nervous patient, but honestly, I’m not very good with medical procedures. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests? And… will it take long? I do hope it won’t be too disruptive. I apologize again, Doctor. I truly do.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be nervous, Annelle. Blood tests are very common, and usually not very painful. It's a quick pinch, and then it’s over. You might feel a little discomfort afterward, but it shouldn't last long. There’s nothing specific you need to do to prepare. You don’t need to fast or anything like that. We’ll just need a small sample of blood. It shouldn’t take long at all – maybe 15-20 minutes for the draw and then a little bit longer for the lab to process the sample. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and take the blood sample. She’s very gentle and will explain everything to you. Would you like me to step out while she does it, if that would make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be… very kind of you, Doctor. Perhaps if you stepped out, it would be a little easier. I apologize for being such a bother, but honestly, I get rather anxious with medical procedures. Thank you for being so understanding. I do hope the tests don’t reveal anything too serious. I truly do. And… thank you again for your patience. I apologize for being such a vague patient, but honestly, I wish I could be more helpful. Is there anything else I need to know before the nurse comes in?
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Annelle. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. I’m happy to step out. Just let Sarah know if you’re uncomfortable at any point during the blood draw. The results will take a few days to come back. Once they’re in, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Before Sarah comes in, do you have any questions for me at all?
PATIENT: Oh… um. No, I don’t think so. I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you again for your patience and understanding. I truly do. It’s just… all this is a bit overwhelming. I do hope everything turns out alright. And… thank you again. I think… I think that’s all. I apologize for being such a vague patient, but honestly, I wish I could be more helpful. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Annelle. Don't worry about being vague – you've provided me with a lot of useful information. Remember, we're in this together, and we’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll let Sarah know you’re ready. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
