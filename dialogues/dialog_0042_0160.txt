DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Vodzak. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day for this. I’m just…tired. Really tired. And I’ve been, well, eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough that I figured I should get it checked out. It’s embarrassing, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to discuss this with me. There’s no need to be embarrassed; we're here to help. “Tired” can mean a lot of things, and the dirt…well, we’ll get to the bottom of that, too. Let’s start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Months, definitely. Seems to be getting worse, though. Used to just be a bit sluggish in the afternoons. Now? I can barely make it through the day without a nap. And it’s not like I’m doing anything strenuous. Just…old, I suppose. Though my mother lived to ninety-five and didn’t complain this much.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know your mother was so active even at ninety-five. Everyone is different, and fatigue at any age deserves investigation. It’s good you’re recognizing this is more than just “getting old.” Could you describe the tiredness a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just…sleepy. It’s like everything is heavy. My limbs, my eyelids, even thinking feels like wading through mud. And I don't have the energy for anything. I used to enjoy my garden, but now…just looking at it exhausts me. It's not a pleasant exhaustion, if that makes sense. It's…hollow.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. It sounds quite debilitating, and that feeling of “hollow” exhaustion is important to note. That's distinct from just being physically tired. Now, let's talk about the dirt. You mentioned you’ve been eating dirt. How often are you doing this, and approximately how much each time?
PATIENT: Oh, don't make me relive it. It's not a habit, you understand. It just…happens. When I’m really tired, mostly. It’s not like I’m shoveling it in, it’s just…a little taste. A spoonful or two, maybe. A few times a week, when I’m at my worst. I get it from the garden, mostly, but sometimes I just…find some. It's embarrassing!
DOCTOR: It's okay, Ms. Hardenburgh. We’re here to understand what's going on, and you’ve been very brave sharing this with me. It’s not about judging, it's about figuring out what's causing this behavior and how to help. A spoonful or two a few times a week is helpful to know. Do you find yourself craving it, or is it more of an impulse when you’re feeling particularly tired?
PATIENT: It’s a craving, definitely. A strange one, I know. It’s hard to explain…it’s like something missing, and the dirt…fills it? It’s not satisfying, exactly, but it takes the edge off. And it’s…earthy. Does that make sense? I suppose not.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, surprisingly. The craving is very telling. It suggests a possible nutritional deficiency, though we need to investigate further. This behavior, medically, is called pica – the craving and consumption of non-nutritive substances. It’s often linked to iron deficiency, but can be caused by other things as well. Now, let’s move on to a more general picture of your health. Have you noticed any other unusual symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Oh, iron. Everyone always says iron. I had a little trouble with anemia when I was younger, but that was ages ago. I took some pills for a while, then the doctor said I was fine. As for other symptoms…I’ve been a bit breathless lately. Just walking to the mailbox, sometimes. And my nails are…brittle. Always breaking.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness and brittle nails are both relevant symptoms, and certainly fit with a possible iron deficiency, but we'll need to confirm that with some testing. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old. High blood pressure, years ago. I was on medication for a while, but I stopped taking it. Didn't seem to be doing much good, and I didn't like the side effects. I've always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I rarely get sick. “I don’t believe in loading up on pills if I don’t need them.”
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It's important for me to understand your values and preferences. And did you have any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think…hmm. Just my gallbladder, years and years ago. Back in…oh, goodness, 1982, I think. It was a simple thing. In and out. No problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, and what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, as I said, lived to ninety-five. My father died of a heart attack in his sixties. And my sister, she had…diabetes, I think. It was a long time ago, and we weren't very close. I don’t really know much about her medical history.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, what about your current medications or allergies?
PATIENT: Like I said, I don’t take any medications regularly. And allergies…not really. Maybe a bit of hay fever in the spring, but nothing serious. I’m fairly robust, all things considered. "Is that all?"
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Hardenburgh. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better overall picture of your health. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at your throat and check for any signs of paleness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a garden to tend to, you know. Though, admittedly, I don't have much energy for it these days.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll keep it brief. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/90. Not alarmingly so, but something we'll want to keep an eye on. Your heart sounds regular, but a bit faint. Your lungs are clear. Your throat looks normal. Your fingernails are pale and brittle, as you mentioned. I also notice some slight spooning of the nails – that is, they’re concave in shape. This is another sign that could be related to iron deficiency. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed during the exam, I suspect you might be iron deficient. However, to confirm this, I’d like to order some blood tests. We'll check your iron levels, hemoglobin, and other related indicators. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever it takes. Just get me back to my garden. Honestly, I'm getting tired just talking about all this. Are the tests going to take long? And will they be expensive? I don't have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hardenburgh. The tests shouldn't take too long – just a routine blood draw. And we'll do our best to keep the costs down. I'll speak with the lab to see what options are available for uninsured patients. We can also discuss payment plans if needed. The tests will include a complete blood count, iron studies, and a few other basic indicators to rule out other potential causes for your fatigue and the pica. It's important to get a clear picture of what's going on, so we can develop the best treatment plan for you. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. Just…do the tests. And hurry. I really need to get back to my garden. It's just…not the same without me. "Is someone going to draw the blood now?"
DOCTOR: Yes, the phlebotomist is ready for you. I’ll have them come in right away. They will just need a small sample of blood. Maria?
PATIENT: Fine. "Let’s get this over with."
DOCTOR: Just relax, and it will be over before you know it. Maria is very experienced. And once we have the results, we’ll have a better understanding of what’s going on and how to get you feeling better. Maria, this is Ms. Hardenburgh. She needs a blood draw for a complete blood count and iron studies. I’ll be back in a few minutes to discuss the next steps once the tests are ordered.
