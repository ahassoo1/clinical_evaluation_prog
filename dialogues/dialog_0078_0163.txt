DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure. Well, it’s a rather… embarrassing matter, truth be told. I’ve been dabbling – and I use that word deliberately – in some rather extreme diets, and I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I do any further foolishness. I’m Jarvis Vantine, by the way. Though I suspect that’s on your chart.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Vantine, I do have your information here. And thank you for being upfront with me – it takes courage to admit when we might be making choices that aren’t the best for our health. It’s good you’re seeking advice before things potentially become more serious. Could you tell me a bit more about these “extreme diets”?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it began innocently enough, really. A friend – a young fellow, actually, involved in motion capture – was extolling the virtues of the “Breatharian Diet.” Apparently, one subsists entirely on prana, sunlight, and… well, positive energy. I thought, “Why not?” I’ve always been fascinated by the esoteric. It lasted… three days. Dreadful three days, I might add. Then, there was the “Tapeworm Diet.” I won’t dwell on the details, but let’s just say it involved a rather unpleasant purchase online. That lasted barely a day. Most recently, I attempted a purely carnivorous diet – entirely meat, Doctor. It proved… unsustainable, both physically and morally. I feel rather foolish recounting all this.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Vantine. It's certainly… a diverse range of dietary experiments. It’s good you’re recognizing these weren’t sustainable, and that you came in to discuss them. While I understand the curiosity and perhaps the search for alternative approaches, these diets can be quite dangerous. To get a better understanding of the impact these diets have had, could you describe any symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms, yes. Well, with the Breatharian Diet, a rather persistent headache was the most notable. And a distinct lack of energy, naturally. The Tapeworm Diet… induced a rather unpleasant bout of nausea, which I won't elaborate upon. The carnivorous diet caused… digestive difficulties, let's put it delicately. And a general feeling of… sluggishness. Also, and this is perhaps the most concerning, my hands have been trembling slightly. Not constantly, but frequently enough to be noticeable. And, I must confess, my memory, normally quite sharp – I worked in special effects, detail is paramount – has been… a touch foggy lately. Though, at my age, one does expect a certain amount of… decline.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so thorough, Mr. Vantine. Those symptoms – the headache, fatigue, digestive issues, tremors, and memory fog – are all concerning and could certainly be related to these extreme diets and the nutritional deficiencies they cause. The tremors and memory fog, in particular, warrant further investigation. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’ve been generally quite healthy, all things considered. As a young man, I had the usual childhood ailments – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I had my appendix removed in 1968, a rather unpleasant experience, but recovered fully. I’ve never been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – no diabetes, heart disease, or anything of that nature. I did have a bout of pneumonia in 2010, but that resolved with antibiotics. I take a daily multivitamin, out of habit more than necessity, I suppose. And I had a rather minor operation on my left knee five years ago, due to a sports injury – a rather clumsy fall while attempting badminton. Otherwise, I’ve been remarkably fortunate. I’ve always been a fairly active individual – walking, swimming, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Vantine. Thank you. And it sounds like you've been reasonably healthy overall, despite the recent dietary experiments. Just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or food?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I am aware of. I’ve never had any adverse reactions to any medication or food, as far as I can recall. I’ve eaten rather a varied diet over the years, travelling extensively for my work, sampling cuisine from all corners of the globe. Shellfish, spicy foods, exotic fruits – I’ve tried it all, without incident. I occasionally experience a touch of indigestion, but nothing more than a mild discomfort, easily remedied with a digestive biscuit and a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies is good to know. Now, just a few more questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a rather difficult question, Doctor. My father, a rather reserved fellow, passed away at the age of 78 from a heart attack, I believe. Though, he smoked heavily, so that was perhaps unsurprising. My mother lived to be 92, remarkably healthy for most of her life, but she did suffer from arthritis in her later years. My only sibling, a sister, passed away from breast cancer at the age of 65. A tragic loss. On my mother’s side, there was an uncle who suffered from what the family referred to as “nervous exhaustion” – I suspect it was some form of depression, but such things weren’t discussed openly in those days. And, I believe, a great-aunt who suffered from dementia in her later years. Nothing else springs immediately to mind, though, I confess, I’m not terribly knowledgeable about the medical history of distant relatives.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Vantine. That gives me a clearer picture. The family history of heart disease, cancer, and potential dementia is important to note. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am divorced, having been separated from my wife for some twenty years. We have no children. I live alone in a small flat in the city centre – quite convenient for the theatres and museums. I have a small circle of friends – mostly former colleagues from the film industry. We meet occasionally for dinner or a glass of wine. I enjoy reading – history, biography, that sort of thing. And I attend the occasional concert or play. I don’t smoke, and I drink alcohol very moderately – perhaps a glass of sherry with dinner. I used to be quite active socially, but in recent years, I’ve become rather more reclusive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vantine. That’s helpful to know. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly alright. I understand it’s necessary. Though, I must confess, I’ve always been rather squeamish about medical examinations. But I trust your expertise. Please proceed as you see fit.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vantine. I’ll do my best to make you comfortable. We’ll start with checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your reflexes. I'll also do a brief neurological exam, just to assess your memory and coordination. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is normal. Now, if you don’t mind, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Do be gentle, if you would. My joints aren’t what they used to be. Proceed at your leisure.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam to assess your memory and coordination. I’ll ask you a few simple questions. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. Let me see. It is… August the 2nd, 2025. Yes, that is correct, isn’t it? August the 2nd, 2025. Though, to be perfectly honest, Doctor, I had to pause and think about that for a moment. It simply doesn’t spring to mind as readily as it once did.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Vantine. It’s perfectly normal to have occasional difficulty recalling dates, especially as we get older. Now, can you please repeat these three words for me: apple, table, penny?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. Yes, quite easily. Apple, table, penny. Though, I suspect I shall forget them momentarily. My short-term memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright. We’ll revisit them later. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Are you able to follow my finger without difficulty?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly. Though, I must confess, my eyes are feeling rather tired today. And my coordination isn’t quite as sharp as it once was. Please do be patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re doing very well, Mr. Vantine. I appreciate your patience. Now, one final quick test. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There we are. A little wobbly, perhaps, but functional. My balance isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vantine. That was very helpful. Based on my examination, and your history, I’m concerned about potential vitamin deficiencies, likely due to your recent restrictive diets. Your diminished reflexes, slight shuffling gait, and some difficulty with memory and coordination are all consistent with this. The tremors you’ve been experiencing are also concerning. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels – specifically B12, folate, and vitamin D. We’ll also check your thyroid function and a complete blood count. This will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Blood tests are quite routine, I presume? Yes, please proceed. I’m rather relieved you’re taking this seriously. The thought of some irreversible neurological damage is… unsettling, to say the least. Please do whatever is necessary to ascertain the cause of these… deficiencies. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. And yes, blood tests are quite routine. We’ll get those ordered right away. In the meantime, I recommend starting a multivitamin supplement daily, and focusing on a well-balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and protein. I also want to emphasize the importance of avoiding any further restrictive diets. These diets can be harmful, and it’s crucial to nourish your body with the nutrients it needs. I’ll review the blood test results as soon as they come in, and we’ll discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything admirably. You’ve been most thorough and reassuring. I shall heed your advice regarding the multivitamins and the avoidance of further… experimentation. It appears my quest for esoteric nourishment was rather ill-advised. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I shall await your call with the results of the blood tests.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening of your symptoms in the meantime. Here's a requisition form for the blood tests, and a printout of the instructions for preparing for the test. Take care, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
