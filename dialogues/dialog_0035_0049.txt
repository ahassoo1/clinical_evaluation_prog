DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya. Well now, it’s… it’s my ears, I think. They just don’t seem to be workin’ like they used to. Things are… muffled, ya know? Hard to hear folks talkin’. Not sure when it started, exactly. It just… happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Muffled hearing. And you said it came on gradually, you weren’t sure exactly when?
PATIENT: Gradually… that sounds right. It wasn’t like a bang or somethin’. Just… slowly gettin’ harder to hear. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s been tellin’ me for a while now. Says I miss a lot of what people say. I mostly just nod and smile, ya know? Don’t wanna bother folks repeat’n themselves.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s good your daughter is looking out for you. And it’s common to not realize it’s getting worse on your own. Have you noticed it being worse in certain situations – like when there’s background noise, or when people aren’t speaking directly to you?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Background noise… oh, yes! Definitely worse then. Like at the grocery store. All that chatter… it's just a jumble. And when folks don't look right at me when they're talkin', it’s hard. Gotta have 'em lookin' at me, I guess. Or… or I just don’t hear ‘em at all. Now that I think of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, worse with background noise and when someone isn't facing you directly. Have you experienced any pain, ringing in your ears, or dizziness along with the muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, no pain, no. And dizziness… not really. There is a… a sort of… hum, sometimes. Not a loud ringin’, more like a… quiet hum. Happens mostly when it's real quiet, I reckon. Like at night, when I’m tryin’ to sleep. It’s not bothersome, usually. Just… there. I don't know if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet hum, mostly at night. That's good to know. Now, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… well now, let me see. Old age, I suppose! I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a while back, the doctor said. But I think it's been alright for years now. I don't remember takin' any pills for it lately. And… and nothin' else, really. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, to be honest. I mostly just stay home and take it easy. My Medicare covers things, I guess, but I don’t like botherin’ folks if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of high blood pressure, but not currently managed with medication. And you haven’t been to the doctor in a while. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little boy. That’s all I can remember. And… I was in the hospital once for the flu, a long, long time ago. But that wasn't nothin' serious. Just a bad case of the flu, that's all. And… no, I don’t think I’ve had any other surgeries or been in the hospital since then. It's been a long life, I'll tell ya that much. Mostly a quiet one.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and one hospitalization for the flu a long time ago. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… oh, dear. My daughter, Mary, she's real good. Comes to visit when she can. She worries about me somethin' fierce. And I had a brother, Thomas, but he passed away a few years back. He had… somethin' with his heart, I think. But I don’t know much about it. We weren't real close, you see. And… and that's about it, really. I don’t have many family left. It's a sad thing, growin' old. Folks just… disappear.
DOCTOR: Alright. Loss is hard. Now, do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take a little somethin’ for my arthritis, sometimes. Just when it’s really achin’. It's a white pill, I think. Don’t remember the name of it. And… and that's it. I don’t really take much of anythin’ else. I try to eat healthy, ya know? Fruits and vegetables, mostly. And I don’t go for all those fancy pills and potions. Just a waste of money, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white pill for arthritis, taken as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Oh, no, not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anythin’. I used to get hay fever when I was a boy, but that went away years ago. And… and no, I don’t think I have any allergies. I can eat pretty much anythin’ ya put in front of me. Lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Schneer, let’s do a quick exam of your ears. I’m going to use this little instrument to look inside your ears. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't hurt. Can you tell me if you've had any ear infections in the past?
PATIENT: Ear infections… Now that you mention it… I believe I did, when I was a little boy. Had to go to the doctor for those. I remember it bein' awful painful. They put somethin' in my ear, some kinda drops. And it smelled real bad! But that was a long, long time ago. Haven’t had any trouble with my ears since then, not ‘til now. Just this muffled hearin', ya know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, I’m looking at your ears now. I see some wax buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to the muffled hearing. The ear canals themselves look normal. Your eardrums are a little dull, which is consistent with wax buildup. I don't see any signs of infection. So, the most likely cause of your hearing loss right now is cerumen impaction – that’s wax buildup. We can try removing it to see if that improves your hearing. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Cerumen… wax buildup, ya say? Well, I ain't got nothin' to lose, do I? If that's what's makin' me hard of hearin', get rid of it! I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever ya think is best. Just get me hearin' again, that's all I ask. I miss hearin' Mary’s voice. She’s got a lovely voice, she does.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer. We’ll start with a simple wax removal procedure. I’ll use a special tool to gently remove the wax from your ears. It may feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. After that, we'll do a quick hearing test to see if it's helped. Sound good?
PATIENT: Sounds… good to me. Just get it over with, then. I ain't afraid of a little poke and prod. As long as it gets me hearin’ again, I’m happy. And… and go easy, now. I'm an old man, ya know. Bones ain’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to use this small instrument to carefully loosen and remove the wax. It may take a few minutes per ear. I’ll let you know if I feel any resistance. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any discomfort at all. Okay, now for the other ear…
