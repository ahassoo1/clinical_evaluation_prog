DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome. I’m Dr. Polczynski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a shaking. In my hands, mostly. It’s been… well, I don’t rightly know how long. A while, I guess. I just want to get it sorted, if that’s possible. Don’t have the patience for a long fuss about it, you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand. A shaking… in your hands. And you've noticed it for a while now. Okay. Could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: More… hmm. It’s worse when I try to do something precise. Like, holding a cup of coffee… or, you know, fiddling with things at the plant. Small things. It’s not constant, thankfully. Comes and goes. I haven’t… haven’t dropped anything important yet, if that helps. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain, really. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for explaining. So, it’s worse with fine motor skills – things that require a steady hand – and it’s not happening all the time. That’s good to know. Now, has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Changed…? Oh, dear. Let me think. Not really. Everything’s pretty much the same, I suppose. The plant… the plant’s the same old plant. Been working there… oh, goodness, decades. Divorced… years ago. No family close by. Just… the usual. No new medications, if that’s what you’re asking. I don't take much of anything. Can't remember the last time I even saw a doctor, to be honest. Is this going to take long? I have a shift later.
DOCTOR: No, this isn't going to be a long fuss, I promise. Just trying to get a good picture of things. No new medications… okay. And you said no family nearby?
PATIENT: That's right. No. My… my wife, she… well, that was a long time ago. No children. Just me, mostly. And the plant. I’ve always been a bit of a loner, I suppose. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know if this shaking is something serious, or just… old age catching up with me. Is that too much to ask? I’d rather know sooner than later. Less fuss that way.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Jezik, that’s not too much to ask at all. It’s perfectly reasonable to want answers. And wanting to know sooner rather than later is a good idea. We’ll figure this out. Let's talk about some other things, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm. Let me think. I… I’ve been a bit tired lately, I suppose. But who isn’t tired these days? And my hands… they feel a little stiff sometimes, but I just thought it was from working with the pipes at the plant. Cold weather doesn't help, naturally. Nothing major, honestly. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting old. It’s hard to tell what's new and what's just… me. Does that make sense? I don't like complaining, you know? Never been one for fussing.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Jezik. You're right, it's hard to separate what's new from the usual aches and pains. Stiffness in your hands, tiredness… okay. Now, have you noticed any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: Balance…? Now that’s a good question. I… I haven’t fallen, if that’s what you’re asking. But I have felt a little… unsteady on my feet a couple of times. Just a little wobble. Nothing dramatic. I just chalked it up to being tired. Or maybe the uneven ground at the plant. It’s not exactly a flat surface, you know? Is that something I should be worried about? I really don’t want to fall. That’d be a mess. .
DOCTOR: Okay. A little unsteadiness. That's good to know. We're gathering information. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if you're okay with that. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and coordination, and take a look at your hands. It will just be a brief check. Does that sound alright?
