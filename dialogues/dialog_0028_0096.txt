DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Memmolo. Well, it's about the sun, really. I've been getting really bothered by it lately. More than usual, anyway. My eyes feel super sensitive, and my skin... it just feels hot and uncomfortable even with a little bit of sun. It's been happening for a few weeks now, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe six or seven weeks? Hard to say exactly, things have been a bit… off since my wife passed. But definitely longer than a month, for sure. It's just gotten worse, though. Used to be able to handle a bit of sunshine, but now... not so much. Even driving to town is a problem sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said your eyes are sensitive… is that a pain, burning, blurry vision… or what exactly are you experiencing?
PATIENT: It’s not really pain, not exactly. More like… everything's just too bright. Like when you walk into a really sunny room after being in the dark, but it doesn't go away quickly. And it makes me squint a lot. Blurry vision sometimes, yeah, but mostly just uncomfortable. And it feels like they’re watering a lot more than usual, too. Sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things. It’s just… bright. And annoying.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And have you noticed any changes to your skin besides the heat and discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Now that you mention it… there’s been a rash, I think. It’s on my arms mostly, and a little bit on my face. It’s not… bubbly or anything, just red and itchy. It seems to get worse after being in the sun, of course. And it’s a bit bumpy, like little… well, little bumps. It’s not raised very much, though. I haven’t really done anything about it, just trying to stay out of the sun. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay. Any family history of skin conditions, or… sensitivities to the sun?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. My mother, she always wore a big hat when she was outside. She said she burned easily. And my grandmother, on my dad’s side, she had… I think it was some kind of skin cancer, years ago. They removed it, thankfully. But other than that, not really. No one else I can think of had problems with the sun. It's funny, though, because I never used to have any trouble until recently.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins, Doctor. Nothing prescribed. A multivitamin, and sometimes vitamin D, especially in the winter. I try to eat well, but you know… just to be safe. I don’t really take anything else regularly. Except for a little pain reliever if my arthritis is acting up, but that’s not every day. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your skin and eyes. If you don't mind. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Sure, no problem at all. Sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to adjust anything. I'm not very flexible these days.
DOCTOR: Just lie back. I’ll need to examine your arms first. Please expose them fully.
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. There. Is this alright? It might be a little chilly in here.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes. Redness, some papules… distribution seems consistent with sun exposure. Any pain with palpation?
PATIENT: No, not really. It's a little… sensitive, maybe? Like a mild itch, but not actual pain. It doesn't hurt when you touch it, just… feels a bit uncomfortable. You can poke around as much as you need to, Doctor. I’m used to a little discomfort with the arthritis, so this isn't too bad. Though that part still bothers me. But the rash... it's more of an irritation.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your eyes… let me take a quick look. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light. Conjunctiva is slightly inflamed. No obvious lesions. Okay. It could be photosensitivity, exacerbated by the recent weather. Or… a mild allergic reaction. Honestly, it’s hard to say without further testing.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Testing? What kind of testing? I'm not a fan of needles, if you don't mind me saying. And is it serious? Should I be worried? I just want to be able to go outside again without feeling like I'm burning up. I have a garden, you know. I really enjoy it.
DOCTOR: We could do a patch test to rule out contact dermatitis. And possibly a blood test to look for underlying autoimmune conditions, though that’s likely not necessary at this point. As for serious… it’s unlikely to be life-threatening. More of a nuisance, frankly. But prolonged sun exposure can lead to skin cancer, so we need to address it. I’m going to prescribe a topical corticosteroid to reduce the inflammation and itch. And I strongly recommend you avoid direct sunlight as much as possible. Wear protective clothing, a hat, and sunscreen with a high SPF.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… a lot. A patch test… that doesn't sound pleasant. But if it helps… alright. Sunscreen, hat, protective clothing… I can do that. I’ll try. What kind of sunscreen is best? And is there anything I can do for the itch right now? It’s really bothering me. I haven’t even been out in the sun all day, and it still feels… prickly.
DOCTOR: Broad-spectrum sunscreen, SPF 30 or higher. Apply liberally and reapply every two hours, or after swimming. As for the itch… an over-the-counter antihistamine might provide some relief. And… try not to scratch. It will only make it worse. Frankly, I’ve seen far worse. Don’t obsess. Just follow the instructions. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Broad-spectrum… right. And antihistamine. No, I… I think that’s it. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I’ll try not to obsess. I just… want to get back to my garden. I hope this works. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Avoid the sun. And if the rash worsens, or you develop a fever, see your primary care physician immediately. Next!
