DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I suppose I’m here because… things aren’t working properly. Honestly, I haven’t got all day to recount every little ailment. My vision went, quite suddenly, and my hearing isn’t what it used to be. It’s terribly inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Julie. Inconvenience is certainly frustrating. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Let's start with the vision change. Could you tell me when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, dates escape me. It was… recent. A week, perhaps? Two? It’s not as if the precise day matters, is it? It just… happened. Everything got blurry, and then… not much. I do recall it was after a particularly stressful bridge game. Perhaps it was strain? I do need to win, you understand.
DOCTOR: A week or two ago, following a stressful bridge game. Certainly possible that stress played a role. And was this blurriness sudden, or did it come on gradually?
PATIENT: Sudden, Doctor! I told you. Not a slow fade, if that’s what you’re implying. One moment I was clearly seeing my opponent’s deceitful face, the next… everything was rather indistinct. Really, this is quite basic, isn’t it? Do you always require such… detailed explanations?
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Julie. I simply want to gather as much information as possible to ensure the most accurate assessment. Sudden onset is important information. Now, regarding your hearing, you mentioned it's not what it used to be. Has this been a gradual decline, or more recent, like the vision change?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. The hearing… it’s been going for some time, probably. Not as abrupt as the vision. More of a… fading away. People mumble, you see. It's terribly rude, most of them. But I suppose it’s my age, isn’t it? Everything goes, eventually. I haven’t bothered to really pay attention, to be frank. It's just… quieter. Is that sufficient detail for you, Doctor? I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Julie. A gradual decline in hearing. And do you notice the hearing loss in one ear more than the other?
PATIENT: Goodness, Doctor, I haven't been conducting a self-assessment with tuning forks, have I? How would I know? Perhaps. Maybe the left one is a bit worse. It's difficult to say. Honestly, I mostly tune people out anyway. They rarely have anything interesting to say. Can we please move on? This is getting rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. We can move on. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're asking about my history? Honestly. As if that matters. I've always been a very healthy woman. I’ve lived a perfectly sensible life. I did have a rather unpleasant bout of the flu a few years ago, but I recovered perfectly well. And… I was divorced, some time ago. A very unpleasant business. Is that what you’re looking for? My personal life? Really, Doctor. This is becoming quite intrusive. I assure you, I’m quite fit for a woman of my age. Now, is there anything specific you need to know, or shall we simply proceed to some sort of… test? I have important things to attend to.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Ms. Julie. I simply want to ensure I have a complete picture of your health. The flu is helpful to know. We’ll skip the personal history for now. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I eat everything. I'm Salvadoran, Doctor, we have robust constitutions. Shellfish, nuts, pollen, whatever it is… I’ve never had a problem. Really, I'm a remarkably unremarkable patient. Can we please get on with it? I'm starting to feel quite faint just sitting here answering endless questions. This is a complete waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
