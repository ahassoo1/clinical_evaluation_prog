DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me in as concise a manner as possible what brings you in today. I have a rather full schedule, you understand.
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Honestly, it’s all rather… bureaucratic, isn’t it? New to the area, you see. Medicare insisted on a visit. A “social healthcare visit,” they called it. Seems a dreadful waste of everyone’s time, but here I am. I suppose I’m…healthy enough. Though my husband does worry about my…well, never mind. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: “Healthy enough” is not a diagnosis, Ms. Engelhaupt. Medicare does have certain requirements, however…unnecessary they may be. Very well. Let’s attempt to fulfill these requirements, shall we?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea what they require. I simply received a letter. A very official-looking letter, mind you, but full of…jargon. Is there a form I can fill out? Perhaps that would be simpler. I do dislike talking about myself.
DOCTOR: Forms are…generally insufficient. A brief history is necessary. Now, tell me, have you experienced any significant changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Significant changes? Goodness. Well… I do tire more easily than I used to, I suppose. But that's simply age, isn't it? And my knees ache when it rains. Though frankly, everyone's knees ache when it rains. Is that what you mean by "significant?" Really, I haven't been ill. Not properly ill, anyway. A little sniffle now and then, but nothing a good cup of tea can't fix.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and…arthralgia. I see. And is this fatigue…constant?
PATIENT: Constant? Oh, dear. Not constant, exactly. It comes and goes. Mostly when I've been… exerting myself. Gardening, mostly. I do enjoy my garden. Though it's been rather a struggle this year with the…weeds. And the heat, of course. One doesn’t have the energy for weeding in this weather. It's more…intermittent. Does that make sense? Honestly, I’m not sure why we’re even discussing this.
DOCTOR: Intermittent fatigue is still fatigue, Ms. Engelhaupt. Let's move on. Do you have any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? Oh, my. Well, I had a touch of… something with my gallbladder years ago. A very long time ago. They removed it, you see. But that was… decades. And I’ve always had rather low blood pressure, the doctor said. But it’s never been a problem. Nothing that required…intervention. Are we getting anywhere with this? I assure you, I'm perfectly capable of looking after myself.
DOCTOR: Cholecystectomy, decades prior. Hypotension. Very well. Any current medications you are taking, Ms. Engelhaupt?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Just…a little something for my blood pressure, occasionally. When it gets very low. A tiny little pill. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a… well, it’s not prescribed, exactly. Just something my neighbour gave me. It helps me relax. Honestly, I don’t take much. I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible. Chamomile tea, you see. It’s very effective.
DOCTOR: Unspecified antihypertensive, PRN. And an…unidentified sleep aid. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, dear. I don't believe so. I've always been rather…robust. I don't recall ever having a reaction to anything. Though, years ago, my mother had a rather bad experience with penicillin. But that was her, not me. Honestly, I can't recall anything specific. I simply don’t pay much attention to such things. Are we finished yet? This is rather tedious, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed to a brief physical examination, then. Please, lie back on the examination table. I need to listen to your heart and lungs. And perhaps check your blood pressure, despite your claims of “robustness.”
PATIENT: Oh. Now we get to the poking and prodding, do we? Honestly. Well, if you insist. But do be gentle, Doctor. My bones aren't what they used to be. And please don't take too long. My husband is expecting me for tea. .
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… slightly low, as you say. Heart sounds are regular, though somewhat diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Everything appears… within acceptable limits, Ms. Engelhaupt.
PATIENT: Within acceptable limits? Well, that's hardly a ringing endorsement, is it? Honestly, I told you I was perfectly healthy. This whole exercise has been a complete waste of time. I suppose I can go now? My husband will be wondering where I am. And the tea will be getting cold. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Engelhaupt. I recommend continuing your current regimen, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. If you experience any… significant changes in your condition, you may schedule a follow-up appointment. I suppose that concludes our visit. And please, be mindful of your blood pressure. You may get dressed now. .
PATIENT: Honestly. A complete waste of an afternoon. . Thank you, Doctor. Though I’m not entirely sure what I’ve accomplished here. .
