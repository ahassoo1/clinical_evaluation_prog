DOCTOR: Hi Jacquille, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Well, to be honest, my wife thought it was a good idea. I wanted to get checked for, you know… the HIV thing. Just to be sure, really. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s always good to be proactive about your health, and it’s wonderful that your wife encourages you to take care of yourself. So, you're interested in getting tested for HIV. Has anything specific made you or your wife concerned?
PATIENT: Concerned? No, not really. It's just… well, you hear things, don’t you? People being careless. And I travel a bit for work, different cities, different hotels. It’s not that I’ve done anything wrong, of course. Just… better safe than sorry, I suppose. She reads a lot of articles online, that’s where the idea came from. Honestly, I think she’s probably overreacting, but it’s easier to just get it done than argue with her.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s very reasonable to want to be cautious, especially with travel and hearing stories. And it’s smart to get checked, even if it’s just for peace of mind. No need to argue with a caring wife! Let's go over a little bit of your history, just to get a clearer picture. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve… always been careful. And I only ever had, you know, one partner before I met my wife. She’s very… particular about these things, so I assure you, everything was quite… proper. I don't go around having random encounters, if that's what you're implying. Honestly, a bit insulting to even ask, really.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, not at all! I apologize if that came across that way. It’s standard procedure to ask about past medical history, including STI testing, regardless of personal habits. I assure you, I wasn’t implying anything. Okay, good. So, you’ve only ever had one partner before your wife, and you’ve never been diagnosed with any STIs. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing at all. I can take pretty much anything. I used to get quite a lot of headaches when I was younger, so I’ve had a few different painkillers over the years, but no reactions. Not even to penicillin. I’m very… robust, shall we say. It’s probably all the fresh air I get when I'm travelling. You don’t get much of that in cities, you know.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No allergies is certainly helpful. And it sounds like you’re generally healthy. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just the occasional paracetamol for a headache, like I said. Nothing regular. My wife is always trying to get me to take vitamins, something for my “energy levels”, but I always forget. She buys them, they sit in the cupboard… it’s a waste of money, really. I eat perfectly well, I don’t need fancy pills. Unless you think I should be taking something specifically for this test?
DOCTOR: No, nothing specifically for the test. We don't need any special preparation. It sounds like you take good care of yourself overall. Now, let's talk a little bit about your travel. You mentioned you travel for work. Could you tell me a bit about where you travel to, and how often?
PATIENT: Right. Well, mostly Southeast Asia. Thailand, Vietnam, that sort of place. Sometimes I go to India, but that’s less frequent. It’s usually about once a month, for a week at a time. I stay in hotels, business-class hotels, mostly. Nothing… dodgy. I’m very careful about where I stay, you understand. I don't go wandering around in back alleys. It’s all work, meetings, conferences. Occasionally, I'll go to a nice restaurant, but that’s it. Honestly, it’s quite boring, really. It’s not a holiday.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Business travel to Southeast Asia about once a month, staying in business-class hotels. And you don’t engage in any risky behaviors while traveling. Now, just to complete the history, have you ever had any significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Nothing at all. I broke my arm when I was a child, climbing a tree, but that was decades ago. Completely healed. Other than that, just the usual colds and flu. I’ve always been very healthy. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. She was a very practical woman. I haven’t even been to the hospital in years. Are we almost done? This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, we're almost finished with the history portion. You’ve had a pretty clean bill of health, which is excellent. Just one last thing before we move onto the physical exam. Do you have any family history of significant illnesses, like heart disease, cancer, or HIV?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. My parents both lived to a good age. My father had a bit of a cough in his later years, but that was it. My mother was very healthy. And no, no history of anything… like that. My family are very… respectable people. We don’t have those sorts of problems. Really, I think I’ve answered everything. Can we just get on with the test now? This is all quite… intrusive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I apologize for the thoroughness, but it's important to have a complete picture. It sounds like you don't have any significant family medical history either. Okay, let's move onto the physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick examination. Then we can discuss the HIV test itself. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I have a conference call later, so I don’t want to be here all day. And please be gentle. I’m not used to being poked and prodded. Honestly, it's all a bit unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'm just checking your blood pressure now. Normal. 120 over 80. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm just going to check your lymph nodes. These are also normal, no swelling. Everything seems to be in good order so far. Ears and throat look clear as well. Now, the HIV test itself involves a simple blood draw. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and the results should be back within a few days. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A blood draw. Right. As long as it’s quick. I hate needles. You’re sure you can’t just… skip that part? It all seems a bit excessive, considering I’m perfectly healthy. And frankly, I’m rather busy. I still have emails to answer. But if you have to, get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, and I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. Unfortunately, a blood draw is the most accurate way to test for HIV. A rapid test is available, but for conclusive results, the standard lab test is preferred. I’ll just clean the area on your arm, then insert the needle. It’ll only be a brief pinch. Okay, all done. Just a little pressure here to stop any bleeding. There you go. All finished. I’ve labelled the sample and it will be sent to the lab. You should have the results back within 3-5 business days. We'll contact you by phone as soon as they are available. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me the results quickly. And try not to bother me unless it's absolutely necessary. I have important work to do. Honestly, this whole experience has been rather… inconvenient. I think I've answered all your questions, and I don't anticipate having any further concerns. Thank you. I suppose. Now, if you'll excuse me…
