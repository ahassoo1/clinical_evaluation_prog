DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Head... back of head hurts. Been hurtin’ for… maybe three days now? Not all the time. Comes and goes. Feels like… a tight band. Not a bad pain, just… there.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a tight band sensation at the back of your head, coming and going for three days. Okay. And would you say anything makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. When I bend over, maybe. Like when I was… fixin’ a little thing in the yard yesterday. Had to really look down. That made it feel tighter. Better… not much make it better, really. Maybe… when I sit still? Just restin’. Not doin’ nothin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. So bending over seems to aggravate it, and rest helps a little. Do you have any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other… hmm. Sometimes feel a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… light. And… my eyes feel tired. Been lookin’ at things close up a lot, I guess. Fixin’ little machines. Old hobby.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some dizziness and tired eyes as well. And you mentioned working on machines, so a lot of close-up work. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision… not really. Things look… blurry sometimes, but I always thought that was just my age. I am ninety years old, you know? Everything gets a little blurry. Not new, just… old blurry.
DOCTOR: Right, perfectly understandable. It’s good you’re aware of that. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not much. Old age things, I guess. Doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, a long time ago. Gave me some pills, I took ‘em for a while. Stopped takin’ ‘em, though. Felt better without ‘em, maybe. And… my wife, she was sick for a long time. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure in the past. And I understand about your wife. Do you remember what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, no I don't. Small white pill, I think. Doctor gave it to me at the… the old clinic. Before this one. It was… a long time ago. I don't remember the name. Just remember it made me tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's okay, we can look into that later if needed. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never needed nothin’ like that. Hospital… just when my wife… when she was very sick. But not for me. I stayed with her.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my son lives in the city. Doesn’t come visit much. He’s busy. Got a good job, I think. And… my daughter, she passed away a few years back. Sad time. Not much family left, really.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your daughter. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to nothin’. Maybe a little itchy sometimes from bug bites, but not a real allergy. I eat everything. My wife used to say I ate too much!
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no pills now. Stopped takin’ them all. Just… old age. Try to eat good, that’s all. Soup and tortillas, mostly. And coffee. Can't live without my coffee!
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications currently. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just tell me if it’s gonna hurt! Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: I will, absolutely. It shouldn't be painful, just a few checks. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles noted. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. 160 over 90. A bit elevated. And I'll just check your reflexes and some basic neurological function. Reflexes are a little diminished, but strength and coordination are intact. Finally, I'm going to do a quick eye exam. Pupils are equal and reactive to light, but there's some mild clouding of the lenses, consistent with cataracts. I notice some drusen as well. Overall vision is diminished. Now, do you feel any tenderness on the back of your head when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. Not bad pain, just… feels tight there. Like a muscle. Maybe I pulled somethin’ fixin’ things in the yard?
DOCTOR: Alright, some tenderness to palpation on the occipital muscles. That could certainly be contributing to your headache. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by muscle strain. The elevated blood pressure is something we'll need to address as well. However, given your age and the dizziness, I want to be thorough. To rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order a few simple tests. A complete blood count to check for infection or anemia, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to rule out thyroid problems. I also think it would be beneficial to get an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, alright. If you think it’s best. Sounds… complicated. But I trust you, Doctor. Just… tell me what it all means later, okay? I don’t understand much of that medical talk.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll explain everything in plain language. And we'll take it one step at a time. Okay, the nurse will come in shortly to draw some blood and get you set up for the EKG. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend taking it easy, staying hydrated, and avoiding strenuous activity. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help with the headache, but be sure to follow the dosage instructions carefully. We will also need to address your blood pressure. I'd like to start you on a low dose of a blood pressure medication. We'll monitor your blood pressure closely to see how you respond. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Yes. Will those pills make me sleepy? I like to stay busy, you know? And… how long will I have to wait for those test results? And… can I still drink my coffee? That’s important!
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions. The blood pressure medication can sometimes cause some drowsiness, especially when you first start taking it, but that usually subsides within a few days or weeks. We can start with a very low dose to minimize that effect. If you do feel sleepy, we can adjust the dosage or try a different medication. The test results usually come back within 24-48 hours. We’ll call you as soon as we have them, and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and make a plan. And yes, you can still drink your coffee! But in moderation. Too much caffeine can raise your blood pressure, so I'd recommend limiting yourself to one or two cups a day. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s good. Coffee is important! And not sleepy is good. Okay. I think I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very nicely.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to get those tests started. In the meantime, just try to relax. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. I’m glad I could help. Get some rest and we’ll talk soon.
