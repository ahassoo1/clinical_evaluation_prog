DOCTOR: Hi Hedy, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have a lot of time. I'm just... tired. Really tired. And I... well, it’s embarrassing, but I’ve been eating dirt. Not on purpose, exactly. It just... tastes good sometimes. And I feel weak. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. No need to be embarrassed, we'll figure this out together. It's good you're being honest with me. “Tired” can mean a lot of things, and the dirt... that's interesting. Let's start with the tiredness. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to say? I’m tired. All the time. Even when I sleep, which isn’t enough, by the way. It's been going on for… a while. Months, probably. Longer? Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. It makes it hard to work, though. I’m a programmer, you know. Gotta be sharp for that. Not like I can be sharp feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, months of persistent tiredness even with sleep… and impacting your work as a programmer. That’s important information. Do you feel tired from the moment you wake up, or does it get worse as the day goes on?
PATIENT: Oh, it's there when I wake up, alright. A heavy feeling. But it gets… heavier. Like someone's sitting on my chest. And the more I try to focus, the worse it gets. Which is… not great for my job. I used to be able to work all night, no problem. Now? Forget it. I'm lucky if I can get through the afternoon. Is this important? Because honestly, I feel like I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: It is important, Hedy. It sounds like this tiredness is significantly impacting your life, and we want to find out why. The feeling of heaviness in your chest is also something we need to explore. Now, let’s talk about this dirt you mentioned. How often are you eating dirt, and roughly how much?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Look, it's not like I'm shoveling it in. A little here, a little there. When I'm outside, mostly. After it rains, the clay is… nice. Smooth. A few mouthfuls, maybe? A couple times a week? It’s hard to say. I don't measure it, okay? It's a weird thing, I know. Don’t judge me.
DOCTOR: I'm not judging you at all, Hedy. It’s good you’re telling me these things, and I appreciate your honesty. Eating dirt, especially clay, can sometimes lead to nutrient deficiencies or even exposure to parasites, so we need to investigate that. Okay, let's switch gears a bit. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and the… dirt eating?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Well, I’ve been getting headaches. Dull ones, mostly. And I’ve been… forgetful. Worse than usual, I mean. I always forget things, but now… it's like my mind is just… foggy. I can’t seem to concentrate. Honestly, it's probably just old age. I’m not getting any younger. Is that what you want to hear?
DOCTOR: It's good you're noticing those things, and no, I don't want to just brush it off as old age. Headaches and increased forgetfulness alongside the tiredness are definitely things we need to look into. Now, regarding your past medical history – have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history… Honestly, I don’t really bother with doctors. I had… something… when I was younger. A fever, maybe? I don’t remember. My husband took care of all that stuff. He’s… gone now. I don’t remember details. It was a long time ago. And frankly, I doubt it’s important. I just want to know what’s making me so tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It’s understandable if you don’t remember details, especially if it was a long time ago. We can work with what we have. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… No. I don't think so. Maybe… a tooth pulled, once? A long time ago. Nothing major. Definitely no big operations. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major surgeries. Good to know. Let's talk about your family. Do you have any family history of medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, anemia, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, that’s a mess. My side of the family… a lot of… problems, honestly. Old age mostly. People just… getting old. My mother had… something… with her heart, I think. But I wasn’t really paying attention. My husband’s family was healthier, I guess. But he’s gone, so… what does it matter? This is useless. I’m telling you, I just need some energy.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of heart issues, but not a lot of specifics. We can note that. I understand you’re frustrated, Hedy, and I'm trying to get a full picture. It’s helpful to know even small details. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don't think so. Maybe a little sniffle when the pollen’s bad. But nothing serious. I eat everything. Look, can we please just get this over with? I’m starting to feel even more tired just talking about all of this. I need to get back to work, if I can even remember what I do anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don’t take anything. Never have. I don’t like pills. My husband tried to get me to take something for my… nerves, once. I threw it out. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. And no medications, that’s good to know. Okay, Hedy, I think I have a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam, if that's okay with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don’t poke me too much. I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, at 140 over 90. Your heart rhythm is a little irregular, and your reflexes are a bit slower than normal. Your coordination is also a little bit off. I’m also noting some pallor. It’s difficult to say exactly what’s going on right now, but these findings warrant further investigation. I think we should order some blood work to check for anemia, thyroid issues, and vitamin deficiencies, especially iron and B12. We also need to check your kidney and liver function. I would also like to order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… more poking? Fine. Just… tell me what you’re looking for. And how long is this going to take? I have deadlines, you know. And don’t tell me anything complicated. I don’t understand doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy, I understand your frustration. The blood work will help us understand what might be causing your tiredness and other symptoms. We're looking for things that could be causing anemia – that’s a low red blood cell count, and it can make you feel very tired. We're also checking your thyroid, as an underactive thyroid can also cause fatigue and other symptoms. And we want to rule out any vitamin deficiencies, as those can also contribute to your symptoms. The metabolic panel will check your kidney and liver function, as those organs play a role in energy levels. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. The results will usually take a couple of days to come back, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I want to ask you about the dirt eating again. Has it been happening for a long time?
PATIENT: Ugh, again with the dirt? Look, I already told you. It comes and goes. When I’m outside, and it looks… nice. Smooth. I don’t know, okay? It's just… appealing sometimes. It's not like I'm addicted to it. I just... crave it. It’s hard to explain. And it's none of your business. Can we just order the tests and get this over with? I'm starting to feel lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. I understand you’re not comfortable discussing this further, and that’s alright. We don't need to dwell on it if you don't want to. The craving is something we need to consider, as it could be related to a mineral deficiency, potentially iron. I'm going to order the blood work now. I’ll also give you a requisition for a stool sample. We'll check that for any parasites, just to be safe. I also want to stress that while we investigate the cause of your symptoms, it’s important to avoid eating dirt. It could be contributing to your current condition. I'll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood now. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. And hurry up. I feel awful. .
