DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… fitness check. For referee. Need paper say I okay. Want to be quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: A fitness check for refereeing, alright. And you’d like a note stating you’re cleared, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes. Exactly. Basketball, mostly. But sometimes… volleyball. Not much running, though. Mostly standing.
DOCTOR: Standing… right. While a basic check-up is always advisable, even for seemingly low-exertion activities, we'll need to cover some basics to ensure it's a thorough assessment, Mr. Shanor. It's important to establish a baseline. Have you had a physical within the last year?
PATIENT: Um… no. Not really. Long time. After… wife… hard to think about doctor things. Sorry. Don’t remember when last time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Shanor. Completely understandable. We will proceed as if this is a full initial examination, then. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No… nothing like that. Never told about anything. Always… okay, I think. Except… wife sick. But not me. Just… her. I don’t think that counts. Is blood pressure… bad? I don’t feel sick.
DOCTOR: It’s good you don’t feel sick, Mr. Shanor, but high blood pressure can exist without noticeable symptoms. It's important to rule things out. And for the sake of a complete record, we’ll need to address it. Now, any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never need. Small cut once, when young. Fall from tree. But mom fix. No doctor. Just… band-aid. Is that okay? Should I have gone to doctor then? I don’t… remember anyone saying I should.
DOCTOR: A band-aid is sufficient for a minor cut, Mr. Shanor. We are establishing a broader medical history, though. Have any close family members—parents, siblings—had any significant health issues?
PATIENT: Um… Mom okay. Still alive. But very old. Dad… dad gone long time. Work accident. Something with… metal? Not sure. Never talk about it much. Sister… she in China. Don’t see her. Don’t know about her health. Sorry. Not much help, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And currently, are you taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Don’t like pills. Never need. Just… sometimes drink tea. Green tea. Is that… a medicine? I don’t think so. Helps me sleep.
DOCTOR: Green tea is not considered a medicine, Mr. Shanor. Now, do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, insects, anything that causes a reaction?
PATIENT: No. I eat everything. Sometimes itchy from mosquito, but everyone get that. No… bad allergy. Never been to hospital for allergy. I think. Maybe when small? But mom fix. Just… cream. No doctor. I’m sorry. I don’t know much about… doctor things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Shanor. We'll get through this. Now, just to clarify, for the record, you’ve stated you do not have any known allergies. And you are not currently taking any medications. Now, let's move on to a brief physical examination. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your throat and ears. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Quick, right? I have things to do. Need to be fast. But… okay. Do what you need. Just… don’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat and loosen your shirt. I will begin with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, Mr. Shanor. We will need to monitor that. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is a little quick, but lungs sound clear. Now, open your mouth, and say "ah." Throat looks fine. Ears seem clear as well. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay… reflexes. What do you need me to do? I’m not good at… tests. Just tell me. But make it quick, please. I feel… little nervous now. Wife… always do tests. I don’t like tests.
DOCTOR: It’s a very simple test, Mr. Shanor. Just relax. I’m going to tap on your knees with this small hammer. It’s perfectly normal. Please lie back on the table. Reflexes are normal, though a little brisk. Finally, let me just check your pulse. Pulse is a little fast. Okay, that completes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Okay. Finished? That was… fast. What does it mean? Am I okay for referee? Need paper, remember? Quickly. My basketball team… they need me. I promised.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, while you are generally in good condition, your blood pressure and heart rate are elevated. It’s concerning. I wouldn’t advise clearing you for strenuous activity—even refereeing—without further investigation. There's a possibility of underlying issues that need to be addressed. We need to rule out hypertension and any potential cardiac abnormalities. I recommend a complete blood panel, an EKG, and a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist. I cannot provide a fitness-to-referee note at this time. It would be irresponsible of me. Do you understand?
