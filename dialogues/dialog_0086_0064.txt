DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s my chest. It… hurts sometimes. Not all the time, you know? More like a… squeezing. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? I think it was after I was helping my son move some boxes. He has so many books!
DOCTOR: A week ago, after lifting… alright. And this squeezing, where exactly in your chest do you feel it?
PATIENT: Right here, mostly. Not on the side, not in my back. Just… here. And sometimes it goes up to my throat a little bit. It’s… hard to explain. Not a sharp pain, not like when you fall, you know? More like… heavy.
DOCTOR: Heavy… alright. And does anything make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Resting makes it better, for sure. When I sit down and just… breathe, it goes away pretty quick. Walking… not so good. Especially if I’m going uphill. And… when I get excited. Like, if my grandkids come over, and they start running around… then it feels a little tighter. It’s silly, I know. But they are very energetic!
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Sherion. It’s good you’re paying attention to what triggers it. So, exertion and excitement seem to bring it on. Does it happen with any other activities?
PATIENT: Not that I've noticed. I do the cooking, you know? Lots of stirring. No problem there. I walk to the market sometimes, but I go slow. And I like to sit and watch the birds in the garden. That never makes it hurt! It's mostly just… when I’m doing something. Or thinking about something too much, maybe? My husband says I worry too much. He’s probably right.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, just to get a better picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor checked it once, a long time ago. He said it was a little high, but he didn't give me any pills. Just said to watch my salt. Cholesterol… no, I don’t think so. And diabetes, no. My mother had it, but I haven’t. I get my checkups, you know? Every year. Mostly just the normal things.
DOCTOR: And any history of heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had something. A heart… attack, I think? A long time ago. He was a smoker, you know? He stopped when he was older, but it was too late, maybe. And my aunt, she had a weak heart. She had to be careful. But that’s… that’s all I can remember, really. It was a long time ago. My family isn’t very good at remembering things, I think. Except for me! I remember everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just the one for my knee. Arthritis, you know? It gets bad when it rains. Little white pill. And sometimes, when I can't sleep, I take something over-the-counter. But that’s it. Nothing for my heart, or anything else. I can tell you exactly what it is, if you want. I write everything down.
DOCTOR: That's very good of you. No need to get it right now. Just the arthritis medication and the occasional sleep aid. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. My doctor checked when I was a little girl. Some kind of skin test, I think? He said I was fine. I can take most things. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’m a pretty healthy person, really. Even with my knee and my chest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Sherion, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Just so we have a baseline. If you could just sit up and lean forward a little bit?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. I always get nervous when they listen to my heart. It sounds so… loud, you know? Like a drum. But I trust you. My husband says I worry too much about everything. He’s probably right. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Your pulse is regular, but a bit fast at 88. I hear some… slight crackling in your lungs, mostly on the left side. And your heart… I do hear a slight murmur, but it’s difficult to assess definitively right now. It’s nothing to panic about, but it warrants further investigation. I think we should get a chest x-ray and an EKG. That will give us a better understanding of what's going on. Do you have any problems with lying flat for a few minutes for the x-ray?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A murmur, you say? Like a little… cat? My father had a murmur, I think. And crackling in my lungs… is that bad? I do get short of breath sometimes, especially when I climb the stairs. But I thought it was just my age. Lying flat… no, no problem. I can lie flat. I used to do yoga, you know? A long time ago. Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? My husband worries so much about me.
DOCTOR: Sherion, please try not to worry. A murmur simply means there's an unusual sound during your heartbeat. It doesn’t automatically mean something is seriously wrong. Many people have harmless murmurs. The crackling in your lungs could be a sign of fluid buildup, which can happen with various conditions, including a mild infection or even just age-related changes. That's why we need to get these tests, to rule things out. We’re being thorough, that's all. Climbing the stairs and being short of breath is something we need to investigate, but it's not an immediate emergency. We'll get the x-ray and EKG done right here in the clinic. It will take about 30 minutes. I'll review the results and then we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That's… good, I think. So, it's not like a bad bad thing? Just… checking? My son, he's a doctor too, you know? He always says to get a second opinion. But he lives very far away. He’s a surgeon. Very busy. Thirty minutes… alright. And the x-ray… is it safe? I heard… things. About radiation. And what if it shows something… serious? What then?
DOCTOR: Sherion, you are understandably anxious, but please, try to remain calm. The amount of radiation from a chest x-ray is very minimal, and the benefits of getting a clear diagnosis far outweigh the risks. We follow strict safety protocols. As for what if it shows something serious… well, that’s why we’re doing it, isn’t it?
