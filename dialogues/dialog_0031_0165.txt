DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. It’s this fever, keeps comin’ back. Been botherin’ me for a bit now. Not fun, lemme tell ya.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. It’s good to meet you as well. A recurring fever, you say. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it usually starts with just feelin’ kinda warm, like I got a little somethin’. Then it goes up pretty quick, maybe 101, 102. Lasts a day or so, then goes away. But then it comes back, maybe a week later, maybe two. It’s been happenin’ on and off for…oh, I dunno, maybe three months now? It’s hard to keep track, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Three months, on and off… I understand. And when the fever is present, do you experience any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. I get tired. Real tired. And achy, like I did too much workin’ in the garden. No cough or nothin' like that, thankfully. Sometimes my appetite goes away when I'm feelin' really bad. But that’s about it. Not much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and body aches accompanying the fever. No cough, and loss of appetite when the fever is high. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes, or anything that makes them better?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed a trigger, not that I can think of. It doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific. As for makin' it better… usually just restin’ and drinkin’ a lot of water. That usually helps it go away. But like I said, it always comes back.
DOCTOR: Alright. No identifiable triggers, and rest and fluids provide some temporary relief. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions. Have you travelled anywhere recently, even within the country?
PATIENT: Nope, haven't been anywhere. Been stickin' close to home, workin’ in the garden mostly. My wife, Elena, and I haven't taken a vacation in…well, a long time, to be honest. Too much to do around the house.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent travel. And are you experiencing any other symptoms at all, even if they don't seem directly related to the fever?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh! Sometimes my joints feel a little stiff in the mornin’. Just a little. It doesn’t last long, usually goes away after I get movin’. And… my stomach’s been a little off sometimes, kinda gurgly, you know? But that happens every now and then, I don't know if that's related.
DOCTOR: Joint stiffness in the morning and occasional stomach upset. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ like that. Doc says I’m pretty healthy for my age. Just the usual aches and pains from workin’ too hard, but nothin’ serious. I do gotta watch my back, old injury from when I was younger. But I've been managin’ it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Yeah, I had my appendix taken out when I was a kid. And… let’s see… a couple of things on my back, fixin' those old injuries I mentioned. Nothing major. Been a while, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and some back surgeries. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had arthritis, real bad. And my father had high blood pressure when he got older. That’s about all I can think of, really. No heart problems or nothin' like that. Just the arthritis and the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis and hypertension. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just some ibuprofen for my back when it's really botherin’ me. And…sometimes a little somethin’ for sleep if I’m really restless. That's about it. Nothin’ regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain and an occasional sleep aid. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Elena's the one with the allergies, not me. She gets itchy when she’s around cats, but I’m fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do, Doc. Let's get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your abdomen and joints. I will also take your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Range of motion is slightly limited in both knees, with mild discomfort on flexion. No visible swelling or redness. Your temperature is 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Pulse is 80 beats per minute and blood pressure is 130/80. Okay, everything seems relatively normal, but the elevated temperature and mild knee discomfort are worth investigating further. I'd like to order some blood work to check for signs of infection or inflammation. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Okay. Sounds good to me. No, not really, I guess. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back again?
DOCTOR: The results should be available within 2 to 3 business days. The lab will send them directly to the clinic, and we’ll contact you as soon as we have them. We will likely need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the next steps. Depending on what the blood work shows, we might need to do some additional testing. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest and drink plenty of fluids. You can continue taking ibuprofen for your back pain as needed, but try to avoid taking it for extended periods. Are you experiencing any difficulty breathing or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no trouble breathin' or chest pain. Just the fever and the tired feelin’. And the achy knees, I guess. Look, Doc, is it somethin’ serious? I just wanna know what I'm dealin’ with here.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Clide. It’s difficult to say definitively without the blood work results. However, based on your symptoms and the physical examination, it could be a viral infection, a bacterial infection, or even a form of inflammatory arthritis. It's important to rule out any serious causes. The blood work will help us narrow down the possibilities. We'll be looking for signs of infection, inflammation, and any other abnormalities. Once we have the results, we can develop a more specific treatment plan. I want to be upfront – the mild joint discomfort raises a slight concern for early-stage arthritis, but we’ll need the lab results to confirm or rule that out. For now, let's focus on getting those tests done and taking things one step at a time. I will call you with the results as soon as they are available. Do you have any other questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just… get those results quick, okay? And thanks, Doc. I appreciate you explainin’ things.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Clide. We’ll get those results back to you as quickly as possible. The lab has been notified to prioritize the test. The nurse will provide you with instructions on where to draw the blood, and a phone number if you have any issues. I’ll be in touch soon. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns.
