DOCTOR: Hi Kile, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. Doctor. Good to meet you too. I… new here. Just moved. Needed… the papers. For the… old people help. Medicare, you know? Is that right? I forget things so easy now.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is perfectly right. We’ll get everything sorted out for you, no problem at all. It's perfectly normal to have a little trouble remembering things, especially with a big move. Just to be clear, and to help me get a better picture of things, could you tell me a bit about why you needed to see a doctor today?
PATIENT: Why…? Oh. Well. It's… not a big thing. Just… a check-up. The lady at the… the place. She said I needed to. Said new people need to see the doctor. Routine, she said. I don’t feel sick. Never really do. Just… old, I guess. Is that good enough? I do makeup, you know. For the… theater. A long time. Still do. Not as much.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Kile. A routine check-up is a great reason to come in. And it sounds like you've been keeping busy with the theater – that's wonderful! It’s good to stay active. So, just to clarify, are there any specific concerns that prompted the lady at the office to suggest a check-up?
PATIENT: Concerns? Hmm. No. Not that I remember. She just… a list of things. Blood pressure, maybe? She said something about that. And… the eyes? She wanted to check the eyes. I think she said… blurry? But I have always had blurry eyes. Glasses, you know. Always. Not a big deal. I do eyelashes, so I need to see close. Is that… making sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, blurry vision is something you’ve lived with for a while, and she was just wanting to make sure everything is stable with that. And blood pressure… Okay. Just to be thorough, Kile, have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Recently…? Oh, dear. That is a hard one. Everything feels… the same, I think. Maybe… darker? It gets darker quicker, when the sun goes down. But that happens when you get old, doesn't it? I used to see all the… details. When I did the makeup. Now… I need more light. The younger girls, they have such good eyes. I don't know. I forget. Is that helpful? This is very… tiring. All these questions.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Kile, thank you. It sounds like you're describing some gradual changes, which is common as we get older. And yes, needing more light to see details is something many people experience. Okay. Let's take a quick step back. Besides the vision and maybe needing more light, are there any other things that have been bothering you lately?
PATIENT: Bothering…? Hmm. No. Not really. I get… tired. But who doesn't? Old bones, you know. And sometimes… a little dizzy. When I stand up too fast. But that's just my age. My wife… ex-wife, she always said I stood up too fast. She was always… complaining. Stop thinking about her. What was the question? No, nothing bothering me. Really. Just… old. I like quiet now. Less drama. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not a problem at all, Kile. It’s good that you’re prioritizing quiet now. Fatigue and occasional dizziness when standing up can be related to age, but it's good we’re talking about it. Just to be sure, how often would you say you experience the dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizziness…? Oh, not much. Maybe… once a week? Sometimes less. It's just… a little whoosh. Like the room spins for a second. I just hold onto something. The table, the counter. Don’t want to fall. My balance… not so good anymore. But I’m careful. Always have been. Don’t like making a fuss. Is that… enough information? I get lost in all these details. This is very… stressful.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Kile. Once a week is good to know. It’s good you’re being careful and that you have something to hold onto. Okay. Just a few more quick questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any changes in your heartbeat?
PATIENT: Chest pain…? No. Never had chest pain. Not that I remember. Shortness of breath… sometimes. When I climb the stairs. But that's just… old lungs. I used to smoke, you know. Long time ago. Quit years ago. Changes in… heartbeat? No. It beats. Sometimes fast, sometimes slow. But it always… beats. Is that enough? I feel a little… faint now. All this talking. Maybe I should sit down. Can I sit down?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, please do sit down. And thank you for letting me know. It's good you quit smoking years ago - that's excellent. Feeling faint is good to know, too. Okay, let's just take a moment. We'll do a quick exam, just to get a better picture of things. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood pressure… yes, she mentioned that. Heart and lungs… okay. Do it quickly, please. I don't like doctors. Never did. Too many… proddings. And poking. Just… quick, yes? I have… things to do. Not important things, but… things. And I'm getting very tired now. Can I have some water? My throat is dry. Is there water?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick as possible, I promise. And yes, of course, let me get you some water right away. Here you go. Just sip this slowly. We’ll start with your blood pressure, and then just listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. No poking, I promise.
PATIENT: Thank you. That is… cold. Always cold. The water. And the… the thing. It squeezes. Is it going to hurt? My arm is thin now. Not much meat on the bones. Just… squeeze it gently, please. I don't like pain. Never did. And don’t listen too long. It makes me nervous. All those… listening things. It feels… intrusive. Can I look away?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You can definitely look away. And I’ll be as gentle as possible. I promise I won't listen too long, and I’ll explain what I'm doing as I go. Okay, I’m just listening to your heart and lungs now. I’m hearing a slightly fast heartbeat, which could be related to your anxiety about the exam, or just your normal rate. I'm also listening for any unusual sounds. Everything seems… clear, but I’m going to listen a little longer just to be sure. Just breathe normally, Kile.
PATIENT: Anxiety…? Yes, I am anxious. Always have been. About… everything. Proddings, pokings, listening… it makes me nervous. Everything makes me nervous. Even quiet. Too much quiet makes me think. And I don't like thinking. Is that… normal? Fast heartbeat… yes, I feel it. Like a little bird fluttering in my chest. Please hurry. I have… things to do. Important things. Not really important, but… things. And I'm getting very tired now. Can I go soon? This is… stressful. Very stressful.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly understandable, Kile. And you’re right to feel that way. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical exams, and your fast heartbeat is likely due to that. Okay, I'm finished listening now. Everything seems clear, but just to get a complete picture, I’d like to check your reflexes and do a quick neurological exam. It’s very quick, I promise. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Neurological…? What is that? Is that… prodding? I don't like prodding. And reflexes… is that… hitting with a little hammer? I saw that on the television. They hit the knee. And the leg kicks. I don't want my leg to kick. I'm a delicate man. I do makeup. And… I don't want to be kicked. No. No prodding. No hitting. No kicking. Can I just… go now? I have… things. Important things. Not important, but… things. And I'm very tired. This is… too much. Very, very much.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right. No prodding, no hitting, no kicking. We will skip the neurological exam completely. It was my mistake for suggesting it without explaining it properly. Let’s just stop here. I understand you're feeling very tired and stressed, and we don't want to push you any further. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam we did, it seems like you’re experiencing some normal age-related changes, such as fatigue and occasional dizziness. However, given your anxiety and feeling of being unwell, I'd like to order some routine blood work to rule out anything else. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work…? Oh, dear. That means… needles? I hate needles. Always have. Faint at the sight of them. Can't stand them. No. No needles. Absolutely no needles. I'm too old for needles. And too delicate. I do makeup. And… I'm very tired now. Can I just… go now? Please? I have… things. Important things. Not important, but… things. And I'm getting very, very tired. This is… too much. Very, very, very much. I think I need to lie down. Can I lie down?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right. No needles. We will skip the blood work completely. It was my mistake for suggesting it, and I apologize. You are perfectly right to prioritize your comfort. Let's just stop here. Given your anxiety and feeling of being unwell, and your strong aversion to needles and further testing, I recommend that you focus on rest and relaxation. I also suggest scheduling a follow-up appointment in a month or two, just to check in and see how you're feeling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Follow-up…? Oh, dear. That means… coming back? To this… place? With the… proddings? And listening? And maybe… needles? No. No follow-up. Absolutely no follow-up. I have… things to do. Important things. Not important, but… things. And I'm very tired now. And I'm getting… faint. Can I just… go now? Please? I think I need to lie down. Right now. Can I just… leave? I have… things. Very, very important things. Not important, but… things. And I'm very, very, very tired.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kile. You can absolutely leave now. Please, take your time and get some rest. And don't worry about a follow-up - you do whatever feels best for you. Here's a card with the clinic's number if you change your mind. Please, take care of yourself. And don’t hesitate to seek help if you feel unwell. Goodbye, Kile.
