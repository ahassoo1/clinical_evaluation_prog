DOCTOR: Hi Raymonde, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's nice to meet you too. Well… it’s my stomach, mostly. Feels awful off lately. I don’t… I don't rightly know how to explain it. I just get sick to my stomach a lot, and I don't feel hungry, even when I should be. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s… worrying me some. I get full so fast too, just a few bites and I’m done.
DOCTOR: Okay, “awful off” and getting sick to your stomach… and not feeling hungry even when you should, that's a good start. And getting full very quickly, with just a few bites?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It’s like… my body just doesn’t want the food. Or maybe it can’t handle it? I don’t know. It's hard to say. It wasn’t always like this, you see. I used to have a good appetite. I really did. I’ve been eating less and less, trying to avoid feeling sick, but then I get weak. It’s a bit of a… a cycle, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A cycle, yes, I understand. And how long has this been going on, Raymonde?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It feels like… months now. Maybe three, maybe four? It’s hard to keep track, you know. Time slips away when you’re… when you're older. It wasn’t sudden, it just sort of… crept up on me. At first, it was just now and then, but it’s been more frequent lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months, gradually worsening. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the nausea and early fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… well, I’ve been tired, of course. But then, I'm always a little tired these days. I have lost a bit of weight, I reckon. My clothes feel a little looser than they used to. And sometimes… sometimes my stomach just hurts, a dull ache. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, some weight loss, and a dull ache in your stomach. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits – like diarrhea, constipation, or anything different in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a… personal question, isn’t it? Well… yes, actually. Things haven’t been regular. Mostly… mostly I’ve been a little constipated, if I’m being honest. It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely not like it used to be. Everything feels… slower, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, slower bowel movements, some constipation. And have you noticed any vomiting at all with the nausea?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no vomiting. Just the feeling like I might throw up, and the sick feeling, you know? It hasn’t actually happened, though. Just… a lot of uneasiness in my stomach. It’s just… unpleasant. I’m mostly just worried about why it’s happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, no vomiting, just the nausea and uneasiness. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, a long time back. And… and I was diagnosed with… with cancer a few years ago. Breast cancer. They treated it with… with everything they had. Chemo, radiation… I think. It’s all a bit of a blur now, honestly. I've been in remission for a while, though. At least, that’s what the doctors told me. I don't always remember everything, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a history of breast cancer in remission. That's important information, thank you for sharing that. And about how long ago were you treated for the breast cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it must have been… five, maybe six years ago? It’s hard to say for sure. Time really does fly when you're older. They did a lot of tests and scans back then, of course. I went to the hospital a lot. Now, I mostly just see my regular doctor for checkups.
DOCTOR: Okay, five or six years in remission. Do you recall what type of breast cancer it was?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… that's a tricky one. I remember them saying a lot of big words. I think… invasive ductal carcinoma? Was that it? I don't rightly know. I always just let the doctors do their thing, and I tried to follow their instructions. All those medical terms just went over my head, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, invasive ductal carcinoma. And are you currently taking any medications, Raymonde?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... Well, I take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was low on it. Other than that, no. Nothing much. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blood pressure medication and vitamin D. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat most everything, really. And I don’t spend much time outdoors, so I don’t really worry about pollen. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but I haven’t been stung in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, have you had any recent changes in your life, like stress, travel, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I live a pretty quiet life, you see. Mostly just me and my animals. I haven't travelled anywhere in years. My husband… well, he passed away a few years ago. It was a shock, of course. And… and I've mostly just been keeping to myself since then. No big changes, really. Just… trying to get by.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde, thank you for sharing all of that with me. That’s very helpful. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your tummy with my stethoscope and feel around gently. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. That sounds… sensible. Just be gentle, if you would. My stomach’s been a bit sensitive lately. And… and please don’t mind if I flinch a bit. It's just… I'm a bit jumpy these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, Raymonde, I will be very gentle. Okay, I’m listening to your stomach now. I’m not hearing anything unusual – no abnormal sounds. Now, I’m going to feel around gently. I'm noticing a little tenderness in your upper abdomen, on your right side, but nothing too significant. Your stomach feels soft overall, no masses or anything like that. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's… a little uncomfortable, yes. Right there… on the right side. It’s not sharp pain, just… a dull ache, like I said. It's been feeling that way for a while now. Not all the time, but… when you press there, yes. It’s… a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde. Dull ache with palpation in the right upper quadrant. That, combined with the other symptoms and your history, makes me want to order a couple of tests just to be sure we aren't missing anything. I want to do a blood test to check your liver function and rule out any infection. And I’d like to get an ultrasound of your abdomen to take a closer look at your liver, gallbladder, and other organs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… more tests. Well, I suppose it's best to be careful. If you think it's necessary, then yes, alright. Do whatever you think is best, dear. I trust your judgment. Just… try to make it quick, if you can. I don’t like being poked and prodded too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde. I understand. I’ll write the orders for the blood test and ultrasound right now. The lab and imaging center are just down the hall, and the staff there will help you schedule appointments. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and figure out the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat small, frequent meals and staying hydrated. And if you experience any worsening pain, fever, or nausea, please call my office right away.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Small meals… and stay hydrated. I can manage that. Thank you for… for everything. It's good to know someone is… looking after me. Just… please let me know what the tests show, alright? I do worry some.
DOCTOR: Of course, Raymonde. I will personally review the results and call you as soon as I have them, to discuss everything. I understand your worry, and we will figure this out together. Is there anything else I can help you with today, or any questions you have before you head to the lab and imaging center?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, dear. You've been very thorough. Thank you again… for listening to an old woman ramble on. I appreciate your kindness. I’ll go and get those tests done, and I’ll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. It’s my job to listen, and you’re not rambling at all. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns while you wait. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. You have a good day too. .
