DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Thut. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… my nails, I think. They just… look funny. Not good funny. I don't really know why I’m here, to be honest. Just seemed like a good idea at the time. They’re changing, you know?
DOCTOR: Changing, you say. Could you elaborate on that, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Well, the color… it's not like it used to be. More… yellowish. And they feel kinda thick, not smooth like they should. I don’t paint them or anything, so it's not that. It just happened, slowly. I don't remember when exactly. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: “Old age,” as you put it, is rarely the sole cause of nail changes, Ms. Thut. While age can contribute, we must rule out other possibilities. Thickening and yellowing… hmm. Have you noticed any changes to the shape of your nails, or any pain or discomfort associated with them?
PATIENT: Shape? Oh… now that you mention it… maybe they’re a little… curved? Like a claw, kinda. Not a big curve, but… yeah, I guess so. And no, no pain. Just… ugly. They’re just not nice to look at anymore. I don't like looking at my hands.
DOCTOR: “Ugly” is a subjective assessment, Ms. Thut, and doesn't aid in diagnosis. However, the curvature you describe is pertinent. Now, let’s move on to a more comprehensive review. Have you experienced any skin changes around your nails – redness, swelling, or scaling?
PATIENT: Skin changes…? I don’t know… not really. Maybe a little dry sometimes, but I always have dry skin. It’s the weather, probably. Everything is always so dry. I put lotion on, but it doesn’t help much. I don’t think my skin around my nails is any different than anywhere else. Honestly, I don't pay that much attention to my hands.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – diabetes, thyroid issues, perhaps psoriasis?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical conditions… let me think. I don’t think so. The doctor always asks me that, and I always say no. I had a little trouble with my stomach a few years back, but that cleared up. And my knees ache sometimes, but that’s just getting old. My sister, she had something with her… thyroid, maybe? But I don’t have that. I’m pretty sure. It was a long time ago. I don't really keep up with those things.
DOCTOR: A family history of thyroid issues is relevant, Ms. Thut. Do you recall if your sister was treated for hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism?
PATIENT: Hyper… hypo…? Oh, goodness. All those words! She was… tired a lot, I think. And she got… puffy. Around her face. That’s all I remember. She went to a doctor for it, of course. She always went to the doctor for everything. I don’t like going to the doctor. It's just… a bother, you know?
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… oh! I broke my arm once, when I was climbing a tree. That was a long time ago. I don’t think I’ve been in the hospital since then. Not for anything serious, anyway. Just… a regular check-up now and then.
DOCTOR: Now, Ms. Thut, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just my vitamins. A multi-vitamin, mostly. And sometimes I take something for my… indigestion. It’s a little purple pill. I can’t remember the name of it. It helps, usually. And… oh! Sometimes I take something for my knees, when they’re really bothering me. But that’s just ibuprofen, I think. You know, the regular kind. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Not that I know of. I get a little sniffly sometimes in the spring, but that’s just the pollen, I think. And… oh! I once had a bad reaction to a lotion, years ago. It made my skin all red and itchy. But that was a long time ago. I don’t use that lotion anymore, of course. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything important. Just… regular stuff.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Thut, if you’ll permit me, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination of your hands and nails. This will involve a visual inspection and gentle palpation. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you have to. But don't poke too hard. My hands are sensitive. And don't take too long, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. As I suspected, your nails exhibit signs of onychomycosis – a fungal infection. The thickening, discoloration, and slight curvature are consistent with this diagnosis. The surrounding skin is not significantly inflamed, which is a positive sign. The proximal nail fold does not appear significantly involved, ruling out more severe inflammatory processes. I'll need to order a fungal culture to confirm.
PATIENT: Fungus…? Oh, dear. Like… mold? Is that contagious? I don’t want to give it to anyone. I wash my hands all the time! What do I do about fungus? Do I have to take… pills? I don’t like taking pills.
DOCTOR: It is not quite the same as household mold, Ms. Thut. It's a specific type of fungal infection common in nails. And while it can be contagious, it’s typically spread through prolonged contact, not casual touch. Good hygiene, as you practice, minimizes the risk. Treatment options include topical antifungal medications, which are applied directly to the nails. In some cases, oral antifungal medications are necessary, particularly for more severe infections. We will begin with a topical treatment, and monitor your progress. However, oral medications may be required if the infection doesn't respond adequately. We will discuss the potential benefits and risks of each option before proceeding. I will write a prescription for you today.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Topical sounds better than pills. But do I have to file my nails? I get them done sometimes, and I don’t want to ruin them. And how long does this… topical stuff take to work? I have a luncheon next month, and I need my hands to look nice. Is it smelly? I don't want smelly hands.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Thut, filing the nails is necessary to allow the topical medication to penetrate effectively. The infected portion of the nail must be removed to facilitate treatment. As for your luncheon, it is unlikely you will see significant improvement within a month. Nail fungus treatment is a lengthy process, often taking several months, even with diligent application. Regarding odor, some topical medications have a slight odor, but it is generally mild and dissipates quickly. I will prescribe a formulation with minimal odor. It is imperative you follow the instructions precisely – consistent application is key. Here are detailed instructions. Please review them carefully. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to assess your progress. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Three months…? Oh, dear. That’s a long time. And what if it doesn’t work? Will I have to get the whole nail removed? I read something about that on the internet. It sounded awful. And what about my luncheon? I have to look presentable!
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, it is highly unlikely we will need to resort to nail removal. That is reserved for severe, refractory cases. The vast majority of patients respond well to topical treatment with consistent adherence to the regimen. I understand your concerns regarding your luncheon. While complete resolution within a month is unrealistic, diligent treatment will improve the appearance of your nails. I recommend keeping your nails trimmed and filed, and avoiding excessive moisture. It is also advisable to avoid sharing nail clippers or files. As for the internet, Ms. Thut, I strongly advise against self-diagnosing or relying on information from unreliable sources. I am here to provide you with the best possible care, and I will guide you through every step of the process. Do you have any specific questions about the medication itself – application technique, potential side effects?
PATIENT: Side effects…? Oh, dear. What kind of side effects? Will my skin turn red? Will my hands get itchy? I have sensitive skin, you know. And what if it interferes with my lotion? I need my lotion! I don't want anything to mess up my hands. It’s the only nice thing about me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, the topical antifungal medication has minimal side effects in most patients. Mild irritation, redness, or itching at the application site are possible, but uncommon. If you experience any significant discomfort, discontinue use and contact me. As for your lotion, it is unlikely to interfere with the medication, but avoid applying it immediately before or after application. Allow the medication to absorb fully. It’s imperative you prioritize the treatment regimen over your lotion for the next several months. I understand your concerns. However, dwelling on potential complications will only exacerbate your anxiety. I assure you, I will monitor your progress closely, and we will adjust the treatment plan as needed. Do you have any other concerns, or are you prepared to begin the regimen?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. I guess I can try it. But if my hands get red, I’m stopping. And if it messes up my luncheon, I’m blaming you. I expect good results.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Thut. I trust you will follow the instructions carefully. Please schedule a follow-up appointment at your convenience. Have a pleasant day. .
