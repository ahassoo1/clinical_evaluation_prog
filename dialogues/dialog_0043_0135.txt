DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Kalinski. It is a pleasure to meet you also. I am here because... well, I have something coming from my ear. A little liquid, you understand? It is… discharging. I noticed it three days ago, maybe.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that, Mr. Radillo. A discharge from the ear for three days… alright. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the liquid a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It is… clear, mostly. A little bit yellow, sometimes. Not much, you know? Not a lot. And… it does not smell. I think. I have tried to smell it, but it is difficult. It feels… wet, of course. And it makes my ear feel… full. A little bit uncomfortable, but not painful. Not yet, anyway.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you providing such a detailed description, Mr. Radillo. That's very helpful. And you’ve noticed this for approximately three days, and it’s clear with a slight yellow tinge, no odor, and causes a feeling of fullness, but not pain at this time. To get a more complete picture, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the discharge?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thinking… yes, I have. My hearing… it is a little quiet in that ear. Not completely gone, you understand. Just… softer. And… sometimes I hear a ringing. A very small ringing. Like a tiny bell. It comes and goes. And… I feel a little dizzy, perhaps? Not falling down dizzy, just… unsteady. A little bit. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very important, Mr. Radillo. Reduced hearing in the affected ear, a ringing sound – which we call tinnitus – and a sensation of dizziness… these all give me a better understanding of what we’re dealing with. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu, or any ear infections in the past?
PATIENT: Thinking… yes. I had a small cold, perhaps one month ago. Not a bad cold, just a little sniffle. And… when I was a boy, very young, I had many earaches. My mother… she always put warm oil in my ear. I do not remember much else. I have not had any trouble with my ears since, until now. No infections that a doctor saw, I do not think. Just the warm oil from my mother. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Radillo. A cold about a month ago and a history of earaches in childhood treated with warm oil… alright. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Allergies… I do not think so, Doctor. I have never been told I have any. I do not sneeze much. Sometimes, I feel a little itchy, but I thought that was just the weather. Dry air, you understand? I have lived in this city for many years, and the air… it can be very dry. I do not take any medicine for allergies. Is that what you are asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is exactly what I was asking, Mr. Radillo. And thank you for clarifying. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any members of your family who have experienced hearing loss, ear problems, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Thinking… my mother, she had trouble hearing when she was very old. Very, very old. She needed… a machine. A small machine in her ear to hear. My father, he did not have any trouble. And my brother… he is healthy, I believe. He lives in Somalia, so I do not see him often. I do not recall anyone else with ear problems, no. Just my mother, with the machine when she was old. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Radillo. A history of hearing loss in your mother later in life. Finally, before we proceed with an examination, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history, Doctor? Hmm… I am divorced, you understand. I have no children. I am a teacher, at the college. I teach history. And… I live alone, in a small apartment. I do not smoke. I drink… sometimes a small glass of wine with dinner. Not much. And I enjoy… reading. And walking in the park. Is that what you need to know? Anything else?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Radillo. That gives me a good sense of your lifestyle. No smoking, occasional social drinking, and a generally active lifestyle. Now, I would like to perform a brief examination of your ears, and perhaps check your hearing a little bit. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgement. Is it… will it hurt? I do not like pain, you understand. But I will try to be brave.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Radillo. I will be as gentle as possible. It shouldn't be painful, although you might feel a little pressure. First, I'm going to look inside your ears to see if I can identify the cause of the discharge. Then, I'll perform a quick hearing test. Okay, looking at your right ear now… I see some cerumen, or earwax, which is normal. The ear canal appears clear, and the eardrum looks intact. Now, looking at your left ear… I observe some mild inflammation of the ear canal, and I can see a small amount of clear, yellow discharge. The eardrum appears slightly cloudy, but I can still see its landmarks. Alright, and just performing a quick hearing test now… your hearing appears slightly diminished in the left ear compared to the right. It's subtle, but noticeable. Based on my examination, it appears you may have an external otitis, also known as swimmer's ear, or an inflammation of the outer ear canal. The discharge and inflammation suggest an infection. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out any other potential causes, I recommend a simple ear culture to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Swimmer’s ear… I do not swim, Doctor. I have not swum in many years. But… inflammation, infection… that sounds… unpleasant. An ear culture… yes, if you think it is necessary. I trust your judgement. What does it involve? Will it hurt? And… what if it is an infection? What will we do then? I prefer to know everything, you understand. It makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask those questions, Mr. Radillo. It's important you feel comfortable and informed. An ear culture involves gently taking a small swab of the discharge from your ear and sending it to the lab for analysis. It shouldn't be painful, although you might feel a slight pressure. It's similar to a COVID test swab. If the culture confirms an infection, we'll likely prescribe antibiotic ear drops to fight the bacteria. In most cases, these drops are very effective in clearing up the infection within a week or so. We would also discuss preventative measures to avoid future infections, such as keeping your ears dry after bathing or showering, and avoiding inserting anything into your ear canal. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding getting any water in your ear, and keeping the area clean and dry. Would you like me to order the ear culture for you today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. Order the culture. I would like to know what is happening. And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It does make me feel better. Avoiding water… that will be difficult. I enjoy my showers. But I will try. And… if the drops do not work? What then? Is there something more serious it could be? I do not wish to worry you, but I prefer to be prepared, you understand.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m happy to help. I’ll order the ear culture right away. The lab usually takes about 24-48 hours to provide the results. You are right to ask about what if the drops don't work. While most cases of external otitis respond well to antibiotic ear drops, sometimes the infection can be more resistant or persistent. If that happens, we would consider a few options: 1. Different Antibiotic Drops: We could try a different type of antibiotic ear drop that might be more effective. 2. Oral Antibiotics: In more severe cases, we might need to prescribe oral antibiotics to fight the infection from the inside. 3. Referral to an ENT specialist: If the infection is particularly stubborn or doesn't respond to treatment, I would refer you to an otolaryngologist – an ear, nose, and throat specialist – for further evaluation and management. Rarely, external otitis can lead to more serious complications, such as cellulitis – an infection of the skin around the ear – or, very rarely, a more severe infection of the inner ear. However, these complications are uncommon, and we would monitor you closely for any signs of these issues. I want to reassure you that we will do everything we can to get this infection under control and prevent any complications. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for some over-the-counter pain relievers to help manage any discomfort, and I’ll give you detailed instructions on how to care for your ear at home. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is all. You have answered everything I was worried about. Pain relievers will be helpful. And… thank you again. You are a very good doctor. I appreciate your patience and your explanations. I will follow your instructions carefully. And I will let your office know if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You are very kind, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. Please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any questions at all. We’re here to support you. I’ll have the nurse print out the instructions and the prescription for you. Have a good day, and please take care.
