DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day. Just… tired. Really, really tired. And I’ve been… eating dirt. Don’t look at me like that. It's just… something I gotta do, okay? It started a few weeks ago, I think. Honestly, dates aren’t my strong suit. Just… help me with the tired part.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt… alright. We can certainly discuss that, but let’s focus on the fatigue for now. A few weeks ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few weeks. Maybe longer? It all feels like one long… drag. I used to be able to get things done. Work… I program those… computer things. CNC, they call 'em. But now? I can barely get out of bed. And when I do get up, I just feel… weak. Like someone sucked all the energy out of me.
DOCTOR: CNC programming... okay, that's fairly physically undemanding work, so weakness is a bit concerning. Can you describe the weakness?
PATIENT: Physically undemanding? Excuse me? It takes a lot of focus! Anyway… weakness. Everywhere, I guess. Arms feel heavy. Legs… like they're filled with cement. Just… everything feels like it takes too much effort. Even… thinking. It's hard to explain. Like my brain is slow. And foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generalized weakness, feeling heavy limbs, and cognitive difficulties – brain fog, you said. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and weakness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… Well, I've been kinda… cranky, I guess. Snapping at people. My neighbor, poor woman, I yelled at her about her roses. Not my finest moment. And… my stomach's been off. Not… throwing up or anything, just… upset. Bloated, maybe. And I get… cold easily. Even when it's warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, irritability, gastrointestinal upset - bloating specifically, and feeling cold easily. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat when I remember. Which isn't often. And I’ve probably lost a little weight, maybe? Clothes feel a bit looser. Not that I’m paying much attention. Honestly, I haven’t stepped on a scale in… well, a long time. Look, can we just skip the details and figure out what's wrong with me? I have things to do, or had things to do, before this… tiredness took over.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. I understand your frustration. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a basic neurological assessment. It will help me narrow things down. Then we can discuss some possible causes and, if needed, run some tests. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests? Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just… hurry, okay? I really don’t have the patience for this. And don’t poke around too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit here, please. I'll start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the lower lobes, but nothing alarming. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Tenderness? Maybe… a little. It’s kinda just… always uncomfortable. Hard to tell. Right… here? No. Here? Yeah, a bit. It's just… bloated, you know? Like there's a balloon in there. It doesn't hurt hurt, just… unpleasant. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I detect some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. Now, let's do a quick neurological check. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Now you're testing my brain? Fine. It's… Two thousand and… twenty-five. Obviously. Though honestly, I’m losing track of everything these days. This whole thing is ridiculous. Just tell me what’s wrong and give me something to fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. Based on what you've told me, and the brief exam, there are a few possibilities. Your symptoms – fatigue, weakness, digestive issues, irritability, feeling cold, and the mention of eating dirt – are concerning. The dirt eating, specifically, raises a red flag for potential nutritional deficiencies, particularly iron. It also suggests pica, which can be a sign of underlying issues. However, it could also be a sign of anemia, hypothyroidism, or even something more serious. Given your age and symptoms, I'm ordering a complete blood count , a thyroid panel, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We also need to check your iron levels and vitamin D. I’m also going to order a stool sample to rule out any parasites or infections. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, tests… Fine. Whatever you think. I just want this over with. Anemia? What's that? Is it fixable? And will these tests take forever? Look, I have things I need to be doing, or had things to be doing, before… this. Just tell me when I can come back for the results.
DOCTOR: Anemia is a condition where you have a lower than normal number of red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout your body. It can cause fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms. It's often fixable with iron supplements or, in some cases, other treatments. The lab should be able to get the results back within 3-5 business days. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend trying to get some rest and drinking plenty of fluids. Given your mention of eating dirt, I strongly advise against continuing that practice. It can introduce harmful bacteria and parasites into your system. I can provide you with a referral to a nutritionist if you'd like to discuss potential dietary changes to address any cravings or deficiencies. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Nutritionist? Seriously? Look, I’ve been eating… things… for a long time. I'll think about it. Probably not. Just… when can I expect the call? And will I feel any better before then? This is just awful.
DOCTOR: The nurse will likely call you within 3 business days to schedule the follow-up appointment. As for feeling better before then... it's difficult to say. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms, and we can develop a treatment plan accordingly. Until then, try to prioritize rest and hydration. If your symptoms worsen significantly – severe weakness, dizziness, or any new symptoms – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. Just… let me go. I’ve wasted enough time here already.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are your lab orders. My nurse is just outside, she’ll escort you. If you have any questions after you leave, don't hesitate to call the clinic. Take care, Ms. Cantoran. .
PATIENT: .
