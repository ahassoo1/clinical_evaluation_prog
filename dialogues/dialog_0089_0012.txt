DOCTOR: Hi Velda, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a rather lovely one, actually, to the Mediterranean – and they require a bit of medical information before I can confirm my booking. I thought it best to get it sorted with a proper doctor, rather than trying to remember everything myself.
DOCTOR: Right, a cruise sounds wonderful! Excellent idea to get everything checked beforehand. So, this is primarily for the cruise documentation, or are you experiencing any health concerns you’d like to discuss while we’re at it?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no concerns at all, thank you. I’m quite fit and healthy for my age, I believe. It’s solely for the paperwork, the cruise line just has a very detailed form. They want to know about past illnesses, allergies, that sort of thing. Nothing to worry about, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. Let’s start with your past medical history then. Have you been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, heart problems – anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me think… My husband, God rest his soul, he had high blood pressure, but I never have. I did have a rather nasty bout of pneumonia when I was thirty-two, but that was fully resolved, and I haven't had any trouble with my lungs since. Oh, and I had my appendix out when I was a girl, but that’s hardly significant now, is it? Aside from that, nothing that springs to mind. I've always been lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: No, pneumonia and an appendectomy aren’t usually significant for a cruise form, but it’s good to have a complete picture. So, no history of diabetes, heart problems, or anything chronic?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. No diabetes, no heart problems, and nothing long-lasting or chronic. I did have a very bad case of the chickenpox as a child, but I imagine that’s quite a distant memory for these forms. And truthfully, I don't recall ever being seriously ill beyond the pneumonia I mentioned. I always kept a good constitution.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good to know. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Now, that’s a tricky one. I don’t have any food allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything – though I prefer a good Scottish oatcake to most things! However… I am terribly sensitive to certain pollens. Especially in the springtime. It makes my eyes water and my nose run something fierce. But it's just seasonal, and easily managed with a tissue, really. It's never been severe enough to require any medication.
DOCTOR: Okay, seasonal pollen allergy, no medication needed. Good to know. And how about any current medications you’re taking – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. Not a single one. I pride myself on staying as natural as possible. I take a multivitamin occasionally, just in the winter months, when there's less sunshine, but that’s the extent of it. I believe in a good diet and plenty of fresh air, that’s my secret! No pills for me, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That makes things quite straightforward. Now, just to complete the form, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother lived to a good age, eighty-nine, but she had some trouble with arthritis in her later years. My father, he was a strong man, but he suffered a stroke when he was seventy, unfortunately. My only brother is still alive and well, thankfully, but he does have high blood pressure, much like my husband. That seems to run in the menfolk, I suppose. As for anything else… I don’t recall any major illnesses on either side of the family, really. Mostly just the usual aches and pains of getting older. Is that the sort of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. So, arthritis in your mother, stroke in your father, and high blood pressure in your brother. Nothing else significant that you’re aware of. Okay. And finally, do you have any surgeries or hospitalizations beyond the appendectomy you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, nothing beyond the appendix when I was a girl. I’ve been remarkably lucky, I truly have. A few broken bones as a child – climbing trees, you see – but nothing that required a stay in hospital as an adult. I've always been careful, and I suppose I've been blessed with a good constitution. Honestly, Doctor, I can’t think of anything else to tell you. I hope I haven't been too tedious.
DOCTOR: Not at all, you've been very thorough. Just one quick thing – and this is more for the cruise line’s records – what is your approximate height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. I'm five foot seven, I believe. And as for weight… well, I'm a bit shy about it, but I’m around ten stone nine pounds. Perhaps a bit more after the oatcakes! I’m reasonably slim, I think, for my age. I try to keep active, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, five foot seven, ten stone nine pounds. Excellent. Just let me quickly review this information… Okay, everything seems complete. Do you have any known drug sensitivities or adverse reactions to any medications, even something mild?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I've never had any trouble with medications, thankfully. As I said, I don't take any, and I've never had any bad reactions to anything prescribed to me in the past – perhaps a bit of drowsiness with a sleeping tablet once, but nothing serious. I’m rather fortunate, really. My body seems to agree with most things.
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. Alright, Velda, I’ve completed the medical form for your cruise. I'll print it out for you now. It covers your medical history, allergies, medications, and recent physical information. Do you have any questions about anything on the form?
PATIENT: Oh, lovely! Thank you very much, Doctor. It all looks correct, yes. Everything is as I’ve described it. No, I don't think I have any questions. You’ve been very thorough, and I feel much more confident knowing I have this sorted for my cruise. Is there anything I owe you for this?
DOCTOR: No, you don't owe anything today. This is a standard medical form completion. It’s been a pleasure meeting you, Velda, and I hope you have a wonderful cruise! Enjoy the Mediterranean!
PATIENT: Oh, that is very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and assistance. I certainly will, and I’ll be sure to think of you when I’m enjoying the sunshine and the sea. Goodbye, and thank you again. I shall be on my way now.
