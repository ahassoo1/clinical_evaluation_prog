DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I want to know… about my family. Long time ago, you know? I hear now, you can find out… with spit? About where people come from? I want to know. I make little boats, all the time. Maybe find out where my people really come from, make better boats.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, I think I understand. You’re interested in genetic ancestry testing – learning more about your family history and origins. You’ve heard about it being done with a saliva sample, which is correct. It’s becoming quite popular. So, you’re hoping this information might help with your boat-making?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s right. Spit test. That’s what they say. My grandfather… he tell stories. About islands. But old stories, you know? Maybe this test… tell me true stories? About where we started. My boats… they feel like they need to go somewhere. If I know where people come from, maybe I make better boats for that place. Does that make sense? I not good with… explaining.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Scobie. Absolutely. You want to connect with your heritage, and you believe knowing your family's origins will inspire your craft. That's wonderful. Now, these tests aren’t perfect, mind you. They can give us a good idea of your ancestral origins, but they aren't a complete picture. There's a lot of history that isn’t written down, and these tests rely on comparing your DNA to existing databases. Before we get ahead of ourselves, let's just get a little more information about your health history, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Health history… I try to stay healthy. Eat fish, mostly. And walk. Not much trouble, really. Old man trouble, you know? Knees a little sore sometimes. And… I forget things. Not all things! But… important dates. Names of people I meet. Is that what you want to know? Big problems? I don't think so. Mostly just… old. Medicare pays for things, I think.
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful, thank you. Just the usual "old man trouble," as you say. And yes, memory changes are common as we age. We can certainly discuss those a bit more if they’re bothering you. Now, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been sick like that. Doctor back home… he check me every year. Always say I strong. Strong for old man! He listen to my heart, check my water. Say I drink too much water, maybe. But never tell me anything bad. Just say, “Keep making boats, Laury.” That’s all. No pills, no nothing. Just water and boats.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Scobie. Sounds like you had a good doctor back home. And that’s excellent advice – keep making boats! Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I cut myself sometimes… with wood. Small cuts. My wife… she used to bandage them. Long time ago now. But never go to hospital. Never need surgery. I strong. Mostly. I fix myself. Like fix boats. Small cuts, small problems. Nothing big.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hm. That's a hard one, Doctor. My grandfather… he had trouble breathing, I think. Old age, mostly. And my auntie… she had sadness. Always sad. Doctor give her… medicine for brain. But she not happy with it. She pass away a long time ago. Nobody talk about sickness much. Just… live. And make things. Boats, baskets, everything. Not much talk about bad things. You understand?
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Scobie. Family histories can be hard to trace, especially when people don’t talk about those things. It sounds like there might be some respiratory issues and perhaps some history of mood problems, but it’s difficult to say for sure. Now, let's talk a little bit about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoke. Never liked it. Smells bad. My wife… she tried once. Made her sick. And no alcohol, no nothing like that. Just water. And fish. And wood dust, maybe. From the boats. Is that bad? I wear a mask sometimes, when I cut the wood. But mostly… just water, fish, and wood. Simple life.
DOCTOR: No, that sounds perfectly fine, Mr. Scobie. Wood dust is something to be mindful of, and it’s good you’re using a mask. But overall, your lifestyle sounds very healthy. Now, before we talk about the ancestry test, I just want to quickly check if you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been allergic to anything. Eat everything. Fish, fruit, vegetables... everything. My wife… she allergic to cats. But I don't like cats. So, no problem. No hives, no trouble breathing, no nothing. Just… everything is good. I think.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Scobie. It sounds like you’re a very healthy man, all things considered. Now, let’s talk about this ancestry test. It’s a saliva sample, as you mentioned. The company will analyze your DNA and compare it to a database of genetic information from different populations around the world. They can give you an estimate of your ancestral origins, showing you what regions your ancestors likely came from. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very good. I want to see. See where my people came from. Maybe… maybe it tell me why I make boats like this. Different shapes, different sizes. Maybe it’s in my blood, you know? Where my blood come from. Will it tell me that? Will it tell me stories? That’s what I want. Not just names of places. Stories.
DOCTOR: It won’t tell you stories in the way your grandfather did, Mr. Scobie. But it can give you clues – information about the regions where your ancestors lived, and sometimes even information about their migration patterns. It might help you understand why your boats are different, why you feel drawn to certain shapes and sizes. It's more like… a starting point for your own story. The test itself is fairly simple. We’ll collect a saliva sample here in the office, and then we’ll send it to the lab. It usually takes a few weeks to get the results. It does cost a bit of money, around $200 or so. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: $200… that’s… okay. I save money. For wood. For boats. $200 for stories… maybe worth it. Will I need to come back here to get the stories? Or will it come in the mail? I not good with… computers. My wife… she used to do all the computers. Now… just me. And the boats.
DOCTOR: It will come in the mail, Mr. Scobie. And the results are usually presented in a fairly simple format, with maps and charts. We can go over the results together here in the office when they arrive, if you'd like. I can help you understand what they mean. No computer needed. We can also discuss whether the results raise any questions about your health that we need to investigate further. It's good to be cautious. So, if you’re comfortable, we can go ahead and collect that saliva sample now?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. You help me with the stories. And you check for bad things. That’s good. Yes, let’s do the spit test. I ready. Where I spit?
DOCTOR: Not quite spit directly, Mr. Scobie. This little tube has a special liquid in it. You just need to swish it around in your mouth for about a minute, then spit it back into the tube. It’s important not to eat or drink anything for about 30 minutes before we collect the sample. Here, let me show you…
PATIENT: There! Is that enough, Doctor? It taste funny. Like… salty water. But I did it. Now we wait for the stories? I hope it tell me good stories. Stories about strong people. And good boats.
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Mr. Scobie! Yes, that's plenty. And yes, now we wait for the stories. It will take a few weeks to get the results back from the lab. I'll have my nurse contact you when they arrive. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. And keep making those boats! Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you for your help. And thank you for listening to my stories. I hope the spit test bring me more. I go make boats now. Maybe better boats.
