DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Petrimoulx. Nice to meet you as well. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Said something about my cholesterol being high. Hyper… something or other. I don’t rightly remember all the fancy words, but it sounded serious enough to come on in. I don’t usually bother doctors much, but… well, a man’s gotta look after himself, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Hyperlipidemia – that's the fancy word you're referring to. It simply means high cholesterol. It's good you came in to get it checked out. We'll figure out what's going on and the best way to manage it. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve been… pretty good, all things considered. I’m 88, you know. Things start creakin’ and groanin’ at this age. I get a little tired easier now than I used to, but nothing major. I used to be a pretty active fella, worked hard my whole life. I was a supervisor, lookin' after folks who… well, they helped people who needed help, if that makes sense. Lots of paperwork, lots of driving. I don’t do much of that anymore, though. My wife… she passed a few years back. I mostly keep to myself now. Eat what I want, I suppose. Not much reason to cook big meals for one. Does that tell you anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, that tells me quite a bit, thank you. It sounds like you've lived a full and active life, and I'm sorry to hear about your wife. It's understandable to change routines after such a loss. Let’s talk a little more specifically about your health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… The doctor, back in ’87, he said somethin’ about my blood pressure bein’ a little high, but he just told me to cut back on salt. I think that worked alright. Other than that… no, nothin’ really. I’ve always been a pretty strong fella, never really got sick much. Had the usual colds and flu, but nothin’ serious. No diabetes, no heart trouble… I don’t think so, anyway. I’ve never had any tests for it, not unless that blood work picked somethin’ up. I always figured if somethin’ was wrong, I’d know it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And you’re right, sometimes you just feel when something isn't right. We'll certainly take that into account. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let's see... I had my appendix out when I was a young man, must've been… oh, 1958, maybe? And I broke my wrist once, fallin' off a ladder while I was fixin' the roof. That needed a cast, but nothin’ serious. Other than that, no, I haven’t been inside a hospital for anythin’ much. A few overnight stays when the kids were born, but that doesn’t really count, does it?
DOCTOR: No, those don’t really count! It sounds like you’ve been very fortunate. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any health problems like heart disease, high cholesterol, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: That's a tough one, Doctor. My family… well, we weren’t big on talkin’ about health, not really. My mother, she died young, from somethin’ with her heart, I think. But she didn’t go to doctors much either, so nobody knew exactly what it was. My father… he lived a long life, but he was a quiet fella. I don't recall ever hearin' about him havin’ any trouble with his heart or anything. I had a brother and two sisters, but they’ve all passed away now. And I honestly don’t remember much about their health. We weren’t close, not really. I’m sorry I can’t be much help on that one. It just wasn’t somethin’ we talked about.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bohnett. It's common for families not to discuss health issues openly. We'll work with what we have. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Not a one, Doctor. Nope. I don't take nothin'. Never really been one for pills. I might take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. And I don't hold with those fancy vitamins and supplements. Seems like a waste of money, if you ask me. I just try to eat a decent meal and get a little bit of exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten just about everything there is to eat, and never had a problem. I've been stung by a bee or two in my time, but that just makes you swell up a bit. Nothing serious. I don't have any trouble with pollen or dust or anything like that, either. I’m pretty lucky that way, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That is good. Alright, Mr. Bohnett, before we move on to a quick physical exam, I just have a couple of social history questions. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life, Doctor. My wife, she tried it once, back when she was a young woman, but she didn't care for it. Said it made her cough. I always thought it was a foolish habit, and I steered clear of it.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, I used to have a beer with dinner now and then, back when my wife was still around. Just one, maybe two. Nothing fancy. But I haven’t really been drinkin’ much lately. Didn’t feel much point in it, drinkin’ alone.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Now, one last question for the social history. Are you currently employed, or are you retired?
PATIENT: Retired now, Doctor. Been that way for… oh, must be twenty years or more. I used to be a supervisor, like I mentioned earlier. Lookin' after folks who helped people. It was good work, important work, but it was hard work too. Lots of responsibility. I miss it sometimes, but I enjoy havin’ the time to myself.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a fulfilling career, Mr. Bohnett. Alright, now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It won’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Sounds alright to me, Doctor. Go right ahead. I haven't had a proper check-up in… well, I don’t even remember. Been feelin’ alright, mostly. But I suppose it's always good to make sure.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart rate is a little slow, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. I hear a very mild murmur, but it’s not concerning given your age. It's likely a benign flow murmur. Lungs are clear bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Ears are clear. Throat looks normal. No redness or swelling. Alright, everything sounds and looks reasonably good for your age, Mr. Bohnett. Now, going back to that lab report that brought you in today… Do you happen to have it with you?
PATIENT: I might, Doctor. Let me see… Here it is, I think. It’s a bit of a mess, my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. I didn't really understand most of it, to be honest. Lots of numbers and fancy words. It was the "high cholesterol" part that worried me.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a look here… Yes, your total cholesterol is elevated at 240 mg/dL. Your LDL cholesterol – that's the "bad" cholesterol – is 160 mg/dL, which is above the optimal level. Your HDL – the "good" cholesterol – is 40 mg/dL, which is a bit on the low side. And your triglycerides are 180 mg/dL, which is within the normal range. Based on these results, you do have hyperlipidemia, or high cholesterol. Now, this doesn't necessarily mean you need to be on medication right away. We have other options we can try first. It’s important to remember these are numbers, and we treat the person not just the numbers. Do you have any questions about these results so far?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a lot of numbers. Is it… serious? I mean, I feel alright. I don’t want to start takin’ pills if I don’t have to. Is there somethin’ I can do? Change my diet or somethin’? I’ve always liked my food, you know.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking those questions, Mr. Bohnett. It’s not an immediate emergency, and we’ll work together to find a solution that’s right for you. High cholesterol, if left untreated, can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. But, there are definitely things we can do about it. Often, lifestyle changes are very effective, especially in the early stages. The first thing I recommend is a heart-healthy diet. This means reducing your intake of saturated and trans fats, found in things like red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. Increasing your fiber intake – fruits, vegetables, whole grains – is also important. Regular exercise is also beneficial – even a 30-minute walk most days of the week can make a difference. And, if you’re overweight, losing even a few pounds can help lower your cholesterol levels. I'd like to start with those lifestyle modifications for the next three months. We'll repeat the blood work then to see how you're doing. If your cholesterol hasn’t come down enough with these changes, then we can discuss medication options. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… alright. I suppose I can try. I don’t mind walkin’, I used to walk a lot when my wife was still around. And I can try to eat a bit healthier, cut back on the sweets and the fried chicken. It’ll be hard, mind you. But I can try. So… no pills right away? Just try these changes and see what happens?
DOCTOR: Exactly. No pills right away. We’ll see how you respond to the lifestyle changes first. I'm confident you can make some positive changes, and we’ll be here to support you every step of the way. I'll give you a handout with some information about heart-healthy eating and exercise. Do you have any questions about this information, or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me have a look… This is a lot to take in. Is there a website or somethin’ I can look at too? My granddaughter, she’s good with computers, maybe she can help me find some recipes or somethin’. And… what if I really crave somethin’ unhealthy? Like, a piece of pie? Is that gonna ruin everything?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Bohnett. Yes, there are several reputable websites with heart-healthy recipes and information. The American Heart Association website – heart.org – is a great resource. And the National Institutes of Health – nih.gov – also has a lot of helpful information. And as for craving something unhealthy… a small indulgence now and then won't ruin everything. It's about making overall healthy choices most of the time. Think of it as an 80/20 rule – eat healthily 80% of the time, and allow yourself a treat 20% of the time. The key is to be mindful of your portions and to not overdo it. We want to make sustainable changes, not restrict yourself completely. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. I’ll try my best to follow your advice. And I’ll look up those websites. Maybe my granddaughter can help me make a healthy pie! I appreciate you takin’ the time with an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. It was my pleasure. Remember, I'm here to support you. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll see you back in three months for a repeat blood work. Have a wonderful day, and best of luck with the healthy pie! .
PATIENT: .
