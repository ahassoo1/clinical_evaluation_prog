DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Thut. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uhm, hi Doctor. It's my nails. They… they just look funny, okay? Not like they feel funny, just… look different. I don't know what's wrong with them. They always been good nails, mostly.
DOCTOR: “Funny” how, exactly?
PATIENT: Well, they got…lines, I guess? And the color, it’s not right. Usually they’re, like, a normal pink. Now they’re kinda…pale. And stripey. I don't know why they’re stripey. I put polish on them sometimes, but not always. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Polish could be a factor, yes. Though, honestly, it sounds…unlikely. Let’s take a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay. But don’t think it's the polish. It's good polish, okay? Not that cheap stuff. I get it from the store... the one near my place. I don’t know what’s happening, it just bothers me to look at them now. They used to be nice.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I see what you mean. The lines are…transverse, running across the nail. And yes, the color is somewhat diminished. Do you notice this on all ten nails, or just some?
PATIENT: Uhm…all of ‘em, I think. Yeah, pretty sure. It’s not just one, Doctor. All of ‘em look…blah. I don't look at my hands that much, okay? But when I was painting them yesterday, I noticed. They just looked…wrong. Is it serious? Don't tell me it's something awful.
DOCTOR: Serious is…a strong word. It could be a number of things. We’ll need to rule some things out. Have you had any recent illnesses, even a bad cold?
PATIENT: Uhm…a cold? Let me think. Not really. Maybe a little sniffle last winter? But nothing major, okay? I don't get sick much. I eat good, mostly. And I take my vitamins. It’s just… the nails! They never looked like this before. It’s probably nothing, right? Just old age or something?
DOCTOR: Age can contribute to nail changes, yes, but at 40, that's less likely to be the sole cause. Do you have any family history of nail problems?
PATIENT: Uhm…my mom? She had nice nails, I think. Always painted them red. I don’t think she ever had problems. My grandma… she didn’t really care about her nails. She was a farmer, okay? Had dirt under 'em all the time. Not sure if she had lines or anything. I don’t really remember. This is a silly question, right? I just want my nails to look normal again.
DOCTOR: It’s not a “silly” question, Ms. Thut. It’s information. Alright. And what about your diet, specifically?
PATIENT: Uhm… I eat pretty regular. I like chicken, okay? And rice. And vegetables, when I feel like it. I drink water. I don't eat a lot of junk food. Not like those kids you see, eating fries all the time. Does it matter what kind of vegetables? I like the green ones, mostly. And carrots. I eat carrots sometimes. I’m a healthy person!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's run a few blood tests, just to rule out any deficiencies. It’s standard procedure when we see nail changes like this. We’ll check your iron, zinc, and thyroid function. Also, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Uhm… medications? Let me think… I take a vitamin, okay? A multivitamin. That's it! No pills for anything else. I don't like taking pills. Makes me feel sick. Blood tests? Okay, but I don’t like needles. They always poke around too much. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It's just a small prick, Ms. Thut. Hardly noticeable. The lab technician is very good. Now, about these blood tests... do you have any allergies to latex?
PATIENT: Uhm…latex? I don’t know. What is latex? Is that in those gloves the Doctor wears? I don’t think so… I haven’t had any problems with gloves before. I don’t have any allergies, okay? I’m not a sensitive person. Just want to know what’s wrong with my nails. Is it something bad? Please tell me it’s not something bad.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Thut, let's not jump to conclusions. We're gathering information. It could be a simple deficiency, it could be something else. We need to see the bloodwork results first. Now, let’s get you over to the lab. I’ll have them draw a few vials. Afterwards, we’ll discuss the next steps. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But be quick, okay? I have things to do. And don't poke around too much. And tell me what it is when you find out. Don't make me come back here a million times. And is it going to cost a lot of money? I'm on Medicare, okay?
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover the tests, yes. The lab will handle the billing. And I assure you, we'll get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. Follow me, please. Let’s get this over with.
PATIENT: Fine. But you better not tell me it’s something awful. I don't want to hear about anything awful, okay? Just fix my nails. That’s all I want. Let’s just…get it done.
DOCTOR: .
