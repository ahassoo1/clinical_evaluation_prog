DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have several patients scheduled, so if you could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Right, yes. Well, I’m here for… a check-up. Before I get some… work done. Cosmetic work. Not that it’s necessary, mind you. Just… improving things. My daughter insisted. Said it was time. Honestly, at my age, what’s the point, but here I am.
DOCTOR: A cosmetic procedure… very well. And to clarify, Mr. Orwin, is this your first visit with our practice?
PATIENT: First visit? Well, yes, I suppose it is. I usually just… get things done. Don't bother with all this preliminary fuss. But, yes. First visit here. Are we going to talk about my medical history all day, or…? I haven’t got all the time in the world, you know.
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Mr. Orwin, to review your medical background before any treatment, even cosmetic. It’s for your safety. Now, have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Look, I’m a healthy Norwegian man. We’re built tough. Ate fish and potatoes my whole life. No fancy illnesses. A little arthritis, maybe, what old man doesn't have that? But nothing a good soak doesn't fix. Honestly, I doubt it's relevant. What does my heart have to do with my face?
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, even seemingly unrelated conditions can impact healing and the suitability of procedures. Arthritis, for instance, can affect your immune system. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh, yes. Appendicitis, back in ‘68, I believe. And… a hernia, maybe ten years after that. Nothing major. And a few teeth pulled, if you count that. Don’t see what that has to do with anything, either. Honestly, this is quite a lot of bother for a little touch-up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I eat everything. A proper diet, you see. None of this… modern food. Just… no. I’m not allergic to anything. Perfectly fine. Now, are we getting any closer to actually doing something? My daughter will have my hide if I'm here all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter supplements or vitamins?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I take a little fish oil, for the joints, you know? And sometimes, when I’m feeling a bit stiff, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s it. Nothing regular. Just when I need it. Now, look, I told you, I'm a healthy man. Is this all going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I suppose we can proceed. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, please lie down on the examination table so I can have a quick look. It’s a standard part of the procedure, and it will help me determine the best course of action. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don’t expect me to lie here all day. And please, be gentle. My back isn't what it used to be. Honestly, all this fuss… I should have just stayed home. .
DOCTOR: Please lie flat, Mr. Orwin. And try to relax. Heart sounds… slightly muffled, but regular rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, if you'll permit, I’ll just check your blood pressure.
