DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Brum is my name, yes. I have… a headache. Back of my head. It started a few days ago. Not so bad at first, but it’s getting worse. Feels like… pressure, maybe? Like someone is squeezing.
DOCTOR: A headache, alright. And you say it’s been a few days, and is worsening. Pressure at the back of the head… can you describe the pain a little more precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm. Precise… that’s hard. It’s not sharp, not like a… a nail. More like a heavy weight. It hurts most when I try to… think hard. Or when I bend over. Makes my eyes feel funny too, sometimes. A little blurry. Does that make sense? I worked with the trains for a long time, you know. Lots of bending, lifting… maybe that has something to do with it.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a dull, pressure-like headache, worsening over a few days, located at the back of the head. Aggravated by exertion – thinking, bending. And you’re experiencing some blurry vision with it. You mentioned working with trains… what kind of work specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Trains… I did everything, really. Started as a… a yard man, moving the cars around. Then I learned to drive the little engine, the dinky. You know, the one that moves the cars in the yard? And then… hostling, they called it. Switching the cars, getting them ready to go. Did that for… fifty years, maybe more. Lots of shaking, bumping… and hot sun. We didn’t have much shade. Now I mostly just… sit. Makes my bones ache more, if you know what I mean. But the headache… that's new.
DOCTOR: Fifty years… quite a long time. A lot of physical work, then a sudden change to mostly sitting. We’ll need to explore that. And the lack of sun protection is concerning. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Not much, really. I get tired, but I am ninety years old! I sleep okay, mostly. Sometimes my stomach feels… upset. Not sick, just… not right. And my hands… they shake a little, always have. But I don’t think that’s new. Oh! And I get dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast. It doesn’t last long. Is that important? I forget things too… but that’s just old age, right? Like where I put my glasses.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's try to be thorough. So, fatigue, occasional stomach upset, hand tremors, dizziness upon standing, and some memory issues. We'll address all of this. Now, regarding your medications… are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no, Doctor. Not really. I tried some pills for my bones, a long time ago, but they made my stomach even worse. So I stopped. I don’t take anything now. Just… water. And sometimes a little coffee. My wife, she used to make it strong. I miss her. She knew what was good for me. She would… never mind. Just water and coffee. No pills. And no supplements, whatever those are.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications currently. Let's do a quick physical exam. If you don't mind, please lie down on the examination table. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also do a quick neurological exam, just to assess your reflexes and coordination.
PATIENT: Okay. Exam… yes. I don’t mind. It's been a long time since I had one. Bones are getting old and creaky, you know. Be careful. This way.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 158/92. Pulse is 78 and regular. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your age and the headache. Heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation, but diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and equal. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Coordination is slightly impaired, particularly with finger-to-nose testing. I’m noting some mild nystagmus as well. Do you experience any double vision or difficulty with balance?
PATIENT: Double vision? No, not really. Sometimes things are blurry, but not… two of them. Balance… well, I wobble a little when I stand up, like I said. But I always have. Old age, maybe? What does nystagmus mean? Is that bad? I don’t like it when doctors use big words. Makes me nervous. I just want to know if this headache is something serious. Is it my brain?
DOCTOR: Nystagmus refers to involuntary, repetitive eye movements. It can be a sign of various neurological issues, but it doesn't automatically mean anything serious. It’s just another piece of the puzzle. Given your symptoms – headache, blurry vision, dizziness, impaired coordination, and the nystagmus – it’s important to rule out several possibilities. We need to investigate this further. I want to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your head. The CT scan will help us visualize your brain and rule out any structural abnormalities. I also want to check your vitamin B12 levels. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? What is that? I don’t think so… I’ve never had anything like that before. No allergies that I know of. I eat everything. My wife, she made sure I had a good diet. But… a CT scan? That sounds… serious. What are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something bad? I’m getting worried now. And all those tests… how much will they cost? I don’t have insurance, you know. Just me, now.
DOCTOR: The CT scan uses a special dye – the contrast dye – to help highlight different structures in your brain. It's a standard procedure for evaluating headaches and neurological symptoms. I understand your concern about the cost. Unfortunately, I don't have precise pricing information readily available. However, I can have our billing department contact you with an estimate before proceeding. We're looking for any signs of stroke, bleeding, tumors, or other abnormalities that could be causing your headache. It doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, but we need to rule things out. Before we proceed with the CT scan, I’m going to refer you to Dr. Ramirez, a neurologist. He can review your symptoms, examine you more thoroughly, and discuss the risks and benefits of further testing. He's the specialist in these matters, and I believe it’s best to get his opinion. I will also prescribe you a medication to help manage your headache symptoms in the meantime—naproxen. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Naproxen… is that a strong pill? I don’t like strong pills. And a neurologist… another doctor? That’s a lot of doctors. What does Dr. Ramirez do, exactly? Will he give me more tests? And the dye… is it painful? I don’t want anything painful. It's just a headache, Doctor. Maybe I just need to rest? My wife, she always said rest was the best medicine.
DOCTOR: Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a common medication for pain relief. It's not a “strong” pill, and it often helps with headaches. Dr. Ramirez specializes in disorders of the nervous system—the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. He will conduct a more in-depth neurological examination and determine if further testing is necessary. The CT scan involves an injection of the contrast dye, which some people find slightly uncomfortable, a warm sensation. But it is usually well-tolerated. I understand your preference for rest, but given your symptoms and age, it’s important to investigate this further. A headache that’s worsening, accompanied by blurry vision and dizziness, requires a thorough evaluation. I'm referring you to Dr. Ramirez not because I believe you need extensive testing, but to ensure we don't miss anything serious. I’m going to give you a referral note with Dr. Ramirez’s contact information. His office will schedule an appointment for you. Please call them as soon as possible. I also want you to follow up with primary care for a routine checkup. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Routine checkup… another doctor? This is too much. Okay. I’ll… I’ll call Dr. Ramirez. But I don’t like all these tests. And I don’t want any painful injections. My wife… she would have known what to do. Is there anything else I should be worried about? Anything I can do right now to feel better? Besides rest? Maybe a warm compress?
DOCTOR: A warm compress is fine. As for anything else, I've already provided you with the necessary information and referrals. Given your age and symptoms, it’s important to be proactive and follow through with the recommended evaluations. I'm not going to speculate on potential causes or alarm you unnecessarily. Dr. Ramirez is the specialist, and he will be able to provide you with a more definitive assessment. If your headache worsens significantly, or you experience any new symptoms—such as fever, weakness, or difficulty speaking—seek immediate medical attention. I’ve done all I can at this point. I suggest you schedule an appointment with Dr. Ramirez as soon as possible. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll call Dr. Ramirez. My wife… she would have known what to do. .
