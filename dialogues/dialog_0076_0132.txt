DOCTOR: Right. So, Mr. Coby, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Heat, mostly. Can't stand it anymore. Always been a bit warm-blooded, you see, but this year… this year's different. It’s like being stuck in a furnace. And it’s not just feeling hot, it’s… well, it’s making me a bit sluggish, if you get my meaning. Not myself at all.
DOCTOR: Sluggish, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sluggish. Like… everything takes more effort. Even just getting up from a chair. And I sweat, Doctor, sweat. More than a working man should, even in this weather. It’s embarrassing, frankly. Used to be able to work all day under the sun, no problem. Now… not so much. You understand, don't you? This isn't normal.
DOCTOR: Right, right. So, this is a new thing?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely new. Like I said, always ran a bit warm. But this… this started proper around May, maybe June. Just got worse and worse as the weather heated up. Never had to worry about it before. I'm a painter, see? Construction work, maintenance. Been doing it for forty years! A bit of sun never bothered me. This is different, Doctor. Really different. And it’s not just uncomfortable, it’s… it’s worrying. Makes a man question things, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Forty years, you say?
PATIENT: Forty-two, actually. Started young, helping my father. Good, honest work. And I’ve always been careful. Hydrated, good food, sensible clothes. Not like these young lads, thinking they're invincible. It's just... my body isn’t what it used to be, I suppose. But forty-two years, Doctor. That’s a long time to be working in the sun. You’d think I’d be used to it by now.
DOCTOR: Well, bodies do change. Happens to us all. Do you have any… underlying conditions?
PATIENT: Underlying conditions? What do you mean? I've had the usual bumps and bruises from the job, a bit of arthritis in my knees, but nothing serious. Never been a sickly man. I eat well, don't smoke, a little bit of a beer now and then, but nothing to write home about. Medicare keeps me ticking along, regular check-ups, you know. They haven’t said anything about anything… underlying. This heat thing just came on suddenly. Seems a bit… presumptuous to assume there’s something wrong with me, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get defensive. Just covering all bases. Any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a bit of ibuprofen for the knees when they act up. Nothing regular. Over-the-counter stuff. Like I said, I’m a healthy man. Mostly. This heat… it’s just interfering with my work. I’ve got deadlines to meet, you know? People are counting on me. It’s not exactly easy to explain to a client that I can’t paint their house because I’m… overheating. Makes me look unreliable, doesn’t it? It’s a bit of a mess, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just… take a quick look at your vitals. Blood pressure, pulse… just to be sure. Sit up for me, if you would.
PATIENT: Vitals? I’ve had my vitals taken plenty of times, Doctor. Mostly perfectly normal. But fine. If you insist. Though I highly doubt it will tell you anything you don't already know. A man’s blood pressure goes up when he’s inconvenienced, perhaps. That’s what that reading will show, I expect. Get on with it, then. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90. Pulse is 88. Not terrible, but not ideal. Temperature is 99.2. A little elevated, perhaps from the… heat. Lungs clear. No obvious signs of anything… concerning. You're probably just dehydrated. Drink more water. And try to avoid the sun during the hottest part of the day.
PATIENT: Dehydrated? Doctor, with all due respect, I’ve been working in the sun for forty-two years. I know how to hydrate. I drink water constantly. It's not a new concept to me. This isn't simply about drinking more water. It’s different this year, and you’re not even listening to me. It's like a weight, Doctor. A constant sluggishness, an inability to cope with the heat. And you’re telling me it’s just… dehydration? I came here for a proper examination, not a lecture on basic hydration. This is… frankly, a waste of my time. Perhaps I should seek a second opinion. From someone who will actually listen.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Coby, I’ve seen patients all day. And frankly, this sounds like heat exhaustion. It’s common. You’re getting older, your body isn’t adapting as well. But a full work-up?
PATIENT: “A full work-up?” That's precisely what I was expecting. What exactly is a “full work-up” in your estimation, Doctor? A cursory listen to my lungs and a lecture on the aging process? You haven't asked me about my diet, my sleep, or anything beyond the most superficial questions. You’re dismissing my concerns without even attempting to understand them. And frankly, it’s insulting. I’m not an idiot. I know my body. Something is different this year, and I deserve a proper explanation, not a pat answer about heat exhaustion. If you're not willing to investigate further, perhaps you should tell me now. I'd rather not waste another moment of my valuable time.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Fine. We can order some blood work. Just to rule things out. Complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function… maybe a thyroid panel. But I’m telling you now, it’s likely nothing serious. But if you insist on a full investigation, I suppose we can indulge you. It will take a few days to get the results back. Here. Take this to the lab downstairs. And try to… relax. .
PATIENT: “Relax?” I’m a painter, Doctor. A construction worker. Relaxation is not a part of my daily routine. And I came here seeking a diagnosis, not a prescription for leisure. Very well. I'll take my blood work. But do not expect gratitude. And if it is something serious, Doctor, I trust you'll have the decency to acknowledge that you dismissed my concerns initially. .
