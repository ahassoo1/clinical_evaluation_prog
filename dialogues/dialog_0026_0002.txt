DOCTOR: Good morning, Zoie. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… It’s… going to the bathroom. It's hard now, you see? Not easy like it used to be. Takes a bit of… pushing. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Zoie. So, you're experiencing some difficulty with urination – it requires more effort than it used to. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not painful, exactly. Just… slow. And I have to… concentrate, you know? Really think about it. My husband, he says I take a long time in the bathroom now. He worries. I don’t remember it being this way before, but… maybe I just didn't notice. Old age, I suppose. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Zoie. And it's good that your husband is paying attention. It's very common for things to change as we get older. Now, when you're able to go, do you feel like you completely empty your bladder, or do you feel like some urine remains?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… sometimes I feel like I do, yes. But other times… maybe not quite? Like there’s a little bit left. It's hard to say for sure, you know? I just try to get it all out, but… it doesn't always feel like I do. I don’t know if that’s helpful. I’m sorry if I’m not very clear.
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly clear, Zoie. It's helpful to know you sometimes feel like you don't completely empty your bladder. And don't worry about being precise – we’ll sort it all out. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… pee? Oh dear. Let me think… it looks pretty normal, I think. You know, the usual color. Maybe a little darker sometimes? But I drink a lot of water, so… I’m not sure if that matters. I haven’t seen any blood, if that’s what you mean. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Zoie. Darker urine sometimes can be a sign of dehydration, but you mentioned you drink plenty of water, which is excellent. No blood is certainly reassuring. Now, have you been experiencing any other symptoms along with this difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think… Oh! My back. My lower back has been a bit achy lately. Just a dull ache, nothing terrible. And… I get up a couple of times at night to go to the bathroom. Maybe two or three times. Is that… is that a symptom? It's just part of getting old, isn’t it? My husband says I shouldn’t drink so much water before bed. He worries about me falling.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain and getting up a couple of times at night to urinate. It’s good that your husband is looking out for you. Getting up at night can be related to the difficulty with urination. Now, Zoie, do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a hard question. So many years… I think… I had my blood pressure checked a lot, years ago. They gave me pills for it, but I stopped taking them a long time ago. And… I had a little problem with my heart once, but the doctor said it was nothing serious. Just a flutter, he called it. And… arthritis, I suppose. My hands are always stiff. Does that help? I’m afraid my memory isn't very good. I forget things so easily.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Zoie. High blood pressure, a heart flutter in the past, and arthritis. Do you remember the names of any of the medications you used to take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I don't, I'm afraid. They were little white pills, I think. Or maybe pink? It was a long time ago. The doctor just told me to take them with my breakfast. I don't remember the name at all. I’m so sorry. I really wish I could remember more. My daughter used to keep track of all my medications, but… she moved away, you see. It’s hard to keep track of things on your own.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Zoie. It's perfectly understandable. Don't worry about it. We can look it up in your records, if they’re available. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I had my appendix out when I was young. A long, long time ago. And… I had a hysterectomy, I think. My husband says I did, but… I don't really remember. It was after my daughter was born, I think. Everything is so fuzzy now. I apologize. I’m not being very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Zoie. It's good to know about the appendix removal and the hysterectomy. That's very important information. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… I had a lot of brothers and sisters, but most of them are gone now. My husband, Tui, he’s still with me, thankfully. We’ve been married for… oh, goodness, almost seventy years! My daughter, Lani, she lives on the mainland now. She has two children, my grandchildren. I don’t see them very often, but they call sometimes. My brothers and sisters… they all had children too, but I don't see them much anymore. It’s just me and Tui now, mostly. He worries about me a lot. He’s a good man. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's lovely to hear, Zoie. It sounds like you have a wonderful husband. And it's good you have family, even if you don't see them often. Now, have any of your family members had any health problems, like heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a hard question. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. She was very sick when she was old. And my brother… he had diabetes. He had to take shots all the time. And… I think my aunt had problems with her kidneys. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t really remember the details. Everyone gets sick eventually, doesn’t it? I’m afraid my memory isn’t very good for details like that. I apologize. I’m trying my best.
DOCTOR: You are doing wonderfully, Zoie. Don’t worry about the details. Knowing about the heart problems, diabetes, and kidney problems in your family is helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think… I don’t think so. I’ve never really had any bad reactions to anything. I eat everything, mostly. Tui always tells me to eat my vegetables, but… I’m not very fond of broccoli. But I eat it anyway. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but… maybe I should ask Tui. He remembers things better than me. He always worries about me. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Zoie. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just the pills Tui gives me. He calls them… something for my water. They’re little blue pills. And sometimes I take a vitamin D pill, the doctor told me to, because I don’t get much sun. That’s all, I think. Just the blue pills and the vitamin D. Tui keeps them for me. He makes sure I take them every day. He’s a good man. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Zoie. So, blue pills for your water and vitamin D. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your overall health. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. That’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust you. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you know? And I bruise easily. But whatever you need, I’ll do. Just be gentle, if you would. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. I will be very gentle. We’ll take things slowly. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright dear. Here you go. Is that alright? I try to breathe deeply, but sometimes it feels… hard. Like my chest is tight. Is that what you wanted to hear? I hope I’m not making this difficult for you. I apologize. I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Zoie. You’re doing wonderfully. Your heart sounds a bit… faint, but there are no abnormal sounds. Your lungs are clear, but your breathing is a little shallow. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Can I have you rest your arm on the table, please?
PATIENT: Alright dear. Here you go. Be gentle, if you would. My arm gets sore easily, you know? And sometimes my blood pressure gets… high. The doctor used to give me pills for it, but I stopped taking them a long time ago. I hope it’s not too high. I don’t want to worry you. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie. Just relax. The reading is a little elevated – 150 over 85. It's not critically high, but it's something we should discuss. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Can you lie back for me?
PATIENT: Alright dear. Here I am. My back is a little achy, you know? I hope that’s alright. Just be gentle, if you would. I don’t want to get hurt. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie. Just relax. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some tenderness in your lower abdomen. Nothing too concerning, but we'll keep that in mind. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Can you bend your knees and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Alright dear. Here you go. My legs are a little stiff, you know? The arthritis, you see? Just be gentle, if you would. I don't want to fall. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. Now, I'm just going to check your feet. Can you point your toes up and down for me?
PATIENT: Alright dear. Here you go. My ankles are a little stiff, you know? The arthritis, you see? It's hard to move them sometimes. Is that alright? I hope I’m not making this difficult for you. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Zoie. You’re doing wonderfully. Your feet have a little swelling and a limited range of motion, which is consistent with arthritis. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with urination, possibly due to an enlarged prostate in your husband, or a weak bladder. You also have some nighttime frequency, lower abdominal tenderness, and elevated blood pressure. We’ll need to do some tests to confirm this. Would you be willing to give a urine sample and have some blood work done?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests? Blood work? I don’t like needles, you know. And I always have trouble giving a sample. It’s embarrassing. But… if you think it’s necessary… alright. I suppose I can try. But please, be gentle. And don’t be mad if I mess it up. Is that alright? I trust you, dear. But I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. We’ll take things slowly and be as gentle as possible. There's no need to be embarrassed, and I definitely won't be mad. I can explain the process and provide you with privacy. The urine sample will help us check for infection and other issues. The blood work will give us a better understanding of your kidney function and overall health. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood. She is very good and gentle. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright dear. If you think it’s best. But please, tell the nurse to be gentle. And… maybe if I sit down first? My legs are a little wobbly, you know. And… can I have a glass of water? I feel a little faint. Is that alright? I trust you and the nurse, dear. But I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. Absolutely. I will let the nurse know to be very gentle and that you're feeling a bit anxious. We’ll have you sit down and I’ll get you a glass of water right away. It’s perfectly okay to feel nervous. We'll take our time and make sure you're comfortable. Let me just call the nurse now. She’ll be in shortly.
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You’re very kind. I appreciate it. Tui always worries about me, you know. He’s a good man. I hope these tests don’t take too long. I just want to get home and rest. Is that alright? I trust you and the nurse, dear. But I really don’t like needles. Oh, and… could I have a blanket? I’m feeling a little cold.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. Absolutely. I will let the nurse know you’re feeling cold and to bring a blanket. And I’ll do my best to make sure the tests don’t take too long. We'll get you home to rest as soon as possible. You're very welcome. It’s my job to take care of you, and I'm happy to do so. Here comes the nurse now. She’s very nice. She’ll explain everything to you. Just relax and take deep breaths. I'll be right here if you need anything.
PATIENT: Oh alright dear. Thank you. I hope she’s gentle with the needle. I really don't like needles. Is that alright? I trust you and the nurse, dear. But please, let me know if anything hurts.
