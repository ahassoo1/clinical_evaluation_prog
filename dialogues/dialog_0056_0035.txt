DOCTOR: Hi Mirriam, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. Been going on for… goodness, feels like days now. Just keep coming and coming, you know? It’s a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for days. That is frustrating. And embarrassing, I can imagine. Let's try to figure out what’s going on. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, they don’t really seem to have a pattern. They just… start. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes when I’m just sitting, sometimes for no reason at all. And they aren’t painful, thankfully, just… startling! I tried drinking water upside down like I always used to, but that hasn’t done a thing this time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no real pattern, not painful, and the usual trick isn’t working. Good to know. Have you noticed anything before they start?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… Sometimes, if I get a little flustered, like if someone surprises me, they might start right after. Or… if I’ve been talking a lot, excitedly, you know? But not always! It’s so odd. And I had a bit of a scare last week – my grandson nearly backed the car into the rose bushes – could that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so sometimes linked to excitement or being startled, and possibly after a stressful event like the car incident. That's helpful. Let’s talk about your overall health a little. Do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was no trouble. And my knees get a bit creaky in the cold weather, typical for an old lady, I suppose! Other than that, I’m pretty healthy for my age. I used to work as a psychiatric aide, you know, so I always tried to keep myself in good shape, both physically and mentally. Blood pressure's usually alright, I think – I had it checked at the pharmacy last month, and the lady said it was fine.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're generally healthy! And that's a very admirable profession, keeping both yourself in shape is important. Do you take any medications currently, or have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my knees when they're really bothering me – naproxen, I think it's called. And… let me see… No allergies, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. I do get a bit sensitive to strong perfumes sometimes, but that’s more of an annoyance than an allergy, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen for your knees, no known allergies. Good. Now, just to get a better picture of things, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No, not really. No heartburn, no trouble swallowing, no nausea. Just the hiccups! Sometimes, maybe, a little bit of burping afterwards, but that’s probably just from trying to stop them, you know? I haven't lost my appetite, and everything tastes normal. It's really just… persistent hiccups.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms. That’s good. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to make sure everything sounds clear. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to being poked and prodded, after all those years working in the hospital!
DOCTOR: Okay, heart and lungs sound good. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I don’t feel anything unusual. Now, I know you've been having these hiccups for days. Given that they’re persistent and haven’t responded to home remedies, I’m going to order a blood test to check your electrolytes and rule out anything obvious. It’s just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it puts my mind at ease, absolutely. Blood test is no problem at all. I used to draw blood samples myself, back in the day, so I know what to expect!
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get the order sent to the lab, and they’ll be in touch to schedule the test. While we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend we try a medication called baclofen. It sometimes helps with persistent hiccups. It’s a muscle relaxant, and we’ll start with a low dose. It can cause some drowsiness, so be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Baclofen, you say? Hmm… a muscle relaxant. Alright, that sounds reasonable. I haven’t taken anything like that before, but if you think it might help, I’m willing to try it. I don’t drive anymore, thankfully – my knees wouldn’t allow it – so the drowsiness shouldn’t be a problem. And just to be sure, is there anything I should avoid eating or drinking while I’m on it?
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the driving. And good question about food and drink. No specific foods to avoid with baclofen, but it can sometimes interact with alcohol, so best to avoid that. Also, stay well-hydrated - drinking plenty of water is always a good idea. I'll write you a prescription, and the pharmacy will explain any potential side effects. We'll check back in with you after a week to see how it's working and review the blood test results. If the hiccups don't improve, or if they get worse, please give us a call right away. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease, truly. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen and figure out what might be going on. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. I’m glad I could help. And please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. We’re here to support you. Have a good day, and I hope the hiccups start to subside soon.
PATIENT: It's lovely to meet you too, Doctor. I will, thank you. And you have a good day as well. Goodbye!
