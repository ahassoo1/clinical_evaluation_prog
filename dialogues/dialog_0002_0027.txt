DOCTOR: Hi Josie, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time for this. It's my stomach. Keeps… coming back up on me. Food, you know? Like it's trying to escape. It's unpleasant. Very unpleasant. And frankly, I've got more important things to deal with than this nonsense.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some nausea and vomiting. And you feel like it's happening repeatedly?
PATIENT: Repeatedly? Is that what you call it? It happens when I eat something that doesn't agree with me, usually. Which is… more often than it should be, I suppose. I eat good food! Polish food! It shouldn’t be disagreeing with me. But it does. And then… well, you know. It comes back up. Is that what you need to know? Because honestly, I don't see what's so complicated.
DOCTOR: Right, so it seems to be triggered by eating, and specifically Polish food, which is a little unusual. Can you tell me a bit more about when this started happening?
PATIENT: When did it start? Honestly, I don't keep a log of my indigestion, Doctor. It's been... a while. Years, probably. Comes and goes. It's never been a serious problem, just… annoying. Lately it's been a bit worse, which is why I'm here, if you must know. My wife insisted. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been happening for years, with a recent increase in frequency. And your wife encouraged you to come in today. That’s good of her. When you say “worse,” can you describe what that means specifically?
PATIENT: More of it, Doctor. More often. And… it burns. A little. Not like a fire, you understand, but… uncomfortable. And it lingers. The taste. It’s awful. Really awful. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I have a town hall meeting later. Important stuff. I don't have time to dissect every mouthful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so more frequent vomiting, and now you're experiencing some burning with it, and a lingering unpleasant taste. That does give us a little more to work with. Do you have any pain anywhere else – in your chest, abdomen, or back, for example?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. A little pressure in my chest, maybe. But I wouldn't call it pain. It’s… discomfort. Like I ate too much, you know? Which I don't! I eat sensible portions. And no, not my back. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure you've seen cases like this before? It seems… rather simple. A bit of indigestion. Isn’t there a pill for that?
DOCTOR: It's good you mention the chest pressure. That's something we want to pay attention to. It could be related to the stomach issue, or something separate. Now, you're right, indigestion is common, but chest pressure warrants a bit more investigation. To get a better idea of what's going on, can you tell me what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Now you want a food diary? Look, I eat good, solid Polish food. Pierogi, kielbasa, golabki… you know, proper meals. Sometimes soup. And maybe a little cake, if my wife makes it. It's not like I'm living on junk food, Doctor. I'm a practical man, I eat what sustains me. It's healthy food! My mother made it this way for eighty years! Are you suggesting my mother’s cooking is… bad for me? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, not at all! I’m not questioning your mother’s cooking. It sounds delicious. It’s just helpful for me to understand what might be triggering this. Sometimes even healthy foods can cause problems for some people. Do you notice if it happens more with certain dishes than others?
PATIENT: Of course it happens more with certain dishes! The spicy kielbasa, usually. And the golabki, if my wife puts too much tomato sauce in them. It's obvious, isn’t it? Tomato sauce and spice! It’s common sense! Look, are we getting anywhere or should I just ask for a prescription and be done with this? I truly don't have all day. My town needs me. And frankly, I'm starting to feel a bit… queasy just talking about all this food.
DOCTOR: Okay, so spicy kielbasa and golabki with a lot of tomato sauce seem to be the biggest culprits. That's very helpful to know. And it sounds like talking about it is making you feel a bit unwell, so let's try to wrap this up. I’m going to document that you’ve been experiencing nausea and vomiting for years, recently worsening, triggered by spicy or tomato-rich foods. You also mention some chest pressure. Before I make any recommendations, I'd like to quickly listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen, just to be sure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But make it quick. Really quick. I've got people waiting. Honestly, all this poking and prodding… It feels unnecessary. I’m a grown man, I know my own body. But do whatever you have to do. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll be as quick as possible. Take a deep breath in... and out... good. And one more... Okay, lungs sound clear. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little. Right… there. Not pain, you understand, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. Honestly, Doctor, I told you. It’s my stomach. What did you expect? It’s not a mystery. It's just a sensitive stomach. Now can we please get to the part where I get something for it? I really need to be going. A constituent is having a problem with their… never mind. It’s complicated. But I need to be there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some mild tenderness to palpation in the upper abdomen. That's good to know. Given your symptoms – the nausea and vomiting, triggered by certain foods, the recent increase in frequency, and now some mild tenderness – it sounds like you might be experiencing gastritis, which is inflammation of the stomach lining. It can be caused by a lot of different things, including spicy or acidic foods. However, because you mentioned chest pressure, and to be on the safe side, I'd like to run a quick EKG just to rule out anything cardiac. It's a very simple test, just some sticky pads on your chest. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An EKG?! Are you serious? For a little bit of indigestion? Look, Doctor, I appreciate your… thoroughness, but this is getting ridiculous. I'm a perfectly healthy man. I've run a town for fifteen years! I don't need a heart test because I ate a spicy sausage. Honestly, this is a waste of my time – and your time, frankly. I'm telling you, it's just my stomach. Give me something for the heartburn and let me go. I have a town to run. This is… unacceptable. Just… give me the prescription. Please. Before I lose my patience. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Josie. I understand your frustration, and I respect your wishes. However, I do want to make sure we’re being as safe as possible. Given your insistence and the fact that you've been experiencing this for years, I’m willing to proceed without the EKG today. But I need you to understand that if your symptoms worsen – if you experience any chest pain, difficulty breathing, or if you start vomiting blood – you need to seek immediate medical attention. I’m going to prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor to help reduce the acid in your stomach. It should help with the heartburn and inflammation. I’ll also recommend avoiding spicy and acidic foods as much as possible. I also strongly advise you to follow up with a gastroenterologist for a more thorough evaluation. They can perform an endoscopy if needed to rule out any underlying issues. Do you have any questions about the medication or the follow-up recommendation?
