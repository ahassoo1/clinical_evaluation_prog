DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Andraca. Nice to meet you as well. Well, I been feeling… funny lately. I does be very, very thirsty all the time. No matter how much water I drink, it not seem to help. And I hungry too. Always hungry. Even after I eat a good plate of food, I still feel like I need something else. It just started a few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. That sounds concerning, feeling constantly thirsty and hungry despite drinking and eating. A few weeks ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Maybe… four weeks now? It hard to say exactly. Time does fly by, you know? It wasn’t sudden, like. It just… slowly get worse. First the thirst, then the hunger follow soon after. I just thought it was the heat, to be honest. Is very hot these days. But it not going away.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're paying attention to this, and that it wasn’t a sudden change. The heat can certainly contribute to thirst, but it’s good we're looking into it further since it’s persisted. Now, besides the thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I does feel tired more often. Not like sick tired, just… heavy. And I been going to the bathroom more too. Especially at night. I have to get up sometimes, which is not good for an old woman like me. Other than that… I can’t think of anything right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst, hunger, fatigue, and more frequent urination, especially at night. That's helpful information, Bianca. Do you feel like you're urinating a larger volume each time, or just more often?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. I think... more often, yes. Not so much a big, big rush each time, just… have to go more times in the day. And a little bit at night, like I say. It does bother my husband, because I wake him up. He not a light sleeper, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're aware of these details. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision, like blurry sight?
PATIENT: Blurry sight? No, Doctor. My vision is… well, it not perfect, you know. I does need glasses to read, but that's been the same for years. I haven’t notice anything different with my eyes. Everything look the same as always, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm… now that you mention it… I think I might have lost a little bit. My clothes feel a little bit looser, but I haven’t been weighing myself. I does not really pay attention to that. Maybe a few pounds? I don’t know. It not like I been trying to lose weight, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. So, increased thirst, increased hunger, fatigue, frequent urination, and possible unintentional weight loss. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I never been diagnosed with anything. I does try to stay healthy, you know? I eat my food, I does a little bit of gardening… nothing fancy. My husband, he does take me to the doctor for check-ups now and then, but they always tell me I’m alright. Just a little bit of aches and pains, like any old woman. I never been a sick person, really.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. Not one. I does not like the idea of cutting into a body, you know? I try to avoid hospitals as much as possible. Everything natural is best, in my opinion.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical conditions or surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a hard one. My mother… she had something with her sugar, I think. My husband say it was diabetes, but I wasn’t really paying attention back then. She get sick, and she had to take pills. But she live a long life, she did. My father… he had heart problems, I think. He passed away when I was young. Other than that… I don’t really know. My family not really one for talking about sickness, you know? We just… deal with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of diabetes in your mother and heart problems in your father. That's helpful. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any pills, not even for headaches. I does take a little bit of cod liver oil sometimes, for my joints, but that’s all. My husband buys it for me. He say it good for my bones, you know? But I don’t take it every day. Just when my knees are bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just cod liver oil occasionally. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I never been allergic to anything. I eat all kinds of food, I does try everything! My husband, he does worry about me trying new things, but I never had a problem. No rashes, no swelling, nothing. I am a lucky woman, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca, that's all very helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’d like to check your feet and do a quick neurological exam. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s alright. You do whatever you need to do. I trust you. I always listen to my doctors. My husband always say I’m too trusting, but I believe you have my best interest at heart. Go ahead, do what you have to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not terribly high. Your heart and lungs sound okay, but your breath sounds are a little quiet. I’m a little concerned about the decreased sensation in your feet. That can sometimes be a sign of nerve damage. Now, I would like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Specifically, I want to check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and electrolytes. I also want to do a urine test. Do you have any concerns about getting blood tests and a urine sample?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood tests… I not really fond of needles, Doctor. But if you say it important, I will do it. I just… I get a little bit nervous, you know? And the urine sample… is that a big one? I does drink a lot of water, so I probably have enough! But the needles… that's what I’s worried about.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Bianca. Many people don't like needles, and that's perfectly okay. It will be a quick pinch, and the phlebotomist is very good at their job. It’s just a small amount of blood. And the urine sample doesn’t need to be huge – just a few ounces, enough to fill a small cup. We just need a sample to check for sugar and protein. To be clear, based on your symptoms – the increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, possible weight loss, and the decreased sensation in your feet – I’m concerned about the possibility of diabetes. The blood tests and urine sample will help us confirm or rule that out. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear, that's my mother's sickness. Is that what you think it is? I does not feel sick, Doctor, not really. Just tired and thirsty. But… if you think it important to check, then I will do it. Tell me about the tests. What will they do, and how long will I have to wait for the results? And… is it bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca, let's take a deep breath. It's good you're asking these questions. It's important to understand what's going on. The first test is a fasting blood sugar. That means we'll ask you to not eat or drink anything for about 8-12 hours before the test. We'll take a blood sample in the morning, and it measures how much sugar is in your blood after you haven't eaten. Then, we'll do an A1C test. This also measures your blood sugar levels, but it looks at your average blood sugar over the past 2-3 months. It doesn't require fasting. We'll also check your kidney function and electrolytes, just to get a complete picture of your health. The urine test will check for sugar and protein, which can be signs of diabetes. The results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back. Now, to address your question about whether it's bad... diabetes can be serious if it's not managed properly. It can lead to problems with your heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves. But it's a very manageable condition. With proper diet, exercise, and sometimes medication, most people can live long and healthy lives with diabetes. The important thing is to get a diagnosis so we can start treatment if needed. We’ll discuss all of the options if the tests come back positive. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot to take in, Doctor. So, I have to not eat for a whole night? That’s hard for me, I does get hungry easily. And then they take blood and… look at my pee? It sounds… unpleasant. But… if it help, I will do it. I just want to know what’s going on with my body. So, what do I do now? Do I make an appointment? And… can I eat something before I fast? Maybe a small plate of food?
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a lot, Bianca. And it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take it one step at a time. Yes, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood test. You can eat a normal dinner tonight, but after that, no more food or drinks – except for water. Staying hydrated is important. We can schedule the blood test for tomorrow morning. The lab is just down the hall. It’ll only take a few minutes. And yes, the urine sample can be done at the lab as well. I’ll write you a lab order, and I’ll give you a sheet with instructions about the fasting. Do you have any questions about the instructions?
PATIENT: Hmm… “no food or drinks except water”… okay, I can do that. “allow 8-12 hours of fasting”… that means I have to finish my dinner early. And “bring a list of current medications”… I don’t have any, except for the cod liver oil. And what if… what if it is diabetes, Doctor? Will I have to take pills? Will I have to change my whole life? I like my food, you know. And I don’t want to be sick.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Bianca. It's good you're thinking about these things. If the tests do come back positive for diabetes, it doesn't necessarily mean you’ll have to take pills right away. Often, we start with lifestyle changes – a healthy diet, regular exercise, and monitoring your blood sugar levels. Many people can manage their diabetes very effectively with those changes alone. If lifestyle changes aren’t enough, then we might consider medication. There are many different types of medications available, and we can find one that works best for you. And no, you don't have to change your whole life. It's about making smart choices and finding a balance. We can work with a registered dietitian to help you create a meal plan that you enjoy and that helps you manage your blood sugar. The goal is to help you live a long and healthy life, and we'll do everything we can to support you. For now, let's focus on getting the blood tests done. Once we have the results, we can talk about the next steps. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all for now. You explained everything very well. I will try not to eat after dinner tonight. And I will go to the lab tomorrow morning. Thank you, Doctor Andraca. You’ve been very kind. I think… I think I will go home now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bianca. I'm glad I could help. Remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your lab appointment. Get some rest tonight, and try not to worry too much. We'll take it one step at a time. Have a good evening, Bianca. I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
