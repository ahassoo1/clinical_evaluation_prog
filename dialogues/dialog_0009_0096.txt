DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this sensitivity to the sun, really. It’s been… strange, lately. I feel like I'm burning even with just a little bit of sun on my skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitivity to the sun… that is strange. And it’s a recent change, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. It started maybe… three months ago? It wasn’t sudden, exactly. More like it gradually got worse. At first, I just noticed I was getting sunburned easier than usual. Now… well, now it feels like any sun at all is too much. Even through the window sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, gradually worsening over the last three months. And it's not just sunburn, but a general sensitivity even with minimal exposure… even through a window. That’s helpful to know. Can you describe what it feels like when your skin is exposed?
PATIENT: It’s not really a pain, at first. More like… warmth, but not a good warmth. Kind of prickly, you know? And then it gets red, obviously. But even before it gets red, it feels… tight. Like my skin is stretching. And sometimes, it feels a bit itchy, but not always. It's hard to explain, really. It's just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds quite bothersome – a warmth, prickling sensation, tightness, and occasional itching, even before visible redness appears. Thank you for explaining that so clearly. Now, have you noticed this sensitivity affecting any particular areas of your body more than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think… yeah, it's worse on my face and the backs of my hands. My arms get it too, but not as bad. And my neck, definitely my neck. It feels… more raw there, somehow, when it happens. I usually try to cover those areas, but it still gets to them.
DOCTOR: Okay, so predominantly face, backs of hands, and neck, with a more intense sensation in those areas. And you're taking precautions to cover up, which is good. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this sensitivity?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. No rash, no blisters, no fever or anything like that. Just the sensitivity. Sometimes my eyes feel a bit… gritty, like there’s something in them, but that doesn’t happen all the time. And I have been a bit more tired lately, now that I think about it, but I figured that was just… life, you know? It's been a bit stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, no rash, blisters, or fever. Occasional gritty eyes and increased fatigue – we'll definitely keep those in mind. Stress can certainly contribute to fatigue. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Not really. Nothing major. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox and stuff. And I had my appendix taken out when I was a teenager. But other than that, I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. Oh… and my wife… she passed away a couple of years ago. It was sudden. But that’s not a medical thing, really. Just… part of my history.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been incredibly difficult. And thank you for sharing that with me – it is an important part of your history. Okay, so childhood illnesses and an appendectomy in your teenage years. No other significant medical conditions. Have you ever had any skin conditions diagnosed, like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: No, never. My skin has always been pretty normal, honestly. A little dry in the winter, but nothing I couldn't handle with lotion. Never any rashes or anything like that. My wife… she had some skin issues when she was younger, but I didn't.
DOCTOR: Alright, no personal history of skin conditions. That's good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had… I think it was diabetes, type 2. My wife’s side… her mother had arthritis, I believe. Nothing too major that I can think of, really. We weren't a big family for talking about medical things, if that makes sense. Just… didn't really discuss it much.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's fairly common. High blood pressure in your mother, type 2 diabetes in your father, and arthritis in your wife’s mother. We’ll make a note of those. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. And occasionally, if I get a headache, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s very rare. I try to avoid taking anything if I can, honestly. I prefer to just… deal with it, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin occasionally and ibuprofen for headaches. And no known allergies to any medications or anything else, correct?
PATIENT: That’s right. No allergies that I know of. Never had any reactions to anything. I've always been pretty lucky, in that regard. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit silly being here, complaining about the sun when some people have real problems. But it’s just… it's worrying me, you know? And it’s getting worse.
DOCTOR: You're not silly at all for being here, Arbin. Your concerns are valid, and it's good you're addressing this, especially since it's worsening. It’s my job to investigate any health concerns, no matter how small they may seem. Now, let’s do a quick physical examination, if you don’t mind. I'll just take a look at your skin, particularly on your face, neck, and hands, and check your lymph nodes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and to check things out. I was worried you’d think I was overreacting. Please, go ahead. I’ll just sit here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm examining your skin now. On your face, I notice some mild redness, particularly around your cheeks and forehead. There's no rash or visible blistering. Skin texture feels normal. Your neck – your lymph nodes are slightly palpable, but not significantly swollen or tender. And on the backs of your hands, there's a diffuse redness, and the skin feels a little tighter than usual. There's no evidence of blisters or other skin lesions. Overall, the skin appears generally healthy, but there is clear evidence of sensitivity and inflammation in the areas you described. I don't feel any concerning masses or abnormalities. Alright, that’s all done. The examination confirms what you’ve described – redness and sensitivity in those areas. Now, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, there are a few possibilities. It could be something as simple as photosensitivity from a medication, even though you’re not taking anything regularly. It could also be a form of dermatitis or eczema, although your presentation isn't classic for those conditions. Less commonly, it could be a sign of an underlying autoimmune condition. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, blood tests sound good. Whatever you think is best, honestly. I just want to figure out what's going on and get it sorted out, if possible. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s… reassuring to have a plan. What kind of blood tests are we talking about? I don't mind, but I always get a little nervous around needles. It's silly, I know.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all to be nervous around needles, Arbin. Many people feel the same way. We'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. The blood tests I’m ordering will include a complete blood count to check your overall health, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your organ function, and an antinuclear antibody test to screen for autoimmune conditions. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels, as a deficiency can sometimes contribute to skin sensitivity. It’s a fairly standard panel, and it will give us a good baseline to work with. We'll also do a test for photosensitivity, if that’s okay. It will involve exposing small patches of skin to UV light and checking for a reaction. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A lot of tests, but if it helps figure things out, I’m happy to do them. The photosensitivity test… that sounds a bit scary, but I understand it’s necessary. Just… let me know when it’s happening, okay? I just want to be prepared. And… is there anything I should do in the meantime? Avoid the sun completely? Wear extra sunscreen? Anything like that?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We will definitely let you know before the photosensitivity test. And yes, in the meantime, it's best to minimize sun exposure as much as possible. Wear protective clothing – long sleeves, hats, sunglasses – whenever you’re outside. And use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, even on cloudy days. Apply it generously and reapply every two hours, or more often if you’re swimming or sweating. I’m also going to prescribe a mild topical corticosteroid cream to help reduce the inflammation and itching. It’s not a long-term solution, but it should provide some temporary relief while we wait for the test results. Do you have any questions about the cream, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Topical corticosteroid… okay. I’ll try to avoid getting it on my face as much as possible, I guess? Just use it on the really itchy spots? And minimize sun exposure… I can definitely do that. It's not exactly beach weather anyway. What about… how long will it take to get the results back? I know you’re busy, and I don’t want to rush you, but I’m just… anxious, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. You’re right to be anxious, and I want to reassure you we’ll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. The lab typically takes about 5-7 business days to process the blood tests. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. And yes, you’re right to be cautious with the topical corticosteroid. Use it sparingly, only on the areas that are most inflamed and itchy, and avoid prolonged use on your face. A thin layer is all you need. I’m also going to give you a written summary of everything we’ve discussed today, including instructions on how to use the cream and a list of potential side effects. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I feel a bit better now, just knowing we have a plan. Thank you, Dr. Petrimoulx.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns, don't hesitate to contact the clinic. We’re here for you. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and provide you with the written summary and prescription. Take care, and I’ll see you in about a week to discuss the results.
