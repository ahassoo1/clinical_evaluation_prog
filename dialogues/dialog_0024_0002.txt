DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks. They’re not working so good, you see? It’s hard to… push it out. Like it’s stuck. It’s been happening for a little while now, I think. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though.
DOCTOR: "Not working so good," you say. Right. And when you attempt to urinate, is there… discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort… hmm. Not pain, exactly. More like… a strain. I have to push, like I said. And it takes a long time. Sometimes it just… dribbles. It's embarrassing, really. My husband helps me remember to go, sometimes. He worries. But I forget if I've already gone, you know? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I understand. A strain, prolonged emptying, and… occasional dribbling. And some difficulty with recall. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, Ms. Stoffregen, have you noticed any change in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Color… oh dear. I don’t really look, you know? I just… go. My husband might notice, he’s always watching things. I haven’t asked him. It usually looks… yellow, I guess? Is it supposed to be a different color? I really don’t pay attention to these things anymore. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It can be indicative, Ms. Stoffregen. Very well. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain recently?
PATIENT: Fever… hmm. I don’t feel hot, if that’s what you mean. And no chills. My bones ache sometimes, but that’s just the weather, I think. And my tummy… no, no pain there. Just… uncomfortable when I’m trying to go. It's mostly down there, not in my tummy. Does that make any sense? I get confused trying to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I gather. Now, Ms. Stoffregen, and please try to be precise, have you had any recent changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… well, it’s not what it used to be. My daughter brings me soup, mostly. I eat a little, don't eat a lot. And weight… goodness, I haven’t weighed myself in ages. My husband used to, but he… he's not as strong as he used to be. I think I'm a little thinner, maybe? But I can't really say for sure. Everything just feels… blurry these days. It’s hard to keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll start with abdominal palpation and then a quick neurological assessment. Please inform me immediately if you experience any discomfort during the examination.
PATIENT: Oh… lie down? I don't like doctors poking around. But… alright. If you need me to, I can just tell you if it hurts. It's just… I'm not very flexible anymore. And I don’t like being told what to do. But I trust you, Doctor. I think. Just… be gentle, okay? It gets sore easily.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. Gentle is my standard practice. Now, if you’ll just lie flat on your back, please. I’ll begin with the abdominal exam. Now, does this cause any tenderness?
PATIENT: Ooh… a little bit there, on the left side. Not pain, exactly, more like… a dull ache. Like someone's squeezing. And… a little bit lower down, in the middle. It’s not awful, but… it’s there. Are you pushing hard? It feels… intrusive, Doctor. No offense.
DOCTOR: "Intrusive," noted. Right. Mild tenderness in the left flank and suprapubic region. Now, I’m just gently tapping on your abdomen. Any discomfort with this?
PATIENT: Oh! That's a bit… startling. It feels hollow, somehow. Like a drum? And… yes, a little bit uncomfortable here, on the right side. It feels… tight. Like a stretched balloon. I don't usually like being tapped, Doctor. It reminds me of when my grandson hits his drums. Very loud.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m simply listening to your abdomen with this instrument. Bowel sounds are present, albeit somewhat diminished. Now, I’d like to perform a quick neurological examination. Please follow my finger with your eyes… and do not move your head.
PATIENT: Oh dear… it's a little blurry. Is that supposed to be… fast? It's hard to keep up. And my neck feels stiff. I think I pulled something gardening last week, maybe? It’s hard to tell. Everything gets mixed up. Am I doing it right, Doctor? I'm worried I'm failing the test.
DOCTOR: Diminished visual tracking, mild neck stiffness noted. Right. Ms. Stoffregen, based on the limited examination and your reported symptoms, it appears you are experiencing urinary retention and potential neurogenic bladder. However, further investigation is necessary to confirm this diagnosis. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. I also want to order a post-void residual volume test to assess how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and attempting to urinate every two to three hours, even if you don't feel the urge. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… so many words. Blood tests? Urinalysis? Post-void… what-now? It sounds very serious. And I'm supposed to… pee more often? Even when I don't need to? It sounds… uncomfortable. I think I understand, but… I don't think I really do. Will it hurt, Doctor? And what if I can’t…? I just get confused, you see. My memory isn't what it used to be. Perhaps my daughter could come with me next time? She’s good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Yes, your daughter’s presence would be… advisable. Here is a prescription for a mild anticholinergic medication. It may help with bladder control, but it can cause drowsiness. Take it as directed. As for the tests, they are standard procedure to rule out any infection or other underlying issues. The post-void residual test is simply measuring the amount of urine left in your bladder after you attempt to urinate. It’s non-invasive. If you experience any fever, chills, or severe abdominal pain, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we’ll discuss the results next week. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… yes, I think so. And take the… pill? Alright. My daughter will help me remember. She's very good. And… next week, you said? Is everything going to be alright, Doctor? I'm a bit frightened. I don't want to end up in the hospital. I just want to be able to… go to the bathroom normally again. Is that too much to ask? .
