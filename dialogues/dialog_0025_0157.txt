DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudeney. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the nurse said. Honestly, I don't even feel that bad. Seems like a lot of fuss over nothing. Just need a note for work, I guess.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, the nurse is just doing her job, checking things. But you’re right, feeling unwell is the most important part. High blood pressure can be serious, even if you don’t feel symptoms, which is why we take it seriously. But let's get a better understanding. When did you first find out your blood pressure was elevated?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember the exact date. It was at a work thing. They make us do these health screenings now. All very... unnecessary, if you ask me. I just know they told me it was high and now I have to come here. It was... maybe six months ago? Something like that. I really don't keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Six months ago… okay. And since that screening, has anyone mentioned it again?
PATIENT: No. Not until the nurse at work started making a big deal about it last week. She kept going on and on about seeing a doctor. She's very… enthusiastic. It’s irritating, frankly. I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no other healthcare visits or concerns about your blood pressure in the last six months?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I feel fine. I eat… normal. I don't smoke. I try not to stress, but, well, sometimes work makes that difficult. Is that all you need to know? Can we just get the note?
DOCTOR: "Normal" can mean a lot of different things, Ms. Dudeney. And stress definitely impacts blood pressure. But, okay. Let’s start with a quick run-through of your medical history. Any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nothing major. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. That’s about it. And I’ve had the usual… you know, colds, flu, nothing serious. My husband handles most of the doctor stuff, honestly. He’s good with all that. I just… show up when I have to. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? What do you want to know? My mom… she had some heart trouble when she was older, but she lived a long life. Dad was fine, mostly. He liked his sweets, though. Does that matter? Really, I don’t see what any of this has to do with my blood pressure. It just feels like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: It matters because heart disease and high blood pressure can run in families. It gives us a better picture. Okay, Mom had heart trouble… do you know what kind?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly? No. Something with… her heart being weak? She was in and out of the hospital a few times when she was really old. She didn't talk much about it. My husband probably knows more. He was closer to her. Look, can we just skip this? I have things to do. It's not like I'm sick sick. Just high blood pressure. It's not ideal, but it's manageable, right?
DOCTOR: "Manageable" depends on why it's high, Ms. Dudeney. And we can't just skip things. Let's try this: any medications you currently take, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin sometimes. And ibuprofen when my back hurts from work. That's it. I try to avoid taking pills if I can help it. They always have side effects. Honestly, I think I'm perfectly healthy. This whole thing is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies to medications that you know of?
PATIENT: No. None. I've never had a reaction to anything. Look, I’m telling you, this is a waste of time. Is there a way to just… confirm it’s not a big deal and get the note? I really need to get back to work. My boss is already annoyed I’m gone.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, I understand you're frustrated. But I need to do a proper assessment. I'm going to need to check your blood pressure again, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your pulse. We also need to check your height and weight. It's standard procedure. And please, I need you to try and answer my questions honestly and completely so I can help you. Do you consent to a physical exam?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have better things to do. But I'm telling you now, it's all going to be perfectly normal. Waste of time, but fine. Do what you have to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, your blood pressure is 158/92. That is elevated. Now, let’s listen to your heart... Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear… … and pulse is 78 and regular. Your height is 5'10", and your weight is 160 pounds. BMI is 22.9, which is within the normal range.
PATIENT: See? Perfectly normal. I told you. So, can we get the note now? Seriously, what’s the hold up? I don’t understand why I’ve been kept here so long for something that’s clearly… fine.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, while your heart and lungs sound normal and your weight is appropriate, your blood pressure is consistently elevated. That is concerning. “Normal” isn’t just about how you feel, it’s about the numbers. I'm going to order some basic blood work: a complete metabolic panel and a lipid panel. These tests will help us rule out any underlying causes for your high blood pressure. It also gives me a better baseline. It could be stress, diet, family history – many things. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend some lifestyle changes…
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? Like what? I already told you, I eat fine and I don't stress! Seriously, this is getting ridiculous. I just want a note saying I'm okay. I'm not going to change my whole life because of a number. I’ve got work to do. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, I understand your frustration, but I'm obligated to ensure your health. I cannot provide a note stating you are "okay" when your blood pressure is elevated without further investigation. This is not about changing your whole life today, it’s about ruling out serious problems. I’m happy to give you a note explaining that you've been evaluated, your blood pressure is currently elevated, and you’re scheduled for further testing. However, I cannot clear you for unrestricted activity until we have those results. Do you understand?
