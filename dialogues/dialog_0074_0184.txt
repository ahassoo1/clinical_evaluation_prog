DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning to you too. Look, I don't have all day, you know. It's about…well, it's about this. It ain't what it used to be, and frankly, it's botherin' me. Used to be solid as a rock, now…it's just… soft.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've noticed a change in your abdomen, and it's causing you some discomfort. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Discomfort? That's a polite way to put it. It's… unsightly. And it makes my clothes fit funny. I been a pile driver operator for fifty years, you know? Fifty years! Always strong, always lean. Now look at me. It’s… a shame, that’s what it is. Don't need a lecture on healthy eatin' neither, I eat just fine.
DOCTOR: I certainly won’t lecture you, Mr. Trendler. Fifty years as a pile driver operator is incredibly demanding work, and it's understandable that changes might occur over time. It's good you're bringing this to my attention. When did you first start noticing this change in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Oh, maybe… six months ago? Around Christmas, I reckon. I went to buy a new shirt, nice one for church, and it just…didn't fit right. Too tight 'round the middle. I thought maybe I put on a little weight, but it ain't just weight, is it? It's… different. Not like muscle, not like fat, just… there. And gettin' bigger.
DOCTOR: So, approximately six months ago, around Christmas, you noticed your clothing fit differently, specifically around your abdomen. It doesn’t feel like weight gain, but a change in the area itself. Has there been any pain associated with this change, or any other symptoms like bloating, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. More… a fullness. Like somethin's… stretched out. And no nausea, I don't get sick easy. Bowel habits? Normal as they ever were. Look, I ain't a doctor, you know. I just know somethin' ain't right. I don't need a list of fancy medical terms, just tell me what's causin' it and how to fix it. Is it somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler, and I appreciate you being straightforward with me. I will certainly avoid using unnecessary medical jargon. The fullness you’re describing is helpful information. It's good that your bowel habits are normal. Given the change you’ve noticed over the past six months, and the sensation of fullness, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One common cause of abdominal changes in men your age is an abdominal aortic aneurysm, or AAA. Another possibility could be a hernia, or even a general accumulation of fat, though you've stated it doesn’t feel like that. To help determine the cause, I’d like to perform a physical exam, listening to your abdomen and gently feeling the area you're concerned about. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Aneurysm? Hernia? What kinda talk is that? Sounds serious. Look, I ain't keen on bein' poked and prodded, but if you say it's necessary… alright. But be gentle, you hear? I've had a hard life, my body ain't what it used to be. And don't expect me to understand all them fancy words if you start tellin' me what's wrong. Just tell me plain and simple. What's causin' it, and what can be done about it. That's all I want to know. Get on with it then, I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I will be as gentle as possible, and I promise to explain everything in plain language. We’ll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope to check the blood flow, and then I’ll gently feel the area to check for any masses or tenderness. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know immediately if anything does cause you pain. I'm listening carefully now. Your abdominal sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to gently press on different areas. Please tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Okay, Mr. Trendler, do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, there! That’s… a little uncomfortable. Not pain, exactly, but… definite pressure. Like somethin's… bulgin' out, maybe? It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain, more like… a heavy feeling. Not all the time, just when you press on it. And it feels… different than muscle. Softer, kinda squishy. Be careful now, you're makin' it worse. And don't stare at me like that, it's embarrassin'.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler, and I apologize if the exam caused any discomfort. The fact that it feels softer and squishier, and that it's more noticeable with pressure, is helpful information. Based on what you've described and the physical exam, it is possible you have an inguinal hernia. It sounds like whatever is causing the bulge isn't causing acute pain, but it is causing you concern. To confirm this, and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order an abdominal ultrasound. It's a non-invasive imaging test that will give us a clear picture of what's going on beneath the surface. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Ultrasound, eh? More pokin' and proddin'? Look, I ain't fond of hospitals and tests and all that nonsense, but… if you say it's the only way to know for sure… alright. But no surprises, you hear? Tell me beforehand what it involves, and how long it's gonna take. I got things to do, you know. And what happens after the test? What if it is one of them… hernias? Do I need surgery? Tell me plain and simple, Dr. Reisig. No fancy medical jargon. I want to know what I'm dealin' with.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Trendler. I will explain everything in plain language, and there will be no surprises. An ultrasound is a completely painless procedure. You'll lie on an exam table, and a technician will apply a gel to your abdomen. Then, they'll use a handheld device – a transducer – to send sound waves into your body. These waves create images of your organs and tissues on a computer screen. It typically takes about 20-30 minutes. If the ultrasound confirms a hernia, it doesn't automatically mean you need surgery. Many small hernias don't require immediate intervention, and we can monitor them over time. However, larger hernias, or those causing significant discomfort, often benefit from surgical repair. We can discuss all your options in detail once we have the results, including the risks and benefits of each approach. I’ll also want to order some blood work to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. Would you be agreeable to both the blood work and the ultrasound?
PATIENT: Blood work and an ultrasound… It's a lot, isn't it? But… alright. Do what you gotta do, I suppose. Just get it over with quickly, and tell me the results as soon as you can. I don't like havin' things hangin' over my head. And no fancy hospital rooms, alright? I want it done here, if possible. I don't do well in big places. And make sure that technician is gentle! I don't want to be poked and prodded by someone who doesn't know what they're doin'. Can we at least schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow? I got a church service to get to this evening. And make sure it's first thing in the mornin'. I don't wanna be spendin' all day in a hospital. Alright, let's get this over with. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I understand your concerns, and I will make sure everything is arranged to your comfort. We can schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning, first thing. It will be done here in the clinic, with a technician who is experienced and gentle. You’ll need to arrive about 15 minutes early to complete some paperwork. For the ultrasound, you don't need to do anything special. You can eat and drink normally. However, it’s best to avoid wearing any lotions or oils on your abdomen. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood for the blood work before you leave today. It will just be a standard panel to check your basic health markers. I’ll get the orders for both tests processed now and have the nurse come in to explain everything to you in more detail, and schedule your appointments. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that's all for now. Just get those tests done quickly, and tell me the results as soon as possible. I don't like waitin' around, you know. And make sure that nurse explains everything clearly. I don't want any surprises. Alright then, I suppose I’ll be seein’ you tomorrow. Hopefully, it won’t be too painful a process. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. I'll make sure everything is taken care of. The nurse will be with you shortly. Thank you for coming in today. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. .
