DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is good to meet you. Well, I have been… having some trouble breathing. A whistling sound, when I try to take a deep breath. It makes me a little worried, you see.
DOCTOR: Trouble breathing, yes. A whistling sound, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a whistling. Like… a small bird, maybe? But inside my chest. It is worse when I walk quickly, or when I am trying to do my exercises. I try to keep active, you know, but this makes it hard.
DOCTOR: And how long has this been going on, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started maybe two weeks ago? At first, it was just after I did a lot of gardening. But now, it happens even when I am just walking around the house. It is getting a little bit worse each day, I think. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Do you have any other symptoms along with the whistling sound?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I have been a little bit tired, maybe? But I am an older woman, so that is not so unusual. And… sometimes my chest feels tight, but only when I am trying to breathe deeply. No cough, no fever, nothing like that. Just the whistling and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Oh, no, not really. My feet sometimes feel a little bit warm, but I thought that was just from walking. I don’t think they are swollen. I would notice swelling, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you likely would. Now, do you have any history of heart problems, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. My heart is strong, I think. I have always been very active. And my lungs… well, I used to be a very good hiker, you know. I have never had any trouble with my lungs before. My doctor back home, he always said I was very healthy. Though that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any allergies to medications, or any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I am not allergic to anything that I know of. And I do not take any regular medications. Just a little bit of pain relief sometimes, for my joints, but that is all. The usual things for an old woman, you know. Nothing serious. I think that's everything.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to listen to your lungs now, Mrs. Kilton. Please sit up straight and take a deep breath when I tell you to.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds good. Just tell me when to breathe. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath... and exhale. Again... and exhale. I am hearing some wheezing in your lungs, Mrs. Kilton. It's subtle, but it's there. I also notice your breathing rate is slightly elevated. Now, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Wheezing, you say? Is it bad? I thought it was just my age. Oxygen… is that important, Doctor? Is this something I should worry about? I do get a little bit anxious sometimes.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Mrs. Kilton, but it does indicate some narrowing of your airways. And yes, oxygen is quite important. Your saturation is currently at 92%, which is a little on the low side. It’s not an emergency, but it requires further investigation. I think we need to get a chest X-ray to rule out anything serious. And I’m going to order a pulmonary function test to assess how well your lungs are working.
PATIENT: An X-ray? Oh my. Is something wrong, Doctor? What could it be? My chest feels a little tight sometimes, but I didn’t think it was anything serious. I do get a little short of breath when I climb the stairs, but that is just because I am old, isn't it? A pulmonary… what was it? That sounds very complicated. I hope it’s not too bad.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, please try to remain calm. An X-ray is just a precaution to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. A pulmonary function test is a simple breathing test that will help us assess how well your lungs are functioning. It’s not complicated at all; you just blow into a tube. It could be a number of things – perhaps asthma, or bronchitis, or even just some age-related changes in your lungs. But we need to rule out anything more serious, such as pneumonia or COPD. I will write you a referral for both tests, and I want you to schedule them as soon as possible. I'll also prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways in the meantime. It’s unlikely to be anything dire, but it’s best to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh, a lot of tests. That sounds… frightening. Broncho… what was that? Will the inhaler make me feel strange? I don't like taking lots of medicine, Doctor. I prefer to just… take things easy. But I understand, you want to be careful. Pneumonia… that sounds very bad indeed. Could you explain a little bit about how to use this inhaler? I don't want to do it wrong.
DOCTOR: A bronchodilator inhaler simply helps to open up the airways in your lungs, making it easier to breathe. It's very common, Mrs. Kilton. And it’s not like taking a lot of medicine; it’s a very small dose of medication delivered directly to your lungs. You'll shake the inhaler well, then take a deep breath and exhale completely. Then, you put the inhaler in your mouth, press down on the canister while simultaneously inhaling slowly and deeply. Hold your breath for ten seconds, then exhale slowly. It may feel a little strange at first, but it’s quite straightforward. I have a nurse who will go over it with you in detail before you leave. Here’s a leaflet with detailed instructions. And the nurse will be happy to answer any questions you have. The main thing is to follow the instructions carefully. As for the pneumonia, it’s unlikely to be that, but we need to rule it out. Try not to worry unduly, Mrs. Kilton. We’re just being cautious. Now, do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, that looks complicated. Shake it… exhale… press down… at the same time? My hands are not very steady anymore, you see. What if I can't hold my breath for ten seconds? Will it still work? And the nurse… yes, I will ask her. Is there anything I should be avoiding while I wait for the tests? Like, should I not climb the stairs? Or should I stay inside? I do enjoy my garden, you see.
DOCTOR: It's not that complicated, Mrs. Kilton. Just try to take a deep breath and follow the instructions. If you can't hold your breath for ten seconds, hold it for as long as you comfortably can – five seconds is fine. It's better than nothing. As for your activities, avoid any strenuous exercise that makes you feel breathless. Climbing the stairs is fine if it doesn't exacerbate your symptoms. And you can continue to enjoy your garden, but don't overexert yourself. Listen to your body, Mrs. Kilton. If you feel tired or short of breath, stop and rest. Now, I have other patients waiting, so I'm afraid we need to wrap this up. I've written you a referral for the chest X-ray and pulmonary function test, and I've prescribed you the bronchodilator inhaler. The nurse will go over everything with you before you leave. Do you have any urgent questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Listen to my body, you say. Yes, I can do that. It's just… I get a little worried easily. I don't want anything to be seriously wrong. Will the tests be very expensive? My insurance is… alright, but I don’t want any big surprises. And… is this something contagious? Should I avoid my grandchildren? They come to visit on Sundays.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, I understand your concerns, but I really must attend to other patients. Regarding the cost of the tests, I cannot provide an exact figure – you will need to check with your insurance provider. However, these are routine tests, and your insurance should cover a significant portion of the cost. As for contagiousness, it's highly unlikely that whatever is causing your symptoms is contagious. But to be on the safe side, it’s always best to practice good hygiene – wash your hands frequently, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and avoid close contact with others if you are feeling unwell. You do not need to avoid your grandchildren. I have given you all the information I can at this time. The nurse will be with you shortly to review everything and answer any remaining questions you may have. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it is nothing serious. I will ask the nurse all my questions. And I will try not to worry too much. Good day to you.
