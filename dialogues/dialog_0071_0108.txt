DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I'm Dr. Galena. Thanks for coming in today. Now, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, it's...well, it's blood. Coming up, you know? Not a good sight, let me tell you. Happened a couple times now. Thought I'd better get it checked before it gets...messy.
DOCTOR: Blood, alright. Coming up… as in, you're vomiting blood?
PATIENT: Vomiting? No, no, not vomiting. Though, honestly, I wouldn't put anything past this body at this point. It’s... coming up from down there. You know. When I, uh, go to the bathroom. Dark stuff. Not bright red, thankfully, but still. Dark. Like coffee grounds, almost. And it's been happening off and on for a week or so now. Is that what you wanted to know? Seems like you’re fishing for specifics.
DOCTOR: Yes, specifics are good, Mr. Gentz. Coffee grounds, you say… okay. And it's been a week, off and on. Has it been with every bowel movement, or just some?
PATIENT: No, not every time. Thank goodness. Usually it's...after a particularly rough one, if you catch my drift. Not the easiest thing to discuss, Doc, but I figure you've heard it all before. And, honestly, I haven’t been feeling the best overall. Just kinda tired, weak, you know? Not myself. But I figured that could be a lot of things, honestly. Old age creeping up, maybe. Though, 51 ain't that old, is it?
DOCTOR: Fifty-one is certainly not old, Mr. Gentz. And, yes, I’ve heard it all before. Tired and weak… alright. Have you noticed any abdominal pain with this, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain...sometimes. Not like a sharp, stabbing thing, more of a dull ache, kinda low down. Comes and goes, really. And my appetite? Honestly, it's been all over the place. Some days I could eat a horse, other days...can't even look at food. Mostly just haven't been feeling up to it. I've lost a little weight, I think. Hard to say exactly, I don't really weigh myself anymore. Seems a bit morbid, you know? But the wife... well, used to always nag me about it. Said I was getting a bit of a belly. That was before... never mind. Point is, I probably haven't been as careful about things as I should be.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, comes and goes… weight loss… alright. Now, have you had any family history of stomach problems, ulcers, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmm. My father... he had something. I don’t remember exactly what, it was a long time ago, and honestly, we weren’t close. Something with his stomach, I think. Lots of pain, they said. Ended up in the hospital a few times. But I never really paid attention to the details. Yemenis aren’t really big on talking about that kind of stuff, you know? Private people. My mother…she was healthy as a horse, until the end. Heart gave out. So, not much help there, Doc. Sorry I can't be more useful. It’s not like I’ve been keeping a medical journal, is it?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Gentz. You've given me some helpful information. Now, let’s talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Look, I try to stay away from all that stuff if I can. Never been one for popping pills. Used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but the wife... she was the one who kept track of all that. After she passed…well, I just stopped. Didn’t really see the point, honestly. And no, nothing over-the-counter. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's it. And supplements? Absolutely not. Waste of money, if you ask me. I’m a simple man, Doc. Simple diet, simple life. Mostly. Though, I do like my coffee. Strong, black, and plenty of it. Probably not helping anything, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And strong coffee… okay. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Always been pretty lucky that way, I suppose. Ate everything put in front of me as a kid, and still do, mostly. Dust bothers me a bit, sometimes. Gets my nose itchy, makes me sneeze. But that's about it. Nothing serious. Look, Doc, I'm starting to feel a bit silly here, listing everything I don't have. This blood thing… it’s gotta be something serious, right? Just seems strange to be going through all this for a few spots of blood. I mean, people have worse, don't they?
DOCTOR: It’s good to be thorough, Mr. Gentz. And you're right to be concerned about the blood. It could be something serious, and that’s why we’re doing this. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listen to your abdomen, check your pulse, and maybe take your temperature. Sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you gotta do, Doc. I guess. Just get it over with, eh? I’ve never been a fan of doctors, if I’m honest. Always poking and prodding. But if that's what it takes… go ahead. Just try to be gentle, alright? And don’t be surprised if I flinch a bit. Old habits. Served in the military, you see. Lots of things you get used to… and then things you don't. Now hurry up, will ya? This chair’s not exactly comfortable.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I’ll be as gentle as possible. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. Let’s start with your pulse… Pulse is 78, a little on the higher side, but not alarming. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. That's elevated. Abdomen is slightly tender in the lower quadrants, and I hear some… diminished bowel sounds. There's some mild guarding here… and a slight fullness. No obvious masses. Alright, Mr. Gentz. I'm going to be frank with you. Based on this exam, it’s not nothing. It sounds like there might be some inflammation going on. It's possible it could be something like gastritis or even a more serious condition like a bowel obstruction. We need to do some more testing to get a clear picture. I want to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample to check for blood and infection. Would you be able to provide a stool sample today?
PATIENT: A stool sample? Seriously? This is getting ridiculous. So let me get this straight... you poke around, listen to my guts, take my blood, and now you want a piece of... never mind. Fine. A stool sample. Wonderful. Just tell me where to go, and I'll… handle it. What's this "bowel obstruction" thing, though? Sounds serious. Is it...cancer? The wife… she always worried about cancer. Said it ran in my family, though I never saw any proof. So, don’t sugarcoat it, Doc. Just tell me what I’m looking at. And how long am I gonna be stuck here, giving up pieces of myself for science?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. It's understandable to be worried, and I won't sugarcoat anything. A bowel obstruction means something is blocking your intestine. It can be caused by many things – adhesions from previous surgery, inflammation, or, yes, in some cases, it can be related to a tumor. However, it's far too early to jump to that conclusion. We need those tests to figure out what's going on. The restroom is down the hall, and there’s a collection kit and instructions inside. Please try to collect a sample as soon as possible. And then we’ll get those tests sent to the lab. It could be a few days for the results. In the meantime, I'm going to order you a liquid diet – nothing solid, just clear fluids – to give your bowel a rest. And I want you to avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I understand this is a lot to take in, but we're going to get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Liquid diet? No solid food? This is a nightmare. Just when I thought things couldn't get worse. Look, Doc, honestly, I'm a bit overwhelmed. My wife...she handled all this stuff. All the appointments, the tests, the worrying. I just...followed her around. I don't even know who to call if I need help with this. She always took care of everything. So...what are we talking here? Best-case scenario? Worst-case? And how much is all this gonna cost? I'm not insured, you see. Spent all my savings on... well, it doesn’t matter. Just tell me the truth. And if it is serious... is there anything they can do? Anything at all? I’m a widower, Doc. I’m all alone in this. And I don’t have a clue what I’m doing. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand. This is a lot to face alone, and it’s perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. We'll take things one step at a time. Let’s talk about the best- and worst-case scenarios. Best case, it’s something relatively minor, like gastritis or an intestinal inflammation that can be treated with medication and dietary changes. The liquid diet should help relieve some of the discomfort, and we’ll see what the tests reveal. Worst case… it could be a more serious obstruction that requires further intervention, possibly surgery. But, and I want to emphasize this, we don’t know that yet. Jumping to conclusions won't help. Regarding treatment, even in serious cases, there are options. Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation…depending on the diagnosis, we'll discuss the best course of action and connect you with specialists. And I understand your concern about cost. As you are uninsured, I can connect you with a financial counselor who can explore assistance programs and payment options. We can also try to minimize the number of unnecessary tests. I’m going to write down the names and numbers of the financial counselor, a social worker who can offer emotional support, and a gastroenterologist I trust. And I will also check if we have any resources available for low-income patients. This clinic has some assistance programs, and I will look into it. Please, take this. Call these people as soon as you can. And remember, you're not alone in this. We'll get through this together. Now, let's focus on getting that stool sample collected and ordering the liquid diet. I'm going to have a nurse come in and give you detailed instructions. Do you have any immediate questions before she arrives?
