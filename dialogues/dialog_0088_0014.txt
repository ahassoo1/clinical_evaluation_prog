DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Oh, goodness… well, my wife, she mostly set this up. Something about… papers? For when you need time off, or… can't work? It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. She said something about FMLA, maybe? I just… need what I need to get things sorted, you know? Sorry, my brain isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like your wife is being proactive, and that's wonderful. FMLA is Family and Medical Leave, yes – it allows time off for certain medical reasons. Before we get to paperwork, though, I want to make sure I understand why you might need leave. Are you experiencing any health issues at the moment?
PATIENT: Health issues… hmm. Well, I’ve been… tired. Really tired. More than usual, I suppose. And achy. Everything just hurts a bit more these days. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a sudden thing, it's been… creeping up on me, I guess. I mostly just try to push through it, to be honest. It’s… part of getting older, right? I don’t want to bother anyone with old age aches. Does that make sense? I mostly do my work, directing things at the church, but it's getting harder to concentrate, too.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Limtiaco. And it’s never a bother to discuss these things. Tiredness and aches can be caused by many things, and it’s good you’re finally bringing it up. “Creeping up on you” is a helpful way to describe it. When you say “tired,” is this fatigue that doesn’t improve with rest?
PATIENT: Yes, that's exactly it. Rest doesn't… fix it. I can sleep eight hours, wake up feeling like I haven’t slept at all. And it's not just physical, you know? My mind feels… foggy. Like trying to see through a cloud. It makes it hard to… organize things at the church, to remember what I need to do. It’s frustrating, really. I used to be so sharp. My wife says I repeat myself a lot now, too. She’s a good woman, always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Foggy thinking and repeating yourself are definitely things we want to explore. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. Oh, gosh. My appetite hasn’t been great. I used to love a good plate of food, but now… it just doesn’t appeal. And I’ve been… a little more clumsy, maybe? Bumping into things. Nothing serious, just… not as coordinated as I used to be. And I think I’ve been… well, my wife says I’m more irritable. Which isn’t like me, usually. I try to be a patient man.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. Loss of appetite, increased clumsiness, and irritability… all things we need to consider. Have you had any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I've noticed. Chills, no. Night sweats… hmm. Now that you mention it, I have been waking up a bit damp sometimes, but I just figured it was the weather. It gets warm here, you know. And weight loss… I think so, maybe? My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven't really been weighing myself. I mostly just try not to think about it, to be honest. Everything feels like a bother these days.
DOCTOR: I understand this is a lot to think about, Mr. Limtiaco. Based on what you’ve described – the fatigue, the fogginess, the appetite loss, the irritability, and potentially some weight loss – there are several possibilities we need to investigate. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s best, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s going on. My wife is worried, and frankly, so am I. A physical exam… alright. Let's get it done, then. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, breathing is good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please sit on the edge of the table?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just tell me what to do, Doctor. I'm a bit wobbly sometimes, so be gentle. I'm sitting now… feels a little high up here. This table is cold, you know.
DOCTOR: Just relax, Mr. Limtiaco. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I’m just going to test your reflexes with this little hammer. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but not significantly. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and point to your nose with your finger. Now, I’m going to hold my finger up and ask you to touch it with yours, keeping your eyes closed. Okay, good. A little tremor, but nothing overly concerning. Finally, I'm going to check your gait - could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright… walking… yes. I used to be a much faster walker, you know. My wife always said I walked like I was on a mission. Now… not so much. Feels a bit wobbly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. That was helpful. Alright, based on the exam and your history, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. Your symptoms – the fatigue, fogginess, appetite loss, irritability, tremor, and gait changes – could be indicative of several things, including vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or early signs of neurodegenerative conditions. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more in-depth evaluation of your neurological symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… and a neurologist… goodness. It sounds… serious. But if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes. Let’s do it. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? I’m not getting any younger, but I’d like to enjoy the time I have left. So, yes, blood work and a neurologist. Can we get that done quickly? My wife will be relieved to hear we’re finally getting some answers.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. I understand your concerns, and we’ll get this moving as quickly as possible. I’m ordering the blood work now – you can get that done at the lab just down the hall. They’ll need a requisition form, which I’m printing for you now. As for the neurologist, I’m sending a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma. Her office will call you to schedule an appointment. It may take a few days to get an appointment, but they’ll prioritize you given your symptoms. Now, while we're waiting for results, I recommend focusing on maintaining a healthy diet and getting as much rest as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. No, I think you've covered everything. Just… the FMLA paperwork? The reason I came here in the first place? My wife is very organized, you know. She’ll want to get that sorted out as soon as possible. If I can’t work, she needs to know what to do. Can we get started on that now? Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Limtiaco. Let’s get to the FMLA paperwork. I just need you to verify some information – your date of birth, your employer’s name, and the nature of your employment. Based on our conversation today, I can document that you’re experiencing symptoms that may require medical leave. I’ll also note the need for neurological evaluation and follow-up. I’ll need your signature here, and here… alright. There you go. I’m sending this to your employer’s HR department now. They may require additional information from you, but this should get the process started. Do you have any questions about the FMLA paperwork itself?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s alright. I mostly just signed where you told me to. My wife will handle the details. She’s very good with paperwork. I think… I think that’s everything, isn’t it? Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need a nap. All this talking has worn me out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And yes, a nap sounds like a very good idea. We'll be in touch with the results of your blood work as soon as they come in. I wish you all the best. .
