DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, good to see you too, Doctor. I just… well, it's silly, really. But my daughter, she says I need a… a card. A “get well” card. From you. She says it will… encourage me. I don't understand what encouragement is, exactly, but she’s very insistent. She says I’m feeling… low. I feel fine. Mostly. But she worries.
DOCTOR: A card, right… Okay. Hmm. Low… feeling low. Well, your daughter sounds like a caring woman. So, physically, you're saying you feel mostly fine?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. My bones ache a little, like they always do when the weather changes. And my stomach, it makes noises. But that’s just… old age, I guess. I don't need a card to fix that. It's just… she thinks a card from a doctor will make me feel… better. I don’t see how paper will help. Is this something doctors do now? Prescribe… paper?
DOCTOR: No, no, not prescribe paper, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like your daughter is… concerned, and she's trying to help in the way she knows how. It's… unusual, but not harmful. Let’s focus on the aches and the stomach noises. When did these aches start getting worse, if you can recall?
PATIENT: Worse? They haven't been worse. They're just… there. Always there. For years now. Maybe a little more when it rains, like I said. I work with the boilers, you see. It's damp work. Always has been. And the noises… the noises are just… noises. Like a grumpy animal in there. They don't hurt. They just… are. Is this about the noises? Should I be worried about the noises?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see you've been seeing Dr. Ramirez for a while now… and some notes about, yes, musculoskeletal complaints, and… occasional GI upset. Nothing urgent flagged here. So, the aches… consistent for years, worse with weather, boiler work. And the stomach noises, no pain, just… present. Have you noticed any change in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? What does that mean? Look, Doctor, I’m a simple man. I fix boilers. I don’t talk about… things like that with doctors. Is this something I need to worry about? Because if it’s not hurting me, I don’t see what the card, or the bowel… whatever you said, has to do with anything. My daughter is making a big fuss over nothing, I tell you. A perfectly good man, worrying about paper. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. We don’t need to get into details if you’re not comfortable. Just trying to rule things out. No blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! No blood. Definitely no blood. I would know if there was blood! Look, Doctor, are you going to give me the card or not? Because frankly, this conversation is making my stomach more upset. And it wasn’t making noises before! My daughter… she's going to be very disappointed if you don’t. She said it has your fancy signature and everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Look, let’s do a quick exam, just to be thorough. I’ll listen to your stomach, feel your abdomen. And then… yes, I will write you a note. A “card,” as your daughter calls it. Sound fair?
PATIENT: Fine. An exam. But don't poke too hard. And make sure the card says something official. Something a doctor would write. Not just… “feel better.” My daughter… she wants reassurance. She says I worry too much. Which is nonsense. But if a card will shut her up, then do it. And be quick about it. I have boilers to fix.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with listening to your abdomen. Lie back for me, please. And I’ll try to be as… official as possible with the note. Just breathe normally. Anything particularly painful when I press here?
PATIENT: No! Stop poking! It's just… sensitive. Old age, remember? Everything's sensitive. And don’t make a face like that. It makes my daughter think I’m a hypochondriac. Which I am not! I fix boilers. Boilers don’t complain when you poke them. This is very undignified. And cold. Is this exam room always so cold?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to worry. Just checking. Abdomen is… soft, non-tender to the touch, some mild discomfort with palpation, as you mentioned. I hear some… normal bowel sounds. A little… gurgly, but nothing alarming. How about your weight?
PATIENT: Weight? What do you need to know my weight for? I haven't weighed myself in… oh, goodness, maybe ten years. I’m a working man! I carry heavy tools! You can tell I’m a healthy weight! I'm not one of those… skinny fellas, if that’s what you mean. Is this about the weight now? My daughter is going to have a field day with this. “Oh, Early, you need to watch your weight!” Honestly. It's ridiculous. Just give me the card!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kammer. I'm just trying to get a complete picture. It's standard procedure. I do see a note from Dr. Ramirez about some weight loss last year. Was that significant?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh. That. Yes. Well, I was… a little sick. Just a cold. A bad one. I didn't have much appetite. But I'm better now! Mostly. I'm eating. I had a good breakfast this morning. Eggs and… toast. Two pieces. And bacon. Yes. A good breakfast. But I am still a little… tired, if you must know. Does that mean something? Is this about the tiredness now? Because I tell you, this is getting very long. And cold. Do you have any sweaters in here?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's address the tiredness. When did it start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start…? It’s been… creeping up on me. Little by little. I don’t know. Maybe… six months ago? A little slower to get up in the morning. A little more… resting in the evenings. Nothing dramatic. I just thought I was getting older. Old men get tired! It’s… natural. But my daughter… she insists it's something wrong. And now you're asking about it. Honestly, Doctor, you're making me more tired just talking about it! Can’t we just finish with the card? A nice, official-looking card?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. Look, I understand your frustration. But we need to rule things out. Fatigue can have many causes. Given the weight loss last year, and the persistent tiredness, I'm going to order some blood work. Just routine, to check your thyroid, your blood count, things like that. And, I strongly recommend seeing a specialist, a gastroenterologist, about the stomach noises. Just to be sure everything is okay. As for the card… I will write you a note stating that you've been evaluated and we are pursuing further investigation to address your fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms. Will that satisfy your daughter?
PATIENT: Symptoms?! What symptoms?! I told you, I feel fine! Mostly. This is getting out of hand. Specialists? Blood work? For a little tiredness and some noises? Doctor, I swear, my daughter is manipulating you. She’s always been dramatic. A specialist… I have boilers to fix! I don't have time for specialists! And blood work… I hate needles! Is this really necessary? Honestly. Just give me the card. A simple card saying I’m a healthy man, with a little tiredness, and some noises. That's all! Write that, and I’ll be on my way. And tell your staff to turn up the heat! I’m freezing! .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. I’m going to write this note, as you requested. But I strongly advise you to reconsider the blood work and the specialist referral. It's better to be safe. Here you go. “Patient evaluated, reports mild fatigue and occasional gastrointestinal sounds. Further investigation recommended.” Will that do?
