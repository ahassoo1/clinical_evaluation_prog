DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start us off, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. That’s what the lady on the phone said. Medicare wants it done, or… someone does. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur these days. Can we just get it over with?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. It’s quite alright if things are a bit unclear; Medicare does often request routine lab work. We'll get this taken care of as efficiently as possible. To ensure I have everything accurate, and just to cover all bases, could you confirm for me what specifically Medicare is requesting?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. I really don't remember. Something about… numbers? And… blood. They said it was routine. Honestly, I get so many forms and calls… it all runs together. Is there a list somewhere? Or can the lady who scheduled it just tell you? I’m not good with details, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Croonquist. Let me see what was noted when the appointment was scheduled. Ah, here we are. It appears Medicare has requested a Complete Blood Count, a Basic Metabolic Panel, a Lipid Panel, and a PSA test. Does that sound familiar at all?
PATIENT: Those… those are just words to me, Doctor. Honestly, no. Blood, I remember. Numbers, maybe. But those… those names. Look, I just need the lab work done so I can go home. Is it going to be painful?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Croonquist. Those are a lot of medical terms. Let me explain briefly what each test checks, and then we can proceed. The Complete Blood Count – or CBC – gives us information about the different types of cells in your blood. The Basic Metabolic Panel checks your kidney function, electrolyte balance, and blood sugar. The Lipid Panel checks your cholesterol levels. And the PSA test is a blood test that can help screen for prostate cancer. As for pain, the blood draw itself will be a very brief pinch, similar to what you experience when donating blood. It’s generally well-tolerated. Is that alright with you if we proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… quickly, please. I have things I need to get to. And a nap I’ve been looking forward to all day. Just… get it over with. And… are you sure it won't take long?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. We will be as efficient as possible. I'll personally ensure a swift and comfortable experience. “Nurse Fatima, could you please prepare Mr. Croonquist for a routine blood draw?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… let’s go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist, the blood draw is complete. Nurse Fatima has sent the samples to the lab, and the results should be available within a few business days. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, let's briefly discuss your medical history. I see here that you're 73 years old. Have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Honestly, Doctor, it’s been a long time. I was… I worked at the power plant for a long time. Lots of dust, maybe. And… I think I had the flu a couple of times. Nothing serious, I don't believe. Old age is what’s ailing me now, if that counts. Do I have to go through all this? It’s… tiring.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Croonquist. It’s good to know you haven’t had any major illnesses. Even seemingly minor things can be helpful information. The dust from the power plant is something we’ll keep in mind. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think… There was… something with my knee, years ago. A small thing. They said it was… cartilage, maybe? I don’t remember the exact word. I was young then, relatively. And… nothing else comes to mind. It was a long time ago. Honestly, my memory is… not what it used to be. Is this all necessary, Doctor? Can’t we just get the results and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Croonquist, I understand. The knee surgery is noted. And, yes, these questions are to help me get a complete picture of your health, and to ensure we interpret the lab results accurately. Knowing your history helps us to understand what is normal for you. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Just… these. For my blood pressure, the doctor said. And… something for my knees. They don’t really help, to be honest. But the doctor keeps prescribing them. I can't even remember the names. It's all a blur. That's it. That's all I take. Please, can we just finish this? I really need a nap.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Croonquist. This is very helpful. I see here you're taking Lisinopril for blood pressure and Meloxicam for your knees. Now, one more question. Are you allergic to any medications or have any other allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Dust at the plant bothered me sometimes, but that wasn't an allergy, just… dust. I don't think I've ever had a true allergy. No, I'm pretty sure. No allergies. Just… old age. And a desperate need for a nap. Can we be done now? I feel… lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. No known allergies noted. And I completely understand your desire for a rest. Now, we’ve covered quite a bit of ground. To summarize, you’re a 73-year-old male with a history of working at a power plant, some knee issues, and currently taking Lisinopril and Meloxicam. We've sent the lab work off, and the results should be back in a few business days. I’ll have the nurse contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—especially chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… no questions. Just… the results. When will I get them? And… will the nurse call, or do I need to call them? I don’t do well on the phone, you see. I forget things… easily. Just… the results. Please.
DOCTOR: The nurse will call you with the results, Mr. Croonquist. You won’t need to call them. We anticipate the results will be back within 3 to 5 business days. I'll make a note to have them call you directly, and they'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Before you go, would you like a written copy of your medication list to take with you?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I have my pills. That’s enough for me. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you not making me remember too much. And… can I just say, it’s very warm in here?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. I'm glad I could help. And yes, I’ll have the nurse adjust the temperature. Thank you for coming in today. Please, take care, and get some rest. And if anything changes, don’t hesitate to contact us. .
