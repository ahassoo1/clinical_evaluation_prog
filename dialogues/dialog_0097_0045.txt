DOCTOR: Hi Enrique, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, I keep getting… a red face. A flushing, I think they call it? It just… happens sometimes. Not always, you know? It’s a little embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a flushing face that comes and goes. I understand it can be embarrassing, so thank you for bringing it up. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s hard to say exactly. Sometimes after I eat… spicy food, maybe? But not always after spicy food. And sometimes… just when I'm talking to people. Not everyone, just… certain people. It's very strange. I don’t know what causes it. It feels warm, like a fever, but I don't have a fever.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be triggered by spicy food sometimes, but not consistently, and also by social situations with certain people. And you feel warmth, but no actual fever. That’s helpful. Does it happen all over your face, or just certain areas – like your cheeks, nose, or forehead?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly my cheeks, I think. And my neck a little bit. Not so much my forehead. And it doesn’t stay for long. A few minutes, maybe. Then it goes away. It’s not painful, just… noticeable. People look at me. It makes me a little nervous, and maybe that makes it worse? I don't know. Is this… normal?
DOCTOR: It sounds like it could be a few different things, Enrique, and it's good you're paying attention to when it happens. The fact that it's tied to certain situations – like talking to people – is definitely something we should explore. Do you notice anything else happening when your face flushes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my heart beats a little faster. Not a lot faster, just… a little bit. And my hands… maybe they get a little sweaty. But not always. And I don't feel dizzy or anything. Just warm and red and… a little anxious, I guess. It’s not… a big problem, really. Just annoying. My wife… she used to say I was blushing all the time, but she passed away last year. So… it’s different now. I don’t have anyone to tell about it.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Enrique. It's understandable that things feel different now, and it takes courage to talk about these things, especially with loss. The faster heartbeat and sweaty hands alongside the flushing does give us a bit more information. It sounds like it could be related to what we call “rosacea” or perhaps something called “social anxiety,” though we’ll need to rule out other things first. Let’s do a quick check of your overall health. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. My heart… it’s been okay, I think. A little bit fast sometimes, like I said. But nothing… terrible. I don’t get chest pain or anything like that. I used to walk a lot, but I haven’t been walking as much lately. I miss my wife, and… I just don’t feel like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, although your pulse is a little elevated, which could be from talking, or just a bit of anxiety. Blood pressure is 135/85 – slightly elevated, but not significantly. Lungs sound clear. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been pretty healthy, actually. I used to be very active. I worked as a counselor for many years, helping people with… problems. Substance abuse, mostly. And mental health. So I always told them to take care of themselves, but… I haven’t been very good at it lately. No diabetes, no high blood pressure before. Just… this flushing. And sadness, of course. But that's not a medical problem, is it?
DOCTOR: It's admirable work you did as a counselor, Enrique, and it's common to focus on others and sometimes neglect our own well-being. And sadness after a loss absolutely impacts our health, even if it isn't a condition with a simple medical fix. We can talk about resources for grief support later if you'd like. Let’s quickly go through a few other things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. I can eat anything. I used to love spicy food, remember? But I haven’t been eating much of anything lately, to be honest. Not much appetite. And I don't take any pills or anything. Never have, really. Just… sometimes a little tea. For sleep. But that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and no medications. That’s good to know. And finally, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. And I haven’t been in the hospital. Not ever. I’ve been very lucky, I think. Except for… losing my wife. That was the worst thing that ever happened to me. I just… miss her so much. I don’t know what to do. But… I should tell you about the flushing, right? I don't want to just talk about sadness.
DOCTOR: You're right, let's focus on the flushing. And please, feel free to share whatever is on your mind. It's important to address everything. It sounds like the flushing is definitely bothering you, and we will figure out what's going on. So, to recap, it happens mostly on your cheeks and neck, comes and goes in a few minutes, sometimes triggered by spicy food but not always, and seems to be associated with certain social situations. You also notice a faster heartbeat and occasional sweaty hands. Given your history, it could be a few things. Rosacea is a possibility – it causes facial redness and flushing. But the association with social situations makes me wonder if it’s more related to anxiety or even a condition called “social phobia.” We should also rule out other medical causes. I’d like to order a few simple blood tests, just to check your thyroid function and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, blood tests are fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to… feel normal again. My wife… she always took care of everything. She would have known what to do. But I’m not her. I just… I don’t want people staring at me when I talk. It makes me nervous, and then the flushing gets worse. It’s a… a vicious circle, I think. Is that what you call it? A vicious circle?
DOCTOR: Yes, Enrique, that is exactly what you call it – a vicious circle. And you’re right to feel frustrated. It's very common for anxiety to create a cycle like this. And it's perfectly reasonable to want to feel normal again. The blood tests will give us a good starting point. I'm also going to ask you to keep a little diary for the next week. Just jot down when the flushing happens, what you were doing beforehand, who you were with, and how you were feeling emotionally. That will help us identify any patterns. I’m also going to give you a brief questionnaire to assess your anxiety levels. It's just a simple set of questions, and it will help me understand what's going on. Finally, if the blood tests are normal and the questionnaire suggests anxiety, we can talk about some strategies to manage it – like deep breathing exercises or even talking to a therapist. There are many effective treatments available. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… okay. A diary, a questionnaire… I can do that. I used to keep notes all the time when I was a counselor, so I’m used to writing things down. And… talking to a therapist. I don’t know. I used to be the therapist. It feels strange to… be the patient. But… I guess it’s worth a try. If it helps me stop flushing, I’ll do anything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Enrique. It’s understandable that it feels strange to switch roles, but remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. And you deserve to feel comfortable and confident. Here are the questionnaire and the notebook. Take your time filling them out, and don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions. My nurse will draw your blood before you leave. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, try to be kind to yourself. Grief can take a long time to process, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious or overwhelmed. Do you have any questions for me right now before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you again, Doctor. I feel a little bit better just talking about it. And I will try to… be kind to myself. My wife would have told me to do that. She was very wise. I guess… I’ll see you in a few days then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Enrique. And yes, I will see you in a few days. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, and remember, you're not alone in this. .
