DOCTOR: Good morning, Elijiah. My name is Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, it's kinda weird. I'm just… having trouble gettin’ out of chairs. Sounds dumb, I know. It’s been happenin’ for a couple weeks now. Not every time, but enough to be a pain.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound dumb at all, Elijiah. It's good you came in to get it checked out. A couple of weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe three weeks now. Started after a really long shift out at the rig. We were pullin’ a double, somethin’ like 36 hours straight. I just… felt stuck when I went to stand up after sittin’ for a bit. Thought it was just bein’ tired, but it hasn’t really gone away. It’s like… my legs just don’t wanna work right for a second.
DOCTOR: Okay, a long shift at the rig. That gives me some context. And it feels like your legs aren’t responding immediately when you try to stand?
PATIENT: Exactly. Not like they're weak, exactly. More like… disconnected for a split second. Like there's a delay between my brain tellin’ ‘em to go and them actually goin’. It’s hard to explain. And it's not every chair, you know? Some chairs are fine, some… not so much. Older ones, maybe? I dunno.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating, and you're doing a good job of explaining it. So it's intermittent, and you've noticed it seems to be more common with older chairs. Have you noticed anything else that makes it worse – like certain positions, or activities besides sitting?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really positions, no. And nothin’ else I’ve noticed, not specifically. I do a lot of liftin’ and carryin’ at work, but that doesn’t seem to affect it. Walkin’ is fine, standin’ is fine. It’s just… sittin’ and then tryin’ to get up. It’s mostly happenin’ when I’m relaxin’, I think. Like, when I’ve been sittin’ still for a while. Makes no sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when this happens, is there any pain associated with it, or just the feeling of difficulty initiating the movement?
PATIENT: Nah, no pain. Not at all. It’s just… frustrating. Like tryin’ to start an engine that’s flooded, y’know? Just kinda… stuck for a second. Then it's fine. I haven't fallen or anything, but I'm worried it'll happen at a bad time. Mostly just makes me look silly, tryin’ to heave myself outta a chair.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It’s good you’re thinking about preventing a fall. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you had any previous medical problems or surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothin’ major. Broke my arm when I was a kid, fallin’ outta a tree, but that healed up fine. No surgeries, no nothin’. Pretty healthy, all things considered. Work keeps me movin’. I don’t really go to the doctor much. This is… kinda new for me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family history… uh, my mom had some trouble with her knees when she got older, arthritis, I think. And my grandpa… he had somethin’ with his balance, but I don’t remember exactly what. He wasn’t a big talker. Everyone on my side's pretty tough, though. We don't usually complain much.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother and some balance issues with your grandfather. Do you know if either of them had any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Uh… neurological? I honestly don’t know, Doc. I don’t really know much about that stuff. Mom just complained about her knees bein’ stiff and achy. And Grandpa… he just kinda wobbled when he walked, needed a cane towards the end. I don’t think it was anything serious, but I couldn’t tell you for sure. I wasn’t really askin’ about medical stuff back then. Mostly worried about gettin’ him another plate of food.
DOCTOR: Understood. That’s perfectly alright. Let’s talk about any medications you’re currently taking, and any allergies you might have.
PATIENT: Nothin’ at all. No medications, no allergies. I drink a lot of water, that’s about it. Sometimes a coffee if it’s a really long shift. But that’s it. I try to stay away from pills and stuff if I can. Seems like they just cause more problems than they solve.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, none of that. Never really been much of a smoker. Had a couple beers with the guys after a shift now and then, but I don’t drink much. And definitely no drugs. I gotta stay sharp for work, y'know? Can’t be messin’ with that stuff.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, I’d like to ask about your social history. What do you do for work, and what does a typical day look like?
PATIENT: Like I said, I work out at the oil rig. Roustabout, mostly. It's… physical work. Liftin’, carryin’, movin’ stuff around, makin’ sure everything’s safe. A typical day… starts early. Real early. Up before sunrise. Then it’s just… workin’. Hours and hours of workin’. Then eat, sleep, repeat. Long shifts, like I mentioned before. It can be pretty rough on the body, but it pays the bills. I live alone now, since… well, since my wife passed. Mostly just keep to myself.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife. That must be difficult. Alright, let's move on to the physical exam. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Thanks, Doc. It's been a few years now. Still rough sometimes. Sure thing. Standin’ up now. Let me know if I should be doin’ somethin’ special.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I’m just going to observe your gait - how you walk. Then I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and balance. Please walk a few steps for me, and then stop. Your gait appears normal, no significant deviations observed. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you please sit back down on the chair?
PATIENT: Alright, walkin' feels normal enough. Back in the chair now. Reflexes, you said? Never had those checked before. What am I lookin’ for?
DOCTOR: Don't worry, you don't need to look for anything specifically. I'll do the checking. Your knee reflexes are present and symmetric, which is good. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Sure thing. Squeezin’ now. As hard as I can. I do a lot of liftin’, so my grip should be pretty strong.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your grip strength is good, bilateral and equal. Now, let's check your balance. Could you please stand up again, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Standin’ up now. Eyes closed. This feels a little… weird. Let me know if I start wobblin’ too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, just stay still as best you can. You’re doing well, minimal sway. Now you can open your eyes. Okay, please sit back down. Everything appears normal so far. Now, I want to see exactly what happens when you get up. Could you try standing up from this chair, slowly and deliberately?
PATIENT: Alright, eyes open. Okay, standin’ up now… slowly… deliberately… Here we go…
DOCTOR: Okay, I see exactly what you mean. There’s a slight delay as you initiate the movement, a little hesitation before you push off. It doesn't appear to be weakness, but more of a difficulty starting the process. Now, could you please sit back down?
PATIENT: Alright, back in the chair. Yeah, that little hesitation… that's exactly what I've been feelin'. It's not like I can’t get up, it just… takes a second to get goin’. Like the signal's gettin’ lost somewhere.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing something called "hesitancy to initiate movement," potentially related to a mild neurological component. It's not necessarily a cause for major concern at this point, but it warrants further investigation to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order some blood work to check for any vitamin deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. I also think it would be helpful to get a referral to a neurologist for a more detailed assessment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A neurologist, huh? Sounds kinda serious. But if that's what you think is best, Doc, then yeah, sure. Blood work, neurologist… whatever it takes to figure out what's goin’ on. I just wanna make sure it’s not somethin’ serious. And I don't wanna end up fallin' or somethin'. So yeah, let's do it. What's the next step?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I understand your concerns, and it's good you're taking this seriously. I'll write you a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a neurologist I trust. Her office is located at 42 Willow Creek Drive, and their number is 555-123-4567. They’ll likely want to schedule an appointment for a full neurological exam. I’ll also send you to the lab for a complete blood count, vitamin D level, vitamin B12 level, and a thyroid panel. The lab order will be sent electronically to the lab at 15 Oak Street. In the meantime, there’s no need to drastically alter your activity level, but I recommend avoiding situations where a fall could be particularly dangerous. And if you notice any new symptoms – weakness, numbness, tingling, vision changes – please contact me immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. I'll write down those numbers and addresses. Dr. Vance, 42 Willow Creek Drive… Got it. And the lab at 15 Oak Street. Avoiding dangerous situations… I can do that. Mostly just work, anyway. Thanks for takin’ the time to listen, and for not brushin’ it off. I appreciate it. What about the cost? Will insurance cover this? Oh… wait. Never mind. I'm not insured. How much are we lookin’ at, roughly?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Elijiah. I'm glad I could help. Regarding the cost, that's a valid concern, especially without insurance. The blood work will likely cost around $150-$200, depending on the lab. As for the neurologist appointment, Dr. Vance typically charges $250-$300 for the initial consultation. However, many neurologists offer a sliding fee scale based on income, and Dr. Vance is known to be quite compassionate. I can call her office on your behalf and inquire about their financial assistance options. Also, there are some local charitable organizations that may be able to help cover the cost of medical care for uninsured individuals. I can provide you with a list of those organizations as well. We can also discuss prioritizing the tests if cost is a significant barrier. For example, we could start with just the blood work to rule out any common deficiencies, and then proceed with the neurological consultation if the results warrant it. What do you think would be the best approach for you?
PATIENT: That's… really good of you, Doc. To even think about that. Callin’ her office and askin’ about financial assistance would be amazing. I really appreciate that. I don't wanna get stuck with a huge bill. Prioritizin’ the tests sounds smart too. Blood work first, see what that says. That's probably the best way to go. I don’t want to waste money if it's somethin’ simple like a vitamin deficiency. Okay, blood work first. You call Dr. Vance’s office. I’ll just… try to stay outta chairs for a while. Thanks again, Doc. Really. You’ve been a big help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Elijiah. I'm happy to help in any way I can. I'll make that call to Dr. Vance's office right now and see what options are available. I'll also print out a list of local resources for uninsured individuals. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, bring those to you before you leave. She can also answer any further questions you may have. In the meantime, try to avoid situations where a fall could be a risk, and please don’t hesitate to contact me if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Here’s a little something to tide you over. Take care of yourself, Elijiah. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. .
PATIENT: Okay, thanks Doc. Fall prevention… good idea. I will. I appreciate everything. I think that’s everything. Thanks again for takin’ the time, and for bein’ so understanding. .
