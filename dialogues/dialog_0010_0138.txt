DOCTOR: Good morning, Alayne. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Annesley. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Let me see... well, my daughter, bless her heart, she’s been worried about me. I’ve been… having these little spells, I guess you’d call them. A bit of weakness on one side, mostly. And my mother… oh, she suffered from terrible headaches all her life. And my brother, too, he had something with… well, it was with his arm and leg, I think. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Spells” with some weakness, and a family history of headaches and some kind of weakness in your brother. That’s helpful to know. When you say weakness, can you describe that a little more for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear, describing… yes. Well, it’s not a total weakness, you understand? It’s more like… my arm feels heavy, sometimes. And my leg… it just doesn’t feel quite right. Like it’s a little slower to move, maybe? It comes and goes, thankfully. It doesn’t happen all the time. It’s hard to explain… it’s like trying to remember a dream, really. A fleeting feeling.
DOCTOR: I understand – a fleeting, intermittent weakness, heavier feeling in the arm, and slower movement in the leg. That’s a good start. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question… Let me think. It's been… months, I suppose. Not recent months, more like… several. It started slowly, you see. I thought it was just getting old, honestly! A little stiffness, a little ache… you know how it is. But then it started happening more often, and my daughter, she insisted I come see someone. She's a worrier, that one, but a good girl. I’d say… maybe six, seven months now? It’s hard to pinpoint, really. Everything blends together after a while, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does indeed. Six to seven months of intermittent weakness. And is this weakness on one side of your body, or does it seem to affect both sides equally?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely one side. My right side, I believe. Sometimes my right arm feels heavier, and sometimes my right leg feels… well, not exactly clumsy, but slower, like I said. It's never bothered my left side, thankfully. It’s all on the right. I remember thinking that was odd, because my mother's headaches… well, she always complained about both sides of her head. But this… this is mostly just on my right side.
DOCTOR: Okay, right-sided weakness, intermittent over the last six to seven months. Now, have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as these spells?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, sometimes I get a bit of a headache before the weakness starts. Not a terrible headache, mind you. More like a dull ache, behind my eyes. And… sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, just for a moment. Nothing major, you understand? It passes quickly. And… oh, yes! I get a little confused sometimes. Just little things, like forgetting what I was saying mid-sentence. Or… misplacing things. But I've always been a bit forgetful, so it's hard to tell if that's anything new. My daughter says I repeat myself, but she always says that!
DOCTOR: Okay, so headache sometimes before the weakness, brief blurry vision, and some confusion and forgetfulness. That's good information. Now, to get a better picture, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear, medical history… That's a long time ago. Let me see… I had the usual things, I suppose. High blood pressure, yes, the doctor told me that years ago. I take a pill for it, I think. Or, I used to take a pill for it. I can’t quite remember now… My husband handles most of the medication, you see. And… I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. And… I think I had a bit of arthritis in my hands. But that’s all I can really recall. Nothing serious, I don't think. Oh! And I wear glasses, as you can see.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure – possibly on medication, gallbladder removal, some arthritis, and you wear glasses. And are you currently taking any medications regularly, even if you're not sure what they're for?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a tricky one… Let me see. I take a white pill every morning. My husband puts it out with my breakfast. He says it’s for my blood pressure, but… I really couldn’t tell you for sure. And… I sometimes take something for my arthritis, when my hands are particularly sore. It’s a little orange pill, I think. But not every day, just when I need it. And… oh, yes! A little pink pill before bed, sometimes. My husband says it’s to help me sleep. But I don’t always take it, you see. It makes me a little groggy in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white pill daily – potentially for blood pressure, an orange pill as needed for arthritis, and a pink pill occasionally for sleep. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Not that I know of, dear. I've always been pretty lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, thankfully. And I haven't had any bad reactions to any medications, not that I recall. My husband always asks the pharmacist, you see. He’s very careful about those things. I think… I think I used to get a little itchy when I wore certain fabrics, but that was years ago. Nothing serious, you understand. Just a little irritation. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a sad story, really. My mother, bless her soul, she suffered from terrible headaches all her life. Migraines, the doctor called them. She was always in and out of bed with them. And my brother… he had a stroke, years ago. It affected his arm and leg, I think. He had a hard time walking after that. And… my father, he had heart problems. He passed away when I was quite young, so I don't remember much about it. And my husband… his mother had diabetes, I believe. But that’s all I can really recall. A lot of illnesses, sadly. It seems to run in the family, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does seem that way. History of migraines in your mother, stroke in your brother, and heart problems and diabetes in your parents. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were dreadful for you. And my husband… well, he used to smoke a little, when he was younger, but he gave it up years ago. He said it wasn’t worth it. No, I’ve never smoked, and I don’t approve of it, either.
DOCTOR: Good. And how much alcohol do you typically drink?
PATIENT: Oh, not much, dear. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Or a little sherry on special occasions. Nothing excessive, you understand. My husband enjoys a little brandy after dinner, but I prefer a glass of wine. And… I don’t drink every day, just a few times a week. It’s nice to relax with a little something, but I don’t rely on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few glasses of wine a week. Now, finally, do you work or volunteer, and how active would you say you are on a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, I'm retired now, dear. I used to work in an insurance office, processing claims and policies. It was… a lot of paperwork, mostly. Now, I mostly keep busy around the house. I do a little gardening, when the weather is nice. And I like to read. I’m not very active, I suppose. I used to walk more, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. I mostly take things easy these days. My daughter worries about me not getting enough exercise, but… I’m an old woman, you see. I’ve earned a little rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired, a little gardening and reading, not very active. Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Alayne. That gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a quick neurological exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement completely. My husband always says I worry too much, so I’m happy to let you take a look. Go right ahead, dear. I’ll just sit here quietly and try to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. There… is that alright, Doctor? Sometimes my eyes get a little tired, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. There’s a slight slowness to your eye movements, but nothing too concerning. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Your grip strength is a little weak on your right hand compared to your left. And finally, I'm going to check your balance. Could you please stand up, if you're able, and try to stand on one leg for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I can manage that, I think. Oh dear… that’s not very good, is it? I feel a little unsteady. I suppose my balance isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright. It’s good we checked. Your balance is a little off on your right side, and that, combined with the slight weakness in your hand and the slowness in your eye movements, is something we need to investigate further. Based on everything you’ve told me and the findings from the exam, I'm concerned about the possibility of a neurological issue, possibly a transient ischemic attack – a TIA – or something similar affecting the blood flow to the brain. It’s important to rule out a stroke.
PATIENT: Oh dear… a stroke? That sounds… frightening. Is it serious, Doctor? My brother… he never fully recovered after his stroke. Is that what you think is happening to me? I don’t feel… terribly ill, but I suppose that doesn't mean anything. What do we do now? I’m a bit scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Alayne. It is frightening to hear those words. It’s important to remember that I'm not making a definitive diagnosis at this point. I’m saying it’s important to rule out a stroke or TIA. And even if it is a TIA, prompt treatment can significantly reduce the risk of a full stroke. Your symptoms – the weakness, the blurry vision, the confusion, and the balance issues – are concerning enough that we need to take action. The most important next step is to get a scan of your brain – a CT scan or an MRI – to see if there’s any evidence of damage or blockage. I'm going to order that immediately. I also want to check your blood sugar and do some blood tests to rule out other causes. Depending on the results of those tests and the scan, we may need to consult with a neurologist – a specialist in brain disorders. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a scan… and a neurologist… it all sounds very complicated. And a bit scary. Will the scan hurt, Doctor? And what does a neurologist do, exactly? My daughter always tells me to ask questions, but I always forget what to say. And... will I have to stay in the hospital? I don't want to be a bother to anyone.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Alayne. It is a lot to take in. Let's address your questions one at a time. The scan – a CT scan – is painless. You’ll lie on a table, and a machine will take X-rays from different angles to create a detailed picture of your brain. It’s very quick and doesn’t involve any radiation exposure that’s harmful. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in disorders of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. If we find anything concerning on the scan, the neurologist will help us figure out the cause and recommend the best treatment options. They are very skilled at diagnosing and treating these kinds of issues. As for staying in the hospital… it depends on the results of the tests. If the scan is normal, we may be able to manage things on an outpatient basis. But if we find evidence of a stroke or TIA, you may need to be admitted for closer monitoring and treatment. We’ll discuss all of that with you in detail once we have the results. Right now, let’s just focus on getting the scan done. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I still feel a bit scared, but… I feel better knowing that you’re taking care of me. I trust your judgement completely. When will I have the scan, do you think? And… should I tell my daughter? She worries so much…
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Alayne. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. We’ll get the scan scheduled as quickly as possible. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, arrange it for you right now. She’ll tell you when and where to go, and what to expect. It should be within the next few hours. And yes, I think it’s a good idea to tell your daughter. She’s clearly very concerned about your well-being, and she deserves to know what’s going on. You don’t have to tell her everything at once, but letting her know that you’re being evaluated and that we’re taking things seriously will likely put her mind at ease. Perhaps you could tell her that you’ve been experiencing some weakness and confusion, and that I want to get a scan to rule out any potential problems. Maria will be in shortly to discuss the scan arrangements with you. In the meantime, is there anything I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I think I'll just sit here for a little while and try to relax. I'm sure Maria will explain everything very clearly. You've been very kind and patient with me. I really appreciate it. I just hope… I just hope everything turns out alright.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alayne. We’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you the best possible care. Try not to worry too much, and please don’t hesitate to let me or Maria know if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to support you. .
