DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Brege. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Just call me Clide, please. Look, I don't like bein' here, no offense. Been havin' this fever come and go. It's been a couple weeks now, maybe three. Just want it to stop, you know? It's nothin' major, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Of course, Clide. No offense taken at all. It's perfectly alright to not enjoy being at the doctor’s office. A fever coming and going for a couple of weeks… that is something we should look into. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it usually starts in the evenin'. Gets pretty warm, you know? Not like burnin' up, just...hot. Then it goes away by mornin'. Happens every few days, like clockwork. I took some of that… Tylenol, I think it was? Helped for a bit, but it always comes back. I don't really pay attention to how high it gets, honestly. I just feel kinda crummy when it's there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it comes on in the evenings, subsides by morning, and happens every few days. You've been using Tylenol with some relief, but it returns. Do you notice anything else happening with the fever?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Not really. No cough, no sniffles. Maybe a little tired, but I'm always a little tired, you know? Sixty-five years takes it outta ya. No aches, no nothin'. Just…warm. And annoyed. It's mostly just annoying, Doctor. Really. It keeps me from gettin' a good night’s sleep, and Maria gets worried. That's why I'm here, I guess. She said I gotta get it checked.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good Maria is looking out for you, and it's perfectly valid to want to get something checked out, even if it doesn’t feel major. No cough, no sniffles, just the fever and some tiredness… Okay. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately?
PATIENT: Appetite's been okay. Maria cooks, so I eat what she puts in front of me. Weight… probably lost a pound or two. But I ain’t been weighin' myself, if that makes sense. It's August, it's hot, I don't eat as much when it's scorchin' outside. Nothin' drastic, though. Same pants still fit. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. It's easy for things to fluctuate a little in this weather. So, no significant weight loss then. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past health. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. I had my gallbladder out years ago, when I was younger. But that was… decades ago. And I got a bad back, that's why I'm a chiropractor, right? Fixed a lot of backs in my time. But other than that, I'm pretty healthy. Always been pretty lucky, I guess. Maria says I work too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal a long time ago, and back issues related to your work as a chiropractor. That's good to know. And you haven’t been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had diabetes, never had high blood pressure. Doc always said I was a healthy fella, just gotta watch the back. Regular checkups, you know, the usual. But this fever… it's new. Never had a fever that just comes and goes like this before. It's just… weird. And annoyin'. Still.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. It is unusual for a fever to come and go like that. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pills, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the Tylenol when the fever hits. And… Maria makes me take a multivitamin. She says I don’t eat enough vegetables. That’s about it. Nothing else. I don't like takin' a bunch of pills, honestly. Makes me feel worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, just Tylenol as needed and a multivitamin. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had allergies. Maria tries to get me to avoid shellfish, says it raises my cholesterol, but I ain’t allergic. Just don’t eat it that often. Otherwise, I can eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to anythin'. Lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good to know. Now, before we do a quick exam, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you traveled anywhere recently, even within the country?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin'. Been stayin' put. Maria and I, we don't really travel much anymore. Too much trouble. Used to go to Puerto Rico every year to see family, but that was years ago. Now, we just stay local. Gardenin', fixin' things around the house, that's about it. Ain't been on a plane in… I dunno, ten years maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent travel. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I'm a chiropractor, like I said. Workin' on backs keeps me busy. Maria and I, we got a little garden. She does most of the work, honestly. I mostly just complain about the weeds. We watch TV in the evenin'. Not much excitement. I don't drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Don't smoke. Pretty boring, really. Just tryin' to take it easy.
DOCTOR: That doesn't sound boring at all, Mr. Brege. It sounds peaceful. Alright, that gives me a good picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Just get it over with, please. I got things to do. The sooner I can leave, the better.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won't take long. If you could just sit up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Here we go… Gettin' old ain't for the faint of heart, Doctor. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Everything sounds clear here. No unusual sounds. Now, I’m going to check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Your temperature is 99.8 Fahrenheit, which is slightly elevated. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 130/80. Both are within a normal range. Now, I’m going to take a look at your throat. Open your mouth and say "Ahhh." Your throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Now, I'll just feel your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes are not swollen. Now, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen. Your abdomen sounds normal. Everything seems okay so far, Mr. Brege. I’d like to order some blood work, just to rule out any underlying infection.
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, great. Just what I needed. Look, Doctor, are you sure this is necessary? I told you, it's just a fever. Comes and goes. It's annoyin', but it ain't killin' me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Brege. You're right, it sounds like it's not significantly impacting your daily life right now. However, a fever that comes and goes for a few weeks can sometimes indicate an underlying issue we want to rule out. The blood work will help us identify if there's any infection or inflammation present. It’s a fairly standard procedure, and it will give us peace of mind. Think of it as just being thorough. It will help us determine the best course of action, and if everything comes back normal, we can simply monitor your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. If you think it's necessary. But please, make it quick. I don't like needles. And tell 'em to be gentle, okay? Maria would have my hide if I showed up with a big bruise. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Brege. I'll make sure they are as gentle as possible. It will be quick and relatively painless. I'll write the order for the blood work now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw the samples. In the meantime, I’d like to recommend you continue to monitor your temperature. If it spikes above 101 Fahrenheit, or if you develop any new symptoms like a cough, shortness of breath, or severe headache, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, monitor the temperature, watch for other stuff. I got it. Just get the nurse in here, please. I'm startin' to feel a little lightheaded just thinkin' about it.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. She'll be in shortly. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Brege. We'll get to the bottom of this. Oh, and just one more thing, while we wait, do you happen to know your height and weight?
PATIENT: Height… I think I’m around five-foot-ten. Maybe five-nine. Lost some height over the years, I reckon. And weight… oh, jeez. I haven’t weighed myself in ages. Probably around… one-fifty, one-sixty? Something like that. I'm a little on the heavy side, I'll admit. Why do you need to know all this anyway?
DOCTOR: Just routine, Mr. Brege. It helps us get a complete picture and calculate things like your BMI. It’s all part of the process. Okay, great. Thank you. The nurse should be in any moment now. Just let her know if you have any concerns or feel uncomfortable at any point. I'll be right outside if you need anything.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with. Hurry up. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: .
