DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber, let's get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. It’s… it’s my water. I have trouble, you see. It doesn’t… come out all the way when I try. Like it’s stuck, almost. It’s been happenin’ for a little while now, maybe a month or so. Not every time, but enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. A month, give or take. It’s not a sharp pain, nothin’ like that. More… a fullness, and then it just… stops. I gotta… strain a bit to get it goin’ sometimes, and even then, it feels like there’s still some left in there. It’s uncomfortable, you understand? Not awful, but bothersome.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said it doesn't happen every time?
PATIENT: No, sir, not every time. Some days it’s fine. I go to the bathroom and it’s normal, like always. Other days… well, like I said. It’s hard to explain. It just feels… weak, like it won’t push it all the way out. It’s more often happenin’ when I’m… busy, maybe? If I don’t have a lot of time, you see. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Busy”?
PATIENT: Well, sir, I work at the shoe factory. Makin’ the shoes, you see. It's a steady job. And sometimes, when I'm rushin' to get things done, I don't take my time. I figure that’s what it is, maybe. I don’t always have a long break to go to the bathroom. I don't want to be late gettin' back to the line. Does that explain what I mean by “busy”? It’s not a fancy life, Doctor. Just workin'.
DOCTOR: Hmm. So, you’re saying a stressful work environment might be contributing to… incomplete emptying?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn't say stressful, exactly. It’s just… fast-paced, you see? Lots to do. And when you gotta go, you gotta go quick. I just thought maybe that was somethin’ to do with it. I don't know what causes it, Doctor. I just know it’s bothersome, and I wanted to ask if it was somethin' serious. I'm a simple man, and I don't want any trouble. It's just… worryin' me a bit.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any blood in your urine, fever, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No, sir, no blood. Not that I’ve seen, anyways. No fever either. I check myself, you know? I always do. And no pain in my back or sides. It's just… the fullness, like I said. And the feelin’ of not gettin’ it all out. That’s all. I haven’t been feelin’ sick, just… uncomfortable. I try to drink plenty of water, too. Old habits, you see. My wife used to always tell me to stay hydrated. It’s been a little over a year since she passed, and I still think of her advice sometimes. But no, no fever, no pain, no blood. Just this trouble with my water.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam. Just need to check a few things. Don’t be alarmed.
PATIENT: Okay, sir. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m not a difficult patient, Doctor. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it. I just want to get this sorted out, if that’s possible. It’s… a little embarrassing, but I’d rather just know what’s goin’ on. So, whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just excuse me for a moment while I prep the room. Change into the gown, and I’ll be right back. I'll need you to lie down on the exam table. And try not to overthink it. It’s just a quick check.
PATIENT: Okay, sir. Thank you. Just a quick check… try not to overthink it… Easy for you to say. But I’ll do it. I always do what I’m told.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber, if you’re ready. Let’s begin. I’m going to palpate your abdomen first. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Take deep breaths. Deep breaths… Hmm. Not much to report here. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I'm ready. Take your time. Deep breaths… Yes, sir. I'm breathin'. It doesn’t hurt… not yet, anyways. Just… a little awkward, you know? I haven't had a doctor poke around in my belly for a long time. But I'm tryin' to stay still. Just tell me if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to perform a digital rectal exam. This will help me assess your prostate and check for any abnormalities. It’s… standard procedure. You may feel some discomfort.
PATIENT: A… a what now? You mean… you're gonna… check me… there? I… I see. Well, if it's standard… if it’s necessary… then I suppose. But… will it hurt much, Doctor? I… I’m not used to this sort of thing. I always tried to avoid this if I could. It’s… a little embarrassing, you know? But… go ahead. If you think it's best. Just… be quick, if you can?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Prostate feels slightly enlarged, but no obvious masses. Not overly concerning at this stage. Alright. That's all. Now, let's get you dressed. I’ll be right back with my thoughts. Don't be alarmed.
PATIENT: Well… that was… somethin’. Alright. Yes, sir. Get dressed. Enlarged, you say? Is that… bad? Enlarged… what does that mean? I hope it’s not too bad. I don’t want any trouble. Just tell me what I need to do. Whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. So, based on the exam, it appears you have Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. It’s a common condition in men your age. Basically, your prostate is enlarged, which can make it difficult to fully empty your bladder. It explains the incomplete emptying you’ve been experiencing. It’s not cancer, not something immediately life-threatening, but it does need to be managed. This sheet explains the condition in more detail. I'm prescribing you Tamsulosin, which will help relax the muscles in your bladder and prostate, making it easier to urinate. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to see how you’re doing. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: BPH… …Bee… Pee… Hach? It’s not… cancer? That’s good. Thank goodness. Relax the muscles… and this… Tamsulosin… will that… help me go to the bathroom easier? And… what if it doesn’t work? Will I need… more poking around? I’m just… a simple man, Doctor. I don't like complicated things. I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely you'll need further poking around. The medication usually does the trick. If it doesn't, we can discuss other options, but let’s not worry about that now. It does have some side effects, dizziness mostly. Take it at night before bed, and if you feel dizzy, just sit down. Follow the instructions carefully. And if you have any serious issues, go to the emergency room. Here’s your prescription. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Dizziness… at night… alright. At night. Serious issues… emergency room… Well… I guess… no. No, I don’t think so. Just… the dizziness, and takin’ it at night… and comin’ back in three months… Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ it to me. I’m still a little worried, but… I guess I’ll try the medicine and see what happens. Thank you again. I’ll be seein’ you in three months. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Goodbye. Next patient!
