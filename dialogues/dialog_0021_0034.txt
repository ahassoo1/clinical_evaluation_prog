DOCTOR: Alright, Emileigh. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's… well, I just moved here, you see? And I need to, like, get set up with a doctor. I have Medicare, and… I think this is a social healthcare visit? My husband helped me make the appointment. I don’t really remember much else, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. A new patient visit, then. And you're on Medicare, good. Social healthcare visit… yes, that’s what this is. It's perfectly alright if you don’t remember the details; we'll get everything sorted. Honestly, people come in all the time not knowing why they’re here. So, leaving the appointment itself aside for a moment, is there anything specifically bothering you right now?
PATIENT: Not really… not that I can think of. I feel okay, I guess. A little tired, maybe? But I always feel a little tired. I do a lot of… stuff with my hands, at work. Mechanical things. It’s hard to explain. I don't hurt anywhere, if that makes sense. Just… worn out sometimes.
DOCTOR: "Stuff with your hands," alright. Mechanical work… that’s… helpful. So, no specific pain, just fatigue. And this has been going on… for how long, would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. A long time. Years, probably? It comes and goes. When I'm busy, it's worse. When things are slow, I feel better. My husband says I push myself too hard. He’s probably right. I just… like fixing things. It makes me feel good. I don't really know when it started, exactly. Sorry. I'm not very good at remembering dates.
DOCTOR: It's alright, dear. Dates aren't crucial. Years of fatigue with fluctuations based on activity level… okay. And does this fatigue interfere with your daily life?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes. Like, I might be too tired to do much after work. Just sit and watch TV. Or go to bed early. My husband does most of the cooking when I'm really tired. He doesn't mind, he's really sweet. It doesn’t stop me from working, though. I still go in every day. I just… take more breaks, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. So, you're able to continue working, but with modifications. Alright. Let's talk about other things, just to get a general picture. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I haven’t really been to the doctor much. Just for check-ups, when I was a kid. And… I had my tonsils out, a long time ago. But nothing else. My husband says I should have been more careful, but I always just… powered through things. I don't really get sick, if that counts for anything. I mean, I get colds sometimes, but everyone gets colds. I don't… I don't really know what you're asking.
DOCTOR: No major medical conditions, tonsillectomy in the past… and generally healthy otherwise. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just… ibuprofen, sometimes. For headaches. But not very often. Like, maybe once a month? When I really push myself too hard at work. And… vitamins. A multivitamin. My husband makes me take it. He says I need it. I don't really pay attention to what's in it, to be honest. It's just… a pill.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen as needed for headaches, multivitamin daily… alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things. And… I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction to anything. My husband always asks, but I always say no. He worries a lot. I guess I'm just… lucky? Or maybe I haven’t found anything I’m allergic to yet. I really don't know. Sorry, I’m not very helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies… Look, it's perfectly alright. We're just gathering information. Now, let's talk about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do you know if anyone in your family has any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… geez. That's a hard one. My family… we don't really talk about that stuff. My mom… she had something, I think. With her heart? But she passed away a long time ago. And my dad… he was always pretty healthy. I think. He worked on boats, so… he was probably strong. I don't really know. We weren't very close. Sorry. I wish I could be more help. It's just… I don’t remember much about them, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mother with a possible heart condition, father generally healthy… That's alright, dear. It's common for people not to have detailed family medical histories. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. I don't like any of that stuff. My husband doesn't either. We both work really hard, and… we just don't have time for that. Or the energy. We like quiet evenings at home, mostly. And… fixing things, of course. Does that make sense? We're pretty boring, really.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. A quiet life is a good life. Now, just one last thing before we do a quick physical exam. Can you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh… um. I'm not very tall. Maybe… five foot? And… I've put on a little weight lately. I think around… eighty-two pounds? I haven’t weighed myself in a while. I think that’s right. My husband says I need to eat more vegetables. He's always telling me things. Does that help? I always feel a little awkward talking about weight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Five feet tall, eighty-two pounds… Thank you. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… tell me if it's going to be uncomfortable? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain everything as I go. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, then listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a quick look at your throat and ears. Nothing too invasive, I promise. If you could just sit up here for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… let me know if anything hurts, okay? I'm not very good with… medical stuff. It makes me a little anxious, honestly.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be very gentle, and I’ll explain everything as I go. It's perfectly normal to feel a little anxious. Alright, this might feel a little tight for a moment. Just try to relax. Blood pressure is… 128 over 76. A little elevated, but nothing to worry about just yet. Pulse is 88, regular rhythm. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Deep breaths are good.
PATIENT: Okay… deep breaths. It feels… weird. Is everything okay? I don’t hear anything wrong, do I? My husband always says my heart is strong, but he's probably just being nice.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds normal so far. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Say “Ahhh” for me. Throat looks a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Ears look clear as well. Alright. Everything looks normal during the exam. No immediate concerns. You are a little underweight, but otherwise, you seem to be in stable condition.
PATIENT: Oh… good. That’s… good. I was worried something was wrong. I always worry. So… what does that mean? What do I need to do? Should I eat more? My husband will be so happy to hear that. He's always telling me to eat more vegetables.
DOCTOR: It means you're generally healthy, but we need to address the weight. It’s good that your husband is encouraging you to eat more. We'll focus on a balanced diet, with plenty of protein and vegetables. Given your fatigue and low weight, I'd like to order some basic blood work to rule out any deficiencies. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… okay. If you think it’s necessary. What will it show? And… where do I go to get it done? I don’t really know how all this works. My husband usually handles all the medical stuff.
DOCTOR: It will show us if you're deficient in any vitamins or minerals, or if there's anything else going on that could be contributing to your fatigue. It's a pretty standard test. Here's a requisition form. You can take this to any lab, but I recommend the one across the street, "County Labs." They're very efficient. The form will tell you if you need to fast beforehand. It’s usually just overnight. It’s a simple procedure. They’ll just draw a little bit of blood. It will take about fifteen minutes. Once the results come back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Overnight… no food? Okay. I can do that, I think. My husband will remind me. He's really good at remembering things like that. So… I just take this to County Labs, and then you’ll call me when the results are in? And then we meet again? Is it going to be expensive? I have Medicare, but… I don't want to cause any problems.
DOCTOR: Exactly. You take this to County Labs, and they’ll send the results directly to me. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment. With Medicare, the lab work should be covered. However, it’s always best to check with your insurance provider to confirm your coverage. They can give you a precise estimate of your out-of-pocket costs, if any. I have a pamphlet here with the Medicare contact information, I'll give that to you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, I'll ask my husband about the Medicare stuff. He's really good with all that. No, I think that's everything. Thank you for… explaining everything. And for not laughing at me when I couldn’t remember things. You were very nice. I appreciate it. I guess I’ll go home now and… eat something. And try not to worry too much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, it's perfectly alright to ask for help. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon. .
