DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It's just… well, I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “Get Well” card, you know? Or something encouraging. My niece, she thinks I’m being silly, but a nice word from a doctor would really show her. It’s for… general encouragement, really. Not that I’m sick sick. Just… low spirits.
DOCTOR: A note for encouragement, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. You know, people listen when a doctor says something. She thinks I worry too much, always have. A little card from you would show her I’m not just… imagining things. It would be very helpful. And it doesn’t have to be long! Just… something professional.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, with all due respect, my time is dedicated to assessing and treating medical conditions. Providing a letter for… emotional reassurance isn’t within the scope of a standard medical visit. While I understand your niece’s concerns, a note from me won’t address the underlying reasons for your low spirits. Perhaps a conversation with a therapist or counselor would be more beneficial?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A therapist? Don't be ridiculous. It’s just a card! It's not like I’m asking for medicine, or anything complicated. Really, Doctor, it seems like a very small thing to ask. And frankly, I don't have low spirits, I just… sometimes feel overlooked. A card would show my niece I deserve to be taken seriously. It’s a matter of respect, not… therapy. Honestly, I find that suggestion rather insulting.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I am attempting to provide you with appropriate medical guidance. Framing a request for emotional validation as a medical need is… unusual. And frankly, it’s a misuse of medical resources. I can document that you expressed feelings of being overlooked, but I will not be writing a “get well” card. Perhaps we should discuss what specifically is causing you to feel this way, and determine if there are any underlying medical issues contributing to your emotional state. Have you been experiencing any changes in sleep, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re trying to diagnose me? Honestly! I just want a card. A simple card. You doctors always want to make everything complicated. Sleep? Fine. Appetite? Normal. Energy? Adequate. I’m perfectly fine, thank you very much. It’s her that’s the problem, not me. She doesn’t appreciate anything. A card would just… prove a point. You’re being deliberately difficult, you know. It wouldn't take you five minutes. And it’s not like I’m asking for a free check-up. I’m a paying customer!
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I understand you are frustrated. However, I am not going to be writing the card. My professional obligation is to provide medical care, and that does not include validating feelings through non-medical documentation. You mentioned being a "paying customer," and while I appreciate your business, that does not entitle you to services outside of the scope of a medical visit. We can either proceed with a legitimate medical assessment to address any potential underlying issues, or you can seek this type of validation elsewhere. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really? You're changing the subject again! This is… this is just unbelievable. I've never met a doctor so determined to be… unhelpful. Fine. No, I don’t have any allergies. But that doesn’t change the fact that you are being completely unreasonable. It’s a card. A tiny piece of paper with a few nice words! I came here for a simple favor, and you’re treating me like I’m asking for surgery! You know, I’m starting to think my niece was right. You doctors are all the same.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, it appears we are at an impasse. I will document your refusal of medical assessment and your request for non-medical documentation. I wish you well. .
