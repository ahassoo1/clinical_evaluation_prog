DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. I'm Dr. Piet. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been feeling quite breathless lately, even when I haven’t been doing much. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It’s been… gradual, I think. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Breathlessness and dry mouth… and you said it's been gradual. Let's try to narrow things down a bit. When you say breathless, can you describe that feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not like I’ve been gasping for air, Doctor, if that makes sense. It’s more… like I don’t have enough air in my lungs, even when I’m just sitting. It feels like I have to work a little harder to take each breath. It's... unsettling. I don’t know if that explains it well enough. It’s just… not easy breathing.
DOCTOR: Okay, “not easy breathing”, that’s helpful. And you mentioned your mouth and eyes are dry. Is that constant dryness, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, I believe. It's not sharp pain or anything, just a persistent… thirst, almost. Especially in my mouth. My eyes feel gritty, like there's something in them, even after I blink. I find myself… frequently trying to moisten them. It's a little uncomfortable, but not terribly so. I don’t… really know if it’s connected to the breathing, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. My life has been… rather quiet lately. I did finalize my divorce a few months ago, I suppose. Other than that… not that I can readily remember. I’ve been focusing on my writing, mostly. I don't believe I've started any new medications or anything of that sort. It’s all a little… hazy, truthfully. Perhaps it’s just stress? Though I don’t feel particularly stressed.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: I… believe I had a bout of bronchitis when I was younger, quite some time ago. And I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing significant, I don’t think. I’ve generally been quite healthy, if that makes sense. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly for many years, truthfully. I don’t… recall any other diagnoses. It’s difficult to remember precisely. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Ms. Kobler. It's common to not remember details from the past. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve never had any surgeries. Not that I can recall, at least. I… truly don’t think so. I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid them, thankfully. I believe my grandmother had her gallbladder removed, but that was many years ago, and it wasn’t me. I wish I could be more precise, but my memory… is not what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she passed away several years ago. I don’t… recall any significant illnesses she had, truly. She was quite healthy for most of her life. My father… he was a fisherman, very strong. He also passed away some time ago. I don’t believe either of them had any breathing problems, or anything similar to what I’m experiencing. They lived in Alaska, mostly. A very different life than mine, now. I… don’t know if that’s helpful information. It’s all a bit distant.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, how about any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think I have any, Doctor. I don’t recall any reactions to anything, truly. I've eaten a variety of foods throughout my life, and I’ve never had any problems. I haven’t taken many medications, thankfully. Perhaps a pain reliever for a headache now and then, but nothing consistent. I don’t recall any skin reactions or anything similar. I apologize if that’s not a very helpful answer.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not taking anything currently. No prescription medications, vitamins, or even over-the-counter remedies. I… prefer to avoid them, if possible. I believe in letting my body heal itself, if that makes sense. I haven’t needed anything for quite some time, thankfully. I apologize for being so… vague. It’s difficult to recall details sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Ms. Kobler, it sounds like you've been generally healthy. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your mouth and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I’m happy to cooperate in any way that I can. I trust your judgment, of course. I’m simply hoping to understand what is causing this discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Okay… and again. Your heart sounds normal. Your lung sounds are… slightly diminished bilaterally, especially in the lower lobes. I'm also hearing some mild… wheezing. Blood pressure is 132 over 88. That’s slightly elevated, but not overly concerning. Now, let's take a look at your mouth and throat. Your mouth is dry, as you mentioned. Your throat appears… mildly inflamed, but no obvious signs of infection. Now, can you say "ah"?
PATIENT: Ah… Is something amiss, Doctor? It feels… a little scratchy in my throat, as I mentioned. Not painful, but… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your uvula is normal. The back of your throat is a little red, as expected. Now, let's check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen saturation is 92%. That’s slightly low, but not critically so. It’s within the acceptable range, but warrants further investigation. I'm going to order some blood work, Ms. Kobler. It will help us rule out any underlying infections or inflammation. Also, I would like you to get a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Blood work and a chest X-ray… Very well, Doctor. Whatever is necessary to understand what is happening. Will the X-ray… be uncomfortable? And will the blood work require a long wait? I… don’t have any pressing engagements, but I prefer to avoid lengthy procedures if possible. I apologize for asking so many questions. I simply wish to be prepared.
DOCTOR: The chest X-ray is very quick and painless, Ms. Kobler. You’ll simply stand or sit in front of the machine for a few seconds. As for the blood work, it usually takes about 15-20 minutes to draw the samples. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have the order sent over electronically. While we're waiting for the results, I'd like you to try to stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water. And if your symptoms worsen—if you experience severe shortness of breath or chest pain—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. We'll discuss the results as soon as they are available. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have covered everything quite thoroughly. Staying hydrated, watching for worsening symptoms… I understand. Thank you for your patience and kindness. I appreciate your attention to detail. I… sometimes feel as though I’m not explaining myself adequately. But I assure you, I am grateful for your help. Perhaps I should simply focus on the hydration and the tests, and leave the diagnosis to you.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining yourself perfectly well, Ms. Kobler. Don’t worry about that at all. It’s my job to put all the pieces together. Focus on staying hydrated, and let me worry about the rest. I’ll have the lab technician come and draw your blood now. I’ll be in my office if you need anything. Please let the front desk know if you have any trouble finding the lab. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you again. I shall inform the front desk and proceed to the lab. I appreciate your reassurance. I shall see you shortly.
