DOCTOR: Hi Margret, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Decosta. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… I am here because… I have been making a whistling sound when I breathe. A wheezing, I think my daughter said. It’s been happening for maybe… a week now?
DOCTOR: Okay, a whistling or wheezing sound when you breathe for about a week. That's good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It happens mostly… when I walk. Or if I try to do things quickly. Not so much when I am sitting, relaxing. And… sometimes it feels tight in my chest when it happens. Not always, but… yes, tight. Is that… normal? I do not know much about these things.
DOCTOR: No, it’s perfectly alright that you don’t know – that’s what I'm here for! Tightness in the chest along with the wheezing is good to know. It definitely warrants a look. So, it sounds like it’s brought on by exertion – walking or activity?
PATIENT: Yes. That is right. When I try to do things. Not when I am just… being. My daughter said it could be my… lungs? She is a nurse, you know. But I wanted to ask a real doctor. I am not so good with remembering what she says sometimes. So many words!
DOCTOR: That's very smart of you to come in and get it checked out, and it’s great your daughter is a nurse! It certainly could be related to your lungs. We'll get a better idea after I listen to them. Before we do that, can you tell me if you've had any cough along with the wheezing?
PATIENT: Hmm… a cough. Not much, no. A little, maybe, first thing in the morning. But nothing… big. Just a small tickle, really. Not like a bad cold cough. Does that make sense? It’s a very dry cough when I have it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A small, dry cough mostly in the mornings. Okay. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. I feel a little… tired, maybe? But I am old, so it is hard to tell what is normal. And… sometimes my ankles are a little swollen at the end of the day. But that happens sometimes, too. Is swelling… important?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and some ankle swelling. Both are good things to mention. The swelling is something we should pay attention to. Let's take a look at your lungs and then I'll check your ankles. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is very good. Checking is good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I am happy to let you check. Just tell me if it will be… uncomfortable? I do not like surprises.
DOCTOR: Not at all uncomfortable, Margret. It’s very simple. I'm just going to listen to your breathing with my stethoscope. It may be a little cool on your skin, that's all. Just breathe normally, in and out, through your mouth. Okay… take a deep breath… and out… good. And again… Alright. I'm hearing some wheezing, as you described, especially on exhale. It sounds a bit more prominent on the right side. I’m also going to check your heart sounds, just to be thorough. Heart sounds are regular. Now, let's take a look at those ankles you mentioned. Can you point to where you’re feeling the swelling?
PATIENT: Right here. Mostly here, on this side. And… sometimes a little bit on this side too, It is not… terrible, but it is noticeable. Especially after I have been walking. It goes down some when I sit and put my feet up. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That's a very helpful description, Margret. And you’re right, it's not terrible – just noticeable, especially after activity. I do feel some swelling, and I’m getting a slight indent when I press – that’s what we call pitting edema. Okay, so putting it all together – wheezing, brought on by activity, a dry cough in the mornings, and ankle swelling – it sounds like we need to consider a few possibilities. The most likely is that this is related to some underlying heart or lung condition. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to check your heart. We'll also do a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any infection. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh dear. X-ray and… a test for my heart? That sounds… serious. Is it something very bad, Doctor? I do not like tests. Are they painful? And what about my kidneys? I did not even know anything was wrong with my kidneys! I just want to be able to walk again without making that whistling sound. Is there anything else we can do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Margret. It is a lot of information, and it's completely normal to feel anxious. Let me reassure you, ordering these tests doesn’t necessarily mean there is something very bad going on. They’re simply tools to help us figure out what’s causing your symptoms, so we can get you feeling better. The chest X-ray is painless – it's just a quick image of your lungs. The EKG is also painless – it measures the electrical activity of your heart through some small stickers we’ll put on your chest. As for the blood test, there will be a small prick on your finger. I want to check your kidneys because heart and lung conditions can sometimes affect kidney function. Again, it's just a precaution to make sure we have a complete picture. We'll take it one step at a time, and I'll explain everything to you every step of the way. Would you like me to go over the tests again in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explaining it again would be very helpful. It is just… so many things. A picture of my lungs… stickers on my chest… a prick on my finger… And what if the picture shows something bad? Will I have to go to the hospital? I do not want to go to the hospital. And… what if my heart is… broken? Oh dear.
DOCTOR: Margret, it's alright to feel overwhelmed. It's perfectly okay to be scared. Let’s break it down. The chest X-ray is like taking a photograph of your lungs. It helps us see if there's any fluid buildup, inflammation, or other issues that could be causing the wheezing. It's quick, non-invasive, and doesn't involve any radiation beyond what you experience in a typical day. The EKG is a simple test to check the rhythm and electrical activity of your heart. It tells us if your heart is beating normally or if there are any irregularities. It's also non-invasive and doesn’t hurt. As for the blood test, it helps us check your kidney function and look for any signs of infection. Now, to answer your question about the hospital, these tests are not an automatic ticket to the hospital. They are simply a way for us to gather more information so we can make an informed decision about the best course of treatment. In most cases, we can manage these conditions right here in the clinic. And finally, about your heart being “broken” – that's a natural fear, but it's unlikely. We're looking for things like irregular rhythms or signs of heart strain, not a literal broken heart. We’ll know more once we have the results of the tests. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that is better. Not as scary when you say it that way. No automatic hospital… good. Stickers and a picture… I can do stickers and a picture. And a little prick. But what if the results are… not good? What kind of treatment would I need then? Will it be expensive? I am on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns about the costs, Margret, and that's a very important question. We absolutely will discuss all treatment options, along with their costs, before proceeding with anything. We also have resources available to help you explore financial assistance options if needed. As for the treatment, it depends on what the tests reveal. If it's related to something like mild asthma, it might involve an inhaler and some lifestyle modifications. If it’s related to a heart condition, it could involve medication to manage your blood pressure or heart rhythm. In some cases, it might require a referral to a cardiologist. We'll discuss all the possibilities in detail, weighing the benefits and risks, and making a decision together that's right for you. First, let’s get these tests done. Then, we’ll sit down and talk through everything. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds like a plan. Tests first, then talk. You are very kind, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so patiently. And… thank you for not laughing at me for being so worried. What do I need to do now? Where do I go for the tests? And… will it take long? I have a bridge club meeting this afternoon, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Margret. There’s absolutely no need to apologize for being worried – it's perfectly natural! And no need to laugh, I assure you! I'm happy to help. Okay, so let me write you some orders for the tests. You’ll need to go to the lab just down the hall - room 102. The receptionist there will have all the information. The chest X-ray will only take a few minutes, and the blood test will be about 10-15 minutes. I would suggest going to the lab as soon as possible. The results should be back by tomorrow afternoon. Once they're available, my nurse, Sarah, will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I don't think it will interfere with your bridge club meeting, but if you feel any worse before then, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here are the orders and the lab slip. Do you have any questions before you head over?
PATIENT: Room 102… and Sarah will call… very good. I think… no, I don’t think I have any more questions right now. Thank you again, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I will go to the lab now. And hopefully, it will not be too bad.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. You take care, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
