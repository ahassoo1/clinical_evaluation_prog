DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um, well… I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come and see what is happening. It’s not a lot of blood, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, coughing up blood is definitely something we need to investigate. That’s good you came in to get it checked out. When did this start, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… a week ago? At first, it was just a tiny bit, and I thought it was maybe from a nosebleed that went down my throat. But then it happened again, and again… and it was definitely coming from my lungs when I cough. It's mostly in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about a week ago, mostly in the mornings. And you're certain it's coming from your lungs and not your nose or throat?
PATIENT: Yes, I am pretty sure. I try to spit it out, and it is… different than nosebleed blood. More… bubbly, maybe? And it smells… a little different. I know that sounds strange to say. I'm sorry. I just want to be clear about what is happening. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not strange at all. It’s good you’re being so detailed. Describing things accurately is very helpful. "Bubbly" and a different smell are important details. Has anything changed recently that might be causing this?
PATIENT: That is kind of you to say. Um… not really. Everything has been pretty normal. I lost my husband last year, so… things are quiet, but I am trying to keep busy. I go for walks every day, and I do some gardening. I haven’t been sick with a cold or anything. I don’t smoke, if that matters. And I haven't traveled anywhere.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Ms. Weichers. That must be incredibly difficult. And no, that's good to know about the smoking and travel. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions – like asthma, COPD, heart problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, but it’s been under control with medicine for many years now. Otherwise, I have always been pretty healthy. I see my regular doctor every year for a checkup, and everything is always good. I have never had any serious illnesses or surgeries. I hope that helps? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all. This is all very helpful information. Controlled high blood pressure is good to know. And it's reassuring to hear you've been generally healthy. Now, are you currently taking any medications, other than the blood pressure medicine?
PATIENT: Just the medicine for my blood pressure. It’s called… amlodipine, I think? A small white pill. I take one every morning. And sometimes, if my arthritis acts up, I will take ibuprofen, but not very often. Mostly just when I have been gardening a lot and my hands hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine daily and ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I have never had a reaction to anything. I eat lots of different foods, and I haven't had any problems. I can wear any kind of jewelry. I'm pretty lucky, I guess! I don't have any pets, though. I used to, but they are gone now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any lung problems like pneumonia, bronchitis, or lung cancer?
PATIENT: Um… my father had pneumonia when he was very old, but he lived a long life. And my grandmother… she had something with her chest, I think. I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago, and my mother never talked about it much. No one else, that I know of, had any problems with their lungs. My family is not very big. Mostly just me and my cousins.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some history of pneumonia and a vague history of something with your grandmother’s chest. Thank you. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take your temperature. It won't take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I am ready when you are. I hope it does not take too long, but I understand you need to do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you. It won’t take long, I promise. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Okay… I’m hearing some mild wheezing in the lower lobes of your lungs, mostly on the right side. Your heart sounds regular, and your blood pressure is 130/80 – well-controlled. Your temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. I also want to check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen saturation is 96%, which is good. Now, could you please cough for me, if you feel comfortable?
PATIENT: Okay. I can cough. Here. Is that enough? It feels a little sore. I haven’t been coughing much, so I guess it’s not a very strong cough.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Yes, that's helpful. I see a small amount of blood-tinged sputum, as you described. It's not a large amount, but it's enough to warrant further investigation. Given your history and the findings on the exam, I want to order a chest x-ray to get a better look at your lungs. I also want to order a sputum culture to check for any infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. An x-ray and a… sputum culture. Okay. Will it take long to get the results? And will I need to come back again? I just want to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. The x-ray results usually come back within a few hours, and the sputum culture takes a few days – typically 3 to 5 business days. We'll call you as soon as we have the results. You will need to come back to discuss them with me, yes. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity until we know more. I'm also going to prescribe you a mild cough suppressant to help manage your cough and a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways. It’s likely the wheezing is contributing to the coughing, and the inhaler may help. Would you like me to write those prescriptions for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. A cough suppressant and the inhaler. Thank you, Doctor. I am a little worried, but I feel better knowing we are doing something. Three to five days… I can wait. Just please let me know as soon as you know anything.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your worry, and we will definitely let you know as soon as we have the results. Okay, here are the prescriptions. The cough suppressant is called dextromethorphan, and you should take it as directed on the label. The inhaler is albuterol, and I'll have the nurse show you how to use it properly before you leave. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You have explained everything very clearly. Albuterol… and dextromethorphan. I will write that down. And I will wait for the nurse to show me how to use the inhaler. Thank you so much, Doctor Lahn. You have been very kind and patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I'm glad I could help. It's my job. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the inhaler technique with you. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
PATIENT: Thank you. You too. .
