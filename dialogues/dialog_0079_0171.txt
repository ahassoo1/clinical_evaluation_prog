DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you are 40 years of age. I see. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Yeah, forty. Something like that. My nails. They just… look funny. Not good funny, you know? They changed. That's why I'm here. I don't really… remember when they started, exactly. Just not how they used to be.
DOCTOR: “Changed,” you say. Can you elaborate on that, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Well, they're… thicker, I think. And kinda… yellow. Not a pretty yellow, like sunshine. A… sickly yellow. And they don't shine anymore. Used to be able to see my reflection, kinda. Now? Not so much. I do a lot of cleaning, maybe that has something to do with it? But I wear gloves! Mostly.
DOCTOR: “Thicker, yellow discoloration, loss of shine.” Gloves, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, gloves. For the dishes, and… stuff. Not always, though. Sometimes it's quicker without. And… I don't know. Maybe the soap is bad? It's got… smells in it. Lots of smells. I don't pick fancy soaps, just the cheap ones. You know, to save money. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, while I appreciate your resourcefulness, frequent exposure to certain cleaning agents – even with gloves – can indeed contribute to nail changes. Now, let's delve a bit deeper. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort in or around your nails?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really… not pain. Maybe a little… sensitive? Like if I bump 'em. It's not a sharp pain, more like… ouch, that wasn't nice. But it doesn't hurt all the time. Just when I… well, when I do things. Is it the gloves? They feel kinda tight, maybe they're cutting off the blood? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Tight gloves could certainly be a factor, Ms. Thut. We need to rule out other possibilities, however. Have you noticed any changes to the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. Skin… it kinda feels dry, I guess. And a little… flaky? Not like big flakes, just… tiny ones. And it itches sometimes. Mostly at night, though. I put lotion on, sometimes. The cheap kind, of course. You know, to save money. Is that a problem? Everything is a problem, it seems.
DOCTOR: “Dry, flaky skin around nails, occasional itching, primarily nocturnal.” Yes, Ms. Thut, we are simply gathering information. Now, do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Uh… not really. I get tired a lot, but everyone gets tired, right? And my back hurts sometimes, but that's just from cleaning. Oh! And I get headaches. But those are just… headaches. I don't go to doctors much. They don't really… do anything, usually. They just ask questions. And then tell you to drink more water. Or take a vitamin. It's a waste of time, honestly. I don't have anything serious. I don't think.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes I take something for my headache, the kind you get at the drugstore. Aspirin, I think. The cheap kind, of course. And sometimes, when my back really hurts, I take one of those… what are they called? Ibuprofen? Something like that. The white pills. And… oh! Sometimes I take a vitamin, a multi-vitamin. But not every day. Only when I remember. Is that bad? I don't really keep track of things, you know? It's all a blur.
DOCTOR: “Occasional aspirin and ibuprofen for headache/back pain, intermittent multivitamin.” Right. Now, Ms. Thut, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination of your hands and nails. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I got things to do, you know? Cleaning doesn't do itself. But… be gentle, okay? My nails are sensitive. And don't take too long. I'm not good at sitting still. It's a waste of time, honestly. But… okay. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let me take a look… There’s a slight thickening to the nails, as you’ve noted. The yellowing is quite pronounced, and I do observe some mild inflammation around the nail folds. The skin is dry and flaky, with some evidence of mild irritation. No obvious signs of infection at this time. It appears we are dealing with onychomycosis—a fungal infection of the nails—likely exacerbated by the frequent exposure to moisture and cleaning agents, and potentially aggravated by the skin irritation.
PATIENT: Onico-what-now? Fungal? Like… dirt? You mean my cleaning is giving me dirt nails? I knew it! I told you it was the soap! All those smells… it's probably full of germs and… and… fungus! See? I knew it. This is why I don't trust doctors. You just make up fancy words and tell me I'm doing something wrong. I gotta go. This is a waste of time. What am I supposed to do? Stop cleaning? That's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Please, Ms. Thut, sit down. "Fungal" doesn't necessarily mean "dirty." It's a common organism that thrives in moist environments. It's not a reflection of your cleanliness. We have treatment options. Topical antifungal medications are often effective, although they require consistent application for several months. In some cases, oral medication may be necessary. I can prescribe a topical cream to start. We will also need to address the skin irritation. I recommend a hypoallergenic, fragrance-free moisturizer and avoiding harsh cleaning agents if possible. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, I am not trying to imply you are doing anything wrong. We are simply identifying the cause of the problem and finding a solution. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I mean, I haven’t had any… bad reactions. I used to get a rash sometimes, when I was little. But that was ages ago. Probably just from the sun. Or… something. I don’t really pay attention to that stuff. But… no, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. This cream… does it smell? I don't like smells. They give me a headache. And how long do I have to put it on? Months? That sounds like a lot. I got things to do. Is it expensive? I'm on a budget, you know? Everything is so expensive these days.
DOCTOR: “No known drug allergies, concern re: medication odor, duration of treatment, and cost.” The cream I'm considering prescribing is fragrance-free, Ms. Thut. I understand your concern regarding the duration of treatment—it is a lengthy process, unfortunately. The typical regimen involves applying the cream twice daily for six to twelve months, depending on the severity of the infection. Fortunately, with your Medicare coverage, the cost should be minimal, likely a small co-pay per tube. I can send the prescription electronically to your preferred pharmacy. We can also discuss strategies to minimize exposure to moisture and irritants, such as wearing cotton gloves under your cleaning gloves and using a mild, pH-balanced soap. Would you like me to write a prescription for the cream?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Cotton gloves? That sounds ridiculous. I'll look like a… a weirdo. But… if it’s cheap, I guess. And if it doesn't smell. Yeah, send the prescription. But don’t bother with the gloves. I don't need any more… stuff. Just the cream. And… make sure they don’t ask me a million questions at the pharmacy. I hate questions. Is that it? Can I go now? I got things to do, you know. Cleaning doesn’t do itself.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Thut. I’ve sent the prescription to your pharmacy. They may ask some routine questions, but I assure you, it should be a straightforward process. Here is the prescription. I also have a printed information sheet on onychomycosis and its treatment. Please review it at your convenience. And if you experience any adverse reactions or have any concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for approximately three months from now to assess your progress. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Three months? Fine. Whatever. But if I'm busy, I'll just cancel. I got things to do, you know. And… I don't want any more lectures about gloves. Is that clear? I got it. Cream. Don't bother me. .
