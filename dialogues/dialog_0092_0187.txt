DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor...Giganti, yes? Look, I don’t have all day. My chest…feels funny. And my heart, it goes bump-bump-bump too fast sometimes. Blood pressure, they said it was high. Just fix it, okay? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand you're feeling a bit rushed, and we'll do our best to be efficient. “Funny” in your chest – can you describe that feeling a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. It’s…tight. Like someone is squeezing. Not pain, exactly. Just…uncomfortable. And it happens when I…walk up hills. Or if I get…excited. My wife says I yell too much when watching the baseball game. She complains. Is that important? Just get to the point, Doctor. What’s wrong with my heart?
DOCTOR: Okay, a tightness in your chest with exertion or excitement…that's helpful. And your wife mentioning you get quite vocal during baseball – that could be related. It sounds like we need to investigate what's causing this. To get a better understanding, let's start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any heart conditions before?
PATIENT: Heart conditions? No! Never. I’m a strong man! Emergency Management Director, you know. I deal with emergencies. I don’t have them. I’ve been…mostly healthy. Little aches and pains, old age, that’s all. Blood pressure is new. Wife made me come. She worries too much. Now, are you going to check my heart or ask questions all day?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. It's good you've been generally healthy. Knowing that you’re an Emergency Management Director is also helpful. We will check your heart, but a few questions first will help me focus the examination and make sure we don't miss anything. Could you tell me if anyone in your family has had problems with their heart – things like heart attacks, high blood pressure, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family? Hmph. My mother…she worried a lot too. She ate too much salt, I think. Father…he worked very hard. Never saw a doctor. Old country ways, you know? No one talked about…feelings. Heart problems? Not that I remember. Lots of hard work, that’s all. Look, are you writing all this down? It’s not getting me any closer to feeling better. Just do something.
DOCTOR: I am making notes, Mr. Sobkowicz, to ensure I have a complete picture of your health. It’s important information. Okay, so no known family history of heart problems. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Doctor, I eat rice. And sometimes kimchi. Wife makes me take a little fish oil, she says it’s good for…something. And a little white pill for the blood pressure, the red one. That’s it. No fancy medicines. I don't like taking pills. Makes me sleepy. Now, can we please get on with it? My schedule is very tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, fish oil and a white pill for blood pressure. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Name? No! I just take it. Little white pill. Small one. Wife fills the thing. She handles all that. I don’t bother with names. It’s…something-pril, maybe? I heard her say that once. I don't know! Does it matter? Just fix my heart. It's getting worse every time I watch the Dodgers lose. Now, are you going to listen to my heart or what?
DOCTOR: Okay, "something-pril" is helpful, we can look that up. It sounds like you're on an ACE inhibitor for your blood pressure. Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure. Then we can discuss some possible causes and next steps. If you could just sit back and relax…
PATIENT: Fine. Hurry up. I have important calls to make. And try not to poke me too much. My wife will be very angry if I come home with bruises.
DOCTOR: Alright, just breathe normally for me, Mr. Sobkowicz. Your heart rate is a little fast, around 90 beats per minute, and I do hear a slight murmur. Your lungs sound clear, but your blood pressure is elevated, 160 over 90. Your pulse is regular, but a bit strong. Now, let's check your reflexes and a quick neurological exam, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Hmph. Murmur? What’s a murmur? Sounds bad. And 160? That’s…high? I knew it. I told my wife I felt funny. This is what happens when you work too hard, always on call. Reflexes…just get it over with. Tap, tap, tap. What are you looking for? I don't have time for all this. This is a waste of my valuable time. And don’t tell me it’s something serious. I have a baseball game to watch.
DOCTOR: A murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes when it’s beating. It doesn’t always mean something is seriously wrong, but it does warrant further investigation. Your reflexes are normal, and your neurological exam is also normal. Given your symptoms – the chest tightness with exertion, the fast heart rate, the murmur, and the elevated blood pressure – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to high blood pressure causing the heart to work harder, or it could be an issue with the valves in your heart. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart size, and some blood work to check your cholesterol and other important markers. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Ugh. Fine. Whatever it takes to get this over with. But I don’t want to spend all day in this place. And I don’t want any needles. My wife will kill me if I get a bruise. Just tell me, Doctor, am I going to die? Is it something serious? Be straight with me. I'm an Emergency Management Director, I can handle the truth. Just don’t waste my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your anxiety, and I appreciate you being direct with me. It’s good you’re able to handle the truth. Based on what we’ve discussed so far, it’s unlikely that you’re in immediate danger, but we need more information to make a definitive diagnosis. The tests I’ve ordered will help us understand what’s going on and determine the best course of treatment. The blood work requires a small needle, unfortunately, but the EKG and chest X-ray are painless. These tests will give us a clearer picture of your heart’s health and allow us to address any potential issues promptly. While we wait for the results, I recommend limiting strenuous activity, such as walking up hills or getting overly excited during baseball games. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the EKG and chest X-ray. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Strenuous activity? Baseball games?! Doctor, that's my life! Look, just get the tests done quickly, okay? And tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle. Very gentle. No other questions. Just hurry. And make sure it doesn't interfere with the game tonight. The Dodgers are playing, you know. This is very important.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’ll make a note about the needle and the importance of not interfering with the Dodgers game. The nurse will be in shortly. Thank you for your patience. We'll get to the bottom of this.
