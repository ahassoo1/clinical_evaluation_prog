DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… good to meet you as well. I’ve been feeling rather… unusually thirsty lately, and hungry, despite eating regularly. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to become a bit bothersome, to be frank. I'd like to get it sorted, if possible, and get on with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds concerning. Increased thirst and hunger, even with regular eating, is definitely worth looking into. A few weeks is a good timeframe to help us figure things out. To start, can you tell me a little more about this thirst?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it's not just a dry mouth, if you understand. I mean, I'm drinking… considerably more water than usual. Several glasses throughout the day, and I still feel parched. It's almost constant. And then I find myself reaching for snacks constantly, even if I've eaten not long before. It's… perplexing. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Christen. Drinking several glasses more than usual, and still feeling thirsty, is a significant symptom. And the constant hunger despite regular meals is also important. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – going to the toilet more often, or perhaps a larger volume each time?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, yes, I suppose I have been visiting the facilities a bit more frequently. I hadn't consciously connected the two, but yes. And, perhaps… a larger volume each time as well. It's not drastic, but noticeable, I'd say. Is that… normal? I apologise if that’s a… crude detail.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologise at all, that’s exactly the kind of detail I need to know. Increased urination, especially with increased volume, along with thirst and hunger… those three together are starting to paint a clearer picture. Let's dig a bit deeper. Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss, despite eating normally, or even increased appetite?
PATIENT: Weight loss… that’s… a difficult one. I haven’t been actively weighing myself, Doctor. My scales are… in storage, if you understand. But my trousers have felt a bit looser lately, now that you bring it to my attention. I hadn't attributed it to anything specific, just thought… well, never mind. So, yes, probably some weight loss, although I couldn’t give you a precise number. Is that a concern? I’m rather busy, you see, and keeping track of such things hasn't been a priority.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s useful information, Christen. Weight loss, even if not precisely measured, alongside the other symptoms… we definitely need to investigate further. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, just to rule things out. Have you noticed any blurred vision, fatigue, or slow-healing sores or cuts?
PATIENT: Blurred vision… no, not particularly. I wear glasses, you see, so it's difficult to say if it’s worse than usual. As for fatigue… well, who doesn’t feel tired these days? I work long hours, and sleep isn’t always… restful. But nothing exceptional. And no, I haven’t noticed any slow-healing cuts or sores. I'm reasonably careful with myself. Is this all taking long, Doctor? I have a delivery to oversee this afternoon.
DOCTOR: No, this isn’t taking too long at all, Christen. I appreciate you being patient with my questions. It's important to get a complete picture. Okay, one last set of questions before we move on to a physical exam. Have you had any recent infections – colds, flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: Recent infections… Hmm. I had a rather nasty cold back in… April, I think. It knocked me off my feet for a few days, but I recovered fully. Nothing else comes to mind. A few sniffles here and there, but nothing major. I'm generally quite robust, if you understand. Can we move on to the exam now, Doctor? I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Let’s move on to a physical exam. If you wouldn’t mind, could you step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Let's get this over with, shall we? I trust this won’t take long.
DOCTOR: Okay, the scale reads 93 kilograms. And your height is recorded as 170 centimeters. That gives you a BMI of 32.1, which places you in the obese category. I understand that BMI isn't a perfect measure, but it's a starting point. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Obese, you say? I'm a… solid build, Doctor. I've always been that way. It's muscle, largely. Though, very well. Do what you need to do. Heart and lungs… proceed. I haven't much time, you understand. I need to oversee a rather important shipment this afternoon. And please be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, if you wouldn't mind, I'll just gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: No tenderness. Just… my stomach. It’s always been that way. Is this necessary, Doctor? I really must insist, I have a great deal on my plate at the moment. And I'm rather particular about people poking around…
DOCTOR: Okay, everything feels relatively normal, although there is a bit of fullness. Given your symptoms – increased thirst, frequent urination, hunger, and potential weight loss, alongside the finding of a BMI of 32.1 – I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out diabetes. It’s the most likely explanation, but we need to confirm with lab results. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Really? Look, Doctor, I'm a busy man. I don't have time for endless tests and procedures. Is this absolutely necessary? I feel perfectly fine, aside from the… minor inconveniences I've described. But… very well. If you insist. Just make it quick, please. And can I have a note for work? I may need to take some time off if this drags on. I have responsibilities, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Christen. And I assure you, I wouldn't order these tests unnecessarily. Ruling out diabetes is important. It's a simple blood draw, and the results should be available within 24-48 hours. I will also provide a note for work explaining you are undergoing some medical investigations. To summarise, I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a fasting glucose test. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I'm aware of. I've always been quite robust, as I mentioned. No allergies to medications or… latex. I’ve had injections before, with no ill effects. Is that all? Can we wrap this up now, Doctor? I really must be going. The shipment won’t oversee itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, that’s good. Alright, I’ll get the lab requisition printed for you. I'll also write a note for your work, explaining you'll need some time off for testing. Once you have the results, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water, but don't overdo it. Here’s the lab requisition and the work note. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… try to be quick with the results, alright? And thank you… I suppose. I have a great deal on my plate, you understand, and this has been… disruptive. Right then. I believe that’s everything. Good day to you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Christen. We'll do our best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. If you experience any worsening symptoms – excessive thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, fatigue – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Have a good day, and I hope everything goes smoothly with your shipment.
