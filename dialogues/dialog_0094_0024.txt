DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s a bit of a strange request, really. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. My insurance, Medicare, needs it for…something about travel restrictions after a loss. It’s been a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand. A fit-to-fly letter, that's perfectly reasonable. Medicare can sometimes have specific requirements. Okay, I see you’re 33 years old. To help me write this letter accurately, could you tell me a little more about why Medicare is requesting it?
PATIENT: Well, my husband… he passed away about six months ago. Unexpectedly. It was…a heart condition. And I’m planning a trip to visit family in Mongolia, it’s been a while. I think Medicare wants to make sure I’m…stable enough for the long flight, you know? It's more of a formality, I hope. I haven't had any issues since…well, you know. Just a bit stressed about the paperwork.
DOCTOR: I see. I'm very sorry for your loss, Ms. Sayar. That must have been incredibly difficult, and planning a trip like this on top of everything is understandably stressful. It's good you're thinking ahead and getting this sorted. To be thorough, and to ensure I can write a comprehensive letter, let’s go through some details. First, have you been seen by any other doctors recently – perhaps since your husband’s passing?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just my regular check-up with my primary care physician, Dr. Lee, back in April. Everything was normal then. He knows my history, of course. I haven’t needed to see anyone else for anything specific. Honestly, I've been trying to avoid doctors if I could, to be frank. It just… brings things back.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s very common to feel that way. Dr. Lee, April check-up, normal findings. That’s helpful. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me about any current symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? And I've been a little… anxious, I suppose. But that’s just the trip, and everything else. Nothing that would stop me from flying, definitely. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness. Just… normal grief, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. “Normal grief” is a very accurate way to put it, and I appreciate you being so open with me. Let’s do a quick review of systems, just to be sure we haven’t missed anything. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: My appetite… it’s been a bit up and down, to be honest. Some days I don’t feel like eating much at all, and other days I’m ravenous. I think I’ve lost a few pounds, but nothing drastic. Maybe five or so? I haven't been weighing myself regularly. I've mostly been preoccupied with arrangements for the trip. It’s hard to keep track, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fluctuation in appetite and a possible five-pound weight loss. We'll note that. And how about your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… that’s been the hardest part. I have trouble falling asleep, and when I do, I wake up a lot during the night. Just… tossing and turning, thinking. I've been managing with chamomile tea and trying to stick to a routine, but it’s not always enough. I wouldn't say it’s debilitating, but it’s definitely not restful.
DOCTOR: Okay, difficulty falling and staying asleep, with some improvement using chamomile tea and routine. Now, thinking about other parts of your body, have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, or any issues with your hearing or balance?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Headaches are rare for me, and my vision and hearing are fine. Balance is good too. I haven’t had any problems with any of that. Honestly, Doctor, I feel physically okay. It’s just the emotional side of things that’s been difficult.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear. It sounds like you’re doing remarkably well, all things considered. Just a couple more quick questions, then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. No allergies to food, medications, or anything like that. I've taken some over-the-counter pain relievers for minor things, like headaches, but nothing serious. I don't have any of those EpiPen-carrying concerns, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every other day. And sometimes I take vitamin D in the winter, but I haven’t been taking it recently, it’s August. That’s it. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. Just trying to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin occasionally, and vitamin D seasonally. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Just a standard check to make sure everything looks and sounds okay. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds fine. I understand. The sooner we get this letter, the better.
DOCTOR: Perfect. I'm going to start by checking your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is within a normal range. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears appear clear. Throat looks clear, no signs of infection. Everything sounds and looks good, Ms. Sayar.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Doctor. Really good. So, what does that mean for the letter? Do you think you can write it now? I just want to get this sorted so I can finally book my trip. I’ve been looking forward to seeing my family for so long.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Everything checked out well. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I don't see any medical reason why you wouldn't be able to fly. I'll write a letter stating that you are cleared for air travel, and that you are in stable medical condition. I will also note that you’ve recently experienced grief and are planning travel to visit family. I’ll include a statement that you’ve been evaluated and are fit for travel, and my contact information should Medicare need to reach me for clarification. Would you like me to print that out for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please! That would be wonderful. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve really put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Here you go. It's two copies, one for your records and one to submit to Medicare. I’ve also included a summary of our visit for your own information. Do you have any questions about the letter or anything else we discussed today?
PATIENT: No, that looks perfect. Everything is exactly as we discussed. Thank you so much, Doctor Gegan. You’ve been incredibly helpful and understanding. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and address my concerns. I think that's everything. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sayar. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns in the future. And I hope you have a wonderful trip and a chance to spend quality time with your family. Take care, and have a safe journey.
